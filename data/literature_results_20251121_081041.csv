Ultra-high resolution (UHR) photon-counting detector CT (PCD-CT) reduces calcium blooming. This study aimed to evaluate the diagnostic performance of UHR CCTA with PCD-CT for detecting coronary stenoses in patients with a high coronary calcium burden compared to invasive coronary angiography (ICA).
In this IRB-approved single-center study, patients with Agatston scores > 600 were included, who underwent ICA and coronary UHR PCD-CT angiography within 2 months. 94% of patients underwent CT prior to transcatheter aortic valve replacement. Coronary arteries were graded for diameter stenosis severity (> 50, > 70%) by two blinded, independent readers. Accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity of CCTA were calculated using ICA as the reference standard. Subgroup analyses were performed across Agatston score groups (600-999, 1000-1999, 2000-2999, and > 3000).
62 patients (mean age, 76 ± 9 years, 16 women) were included. The median Agatston score was 2423 (IQR: 1085-3340). Across all Agatston categories, CCTA demonstrated high diagnostic accuracy and strong agreement with ICA (Cohen's kappa 0.71-1.00). In patients with Agatston scores > 3000 (n = 18), the diagnostic performance of coronary UHR PCD-CT angiography for detecting > 50% (sensitivity 92-100%, specificity 83-100%) and > 70% diameter stenosis (sensitivity 88-100%, specificity 89-100%) remained high for both readers. There was no correlation between the Agatston score and diagnostic error (p > 0.05).
UHR CCTA with PCD-CT provides high diagnostic performance even in patients with extensive coronary calcifications.
Question In patients with severe coronary calcification, conventional coronary CT angiography often suffers from blooming artifacts, reducing accuracy and causing unnecessary invasive procedures. Findings Ultra-high resolution coronary angiography with photon-counting detector CT showed high sensitivity and specificity for detecting stenoses, even at Agatston scores > 3000. Clinical relevance Ultra-high resolution coronary CT angiography enables accurate noninvasive detection of stenoses in heavily calcified vessels, potentially reducing invasive coronary angiography."

By providing high spatial and temporal resolution, overcoming acoustic window limitations, and enabling both multiplanar and three-dimensional reconstructions, CTA allows for a comprehensive morphological and functional assessment. This review summarizes the anatomic foundation and key measurements of the aortic valve, delineates valvular phenotypes-particularly bicuspid morphology-and illustrates the role of CTA in characterizing aortic stenosis, aortic regurgitation, focal lesions, paravalvular complications of infective endocarditis, and aneurysms involving the aortic valve apparatus. By offering detailed anatomical visualization and clinically relevant metrics, CTA supports accurate diagnosis, improves disease classification, and guides personalized surgical or interventional approaches."

This study aimed to compare outcomes of TAVR between patients with MMAVD and those with isolated severe AS. Between January 2019 and June 2024, 848 patients who underwent TAVR at our center were identified for analysis, including 75 with MMAVD and 773 with isolated severe AS. To minimize confounding, 73 MMAVD patients were matched with 264 isolated AS patients using 1:4 propensity score matching for comparative analysis. The primary endpoint was all-cause mortality; secondary endpoints included heart failure rehospitalization, left ventricular (LV) reverse remodeling, and procedural complications. Continuous variables were compared using independent samples t-tests, categorical variables using chi-square or Fisher's exact tests, and survival using Kaplan-Meier curves with log-rank tests. At baseline, MMAVD patients exhibited greater LV dilation (LV end-diastolic diameter [LVEDD]: 56.07±9.04 vs. 50.68±7.70, p<0.001) and hypertrophy (LV mass index [LVMI]: 163.68±50.17 vs. 151.59±44.38, p=0.026). Post-TAVR, MMAVD showed superior reverse remodeling (ΔLVEDD: -7.18±9.75 vs. -2.52±7.64, p<0.001), though LVEF recovery was comparable (ΔLVEF: 5.47±13.98 vs. 6.88±15.20, p=0.52). Survival rates were similar (log-rank p=0.370), but MMAVD had higher 1-year heart failure rehospitalization (5.97% vs. 0.96%, p=0.032). In conclusion, TAVR with self-expandable valves yields comparable survival in MMAVD and isolated AS, with more pronounced reverse remodeling in MMAVD despite advanced baseline disease."

Advances,"Bicuspid aortic valve (BAV) disease is the most common congenital heart defect and is associated with elliptical openings and excess calcification. Limited data are available on long-term efficacy of transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) for BAV patients.
The purpose of this study was to compare simulated mechanical metrics post-TAVR between BAV and trileaflet patients with calcific aortic stenosis.
Pre-TAVR computed tomography scans of trileaflet (n = 22) and BAV (n = 25) were used to segment the aortic valve. Simulated balloon-expandable stent deployment was performed from a previously developed protocol. The bioprosthetic leaflets were then pressurized under a physiological pressure. Stent waist expansion ratio, aspect ratio (AR), leaflet systolic normalized geometric orifice area (GOA), and maximum leaflet diastolic stress were measured.
BAVs had lower waist expansion ratio (87.8% ± 2.6% vs 89.4% ± 1.4%; P < 0.001), lower waist AR (94.6% ± 2.8% vs 98.2% ± 1.0%; P < 0.001), lower normalized GOA (88.9% ± 0.8% vs 89.5% ± 0.7%; P < 0.01), and higher maximum stress (2.81 ± 0.44 vs 2.29 ± 0.25 MPa; P < 0.001) on average compared to trileaflet patients, respectively. Within the BAV group, calcium volume was correlated with waist AR (r = -0.75, P < 0.001), normalized GOA (r = -0.68, P < 0.001), and maximum stress (r = 0.66, P < 0.001).
Balloon-expandable TAVR for BAV has worse simulated mechanical metrics compared to TAVR for trileaflet aortic valve patients and is associated with high calcium volume."

A 74-year-old man with severe symptomatic aortic stenosis and a prior left-subclavian-to-descending aortic bypass presented for TAVR. CT showed a large, calcified annulus (perimeter-derived diameter 27.6 mm; area 573.7 mm²) and a serpiginous, calcified bypass graft. After initial failure to advance the system through the graft, we pre-shaped a Lunderquist wire with an acute bend ~40 cm from the tip to redirect the delivery vector. A 27.5-mm balloon-expandable MyVal was then advanced and deployed uneventfully, with no paravalvular leak.
Intentional pre-shaping of a stiff wire can facilitate TF device traversal across aorto-subclavian bypass grafts with severe tortuosity, enabling safe, precise deployment when TF remains the preferred route."

Limited evidence exists on whether early postprocedural administration of atrioventricular (AV) nodal blocking medications impacts these outcomes.
This study aimed to evaluate the safety of AV nodal blocker use within the first 48 h after TAVR.
A retrospective cohort study was conducted in adults who underwent TAVR from January 1, 2016 to April 2, 2024. The population was divided into two cohorts based on administration of an AV nodal blocker within the first 48 h. The primary endpoint was the rate of second-degree or higher AVB at 30 days.
A total of 756 patients met the study criteria, with 381 (50.4%) receiving an AV nodal blocker within 48 h. The primary outcome occurred in 2.7% of patients who did not receive an AV nodal blocker and 1.6% of those who did (p = 0.297). No significant difference was observed in second-degree or higher AVB at discharge, PPM placement at 30 days, or hospital length of stay. All-cause mortality at 30 days was significantly higher in the AV nodal blocker group (2.4% vs. 0.3%, p = 0.011), but this difference did not remain significant after adjusting for covariates.
AV nodal blocker use within 48 h following TAVR was not associated with an increased rate of second-degree or higher AVB or PPM placement. These findings suggest that AV nodal blockers may be considered in the immediate post-TAVR period based on risk-benefit assessment."

This review examines the structure, pathophysiology, and epidemiology of Lp(a), with a focus on its contribution to ASCVD and related conditions such as aortic valve stenosis and peripheral artery disease. The main research question addresses how Lp(a) influences cardiovascular risk and how emerging therapies may modify this risk.
This review synthesizes published evidence describing the biological characteristics of Lp(a), its mechanistic roles in disease, and its epidemiologic associations with cardiovascular outcomes. It also evaluates current and investigational therapeutic approaches by examining clinical trial data for agents targeting Lp(a).
Lp(a) contributes to residual cardiovascular risk through proatherogenic, proinflammatory, and prothrombotic mechanisms. Current evidence highlights its involvement in ASCVD, aortic valve stenosis, and peripheral artery disease. Clinical studies of antisense oligonucleotides, small interfering RNAs, oral small molecules, and CRISPR-based gene editing, including pelacarsen, olpasiran, zerlasiran, lepodisiran, muvalaplin, and obicetrapib, demonstrate promising efficacy and safety. These agents show potential to significantly reduce Lp(a) levels and influence future cardiovascular prevention strategies.
As novel therapies advance and clinical guidelines evolve, Lp(a) is emerging as a central determinant in personalized cardiovascular care. The increasing emphasis on Lp(a) testing underscores its importance in risk stratification and future therapeutic decisionmaking."

Current tissue-based transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) devices are designed for TAV anatomy and merely approved for BAV, leading to poor annular fit, paravalvular leak, thrombosis, and limited durability-especially problematic for younger BAV patients. This study presents PolyV-B, a first-of-its-kind polymeric TAVR device tailored to BAV anatomy, aimed at improving durability, hemodynamics, and outcomes through advanced computational modeling.
PolyV-B features a sutureless, eccentric valve with asymmetric xSIBS polymeric leaflets and a fatigue-optimized nitinol stent with a centerline groove. The 29-mm device incorporates a rhombic stent profile and large cells to enhance anchoring and coronary access. Developed on the 3DExperience platform, it was virtually deployed in six patient-specific BAV anatomies. Its performance was compared to the Evolut R using finite element modeling and fluid-structure interaction (FSI) simulations.
Simulations demonstrated that PolyV-B offers a 50% strain reduction during crimping, improved annular fit, enhanced sealing, and reduced thrombogenic risk. Flow simulations confirmed superior hemodynamics and a larger orifice area compared to Evolut R.
The PolyV-B TAVR device introduces design innovations that enhance durability, hemodynamics, and usability. Simulations in six patient-specific BAV anatomies demonstrated advantages over the Evolut R device. Optimization enabled efficient feasibility assessment, supporting the development of a tailored, clinically impactful solution for the BAV patient population facing unmet clinical needs."

The aim of this study is to describe long-term outcomes after the ASO in patients with TGA, and to explore anatomical and clinical factors potentially associated with adverse outcomes, comparing simple and complex TGA. Since December 2001 to October 2023, 233 patients underwent arterial switch operation (158 simple TGA and 75 complex TGA). Kaplan-Meier analysis assessed survival and reoperation risk, Chi-square test and T-student test have been performed in order to analyse pre-, intra- and post-operative data among the two groups. In-hospital mortality was 1.7%. Overall survival rates were 97.9%, 96.8% and 96.8% at 5, 10 and 15 years, respectively. Freedom from surgical reoperation at 15 years was 98.3% in simple TGA and 91% in complex TGA at 15 years (p = 0.039). Reinterventions were infrequent and mainly related to pacemaker implantation and right ventricular outflow tract obstruction. Coronary artery stenosis occurred in 5 patients (2.2%). Risk factors analysis suggested that anatomical complexity such as intramural coronary artery (p = 0.003), aortic arch hypoplasia (p = 0.004), aortic arch interruption (p = < 0.001) and coronary reimplantation with button technique (p = 0.018) are predictive factors for mortality. In addition, complex TGA (p = 0.022) and post-operative aortic regurgitation (p < 0.001) are identified as potential predictive factors for reintervention. Arterial switch operation provides excellent long-term survival and low reintervention rates in TGA. These results support tailored long-term surveillance, particularly for patients with complex anatomy or coronary anomalies."

We searched MEDLINE, Embase, and Scopus from January 2021 through September 2025 and included 59 studies. Owing to heterogeneity in study designs, protocols, and endpoints, the findings were synthesized narratively across five domains (coronary, myocardial, structural/valvular, pulmonary-cardiopulmonary function, and aortic/visceral/peripheral arteries). In coronary imaging, a routine-practice cohort (n = 7.833) reported a per-patient specificity of 98% vs. 93%, lower invasive angiography of 9.9% vs. 13.1%, and a higher revascularization yield of 43.4% vs. 35.5% [PCD-CT vs. energy-integrating detector CT (EID-CT); ultra-high-resolution protocols achieved a vessel-level area under the curve (AUC) of up to 0.99.

Virtual non-contrast calcium scoring showed an intraclass correlation coefficient of 0.98 vs. true non-contrast. In myocardial tissue characterization, PCD-CT-derived extracellular volume differed from cardiovascular magnetic resonance by ≤2% in selected cohorts, with a kappa of up to 0.956 for late-enhancement agreement; segment-level inflammation classification reached an AUC of 0.95. For structural/valvular assessment, a comparative cohort reported an effective dose of 8.8 ± 4.5 vs. 15.3 ± 5.8 mSv, with visual image quality scores of 4.8 vs. 3.3, respectively, for PCD-CT vs. EID-CT. Lung-perfusion iodine maps for chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension achieved an accuracy of 0.85-0.88 at approximately one-fifth of the dose of single-photon emission CT.

The global number of transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) procedures is rapidly increasing. Nevertheless, the ischemic cerebrovascular events remain among the most significant complications of this procedure. This study aimed to assess the long-term incidence of neurological events and identify the most powerful predictors of stroke following TAVR in a high-volume cardiovascular care center.
705 patients who underwent TAVR between January 2016 and September 2022, with a median follow-up of 60 months were analyzed. Baseline patient characteristics, procedural data, and long-term neurological outcomes were evaluated.
At five years the cumulative incidence of any neurological events, strokes and disabling strokes reached 28.5%, 20.3% and 13.2%, respectively. Periprocedural strokes occurred in 1.4% of patients. The multivariable analysis performed was aimed at identifying the relationship between a range of clinical and procedural variables and the incidence of stroke within five years following TAVR.
The findings highlight the importance of long-term neurological follow-up after TAVR, as stroke mechanisms evolve over time - from periprocedural embolization to thrombus formation or chronic conditions like frailty and atherosclerosis. Future research should focus on more targeted stroke prevention and long-term management strategies enhancing safety for the TAVR recipient population."

This was a retrospective, single-center cohort study including patients diagnosed with ATTRwt between 2011 and 2024. We calculated the prevalence of each significant valvular heart disease, and Kaplan-Meier survival curves were generated to estimate two-year all-cause mortality, stratified according to the presence or absence of each significant valvular disease. Finally, a multivariable Cox regression was performed to assess their association with survival.
We included 154 patients, with a mean age of 81 (±7) years; 85% (n=131) were male. Significant TR was the most prevalent valvular disease (27%, n=41), followed by significant MR (20%, n=30) and AS (13%, n=20). Patients with significant TR had a higher incidence of all-cause mortality compared to those without significant TR (41% vs. 16%, log-rank test, p=0.0007), whereas no differences were observed between patients with and without significant AS or MR. In multivariable Cox models, significant TR was independently associated with higher mortality, regardless of age, the presence of other valvular diseases, and NT-proBNP levels.
Significant TR was the most prevalent valvular disease in patients with ATTRwt and was associated with lower survival in this population."

Despite its minimally invasive nature, serious complications can occur, particularly in frail, elderly individuals. An 89-year-old, frail woman with severe symptomatic aortic stenosis and multiple comorbidities underwent elective TAVI. The procedure, planned under conscious sedation, was complicated by an anaphylactic reaction to an antibiotic, requiring emergency intubation, vasopressor support, and intensive care admission. TAVI was subsequently completed successfully. Postoperatively, she developed sudden chest and back pain, new-onset atrial fibrillation with hemodynamic instability, and a reduced level of consciousness. Transesophageal echocardiography revealed a thoracic aortic dissection (AD). Given her advanced age, frailty, and poor surgical candidacy, no further intervention was pursued. Despite maximal supportive therapy, she deteriorated and passed away peacefully. This case highlights the challenges of managing frail, elderly patients undergoing TAVI. Although the procedure offers a less invasive alternative to surgery, severe complications such as AD may occur. Individualized risk assessment, multidisciplinary evaluation, and alignment of treatment goals are essential for optimal care."

We evaluated a tripartite low-dose strategy combining high-iodine-concentration contrast media (HCM, 400 mgI/mL), 80-kVp scanning, and deep learning image reconstruction (DLIR) in obese patients (BMI ≥30 kg/m2) to simultaneously reduce radiation and iodine dose while maintaining diagnostic quality. In this prospective, single-center trial, 100 obese patients were randomized to either a low-dose group (80 kVp, HCM at 0.6 mL/kg, DLIR reconstruction; n = 50) or a standard-dose group (120 kVp, 350 mgI/mL contrast at 0.9 mL/kg, adaptive statistical iterative reconstruction [ASiR]-V 50% reconstruction; n = 50). Low-dose scans were also reconstructed with ASiR-V 50% for internal comparison. Objective (noise, signal-to-noise ratio, contrast-to-noise ratio) and subjective (5-point scale by blinded radiologists) image quality, radiation dose, total iodine load, and diagnostic performance (vs invasive coronary angiography in a 20-patient subgroup) for detecting ≥50% stenosis were compared. The low-dose protocol significantly reduced effective radiation dose by 48.6% (1.06 ± 0.26 mSv vs 2.27 ± 0.42 mSv; P <.001) and total iodine load by 23.8% (19.2 ± 2.1 gI vs 25.2 ± 2.4 gI; P <.001) compared to standard protocol. DLIR at 80-kVp significantly reduced image noise (aortic root: 16.5 ± 3.0 HU vs 25.1 ± 4.0 HU for ASiR-V at 80 kVp; P <.001) and improved contrast-to-noise ratio (e.g., proximal left anterior descending: +41.6%, P <.001) and signal-to-noise ratio (e.g., distal right coronary artery: +63.8%, P <.001). Subjective image quality scores were significantly higher for DLIR (mean 4.4 ± 0.5) versus low-dose ASiR-V (3.0 ± 0.7) and standard-dose ASiR-V (4.1 ± 0.7; P <.001), with excellent inter-observer agreement (κ = 0.88). 94% of DLIR datasets received optimal noise scores (≥4/5) versus 0% for low-dose ASiR-V. Against invasive coronary angiography, the low-dose protocol achieved 100% patient-level sensitivity and negative predictive value, with 91.7% vessel-level accuracy. Combining HCM, 80-kVp scanning, and DLIR significantly reduces radiation exposure and iodine load in obese CCTA patients without compromising image quality or diagnostic accuracy compared to standard protocols, offering a safer alternative, particularly for patients with renal impairment."

The extended ALIGN-AR pivotal experience with a prospectively enrolled continued-access cohort and longer follow-up aimed to characterise the safety, valve function, and clinical outcomes of transcatheter aortic valve intervention (TAVI) with a dedicated device in aortic regurgitation.
ALIGN-AR is a prospective, multicentre, single-arm study enrolling patients at high surgical risk to undergo TAVI with a dedicated valve (Trilogy valve) for symptomatic moderate-to-severe or severe aortic regurgitation at 30 centres in the USA. Coprimary endpoints were a safety composite of major adverse events within 30 days post procedure (all-cause death, stroke, life-threatening or major bleeding, acute kidney injury, major vascular complications, need for additional surgical or percutaneous interventions, new pacemaker implantation, and moderate or greater aortic regurgitation), tested for non-inferiority against a margin of 1·35 applied to literature-based incidence of safety endpoint of 30% translating to performance goal of 40·5%, and 1-year all-cause mortality, tested for superiority against a performance goal of 25·0%. Analyses were done in the intention-to-treat population. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT04415047), and is ongoing.
Between June 8, 2018, and July 29, 2025, we screened 1352 patients and enrolled 700 patients (pivotal cohort n=180; continued access cohort n=520). Median age was 79·0 years (IQR 72·0-84·0), 321 (46%) were female, 379 (54%) were male, and 532 (76%) were White, 68 (10%) were Black or African American, and 36 (5%) were Asian. Technical success was achieved in 664 (95%) patients. The median duration of follow-up was 472 days (IQR 352-891). The 30-day primary safety composite endpoint occurred in 168 patients (24·0% [upper 97·5% CI 27·3%]; pnon-inferiority<0·0001), meeting the performance goal. Among components of the composite safety endpoint, death occurred in 11 (1·6%), stroke in 12 (1·7%), new pacemaker implantation in 127 (21·6%) of 589, moderate aortic regurgitation in three (0·5%) of 569 and severe aortic regurgitation in none. All-cause mortality occurred in 38 at 1 year (7·7% [upper 97·5% CI 10·4%]; psuperiority<0·0001), meeting the performance goal, and in 53 (13·3%) at 2 years.
In patients with symptomatic moderate-to-severe or severe aortic regurgitation considered to be of high surgical risk, TAVI with a dedicated platform met prespecified safety and effectiveness performance goals. We observed substantial reductions in aortic regurgitation, favourable valve haemodynamics and myocardial remodelling, with associated improvements in functional status and quality-of-life gains up to 2 years. These data support TAVI with a purpose-built device as a feasible and effective treatment option for selected patients with native aortic regurgitation who are at high risk for death or complications after surgery.

PubMed,aortic stenosis,Transcatheter Aortic Valve Implantation (TAVI) Versus Surgical Valve Replacement on Clinical Outcomes in Patients with Aortic Stenosis.,André Luiz Lisboa Cordeiro; Emmanuel de Souza Gonçalves; Rute Macêdo de Santana; Tayane Siqueira Martins Dos Santos,10.36660/abc.20240295,2025-10,Arquivos brasileiros de cardiologia,"Aortic stenosis (AS) is one of the most prevalent valve lesions, and transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVI) has emerged as an alternative to surgical aortic valve replacement (SAVR). TAVI is a minimally invasive procedure that has proven to be a safer option in several aspects. The objective is to review the impact of TAVI compared to surgical aortic valve replacement on mortality, postoperative complications, hospitalization, and quality of life in patients with AS. A systematic review was conducted using the PICO strategy, with searches in the PubMed, Central, and LILACS databases, employing the following descriptors: aortic stenosis, hospitalization, mortality, clinical trial, transcatheter aortic valve implantation, quality of life, postoperative complications, combined with the Boolean operators ""AND"" and ""OR."" A total of 29 articles were found after reading the titles and abstracts. Of these, nine showed lower mortality in patients undergoing TAVI, while three reported lower mortality in the SAVR group. Eight articles had similar findings regarding complications, with six showing a lower incidence of postoperative complications in TAVI and three in SAVR. Additionally, three articles showed better quality of life in TAVI patients, while one study indicated a shorter hospital stay for TAVI patients. In all studies, the patients analyzed were over 70 years old. TAVI reduced mortality compared to SAVR in patients with AS. Furthermore, TAVI was associated with a reduction in hospital stay and improvement in quality of life. Regarding postoperative complications, the results indicated that TAVI tends to have a lower complication rate, although variations exist between studies."

While certain LMNA gene mutations are known to cause cardiomyopathy and conduction system disease, severe early-onset calcific valvular heart disease is not conventionally considered a typical feature of MADA. This report describes two brothers from a consanguineous Han Chinese family who presented with classical MADA phenotypes alongside severe, early-onset cardiac valvular calcification. Genetic investigation revealed that both affected brothers carried a homozygous missense mutation, c.785A &amp;gt; G (p.Glu262Gly), in the LMNA gene. The elder brother, aged 41, successfully underwent transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) due to severe aortic valve stenosis. This finding represents the first association, to our knowledge, between the homozygous LMNA c.785A &amp;gt; G (p.Glu262Gly) mutation and significant severe early-onset cardiac valvular calcification manifesting as a prominent feature within the MADA phenotype, thus expanding the clinical spectrum associated with MADA and this specific LMNA variant. This case highlights a potentially underrecognized cardiovascular manifestation in MADA patients and underscores the importance of comprehensive cardiac assessment in affected individuals, particularly those from consanguineous families."
OpenAlex,valvular heart disease,Burden of non-rheumatic valvular heart disease globally and in China from 1990 to 2021: a systematic analysis for the global burden of disease study 2021,Wen Chen; Jiyong Wei; Zheng Xiaoyu; Yanni Lan; Baoshi Zheng,10.3389/fcvm.2025.1641448,2025-11-20,Frontiers in Cardiovascular Medicine,"Background Non-rheumatic valvular heart disease (NRVHD), driven by aging populations and epidemiological transitions, has become the dominant form of valvular heart disease globally, yet its burden trends and demographic disparities remain undercharacterized. This study quantifies the global and Chinese burden of NRVHD from 1990 to 2021, analyzing age-sex disparities and temporal trends. Methods Using data from the Global Burden of Disease (GBD) 2021 Study. First, the number of incidence, prevalence, deaths, and disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) cases, along with their corresponding age-standardized rates (ASRs), were reported globally and in China, stratified by different sub-types in 2021. These sub-types included sex and age groups. Second, to explore the temporal trend of the disease burden, data from 1990 to 2021 were analyzed both globally and by sub-types. The estimated annual percentage change (EAPC) value was calculated using a linear regression model. Results In 2021, NRVHD caused 2,206,928 global incidence cases (ASR: 25.0/100,000) and 28.4 million prevalence cases (ASR: 335.3/100,000), with 181,078 deaths (ASR: 2.31/100,000) and 3.24 million DALYs (ASR: 39.7/100,000). China accounted for 292,215 incidence cases (ASR: 12.8/100,000) and 3.28 million prevalence cases (ASR: 156.2/100,000), demonstrating lower deaths cases (ASDR: 0.13 vs. global 2.31/100,000) but accelerated burden growth. From 1990 to 2021, global incidence rose 129%, while China's surged 220%. Age-standardized deaths rate declined globally and in China, contrasting with rising prevalence. Males bore higher burdens globally and in China, with elderly populations disproportionately affected. Conclusion NRVHD burden has escalated globally, characterized by rising morbidity amid declining mortality, a paradox amplified in China. While therapeutic advances and hypertension control contributed to mortality reductions, persistent sex-age disparities and rural-urban inequities demand targeted strategies. China's rapid epidemiological transition underscores the urgency of integrating primary prevention, equitable technology access, and enhanced surveillance to address aging-related valvulopathies."

As the most serious sequel of acute rheumatic fever (ARF) caused by Streptococcus pyogenes, RHD arises from molecular mimicry that drives autoimmune damage of cardiac valves. We systematically reviewed human studies (1977–2025) following PRISMA to clarify systemic immune signatures associated with valvular pathology. Searches of PubMed, LILACS, ScienceDirect, and Web of Science found 29 studies: 22 RHD and 7 ARF. In ARF, elevations in IL-6, IL-8, IL-17F, GM-CSF, TNF-a, and CXCL10 occurred alongside increased activity of CD4+ Th1 and MAIT cells. In RHD, a consistent inflammatory–fibrotic profile emerged with raised IL-17, IFN-γ, TNF-a, TGF-β1, Tenascin-C, and prothymosin alpha (ProTα) in blood and valve tissue. CD4+ and CD8+ T cells were implicated in valve injury; ProTα correlated with cytotoxic activity of circulating CD8+ T cells. Several mediators (IL-6, TNF-a, IL-8, CXCL10, CCL2, CCL19) were identified in RHD studies as being associated with inflammation, cell recruitment, and clinical severity. Systemic dysregulation mirrored local valve inflammation, suggesting circulating molecules may index ongoing cardiac damage. These findings underscore a central role for T cells and pro-inflammatory cytokines in RHD and highlight candidate prognostic markers and therapeutic targets to inform translational studies and trials."

DeSimone; Abhishek Deshmukh,10.1111/jce.70192,2025-11-17,Journal of Cardiovascular Electrophysiology,"ABSTRACT Background Transvenous lead removal (TLR) in patients with a history of mediastinal radiation poses unique challenges due to potential radiation‐induced fibrosis, vascular changes, and anatomical distortion, which may increase procedural complexity and complication risk. However, contemporary data on clinical outcomes in this population remain limited. Methods We analyzed the National Readmissions Database (2016–2021) to identify adults (≥ 18 years) undergoing TLR. Patients were stratified by prior mediastinal radiation. Baseline characteristics were compared using standard statistical tests. Multivariable logistic regression was used to evaluate the association between prior mediastinal radiation and in‐hospital outcomes, 30‐day mortality, and 30‐day readmissions after adjustment for demographics and comorbidities. Results A total of 48,985 patients underwent TLR, of whom 735 (1.5%) had a history of mediastinal radiation. Compared with patients without radiation, those with prior radiation were older (70.1 vs. 66.2 years, p &lt; 0.01), were more frequently females (38.2% vs. 31.6%, p &lt; 0.01), and had higher rates of valvular heart disease, atrial fibrillation, and peripheral vascular disease. Adjusted analyses demonstrated no increased risk of in‐hospital mortality (2.3% vs. 3.4%; adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 0.65, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.41–1.18, p = 0.29) or major complications, including cardiac arrest, pericardial complications, vascular injury, pulmonary complications, or embolic events. Similarly, (3.6% vs. 5.3%; aOR 0.76, 95% CI 0.48–1.43, p = 0.35) and 30‐day all‐cause readmissions (8.7% vs. 9.1%; aOR 0.81, 95% CI 0.64–1.28, p = 0.70) were not significantly different between groups. Subgroup analyses by indication for TLR (infection vs. mechanical complication) revealed no differences in outcomes. Conclusion Despite theoretical concerns, prior mediastinal radiation was not associated with excess procedural risk or worse short‐term outcomes after TLR. These findings may inform procedural planning and risk counseling in clinical practice."

Lung disease often causes increased right ventricular load, leading to RHF. Therefore, it is very important to screen out patients with cor pulmonale who develop RHF from people with underlying lung diseases. In this work, we propose a self-supervised representation learning method to early detecting RHF from patients with cor pulmonale, which uses spirogram time series to predict patients with RHF at an early stage. The proposed model is divided into two stages. The first stage is the self-supervised representation learning-based spirogram embedding (SLSE) network training process, where the encoder of the Variational autoencoder (VAE-encoder) learns a robust low-dimensional representation of the spirogram time series from the data-augmented unlabeled data. Second, this low-dimensional representation is fused with demographic information and fed into a CatBoost classifier for the downstream RHF prediction task. Trained and tested on a carefully selected subset of 26,617 individuals from the UK Biobank, our model achieved an AUROC of 0.7501 in detecting RHF, demonstrating strong population-level distinction ability. We further evaluated the model on high-risk clinical subgroups, achieving AUROC values of 0.8194 on a test set of 74 patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) and 0.8413 on a set of 64 patients with valvular heart disease (VHD). These results highlight the model's potential utility in predicting RHF among clinically elevated-risk populations. In conclusion, this study presents a self-supervised representation learning approach combining spirogram time series and demographic data, demonstrating promising potential for early RHF detection in clinical practice."

Methods and Results Patients in the Swedish Heart Failure (HF) Registry who met the guidelines’ recommendation for CRT between 2014 and 2022 were included. The primary endpoint was the composite of time to first HF hospitalization or cardiovascular (CV) death. Secondary endpoints were its individual components, all-cause death, and total number of HF hospitalizations. Out of 3,530 patients with HFrEF and an indication for CRT, 24.7% received a CRT. A history of or concomitant AF were observed in 51.6% of patients. AF was not associated with the likelihood of receiving a CRT, and the patient characteristics independently associated with CRT were consistent regardless of AF, except for CRT being less likely implanted in patients with valvular disease without AF, and more likely among those with AF and university (vs compulsory) education. Regardless of AF, CRT use was associated with a lower adjusted risk of CV death/first HF hospitalization [hazard ratio (HR): 0.71, 95% Confidence Interval (CI) 0.64-0.79], of its individual components, and of all-cause death (HR: 0.72, 95% CI 0.64-0.81), but not with total number of HF hospitalizations. Conclusions A diagnosis of AF was not associated with the likelihood of receiving CRT in real-world HF care, nor did it affect the association between CRT and lower risk of clinical outcomes."

Caval valve implantation with the TricValve system is one of the transcatheter treatment options proposed for TR symptom reduction. With this prospective registry, we aim to summarize our early experience with TricValve system implantation. Methods: Registry participants, selected out of patients who were referred for TR treatment but who were not eligible for the transcatheter tricuspid edge-to-edge valve repair (T-TEER), were qualified for the caval valve implantation following a HeartTeam discussion. Results: Four patients (four women; median age 71 years; 67.5–77 years) in whom a one-year follow-up was completed were included in the study. The patients were highly symptomatic in the NYHA class III despite intensive diuretic treatment; all of them were considered a high-mortality risk during conventional cardiac surgery. The TricValve system was successfully implanted in all patients. At 6-month follow-up, we observed a reduction in symptoms in three out of four patients. Up to 12 months, only one patient survived, with a reduction in symptoms of NYHA class II; two patients died because of heart failure; one died due to a progression in neoplastic disease. Conclusions: In highly symptomatic TR patients who were not eligible for the T-TEER and who had a prohibitive risk of cardiac surgery, TricValve implantation led to a reduction in symptoms in a 6-month perspective. Long-term survival was limited mainly by heart failure progression and severe concomitant disorders. Further studies are needed to fully elucidate the role of caval valve implantation in the treatment of TR patients."

Its causes can be divided into two large groups: those of genetic origin and those of nongenetic origin, which include infectious, toxic, and autoimmune disease causes, among others. Its natural course varies significantly based on the different etiologies and its diagnosis can influence the disease's management and prognosis. Clinical case: 29-year-old male, with a history of having suffered from Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia at the age of 4 with complete remission of the disease demonstrated at that time by bone marrow aspirate and immunophenotype, having been treated with anthracyclines. On this occasion, he attended due to the presence of sudden onset dyspnea and hemoptysis, for which in the first instance, due to the previously mentioned history, an attempt was made to rule out pulmonary thromboembolism with chest Angio tomography, which was corroborated by said study and demonstrating the presence of two intracavitary thrombi. Therefore, a transthoracic echocardiogram was performed, highlighting severe dilation of the left ventricle. Management for heart failure was adjusted based on structural alteration demonstrated by echocardiography, with favorable clinical evolution. Conclusions: The natural history of dilated cardiomyopathy is not easy to establish due to the wide heterogeneity of its etiology and the different rates of progression depending on it. In some cases, there may be functional recovery after acute myocardial damage, for example, in cardiomyopathy induced by tachycardia or in that induced by cardiotoxic drugs. In other cases, stabilization of the disease and systolic dysfunction and, in others, sudden death may be observed."

Although these findings can significantly support clinical decision-making, the large number of available studies renders an overview of this topic challenging. In this review, we provide a comprehensive overview of the currently identified factors associated with increased mortality after TEER. We also summarize the current evidence on published risk scores that stratify mortality risk after M-TEER and T-TEER.

Valvular lesions, such as aortic stenosis, mitral regurgitation, and aortic regurgitation, impose chronic pressure and volume overload on the myocardium, often leading to structural and functional changes in the heart. Early identification of patients at risk of HF progression is essential to optimize management strategies and improve outcomes. Echocardiography, as a non-invasive and widely available imaging modality, provides detailed assessment of cardiac structure, function, and hemodynamics, making it a crucial tool in the prognostic evaluation of VHD patients."
OpenAlex,valvular heart disease,Characterization of Left Ventricular Hemodynamic Forces in Mitral Regurgitation Using 4-Dimensional-Flow Magnetic Resonance Imaging,Monisha Ghosh Srabanti; Ali Fatehi Hassanabad; Lyes Kadem; Julio Garcia,10.1177/30494826251395620,2025-11-13,Journal of the Heart Valve Society,"Background: Mitral regurgitation (MR) is one of the most common valvular heart diseases. Despite the recognized importance of hemodynamic force (HDF) in cardiology, its exploration in MR has been limited. Therefore, using a retrospective observational study design, we aimed to investigate the potential of noninvasively assessed systolic and diastolic HDF derived from 4-dimensional-flow magnetic resonance imaging (4D-flow MRI) as markers for determining MR. Method: The study cohort included 15 controls (19-61 years) and 26 MR patients (20 with primary and 6 cases with secondary MR, 33-75 years) classified into trivial-to-severe MR through cardiac MRI. The 3 T/4D-flow MRI sequence was used to assess left ventricular (LV) HDF (integral of intraventricular pressure gradients over the LV cavity) in 3 directions (lateral-septal, inferior-anterior, and apical-basal) using “Segment,” v2.2 R6410. Results: A negative coefficient for peak-systolic apical-basal HDF corresponded to decreased ejection fraction (β = −8.1, SE = 3.3, t = −2.5, P = .03), and a positive association was found between LV mass index and peak-systolic apical-basal HDF (β = 25.6, SE = 11.1, t = 2.3, P = .04). Peak-systolic apical-basal and E-wave apical-basal (diastolic HDF at E-wave time point) HDF emerged as significant predictors in detecting severe MR (Estimate = 2.2, P = .007; Estimate = 1.8, P = .015, respectively). The peak-systolic apical-basal HDF was also notably correlated with age in moderate-severe MR ( r = 0.88, P = .022). Conclusion: Mitral regurgitation affects early diastolic filling and peak systolic ejection, indicated by peak-systolic and E-wave HDF in the apical-basal direction, offering insights into dynamic flow patterns and LV remodeling. Hemodynamic force analysis could enhance risk stratification and guide therapeutic decisions, complementing traditional diagnostic methods for improved MR management."

Veeken,"Abstract Objectives Autoantibodies represent a serological hallmark of systemic sclerosis (SSc). Heart involvement in SSc patients includes diastolic dysfunction, conduction block, pericardial effusion, altered left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF), valvular pathology, as well as myocardial inflammation and/or fibrosis. To characterize the role of anti-RNA polymerase III (RNAPIII) antibody positivity in the pathophysiology of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)-related cardiac involvement in SSc patients. Method We retrospectively analyzed four SSc patients with anti-RNAPIII antibodies who developed cardiac complications after COVID-19. This study was approved by the University of Osaka Clinical Research Review Board. Results All patients were female and had been diagnosed within the past 3 years. Case 1 presented with elevated myocardial enzymes and severe cardiac injury requiring mechanical circulatory support. The diagnosis of COVID-19-related fulminant myocarditis was made. The other three patients did not have elevated myocardial enzymes but had elevated brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) or N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) and pericardial effusion or decreased LVEF and respiratory distress, suggesting the appearance of COVID-19-induced cardiac dysfunction. Conclusion Patients with anti-RNAPIII-positive SSc may have an increased risk of developing cardiac complications after COVID-19. The pathogenesis may involve angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2)-mediated mechanisms, which may include reducing ACE2 expression, leading to increased angiotensin II activity and induce cytokine storm. These results underline the importance of understanding the interplay between autoimmune diseases and infections in promoting immune-mediated cardiac injury. Further investigation is needed to characterize the role of anti-RNAPIII antibodies in the pathophysiology of COVID-19-related cardiac involvement."
OpenAlex,valvular heart disease,Temporal Prognostic Factors in Elderly Patients with Acute Heart Failure: A Cohort Study from a Spanish Emergency Department,Itziar Ostolaza Tazón; Héctor Alonso Valle; Pedro Muñoz Cacho,10.20944/preprints202511.0861.v1,2025-11-13,Preprints.org,"Background/Objectives: Acute heart failure (AHF) is a common cause of hospitalization in older adults, associated with high morbidity and mortality. In this population, frailty, comorbidity, and functional variability significantly influence prognosis. This study evaluated short-term (30-day) and long-term (1-year) mortality predictors in elderly patients with AHF treated in the emergency department (HED), considering clinical variables, comorbidities, and precipitating factors (PFs). Materials and Methods: An observational cohort study was conducted based on a secondary analysis of older patients with AHF included in the Epidemiology of Acute Heart Failure in Emergency Departments (EAHFE) registry, treated at Hospital Universitario Marqués de Valdecilla (HUMV) between 2007 and 2022. Clinical, laboratory, and PF-related variables were collected. The primary outcome was all-cause mortality at 30 days and 1 year. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were performed. Results: A total of 548 patients were included (mean age: 80.7 years), of whom 78.6% required hospitalization, mainly in the Internal Medicine department. Mortality was 11.1% at 30 days and 29.9% at 1 year. Age, valvular heart disease, dementia, and elevated creatinine levels were independently associated with higher mortality. Hypoxemia and low-output symptoms were linked to short-term mortality, while NYHA class III and anemia were associated with long-term mortality. Among PFs, acute coronary syndrome (ACS) was related to worse short-term outcomes, whereas rapid atrial fibrillation (AF) was inversely associated with long-term mortality. Conclusions: The prognostic relevance of risk factors differs between short- and long-term outcomes in older patients with AHF. Incorporating clinical characteristics and PFs into risk stratification models may support individualized management and guide follow-up strategies tailored to the geriatric profile. This multidimensional approach is essential to improve clinical decision-making and outcomes in a highly vulnerable population."

Using a prospective multicentre cohort of patients treated for IE, we compared the performance of the 2023 ESC classification to that of 2015 ESC, 2019 European Heart Rhythm Association (EHRA) and 2023 Duke-International Society for Cardiovascular Infectious Diseases (ISCVID) classifications in patients with or without cardiac implantable electronic devices (CIEDs). Methods A total of 1180 patients treated for IE between January 2017 and October 2022 were categorised as having either definite or possible/rejected IE within each classification. The gold standard diagnosis of IE was independently adjudicated by experts as ‘certain’ or not. Definite and ‘certain’ cases of IE were cross-tabulated to calculate sensitivity, specificity and accuracy. Suspicion of lead IE was defined by specific anatomical or metabolic features of cardiac lead infection on imaging; or by pulmonary embolism without valvular vegetation; or by positive culture of a lead extracted during open-heart surgery. Results In the 269 patients with CIEDs, 208 (77.3%) were adjudicated as ‘certain IE’; 2023 Duke-ISCVID and 2023 ESC classifications achieved higher sensitivity (97.1% and 93.8%, respectively) but markedly lower specificity (31.1% and 41.0%, respectively) than 2015 ESC and 2019 EHRA classifications. In the 159 patients with CIEDs and lead IE (78.6% ‘certain IE’), while sensitivity remained high for all classifications, specificity dropped for 2023 Duke-ISCVID and 2023 ESC classifications (11.8% and 32.4%, respectively), but not for 2019 EHRA classification (67.6%). In the 911 patients without CIEDs (81.0% ‘certain IE’), sensitivity was higher than 96% for all classifications and specificity was 55.5%, 52.6% and 48.0% for 2015 ESC, 2023 Duke-ISCVID and 2023 ESC classifications, respectively. Conclusions The 2023 ESC and 2023 Duke-ISCVID classifications had a higher sensitivity but a lower specificity than the 2015 ESC classification in patients with CIEDs, especially among those with lead IE. In patients with CIEDs, the 2019 EHRA classification was the most accurate."
