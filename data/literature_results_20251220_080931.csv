We performed a multi-ancestry genome-wide association meta-analysis of 86,864 AS cases among 2,853,408 individuals, discovering 241 autosomal independent risk loci and 3 X chromosome risk loci. We additionally performed sex-stratified and ancestry-stratified genome-wide association studies (GWASs), identifying an additional 5 sex-specific risk loci, 11 risk loci in European ancestry individuals and 1 risk locus in African ancestry individuals. We also performed a transcriptome-wide association study using expression quantitative trait loci from human aortic valves, discovering 54 new genes for which genetically predicted expression influences the risk of AS. We then generated a new polygenic risk score for AS. Finally, we performed gene silencing experiments targeting biologically relevant genes identified by our GWAS. Silencing of CMKLR1 and LTBP4 in human valvular interstitial cells substantially decreased mineralization, implicating a role for polyunsaturated fatty acids and transforming growth factor β signaling in AS."

We used deep learning to measure peak velocity, mean gradient and aortic valve area from magnetic resonance imaging and conducted genome-wide association studies (GWAS) in 59,571 participants in the UK Biobank. Incorporating the aortic valve measurement GWAS with aortic stenosis GWAS using multitrait analysis of GWAS (MTAG), we identified 166 distinct loci (134 with aortic valve traits, 134 with aortic stenosis and 166 unique loci across all GWAS), including PCSK9 and LDLR. The MTAG aortic stenosis PGS was associated with aortic stenosis in All of Us (hazard ratio (HR) = 3.32 for top 5% versus all others, P = 8.8 × 10-22) and Mass General Brigham Biobank (HR = 2.76, P = 7.8 × 10-15). Using Mendelian randomization, we found evidence supporting a potential causal role for Lp(a) and LDL on aortic valve function. These findings have implications for the early pathogenesis of aortic stenosis and suggest modifiable pathways as targets for preventive therapy."

Atypical forms (such as duplications, vascular rings, or functional obstructions) lie outside standard classifications and they are very uncommon. These variants can confound diagnosis and require adapted strategies.
We retrospectively reviewed 43 EA cases (2018-2021) and identified three with atypical anatomic or functional presentations. Clinical, radiologic, and endoscopic findings were analyzed. Each case demanded a bespoke diagnostic and surgical plan.
Case 1: A neonate with EA/TEF had a long esophageal duplication with an internal septum. The septum was divided and the esophagus anastomosed; although the repair was intact, the infant later died from aspiration pneumonia. Case 2: EA repair was complicated by a right aortic arch (≈6 % of EA/TEF patients). We tunneled the distal esophagus behind the arch for a thoracoscopic anastomosis. A mild stricture was dilated, and the infant tolerated full feeds. Case 3: Initial imaging suggested EA, but endoscopy showed a continuous but narrowed esophagus (likely a motility disorder). Tube feeding led to normalization by 1 month, avoiding surgery. Two infants survived with good feeding outcomes.
These cases (≈7 % of our EA cohort) illustrate that atypical EA variants require individualized management. Detailed imaging and endoscopy were critical to identify unusual anatomy. Tailored thoracoscopic techniques (such as septum resection and retro-arch anastomosis) restored continuity in two infants, while recognizing a motility obstruction in the third obviated surgery. Awareness of atypical anatomy is essential to improve outcomes.

Fractional flow reserve (FFR) may improve the identification of ischaemia-producing lesions compared to angiographic assessment alone, but data in the TAVI population are lacking.
In this multicentric, open-label, randomized, superiority trial with blind adjudication of adverse events, patients with aortic stenosis and intermediate coronary lesions undergoing TAVI were randomized 1:1 to FFR-guided or angiography-guided percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). The trial was registered at ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT03360591). All randomized patients were included in the primary analysis according to the intention-to-treat principle. The primary endpoint was a major adverse cardiac and cerebrovascular event (MACCE) at 12 months of follow-up, defined as a composite of all-cause death, myocardial infarction, ischaemia-driven target vessel revascularization, disabling stroke, or major bleeding.
A total of 320 patients were enrolled across 15 Italian centres. The median age of the patients was 86 years [interquartile range (IQR) 83-90], and the median STS score was 3% (IQR 2-5). The median SYNTAX score was 7 (IQR 5-11). FFR-guided PCI was associated with a significantly lower rate of MACCE at 12 months compared with angiography-guided PCI (8.5% vs 16.0%; hazard ratio .52; 95% confidence interval .27-.99; P = .047). The difference in the primary endpoint was primarily driven by a reduction in all-cause mortality (hazard ratio .31; 95% confidence interval .10-.96). Other components of the composite were numerically lower but not statistically significant.
In patients undergoing TAVI with intermediate coronary lesions, FFR-guided PCI was associated with a reduced risk of MACCE at 12 months. These findings support a physiology-based revascularization strategy in this frail, elderly population."
PubMed,aortic stenosis,Hemodynamic Analysis of Non-uniformly Calcified Aortic Valve Using a Partitioned Fluid-Structure Interaction Framework.,Mishal Raza-Taimuri; Ian Y Chen; Hamid Sadat,10.1007/s13239-025-00811-z,2025-12-19,Cardiovascular engineering and technology,"Calcific Aortic Valve Disease (CAVD) is a common cause for aortic stenosis characterized by the progressive calcification and stiffening of the aortic valve, often leading to significant hemodynamic changes and impaired cardiac function. Several Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulations have been conducted in the literature to provide more detailed analysis of CAVD, but are mainly reliant on uniform calcification. Also, outcomes from current clinical diagnostic techniques do not account for the effect of non-uniform calcification. The purpose of this study is to extend previous CFD simulations to non-uniformly calcified aortic valves and to evaluate the accuracy of clinical diagnostic methods under these conditions.
High-fidelity simulations of non-uniformly calcified aortic valves are performed by coupling fluid and solid solvers using a partitioned fluid-structure interaction (FSI) method for a patient-specific valve model extracted from computed tomography (CT) images. Non-uniform calcification is modelled by varying the elasticity along the leaflet, with several levels of calcification ranging from mild to severe.
Non-uniform calcification alters flow physics, leading in up to 35-50% increase in maximum jet velocity and up to 150-170% rise in TPG compared to the normal valve, significant vortex shedding, extended flow separation regions, and intensified wall shear stress (WSS) fluctuations, especially on the ventricular side of the leaflet. The results indicate that the severity of calcification cannot be accurately predicted by several clinical diagnostic methods, with only effective orifice area (EOA) and maximum opening ratio (MOR) emerging as the reliable predictors.
The progression of non-uniform calcification on the aortic valve leaflets significantly impacts both hemodynamics and leaflet mechanics, with clear alterations in flow patterns and biomechanical responses as calcification severity increases. These findings highlight the need for more accurate diagnostic techniques and may drive the development of improved clinical strategies for the management and treatment of CAVD."

However, comparative data with surgical aortic valve replacement (SAVR) within the Brazilian public health system (SUS) remain limited.
To compare clinical outcomes and perform a cost-analysis of TAVI versus SAVR in SUS patients.
This retrospective, single-center study evaluated clinical outcomes and direct medical costs, using a statistical significance threshold of 5%.
Between 01/2018 and 12/2022, 320 patients (139 TAVI, 181 SAVR) were included. TAVI patients were older (77.9 vs. 64.9 years, p<0.001) and had higher surgical risk (STS 3.62% vs. 1.64%, p<0.001). Mortality (2.9% vs. 5.0%) and stroke rates (1.4% vs. 3.3%) were numerically lower for TAVI, but not statistically significant. In a risk-adjusted composite outcome (death, stroke, re-hospitalization), TAVI showed potential superiority (5.8% vs. 12%, OR 2.68, 95% CI 1.04-7.65, p=0.05), though not statistically significant. TAVI was associated with a shorter hospital stay (2.0 vs. 8.0 days, p<0.001). TAVI's total cost was significantly higher than SAVR's (R$ 55,750.90 [52,345.30; 92,286.80] vs R$ 22,518.10 [19,130.60; 25,875.10, - p<0.001]).
In this study, TAVI displayed similar clinical outcomes compared to SAVR, while being performed on older patients with higher surgical risk. From an economic perspective, costs of TAVI treatment were significantly higher than SAVR, driven mainly by device costs, while in-hospital length of stay was significantly lower. With extended follow-up and reduced procedural costs, TAVI may become a cost-effective option in the SUS."

Although some reports have compared procedural costs, data addressing low-risk populations remain limited. This study aimed to assess in-hospital costs and outcomes of isolated TAVR versus surgical aortic valve replacement (SAVR) in low-risk patients with AS in real-world practice in Japan.
We retrospectively analyzed 128 low-risk (Society of Thoracic Surgeons [STS] score < 4%) patients with AS who underwent isolated TAVR (n = 80) or SAVR (n = 48) between August 2021 and December 2024 at The University of Osaka Hospital.
Both groups achieved excellent outcomes, with no in-hospital or 30-day mortality. Patients who underwent TAVR had shorter intensive care unit (ICU) stays (1 [1-1] vs. 3 [2-4] days) and shorter postoperative stays (7 [5-11] vs. 14 [11-18] days). However, total in-hospital and combined operative plus postoperative costs were significantly higher for TAVR (5.62 vs. 5.11 million Japanese Yen (JPY), p < 0.0001), (5.29 million vs. 4.80 million JPY, p = 0.0002).
In this cohort of low-risk patients with AS in Japan, TAVR was associated with significantly higher in-hospital costs than SAVR, despite shorter postoperative stay."

NT-proBNP is a biomarker of decompensation and independent predictor of poor prognosis: its elevation above 5000 pg/ml is associated with high mortality risk. Balloon valvuloplasty is used as a palliative measure and a bridge to radical treatment in patients with high surgical risk. This procedure allows not only to reduce surgical risk by 30-40% but also to transfer the patient from inoperable category to extremely high-risk group. This article presents comprehensive treatment of a 35-year-old patient with critical aortic stenosis complicated by severe heart failure and multiple organ failure. Due to decompensation of chronic heart failure and signs of liver cytolysis, a staged approach was employed. The first stage involved palliative balloon valvuloplasty that was complicated by cardiac arrest with successful cardiopulmonary resuscitation. Eight days later, radical treatment was performed: ascending aortic and aortic valve replacement, thrombectomy from the left ventricle and DeVega tricuspid valve annuloplasty. The patient was discharged. This strategy demonstrated safety and efficacy in a patient with critical aortic stenosis and multiple organ failure, as well as feasibility of radical surgical treatment in patients with high surgical risk."

Advances,"In aortic stenosis (AS), chronic pressure overload of the left ventricle (LV) may sustain an intrinsic, afterload-dependent adaptive response known as the Anrep effect, characterized by increased myocardial contractility and prolonged systolic duration. Whether this response resolves following transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) remains unknown.
The objective of the study was to determine whether the Anrep is chronically activated in severe AS and acutely reverses after TAVR.
We studied 119 patients with high-gradient AS undergoing TAVR. Pressure-volume (PV) loops were analyzed by echocardiography before and 24-hours after intervention. The ""Anrep triad"", defined as elevated afterload (LV end-systolic pressure, effective arterial elastance), enhanced contractility (end-systolic elastance, end-systolic volume at 150 mm Hg), and prolonged systolic ejection time, was assessed. Stroke work (SW), potential energy, PV area (PVA), and mechanical efficiency (SW/PVA) quantified LV energetics.
TAVR reduced afterload (LV end-systolic pressure: 220 vs 143 mm Hg; effective arterial elastance: 2.8 vs 2.0 mm Hg/mL) and contractility (end-systolic elastance: 4.5 vs 2.6 mm Hg/mL; end-systolic volume at 150 mm Hg: 39 vs 53 mL), while shortening systolic duration (systolic ejection time: 390 vs 321 ms) (all P < 0.0001). LV ejection fraction was unchanged (56% vs 56%, P = 0.44). Mechanical workload decreased (SW: 9,017 vs 6,257 mm Hg mL; PVA: 14,261 vs 10,017 mm Hg mL, P < 0.0001), while efficiency was preserved (64% vs 63%, P = 0.101).
In severe AS, the Anrep effect supports output at high energetic cost. TAVR reverses this state, unloading the heart and reducing mechanical demand without altering ejection fraction. This identifies the Anrep as a clinically relevant load-dependent mechanism in AS and highlights its reversibility post-TAVR."

Although TAK primarily affects young adult females, its occurrence in pediatric patients is uncommon and frequently associated with a more aggressive clinical course. We report a severe neurovascular presentation of TAK in a 16-year-old Mexican female patient who developed sudden-onset right hemiparesis, global aphasia, and multiple syncopal episodes. Marked interlimb blood pressure discrepancies were recorded, with upper limbs showing 63/30 mmHg and 66/35 mmHg compared with 127/47 mmHg and 135/52 mmHg in the lower limbs. Initial computed tomography revealed extensive cerebral ischemia involving the right posterior and left middle cerebral arteries. Diagnostic digital subtraction angiography (DSA) performed via a femoral 7-Fr introducer and JB2/pigtail catheters demonstrated complete occlusion of the supra-aortic trunks with collateral filling from intercostal arteries at T2-T4, consistent with type IIB TAK according to the Numano classification. Intra-arterial pressure measurements confirmed a systolic gradient exceeding 20 mmHg across the aortic arch. The patient required vasopressor support to maintain cerebral perfusion and received corticosteroids, anticoagulation, and neurocritical care. Clinical improvement was achieved with partial recovery of right-sided strength and language function. The absence of renal involvement and the coexistence of hidradenitis suppurativa raise potential questions about overlapping autoimmune mechanisms. This report emphasizes the neuroendovascular diagnostic approach and the importance of early vascular imaging and hemodynamic assessment in pediatric TAK presenting with cerebral ischemia."

While generally safe, the procedure can, in rare instances, lead to severe vascular complications.
A 64-year-old male with a prior history of esophagectomy for cancer presented with dysphagia due to an anastomotic stricture. Shortly after undergoing endoscopic balloon dilation, he developed hoarseness. Computed tomography (CT) identified a penetrating aortic ulcer (PAU) with contained rupture and an associated hematoma compressing the left recurrent laryngeal nerve, consistent with Ortner's syndrome. The patient was successfully managed with emergent thoracic endovascular aortic repair (TEVAR). At the three-month follow-up, the aortic stent remained, and his hoarseness had significantly improved.
This rare case of a PAU and Ortner's syndrome following endoscopic dilation underscores the critical importance of vigilance for life-threatening vascular injuries after seemingly routine procedures. It highlights the necessity of considering such complications in the differential diagnosis of post-procedural symptoms and demonstrates the efficacy of endovascular repair as a definitive treatment option."

The classic description of feline subaortic stenosis reflects the presence of a fibrous ring just underneath the aortic valve. The present case has a unique morphological aspect, analogous with a rare human stenosis. A 15-month-old, ESH female presented with an anamnesis consisting of respiratory distress, apathy, and anorexia. The clinical examination displayed a patient with lethargy and severe dyspnea, whilst lung auscultation identified generalized bilateral pulmonary crackles. A systolic IV/VI parasternal murmur was identified on the left thorax, while the murmur intensity on the right side was III/VI. Electrocardiogram showed a sinus rhythm interrupted by ventricular ectopic beats. Two-dimensional (2D) echocardiography revealed a concentric hypertrophy of the left ventricle, with severe left atrium enlargement and mild pleural and pericardial effusion. A subaortic, hyperechoic structure was seen from the right parasternal five-chamber view, accompanied by post-stenotic aortic dilatation. The aortic peak velocity was 5.2 m/s, a feature that characterizes the severe form of aortic stenosis. The cat died shortly after presentation and necropsy was performed. Subaortic stenosis was confirmed on gross examination. The structure that induced stenosis of the left ventricle outflow tract (LVOT) had the appearance of a rudimental valve with moderator bands attached. Microscopically, it contains fibrous and smooth muscular tissue and cardiac conduction fibers. This type of subaortic stenosis resembles the cushion-like pseudovalve type described only in human cardiology. This is the first case describing clinical signs, ECG, echocardiography, and histopathological findings in a cat with cushion-like pseudovalve subaortic stenosis. Fixed subaortic stenosis is a rare congenital disease in cats, which should be taken into consideration in young cats with dyspnea and left ventricular hypertrophy."

This review aimed to summarize immediate, short-term, and long-term neonatal outcomes following FLP for TTTS. A narrative review of published clinical trials, cohort studies, and meta-analyses was conducted, focusing on survival, neurological, cardiovascular, and renal outcomes in neonates following FLP, including comparisons between selective and Solomon techniques. FLP significantly improves survival rates, with at least one twin surviving in 80-90% of cases. However, prematurity remains frequent, with median delivery at 32-34 weeks. Short-term brain injury occurs in 2-8% of cases, and long-term neurodevelopmental impairment affects 3-14% of survivors. Cardiovascular complications, such as pulmonary stenosis and aortic coarctation, develop at follow-up in 8% of cases, while renal dysfunction, primarily in donors, is reduced after FLP compared with expectant management.
FLP substantially enhances survival in TTTS, but neonatal morbidity remains a subject of concern. Persistent neurological, cardiac, and renal complications warrant multidisciplinary, long-term follow-up to optimize developmental outcomes for survivors.
• Fetoscopic laser photocoagulation improves survival in severe twin-to-twin transfusion syndrome compared with amnioreduction.
• Despite improved survival, long-term neurological, cardiac, and renal morbidities remain significant, emphasizing the need for multidisciplinary, prolonged postnatal follow-up of TTTS survivors."

Metformin, an oral anti-diabetic drug, has been suggested to protect valvular interstitial cells (VICs) from calcification, but its role in preventing organic phosphate-induced degeneration in VICs and aortic valve (AV) leaflets remains unclear. Using an ex vivo three-dimensional tissue model, we induced degeneration with organic phosphate-rich conditions in ovine VICs and AV leaflets. Metformin treatment reduced calcium deposition, as assessed by alizarin red staining (VICs: p < 0.0001; AV leaflets: p < 0.05), and preserved reduced opacity of AV leaflet (p < 0.01). It inhibited early osteogenic differentiation, evidenced by reduced alkaline phosphatase activity (VICs: p < 0.0001; AV leaflets: p < 0.05), and mitigated gene expression of myofibroblastic markers. Furthermore, metformin improved proliferation (VICs: p < 0.0001; AV leaflets: p < 0.05), lowered lactate dehydrogenase levels (VICs: p < 0.01; AV leaflets: p < 0.001), preserved extracellular matrix architecture, and ameliorated extracellular matrix remodeling at gene expression level.

In conclusion, metformin protects against organic phosphate-induced degeneration in both VICs and AV leaflets, highlighting its therapeutic potential in CAVD."

This study explored whether haemodynamic parameters from four-dimensional flow MRI (4D flow MRI) are associated with the potential progression to AVR.
15 patients with moderate AS underwent baseline 4D flow MRI and echocardiography, with repeat echocardiography within 2 years. Patients were categorised into AVR (n=8) or no-AVR (n=7) groups based on whether they underwent AVR during follow-up.
AVR occurred a mean of 396±156 days after baseline. The AVR group had higher follow-up peak velocity (p=0.001), mean pressure gradient (p=0.022) and smaller valve area (p=0.004). Baseline peak vortex volume was greater in the AVR group (p=0.009) and was associated with AVR with an area under the curve of 0.88 (95% CI 0.82 to 1.00). Peak vortex volume moderately correlated with baseline (r=0.69) and follow-up (r=0.63) peak velocity and baseline mean pressure gradient (r=0.59) measured by echocardiography.
Abnormal vortex formation may reflect haemodynamic alterations associated with AS progression and eventual AVR. These exploratory results should be validated in larger cohorts to define the potential role of 4D flow MRI-based vortex assessments in AS evaluation."

Transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) and percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) represent a valid alternative. This study sought to investigate clinical outcomes after TAVR+PCI vs. SAVR+CABG in patients with severe AS and CAD. A systematic review was conducted from inception until December 2024 for randomized controlled and propensity score-matched studies comparing TAVR+PCI and SAVR+CABG for patients with severe AS and CAD. Kaplan-Meier-derived individual patient data was retrieved when available. Primary endpoint was all-cause mortality. The study was registered with PROSPERO (CRD42025642206). Six studies met our inclusion criteria with a total of 1,998 patients: 1,007 in the TAVR+PCI group and 990 in the SAVR+CABG group. The hazard ratio of all-cause mortality varied over time between groups: TAVR+PCI showed a lower incidence of all-cause mortality in the first 19 days, with a reversal at 73 days favoring SAVR+CABG. Patients undergoing TAVR+PCI group experienced lower rates of stroke-free survival (p=0.039), postoperative reintervention (p=0.020), atrial fibrillation (p<0.001), and acute kidney injury (p=0.001) rates, while they were at higher risk of postoperative moderate/severe aortic regurgitation (p<0.001), permanent pacemaker implantation (p=0.005) and major vascular complication (p<0.001). Major bleeding didn't differ (p=0.358). A percutaneous treatment approach offered an early survival benefit over a surgical approach in patients with severe AS and CAD but was associated with worse survival at mid-term follow-up."

Although the disease most commonly affects the respiratory and lymphatic systems, extrapulmonary manifestations involving the brain and heart also occur. Neurosarcoidosis may cause dysfunction of the cranial nerves, meninges, peripheral nerves, or the pituitary system. Cardiac sarcoidosis may lead to arrhythmias, cardiomyopathy, or heart failure. These specific diagnoses can be challenging because they may masquerade as isolated pathologies. In this clinical vignette, we present a rare case of systemic sarcoidosis with concomitant neurological and cardiac involvement. CASE REPORT A woman in her late 50s with a history of bilateral anterior uveitis presented with stroke-like symptoms. Initial workup was negative for stroke, but imaging identified a prevascular mediastinal lymph node and moderate mitral regurgitation. Lumbar puncture results were consistent with neurosarcoidosis, and steroids initiation led to symptom improvement. The patient subsequently exhibited non-sustained ventricular tachycardia, and further investigation revealed findings consistent with cardiac sarcoidosis. An implantable cardioverter-defibrillator was placed. The patient continued steroids and immunosuppressive therapy with favorable results. CONCLUSIONS Diagnosis of systemic sarcoidosis can be difficult because of its variable presentation. This challenge is enhanced when uncommon organs such as the brain and heart are affected. Thorough evaluation is therefore essential when evaluating systemic diseases."

This study evaluated whether the effects of M-TEER on clinical outcomes vary by baseline health status, as measured by the Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire (KCCQ), and assessed the impact of M-TEER on health status post-randomization.
The RESHAPE-HF2 trial included patients with symptomatic HF and moderate-to-severe vSMR (mean effective regurgitant orifice area .25 cm2; 14% >.40 cm2, 23% <.20 cm2). The impact of baseline KCCQ-clinical summary score (CSS) on the effect of M-TEER on clinical outcomes was assessed using Cox proportional hazards models. Changes post-randomization in health status and responder analyses were performed to assess the odds ratio (OR) of improvement and deterioration in KCCQ scores.
Among 505 patients, M-TEER reduced cardiovascular death or HF hospitalization risk [hazard ratio (HR): .71 (.48-1.05), .50 (.29-.85), and .73 (.38-1.41)] across KCCQ-CSS tertiles of <38.9, 38.9-66.1, and >66.1, respectively (P-trend = .53). Similar results were seen for total HF hospitalization (P-trend = .48). M-TEER improved KCCQ-CSS, total symptom score, and overall summary score at 1, 6, 12, and 24 months compared to medical therapy alone (P < .05 at all time points). More patients in the M-TEER arm experienced a ≥5-point [OR 3.38 (2.09-5.45)], ≥10-point [OR 3.12 (1.93-5.02)], and ≥15-point [OR 3.25 (1.94-5.45)] improvement, and less patients had a ≥5-point deterioration [OR .34 (.19-.57)] in KCCQ-CSS at 6 months. Similar results were seen across other KCCQ domains and all time points.
In patients with HF and moderate-to-severe vSMR, M-TEER showed a consistent trend towards a lower risk of HF hospitalization, with or without cardiovascular death, across all KCCQ-CSS tertiles and improved health status over time."

This study evaluated left ventricular (LV) global longitudinal strain (GLS) in pediatric SCD patients, and its relationship with traditional LV function indices, disease complications, hemolysis markers, and diseasemodifying therapy. We retrospectively analyzed 278 echocardiograms from 185 participants (118 SCD patients, mean age 12.2 years; 67 age- and sex-matched controls, mean age 11.8 years) obtained between 2015 and 2023. Among the SCD cohort, 66.1% had the HbSS genotype, 9.3% had HbSβ°-thalassemia, and 17.8% had HbSβ⁺-thalassemia; the majority (83.9%) were on hydroxyurea. Compared to controls, SCD patients had significantly lower, but still normal, GLS (-21.5% vs. -22.3%; p < 0.001), along with significantly larger chamber diameters, elevated mitral valve E velocity, E/A ratio, and tricuspid regurgitation maximal velocity. Prior stroke (β = 0.9) and avascular necrosis (β = 1.51) were independently associated with worse GLS. The different genotypes did not exhibit significant difference in GLS. The strain values did not correlate with hemolysis markers, suggesting that other mechanisms may underlie myocardial impairment. A significant age-related decline in GLS was detected, with an inflection point at approximately 9.9 years. Longitudinal analysis of LV strain in the SCD cohort demonstrated a small decline from -21.6% to -21.2% over a 3.7-year follow-up period. Finally, pediatric SCD patients exhibit significant cardiac remodeling and diastolic dysfunction with preserved, yet lower, LV GLS, underscoring the need for further research in this population."

To investigate characteristics, management and outcomes of patients with native MR referred to HVCs.
Between January 2017 and May 2021, all patients with MR referred to seven French HVCs for medico-surgical evaluation were included. Individual management was left to the local interdisciplinary HVC. Patients eligible to mitral valve (MV) intervention were compared with those deemed ineligible and left on medical therapy. The primary endpoint was 2-year all-cause mortality.
After exclusion for treatment refusal or non-MV surgery, a total of 823 patients were analysed: 662 eligible versus 161 ineligible to MV intervention. Among the 662 eligible patients, 382 (57.7%) underwent transcatheter edge-to-edge repair, 215 (32.5%) MV surgery, 40 (6.0%) transcatheter MV replacement and 25 (3.8%) were either on the waiting list at the end of follow-up (n=12) or had died before intervention (n=13). Ineligible patients had higher surgical risk scores (median EuroSCORE II 4.2% vs. 3.3%; P=0.003; median Society of Thoracic Surgeons mortality risk score 4.3% vs. 3.5%; P=0.023) and more advanced left ventricular (LV) impairment (mean LV ejection fraction 49.7% vs. 56.6%; P<0.001). At 2years, all-cause mortality was significantly higher in ineligible versus eligible patients (36.3% vs. 18.0%; P<0.0001). After multivariable adjustment, HVC-defined eligibility for MV intervention was associated with lower 2-year mortality (hazard ratio: 0.54, 95% confidence interval: 0.35-0.84; P=0.006).
HVC interdisciplinary evaluation of severe native MR results in MV intervention in most cases. Eligibility for MV intervention was associated with lower risk of 2-year mortality."

The vast majority of these patients are turned down for corrective surgery. The combined strategy of transcatheter edge-to-edge repair of mitral valves and percutaneous mechanical circulatory support devices to treat high-risk patients with severe mitral regurgitation and cardiogenic shock has not been evaluated in randomized controlled trials.
In this multicenter registry we aimed to assess the outcomes (all-cause mortality, other important secondary outcomes included freedom from 30-day cardiac death or cardiac readmission, 30-day all-cause mortality, 30-day cardiovascular mortality, and 30-day MACE events) of the combined strategy of Transcatheter Edge-to-Edge Repair of Mitral Valve and Percutaneous Mechanical Circulatory Support Device to Treat High-Risk Patients with Severe Mitral Regurgitation and Cardiogenic Shock.
This multicenter registry retrospectively evaluated all consecutive patients who presented with severe MR, had persistent cardiogenic shock (CS) despite appropriate therapy (including mechanical circulatory support [MCS]), were turned down for surgery due to operative risk from acuity at presentation, and were considered for TEER by a heart team.
Twenty-one consecutive patients with severe acute or acute-on-chronic MR (anatomy suitable for M-TEER) and CS who were undergoing TEER after surgical turndown were included. Mean age was 63 years (SD ± 12.4), 71 % males, mean Society of Thoracic Surgeons Score predicted risk of mortality (STS-PROM) was 20.1 ± 19.2 % (range: 3.1 to 82), 71 % required mechanical ventilation, 52 % had pulmonary edema, 48 % had index acute myocardial infarction (AMI), 19 % required dialysis, 100 % had Impella™ in place. Immediate procedural outcomes included 100 % technical success, MR grade 1.2+ (mild, p < 0.001), and no events for device-device interaction were observed. The primary outcome of in-hospital all-cause mortality was 4.7 % (1 death from multiorgan failure). All-cause mortality at 30 days was 14 %, and three patients died. The procedural success rate was 81 %, with one readmission for DVT that was treated with oral anticoagulation, and none of the patients required mitral valve reintervention at 30-day follow up. Echocardiography at 30 days revealed an MR grade of ≤2+ (mild or moderate) in 94 %, and mean LVEF improved from baseline to 30 days (24.3 ± 11.3 % vs 30.5 ± 14 % respectively) (p = 0.001).
Patients with severe mitral regurgitation and cardiogenic shock, who are at high risk for surgery, were treated with a combined approach of percutaneous mechanical circulatory support and transcatheter edge-to-edge repair of MV. We found this approach safe and it effectively improved mortality and symptoms. Larger studies and clinical trials are required to evaluate the effectiveness of this combined approach prospectively."

A computerized tomography scan found severe LA dilation up to 17.8 cm. The patient underwent mitral valve replacement, tricuspid valve repair, and LA reduction. MR is known to result in LA dilation due to increased LA volume and pressure. While large LA sizes have been reported, they are often related to congenital conditions and rarely grow to the size identified in this case. AF and LA dilation both predict adverse outcomes, increasing the risk of thrombus formation in such a large chamber."

The authors aimed to compare MAC severity assessment by 3D-TEE vs CT and evaluate their associations with hemodynamic parameters indicative of mitral valve disease.
We analyzed patients with MAC enrolled in the MITRAL (Mitral Implantation of TRAnscathether vaLves) II trial (NCT04408430) across 13 centers undergoing transcatheter mitral valve replacement screening. Core laboratories assessed MAC severity using 3D-TEE and CT. Correlation and agreement were assessed via Spearman and intraclass correlation coefficients. Hemodynamic parameters of mitral stenosis (MS) and regurgitation were obtained from two-dimensional transthoracic echocardiography (2D-TTE) and 3D-TEE. Linear regression evaluated associations with MAC scores.
The analysis included 164 patients (75% females, mean age 75.5 ± 9.1 years). The mean MAC scores were 8.0 ± 0.44 by CT and 8.2 ± 0.45 by 3D-TEE. A modest positive correlation (Spearman correlation coefficient = 0.34; P < 0.001) was observed between 3D-TEE and CT scores, with better agreement in severe MAC. Each unit increase in the 3D-TEE MAC score was associated with a 0.15 cm2 decrease in 3D-TEE mitral valve area, a 0.05 cm2 decrease in 2D-TTE mitral valve area, and an increase in mean diastolic pressure gradient (1 mm Hg by 3D-TEE; 0.96 mm Hg by 2D-TTE). 3D-TEE MAC scores showed no significant correlation with regurgitation parameters. CT-MAC scores showed weak, nonsignificant correlations with both MS and mitral regurgitation.
3D-TEE provides complementary and functionally relevant MAC assessment, correlating with MS severity. It may serve as a useful adjunct to CT in transcatheter mitral valve replacement evaluation, especially when contrast imaging is limited."

However, there is a paucity of data regarding device-associated valvular complications. We sought to pool existing data to understand its incidence, management, and outcomes.
An electronic search was conducted in October 2024 to identify studies reporting microaxial device-associated valvular complications that did not resolve with device explantation. A total of 26 case reports and case series, representing 27 patients, were included. Patient-level data were extracted for analysis.
The median age was 50 years [IQR 34-65], and 78% (21/27) were male. The indications for microaxial support were cardiogenic shock (85.2%, 23/27), coronary bypass grafting (7.4%, 2/27), and high-risk percutaneous coronary intervention (7.4%, 2/27). The most commonly used devices were the Impella 5.0 (41%, 11/27) and Impella CP (22%, 6/27). Aortic regurgitation (AR) developed in 67% of patients (18/27). Mitral regurgitation (MR) developed in 33% (9/27) of patients, all of which were severe. The median duration of microaxial support was 10 [3-15] days. Overall, 74% (20/27) of patients underwent surgical management, 11% (3/27) underwent transcatheter treatment, and 15% (4/27) were managed nonoperatively. In-hospital/30-day mortality was 11% (3/27), including two deaths among patients with MR (22%) and one in a patient with AR (5.6%) with a pre-existing bioprosthetic aortic valve (p = 0.19). When considering the patients with only native valves and excluding the bioprosthetic aortic valve, mortality was significantly higher among MR patients compared to those with AR (MR: 22%; AR: 0%, p = 0.04). At a median follow-up of 183 [30-365] days, overall survival was 89% (24/27).
AR was more common than MR; however, all MR cases were severe. MR may be associated with worse outcomes. Surgical management appears to be the most frequently employed strategy for valvular injury."

FMR patients with postprocedural acute kidney injury (AKI), defined as an increase in serum creatinine levels ≥0.3 mg/dL within 48 h or ≥1.5 times baseline within 7 days post procedure, showed significantly increased mortality after indirect annuloplasty (Log Rank test P Value: 0.002). Carillon device implantation resulted in FMR reduction and improved NYHA classification at 3- and 12-months follow-up regardless of CKD.
CKD in patients undergoing indirect mitral annuloplasty seems to be a negative predictor of outcome in FMR patients. However, Carillon device implantation improved NYHA and FMR classification regardless of renal function."

The combination of annular dilatation and abnormal annular motion increases mechanical stress on the mitral leaflets, triggering the degenerative process.
This review summarizes the major pathophysiologic, diagnostic and therapeutic measures for the treatment of patients with MAD and an indication for mitral surgery.
The diagnosis is primarily based on non-invasive imaging techniques. Echocardiography is the first choice due to its ability to assess real-time mitral valve function. Cardiac Computed tomography and Magnetic Resonance Imaging provide more comprehensive information on the extend of MAD and the presence of calcifications. Indications for surgical mitral valve treatment are based on current recommendations. In cases with MAD and moderate mitral regurgitation, early intervention may be advocated in the presence of arrhythmogenic MVP. Long-term outcomes after treatment are assessed through multimodal imaging and electrocardiogram monitoring. A ring annuloplasty is an important cornerstone of treatment. Stabilization of the mitral annulus abolishes functional prolapse and increases the antiarrhythmic effect of mitral surgery. However, postoperative arrhythmic burden may persist in some cases, requiring continuous monitoring and sometimes an additional device therapy.

In 32 (51.6%) patients with residual PH after TEER, adverse clinical events were observed more frequently compared with those without residual PH. Multivariate analysis confirmed residual PH as an independent predictor of all-cause death or hospitalization for heart failure.
In patients with secondary MR, residual PH after TEER is an independent predictor of adverse clinical outcomes."

Current American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association guidelines include class I recommendations for intervention for severe primary MR at the onset of symptoms, significant left ventricular (LV) enlargement (end-systolic dimension ≥40 mm), or dysfunction (ejection fraction ≤60%), with a class IIA recommendation for mitral valve repair when performed at an experienced surgical center. Recent data suggest a survival penalty when waiting for class I surgical guideline indications, and novel markers of decompensation are under investigation.
Comprehensive assessment of MR severity using echocardiography is critical, and when warranted, cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) is complementary. Assessment of LV size and function, as well as serial changes in both, is crucial for determining timing of surgery. New-onset atrial fibrillation, left atrial enlargement, pulmonary hypertension, and exercise-induced changes in LV function should also be considered in borderline scenarios. The roles of LV volumes, global longitudinal strain, CMR-derived measures of myocardial dysfunction, and cardiac biomarkers are worthy of further investigation regarding consideration for early surgical intervention.
A more refined approach incorporating assessment of extravalvular cardiac injury, novel imaging markers, and biomarkers is needed to optimize surgical timing in primary MR. Further research is warranted to validate these emerging parameters and refine guidelines to improve patient outcomes."

However, some patients with severe aortic stenosis exhibit eccentric remodeling with enlarged left ventricular cavities, enabling a normal flow, low ejection fraction (NF-LEF) phenotype. We assessed the prevalence, hemodynamic characteristics, and post-transcatheter aortic valve implantation outcomes of NF-LEF.
In this substudy of the COMPARE-TAVI 1 trial, 979 patients undergoing transfemoral transcatheter aortic valve implantation were stratified by left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) (< or ≥50%) and stroke volume index (< or ≥35 mL/m2) into 4 groups: normal flow, normal LVEF, NF-LEF, low flow, normal ejection fraction, and low flow, low ejection fraction.
NF-LEF was observed in 10.7% of patients. Reduced LVEF was associated with previous myocardial infarction, pacemakers, New York Heart Association class >2, atrial fibrillation, moderate or worse mitral regurgitation, and larger left ventricular cavities (P<0.001) with eccentric hypertrophy (P=0.004). Compared with low-flow, low-ejection fraction, patients with NF-LEF more frequently had moderate or worse aortic regurgitation (P=0.007), whereas low flow, low ejection fraction showed poorer diastolic indices, suggesting diastolic dysfunction with high left ventricular filling pressures. Patients with low flow, normal ejection fraction were the most symptomatic and showed less improvement in 6-minute walk distance at 1 year compared with normal flow, normal ejection fraction. During follow-up, both low-flow groups demonstrated significant increases in stroke volume index (P<0.001), whereas LVEF also improved among patients with reduced LVEF (P<0.001).
NF-LEF is a prevalent aortic stenosis phenotype characterized by preserved flow despite reduced LVEF, likely driven by eccentric remodeling with moderate or worse aortic regurgitation and more favorable diastolic properties, with similar survival and time-to-event outcomes across phenotypes after transcatheter aortic valve implantation at long-term follow-up. Despite higher comorbidity burdens, patients with NF-LEF showed functional and clinical improvements comparable with normal flow, normal ejection fraction, indicating a severe aortic stenosis phenotype."

However, whether the morphology of the residual MR (rMR) jet affects long-term clinical outcomes has not been reported. The purpose of the study was to assess the impact of eccentric rMR (erMR) at discharge on long-term mortality and heart failure hospitalizations after M-TEER.
We analyzed preprocedural, intraprocedural, and early postprocedural echocardiographic data (1-2 days post-TEER) in patients treated by M-TEER at our institution between 2012 and 2022. Eccentric rMR was defined as a nonsymmetric, wall-hugging MR jet.
Among 125 patients with early residual jets, erMR was present in 30% and more commonly in those with medially placed devices and in severe rMR (p < 0.05). Eccentric jets were equally frequent in patients with originally functional or degenerative MR. During 49 (26-79) months follow-up, the median survival was 29 months in patients with erMR vs. 65 months in patients without erMR (p < 0.001). In Cox regression analysis, erMR predicted a 2.2-fold higher risk of death (95% CI 1.3-3.7, p < 0.05) after adjustment for MR severity, age, mean blood pressure, atrial fibrillation, left ventricular and left atrial size, and device position. Eccentric rMR also predicted a 1.8-fold (95% CI 1.1-3.1, p = 0.02) higher adjusted risk of heart failure hospitalization post-M-TEER.
Presence of erMR at discharge is associated with reduced long-term survival after M-TEER independent of the severity of rMR. Our findings shed light on the importance of preprocedural and intraprocedural planning to avoid eccentric jets and mitigate unfavorable long-term outcomes after M-TEER."

We aimed to examine outcomes stratified by CIED removal status in patients with IE.
Using Danish nationwide registries (2010-2021), we identified patients aged ≥18 years with first-time IE, who were alive at discharge, managed without valve surgery and had a CIED. Patients who underwent CIED removal during IE admission were compared with those without removal. The study outcomes were IE readmission, recurrent bacteraemia (including IE with the same microbial aetiology) and all-cause mortality within 6 months after discharge.
The study population comprised 1040 patients with non-surgically managed IE and a CIED, and among these, 596 (57.3%) underwent CIED removal during admission. Patients who underwent removal were younger and less frail than those without removal. In the removal versus non-removal group, the 6-month cumulative incidences were 2.5% (95% CI 1.4% to 4.1%) vs 7.1% (95% CI 4.9% to 9.9%) for IE readmission (p value <0.001), 2.1% (95% CI 1.1% to 3.5%) vs 5.2% (95% CI 3.4% to 7.6%) for recurrent bacteraemia (p value=0.005) and 11.5% (95% CI 9.1% to 14.3%) vs 20.0% (95% CI 16.4% to 23.9%) for all-cause mortality (p value <0.001). In multivariable Cox regression models, CIED removal was associated with lower 6-month rates of IE readmission (HR 0.39 (95% CI 0.19 to 0.79)) and all-cause mortality (HR 0.70 (95% CI 0.49 to 0.996)), compared with no removal.
In this nationwide study of patients with non-surgically managed IE and a CIED, CIED removal was associated with significantly lower 6-month rates of IE readmission, recurrent bacteraemia and mortality compared with no removal, supporting current guideline recommendations. However, randomised clinical trials are warranted to determine the most effective treatment strategy."

Traditional diagnostic methods require hospital visits and professional medical personnel, but the timely detection of cardiac conditions can significantly improve survival rates. Therefore, wearable devices with edge-computing capabilities for real-time cardiovascular diagnosis are highly important. Heart sounds provide valuable information on valve closure; however, variations in heart rhythm or heart valve diseases (HVDs) can complicate the identification of affected valves and the interpretation of heart sound origins. Additionally, different disease classifications require distinct model architectures, posing significant challenges for implementation on wearable devices. This study addresses these challenges through three key contributions: an ECG-gating PCG algorithm, improved classification algorithms for arrhythmia and valvular heart disease, and a systolic array-based accelerator with an application-specific instruction-set processor (ASIP) capable of performing inference on multiple models. The algorithms achieve 97.8% and 99.3% accuracy on the MIT-BIH and heart murmur databases, respectively, with hardware quantization errors below 0.5%. The accelerator is fabricated in TSMC 180 nm CMOS technology, achieving an operating power of 414 $μ$W at 1 MHz. The execution times for arrhythmia and valvular heart disease classification are 7.2 ms and 21 ms, respectively, and the energy efficiency normalized to 40 nm is 395.3 GOPS/W. These show that this system can effectively solve the classification of arrhythmia and heart valve diseases."

This study aimed to assess the predictive value of the age-creatinine-ejection fraction (ACEF) score for NOAF in STEMI patients.
We retrospectively analyzed 951 STEMI patients who underwent primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) at out tertiary center between 2020 and 2023. Patients with prior atrial fibrillation (AF), AF on admission, cardiogenic shock, heart failure, significant valvular disease, or failed PCI were excluded. Clinical, laboratory, and echocardiographic data were collected, and ACEF scores were calculated. NOAF was defined as any AF episode during hospitalization in patients without prior AF. The optimal ACEF cutoff was determined using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis (Youden's index), and multivariate logistic regression identified independent predictors of NOAF.
NOAF occurred in 63 patients (6.6%). These patients were older, more often female, and had lower systolic blood pressure, lower left ventricular ejection fraction, and higher C-reactive protein and creatinine levels (all p < 0.05). In-hospital major adverse cardiac events (MACE) and mortality were significantly higher in the NOAF group than patients in without NOAF group (22.2% vs. 6.2%, and 15.9% vs. 4.3%, respectively; p < 0.001). The ACEF score was significantly higher in patients with NOAF (1.73 ± 0.74 vs. 1.42 ± 0.64, p < 0.001). ROC analysis showed an area under curve (AUC) of 0.643 (95% CI: 0.571-0.715; p < 0.001). An ACEF score ≥1.32 predicted NOAF with 73% sensitivity and 55.6% specificity. In multivariate analysis, ACEF remained an independent predictor of NOAF (OR ~1.5, p = 0.02), but among its components, only age was independently associated with NOAF (OR ~1.03 per year, p = 0.01).
The ACEF score modestly predicts NOAF in STEMI patients, but its predictive power only incremental to age alone. Further studies are warranted for this field."

However, prior research has not explored the correlation between SHR and the prognosis of patients with mitral valve disease (MVD). This study evaluates the relationship between SHR and 28-day all-cause mortality in critically ill MVD patients admitted to the intensive care unit. Patient data were extracted from the MIMIC-IV (medical information mart for intensive care IV) database. Participants were categorized into four groups based on SHR quartiles. The primary outcome was 28-day all-cause mortality, and Kaplan-Meier curves were used to compare outcomes across different glucose metabolism states. Cox proportional hazards regression and restricted cubic splines (RCS) were employed to assess the relationship between the SHR index and the outcomes. Five machine learning algorithms were utilized for mortality risk prediction, with SHapley additive explanations (SHAP) applied to identify key predictors. Among 3506 participants, 1986 (56.65%) were male and 1520 (43.35%) were female. Kaplan-Meier curves showed that higher SHR levels were associated with increased 28-day all-cause mortality (log-rank P = 0.01). This correlation persisted across glucose metabolism groups. Cox regression analysis revealed that the highest SHR quartile was linked to higher mortality risk, particularly in non-diabetic patients. RCS analysis confirmed a U-shaped relationship between SHR and mortality. Subgroup analysis showed that SHR was associated with mortality risk across various subgroups, with stronger associations in females and prediabetic patients. Among eight machine learning models developed based on eight RFE-selected variables, the XGBoost model achieved the best predictive performance for 28-day mortality (AUC = 0.819). SHR can serve as a key prognostic tool for mortality in mitral valve disease (MVD) patients, especially among women and patients with prediabetes. This integrated approach may inform personalized glucose management strategies, potentially improving clinical outcomes."

In parallel, the remarkable development of transcatheter therapies has dramatically expanded both the therapeutic landscape and the number of patients eligible for curative interventions. Together, these trends have created a growing financial, societal, and logistical burden on healthcare systems worldwide. Despite technological breakthroughs, major challenges persist. Many patients with VHD remain undiagnosed, are referred late in the disease course, and ultimately receive suboptimal treatment. Unlike atherosclerosis or heart failure, where medical therapies have led to major clinical advances, there is currently no effective medical therapy to slow or prevent degenerative VHD progression. Healthcare systems face significant constraints, including shortages of healthcare providers, limited access to primary care, restricted availability of diagnostic testing and cardiology services. These challenges are particularly pronounced particularly in publicly funded systems such as Canada, where direct specialist access is limited, and hospital capacity is insufficient. These challenges are unevenly distributed: individuals with low socioeconomic status or those living in rural or underserved areas bear the greatest burden. Moreover, structured and coordinated healthcare pathways for valve disease remain lacking. Addressing these challenges requires opening up the future of valve disease: expanding early detection beyond hospital walls, integrating digital and community-based care, fostering big data and innovation networks, and accelerating the development of medical therapies and personalized medicine approaches through multidisciplinary collaboration that can truly transform patient outcomes."

This condition significantly worsens prognosis and quality of life, yet therapeutic strategies remain heterogeneous and based on low-level evidence.
To systematically review diagnostic approaches and therapeutic options for right-sided valvular disease in CaHD, assessing indications, advantages, limitations, and outcomes.
A systematic review was conducted according to PRISMA guidelines and registered in PROSPERO (CRD42023392363). Searches were performed in PUBMED/MEDLINE, LILACS, and EMBASE for studies published between 2002 and 2024. Eligible studies included clinical trials, observational studies, case series, and case reports evaluating pharmacologic, surgical, or percutaneous interventions for CaHD with reported cardiovascular outcomes. Risk of bias was assessed using ROBINS-I V2 and JBI tools.
Of 183 total records, 45 studies met inclusion criteria (30 case reports, 8 case series, 7 observational studies). Tricuspid regurgitation was the most prevalent lesion (90%), followed by pulmonary regurgitation (73%). Somatostatin analogues were frequently used but did not prevent progression of valve disease. Surgical valve replacement, predominantly with bioprostheses, remains the cornerstone for severe symptomatic cases, providing symptomatic and echocardiographic improvement, but with a perioperative mortality of up to 10%. Percutaneous valve therapies, though limited to small series and case reports, demonstrated promising short-term outcomes without major complications. Additional strategies such as patent foramen ovale closure and hepatic resection showed potential prognostic benefit. No significant difference in outcomes was observed between biological and mechanical prostheses.
Surgical valve replacement remains the most effective evidence-based therapy for CaHD, while percutaneous techniques emerge as feasible alternatives in high-risk patients. Adjunctive measures such as PFO closure and hepatic metastasis resection may improve prognosis. Drug therapies control carcinoid syndrome but are insufficient to halt cardiac disease progression. Further prospective studies are needed to define optimal timing, patient selection, and long-term outcomes of interventional strategies."

Clinical subphenotypes were identified using a combination of principal component analysis and latent class analysis based on age, sex, comorbidities, SOFA score, creatinine levels, metastatic foci, source, and acquisition. The 90-day mortality associated with each subphenotype was estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method. Cox regression was performed to assess the risk of death.
A total of 419 MRSAB were included. Four distinct subphenotypes were identified: S1 was associated with younger age, community acquisition, and unknown or skin and soft-tissue infection source; S2 was associated with older age, female sex, high burden of comorbidities, and healthcare-related acquisition; S3 was linked to a catheter source and nosocomial acquisition; and S4 was predominantly associated with the presence of heart valve prostheses, and metastatic foci. Significant differences in all-cause 90-day mortality were observed across subphenotypes: 20.0% in S1, 47.4% in S2, 26.2% in S3, and 35.1% in S4 (P < .01).

Advances,"Few studies have evaluated the prevalence or severity of mitral valve prolapse (MVP) and other valvular heart disease (VHD) in the rural U.S. South, where strategies for early detection are crucial for risk stratification and prevention.
We assessed the prevalence of MVP and other VHD in a rural U.S. South cohort and examined associations with cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk. We also evaluated associations between MVP severity, high-sensitivity cardiac troponin T, and N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide.
We conducted a cross-sectional analysis from the Risk Underlying Rural Areas Longitudinal study. Logistic regression assessed associations between participant characteristics and MVP, other VHD, or either. Weighted models assessed odds for MVP and other VHD by 10-year CVD risk categories using the Predicting Risk of CVD Events (PREVENT) score. Among a subset, we evaluated associations between MVP severity and cardiac biomarkers.
Among 2,621 participants (68.7% women), MVP and other VHD were present in 1.9% and 11.2%, respectively. Compared to the low PREVENT risk group, odds of MVP were lower and odds of VHD were higher among borderline and intermediate/high groups. High-sensitivity cardiac troponin T was lower in MVP vs non-MVP (0.64; 95% CI: 0.58-0.71), without difference by severity of MVP.

Advances,"Bicuspid aortic valve (BAV) is the most common congenital heart defect but often evades timely diagnosis due to variable clinical presentations. Prior to October 2024, no specific diagnosis code existed for BAV, limiting retrospective identification.
The purpose of this study was to develop and validate a natural language processing (NLP) system for automated extraction of heart valve morphology from echocardiographic reports, with focus on BAV detection.
We developed a rule-based NLP system using MedSpaCy to analyze echocardiographic reports from the Veterans Affairs Corporate Data Warehouse. The system was trained on 555 manually annotated reports and validated on 170 held-out reports. System performance was evaluated on valve leaflet structure identification.
The NLP system achieved excellent performance for BAV detection with a precision of 0.925, a sensitivity of 0.939, and an F1-score of 0.932. When applied to 14,453,591 echocardiographic documents from 3,478,658 patients, the system identified 83,461 patients (2.40%) with affirmed BAV. Among patients identified by the International Classification of Diseases-10 code Q23.81, NLP showed 86.1% concordance, with manual review confirming NLP accuracy in discordant cases.
This NLP approach enables large-scale retrospective identification of BAV patients from clinical text, creating the largest BAV cohort to date and facilitating future cardiovascular research and clinical decision-making."

Hierarchical bivariate meta-analysis yielded pooled sensitivity/specificity of 0.93/0.90 on a per-patient basis and 0.92/0.93 per eye, closely paralleling expert grading. Meta-regression showed that DR severity threshold, national-income level, image gradability, pupil dilation, reference standard, and diagnostic criteria collectively explained most between-study heterogeneity; any-DR screening, low-income settings, or ungradable images increased false-positive rates, whereas dilated pupils, portable cameras, and adjudicated references improved specificity. Publication bias was minimal. Overall, regulator-approved DL algorithms provide accurate, scalable DR detection, but programs must tailor deployment and reimbursement to disease threshold, image quality, and local resources, and post-market audits with standardized gradability metrics are needed to ensure safe, equitable global adoption."
PubMed,deep learning,Augmenting a prognostic deep learning system for referable diabetic retinopathy and maculopathy with synthetic retinal images.,Paul Nderitu; Joan M Nunez do Rio; Laura Webster; Samantha S Mann; David Hopkins; Christos Bergeles; Timothy L Jackson,10.1038/s43856-025-01316-5,2025-12-20,Communications medicine,"Labelled data scarcity and class imbalance are common deep learning system (DLS) development challenges. We investigated if synthetic retinal images from a conditional cascaded diffusion model (CCDM) improves prognostic DLS (pDLS) performance for 2-year incident referable diabetic retinopathy or maculopathy (rDR/rM) prediction.
Macula images from 72,559 eyes (September 2013 to December 2019) from the UK South-East London Diabetic Eye Screening Programme (SEL-DESP) formed the development dataset, whilst 9,071 eyes were used for internal testing. Images from 2,842 eyes from Birmingham DESP were used for external testing. Prognostic DLS were augmented with ×1, ×2, and ×4 additional synthetic positive cases (pDLS-G) and compared to unaugmented (pDLS-N) and ×1 positive-case resampled pDLS (pDLS-R) using the Area-Under-the Receiver Operating Characteristic curve (AUROC).
Here we show that CCDM generate realistic synthetic retinal images that are comparable to real images and demonstrate the utility of synthetic retinal images in augmenting the development of a pDLS. The internal and external test AUROC for the pDLS are 0.827 (95% CI: 0.794-0.861) and 0.756 (0.680-0.831), respectively. Augmentation with ×2 additional synthetic positive cases (pDLS-G ×2) significantly improves the internal test AUROC to 0.845 (95% CI: 0.812-0.877, p = 0.044) but does not improve the external test AUROC 0.717 (0.633-0.828, p = 0.243). Resampling positive real cases alone does not improve pDLS-R performance.
Augmenting pDLS with synthetic retinal images significantly improves pDLS performance on internal testing but not external testing suggesting further research is required to enhance the generalisability of synthetic retinal image augmentation."
PubMed,deep learning,Modeling and simulation of dual-battery FANET system using MADRL for energy optimization.,A Sophia Mary; T S Pradeep Kumar,10.1038/s41598-025-30429-z,2025-12-19,Scientific reports,"Uncrewed Aerial Vehicles (UAVs), or drones, are revolutionizing applications such as surveillance, search and rescue (SAR), precision agriculture, and disaster response. In these applications, Flying Ad-Hoc Networks (FANETs)-dynamic networks of interconnected UAVs-are essential for enabling rapid and adaptive deployments. However, the limited battery life of UAVs remains a critical challenge, particularly in extended missions like SAR, where operational longevity and reliable performance are paramount. This paper addresses two key challenges in FANET-based UAV operations: optimizing energy consumption and ensuring stable communication links. We propose a novel strategy that models energy-efficient UAV behavior by focusing on the three primary drivers of power consumption: flight dynamics, payload operations, and continuous wireless communication, which collectively account for 80-85% of the UAV's energy usage. Leveraging a multi-agent deep reinforcement learning (MADRL) framework that intelligently manages a dedicated dual-battery system: one battery (B1) optimized for flight dynamics and payload operations, and the other (B2) for processor/sensor and continuous wireless communication. The MADRL agents (Proximal Policy Optimization: PPO) are modeled to handle battery B2, which dynamically establishes communication between UAVs regarding energy usage and other environmental conditions during SAR operations, thereby efficiently conserving available energy to extend the battery life of each UAV within the FANET system. Experimental results demonstrate that MADRL enhances network connectivity and significantly reduces energy wastage, enabling sustained operations over longer durations. This research lays the foundation for developing energy-efficient UAV systems, which are crucial for large-scale and autonomous deployments in mission-critical scenarios."

Fifty-five scans were performed as part of an ongoing multicenter study. Routine carotid VWI protocol including 2D T1- and T2-weighted TSE, 3D TOF-MRA, and MPRAGE was performed using simultaneous acquisition from a standard 20-channel head-and-neck coil and a high-sensitivity Neck-Shape-Specific (NSS) surface coil. Paired retrospective reconstructions with and without NSS coil elements served as the reference and input, respectively. A supervised DL model employing a residual UNet architecture was optimized and trained to map low-SNR inputs to high-SNR references, benchmarked against conventional denoising algorithms using quantitative and qualitative metrics.
The DL denoiser substantially reduced noise while preserving vessel-wall structures across contrast-weighted sequences. It achieved PSNR > 31 dB and structural similarity index (SSIM) > 0.93 versus reference slices. In segmented vessel-wall and lumen regions of interest (ROIs), the DL approach achieved significantly higher SNR and CNR values than input images (p < 0.05), closely approaching the reference. Furthermore, inner-wall edge sharpness was maintained (Average ERD 7.50-8.51 mm with DL vs. 7.15-8.28 mm with references), supporting confident downstream plaques assessment. Radiologists' Likert ratings corroborated these image-quality improvements.
A DL-based method was developed to improve high-resolution, multi-contrast carotid vessel wall MRI acquired using low-SNR standard head-and-neck coils. The resulting image quality was comparable to that obtained with specialized neck surface coils, potentially enabling broader access to advanced carotid imaging without the need for additional hardware."

Moreover, deep learning-based target detection methods suffer from insufficient accuracy and real-time performance when addressing low-contrast, fog- and snow-obscured, and high-elevation polar images. Therefore, this study integrates transformer-based convolution (TransConv) into You Only Look Once (YOLO)v11 to strengthen the ability of the network to model the global information contained in fog- and snow-obscured images and to achieve improved target detection performance in complex environments. A mist global feature pyramid network (MistGFPN) is designed to focus on the ability to extract features from small targets to improve the target detection performance achieved at high altitudes. An efficient asymmetric detection head (EADH) is proposed to improve the frames per second (FPS) and real-time detection performance of the target detection model. Finally, several comparative experiments are designed to verify the effectiveness and real-time performance of the proposed model. The experimental results obtained on homemade datasets show that the proposed model (YOLO-TME) improves the accuracy, recall, average accuracy, and F1 score metrics by 4.2%, 5.8%, 5.5%, and 5.1%, respectively, over those of the original YOLOv11 model, which indicates that YOLO-TME provides substantially improved detection accuracy while maintaining high detection speed, thus satisfying the real-time landing sign detection requirements imposed in polar environments."

Trifluoromethanesulfonyl fluoride (CF3SO2F) emerges as a promising candidate due to its excellent properties. However, understanding its thermal decomposition pathways and products under operationally relevant conditions is critical for evaluating its environmental feasibility and mitigating potential risks upon accidental release or during fault events. This study investigates the thermal decomposition mechanisms of CF3SO2F using a deep learning potential that combines ab initio accuracy with empirical MD efficiency. By leveraging machine learning driven molecular dynamics, we systematically analyze the yields and components of decomposition products versus temperatures, gas mixing ratios, and buffer gas. The results reveal that the bond-breaking pathways are temperature-dependent, with both elevated temperatures and higher buffer gas mixing ratios promoting its decomposition. Elevated gas pressure enhances the decomposition process by increasing the collision frequency among reactant species. Additionally, N2 exhibits an inhibitory effect on decomposition under high pressure compared to CO2. Experimental validation via a thermal decomposition platform confirms characteristic decomposition products. These findings are pivotal for guiding the rational design and safe deployment of CF3SO2F to achieve substantial greenhouse gas mitigation in the power industry."

We propose REFINE-MORE (REference-Free Implicit NEural representation with MOdel REinforcement), combining an implicit neural representation (INR) architecture with a model reinforcement module that incorporates MR physics constraints. The INR component enables informative learning of spatiotemporal correlations to initialize multiparametric quantitative maps, which are then further refined through an unrolled optimization scheme enforcing data consistency. To improve computational efficiency, REFINE-MORE integrates a low-rank adaptation strategy that promotes rapid model convergence. We evaluated REFINE-MORE on accelerated multiparametric quantitative magnetization transfer imaging for simultaneous estimation of free water spin-lattice relaxation, tissue macromolecular proton fraction, and magnetization exchange rate, using both phantom and in vivo brain data.
Under 4× and 5× accelerations on in vivo data, REFINE-MORE achieved superior reconstruction quality, demonstrating the lowest normalized root-mean-square error and highest structural similarity index compared to baseline methods and other state-of-the-art model-based and deep learning approaches. Phantom experiments further showed strong agreement with reference values, underscoring the robustness and generalizability of the proposed framework. Additionally, the model adaptation strategy improved reconstruction efficiency by approximately fivefold.

Early detection of this disease plays a vital role in reducing its complications. However, machine learning and deep learning models often face distrust in medical settings due to their opaque, ""black-box"" nature. The aim of this study was to combine three machine learning algorithms using stacking and voting methods to propose a model for type 2 diabetes detection, and to increase transparency by using the explainability techniques LIME and SHAP to identify important features. This study used medical data from 768 Pima Indians Diabetes samples, including 8 features such as age, BMI, glucose, insulin, blood pressure, skin thickness, pregnancies, and family history. Data preprocessing included mean imputation for missing or zero values, Min-Max normalization, and classification into ""Normal"", ""Prediabetes"", and ""Diabetes"" based on fasting glucose thresholds. Feature selection was performed using Spearman correlation to retain the most relevant variables. A hybrid machine learning model was developed using three base models Neural Network (NN), k-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), and Random Forest (RF) with automated hyperparameter tuning. The outputs of these models were combined via stacking using a logistic regression (LR) meta-model and in parallel using a soft voting method. Nested cross-validation (5 outer and 5 inner folds) was applied to prevent data leakage and ensure robust evaluation. Model interpretability was assessed using LIME for local explanations and SHAP for global feature importance. Decision thresholds and influential feature regions were identified, and model calibration and decision curves evaluated clinical reliability. Models performance was evaluated using accuracy, precision, recall, specificity, F1-score, AUROC, Brier Score (1-B), and Expected Calibration Error (1-E). Statistical reliability was assessed using bootstrap resampling to compute 95% confidence intervals, as well as paired tests to compare the hybrid model with the base models and voting ensemble. Based on the evaluation metrics, the stacking ensemble achieved perfect performance for Class 0, with 100% accuracy, precision, recall, specificity, F1 score, and AUROC, alongside the highest calibration metrics (Brier Score: 99.9, ECE: 98.7). The Random Forest model also excelled, achieving 100% accuracy, precision, recall, specificity, and F1 score for Class 0 and Class 2. In contrast, the KNN model consistently underperformed, particularly for Class 0 (F1: 83.3, Precision: 83.3, Recall: 83.3). The Neural Network demonstrated strong recall for Class 0 (100%), while the voting ensemble showed balanced results but was slightly outperformed by the top ensemble methods. Explainable AI analyses using LIME and SHAP revealed that glucose was the most influential predictor for identifying the Pre-diabetes state. Both methods consistently identified a decision band between 0.35 and 0.47 (corresponding to 100-125 mg/dL) as the transition zone between ""Normal"" and ""Prediabetes"", confirming the model's alignment with WHO/ADA diagnostic criteria. The stacking model achieved perfect performance and superior calibration, outperforming all other models in type 2 diabetes prediction and classification. Explainability techniques (LIME and SHAP) identified glucose level, body mass index, and blood pressure as key predictive factors. This approach provides an accurate and interpretable tool for clinical decision support in healthcare systems."

312 periapical radiographs were retrospectively collected, each accompanied by a corresponding cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT) scan obtained within six months and a radiology report authored by board-certified oral and maxillofacial radiologists. These reports served as the reference standard, and all findings were cross-verified by the primary investigator through CBCT review. The dataset included 181 images with at least one apical radiolucent lesion and 131 lesion-free controls. Using the no-code AI platform LandingLens (Landing AI LLC, Palo Alto, CA), a diagnostic model was developed. De-identified radiographs were manually annotated with bounding boxes around lesions and automatically divided into training (70%), validation (20%), and testing (10%) subsets. Model performance was evaluated at the tooth level using sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, precision, and F1 score. To investigate the influence of anatomical sites, data were stratified by region and analyzed using chi-square and pairwise chi-square tests (α = 0.05).
The AI model demonstrated robust diagnostic performance, achieving 88.7% sensitivity, 93.0% specificity, 76.6% precision, 92.1% accuracy, and an F1 score of 0.822. Sensitivity was significantly higher in the maxilla (93.1%) compared to the mandible (83.8%; p = 0.049), whereas specificity was greater in the mandible (95.4%) than in the maxilla (90.8%; p = 0.01). No differences in performance were found between anterior and posterior teeth (p > 0.05). Regionally, the highest sensitivity was observed in the anterior maxilla (97.7%), while specificity peaked in the anterior mandible (97.9%; p < 0.05). Other diagnostic metrics did not vary significantly across regions (p > 0.05).
This no-code AI model demonstrated high accuracy in detecting apical radiolucent lesions and revealed that diagnostic performance can vary based on anatomical location. The model's increased sensitivity in the maxilla and higher specificity in the mandible highlight the relevance of regional anatomy in AI-assisted diagnostics. These findings support the potential of no-code AI platforms as accessible tools for building clinically meaningful diagnostic models and underscore the importance of anatomical considerations in their implementation."

Using the NLST CT arm with outcomes defined over a 0-24‑month window, we construct a fixed patient‑level split (one CT per patient; no cross‑split leakage) and perform 25 repeated imbalanced test draws (~ 6% prevalence) to approximate screening conditions. At screening prevalence, RAD‑DINO + MLP achieves PR‑AUC = 0.705 (calibrated; raw 0.554) and ROC‑AUC = 0.817 (raw; 0.736 calibrated), with improved probability reliability following calibration; operating points are selected on validation and reported on test. For secondary ablations only, a near‑balanced cohort (N = 1984) yields accuracy 0.966, precision 0.974, recall 0.973, F1 0.973, and ROC‑AUC 0.912. Beyond classification, retrieval with triplet‑fine‑tuned embeddings attains Precision@5 = 0.853. Interpretability analyses show that cancer cases sustain higher top‑k slice scores and that directional SHAP concentrates on a small subset of high‑probability slices; label‑colored t‑SNE provides qualitative views of embedding structure. Limitations include single‑cohort evaluation, lack of Lung‑RADS labels in public NLST, and a CXR → CT pretraining shift; future work will pursue external validation and CT‑native self‑supervised continuation. Overall, frozen 2D foundation embeddings provide a strong, transparent, and computationally practical starting point for LDCT screening workflows under realistic prevalence."

Our study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of shape-guidance strategies by varying the combinations of encoder layers that guide attention to breast structures and by comparing the proposed models with conventional models. For the shape-guidance strategy, we applied breast masks to the attention mechanism to emphasize spatial dependencies and enhance the learning of positional relationships within breast anatomy. We then compared the representative models-Masked Transformer models that demonstrated the best performance across layer combinations-with the conventional ResNet50, ViT, and SwinT V2. In our study, a total of 2,436 publicly available mammography images from the Chinese Mammography Database via The Cancer Imaging Archive were analyzed. Three-fold cross-validation was employed, with a patient-wise split of 70% for training and 30% for validation. Model performance on differentiating breast cancer from non-cancer images was assessed by the area under the receiver-operating characteristic curve (AUROC). The results showed that applying masks at the Shallow and Deep stages gave the highest AUROC for Masked ViT. The Masked ViT achieved an AUROC of 0.885 [95% confidence interval: 0.849-0.918], a sensitivity of 0.876, and a specificity of 0.802, outperforming all other conventional models.

Among evaluated YOLO versions, the YOLO11l model exhibited the optimal segmentation performance, with mean Dice (mDice) coefficients of 0.82 (internal test set) and 0.77 (external test set). Its classification sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy were 91.67%, 76.11%, and 83.25% on the internal test set, significantly outperforming other versions. On the external test set, corresponding values were 84.68%, 61.22%, and 71.00%, representing the best overall performance. Notably, the diagnostic performance of the YOLO11l model was non-inferior to that of Resident1 (p = 0.41) but inferior to that of Attending2 (p = 0.015).
The YOLO11l model represents a promising approach to aiding the assessment of TFCC injuries. Compared with less experienced radiology residents, this model can provide reliable and reproducible diagnostic support."

Tongue diagnosis provides a non-invasive and cost-effective insight into internal health; however, its subjectivity limits clinical reliability. We developed TongVMoe, a multi-task deep learning model trained on 2202 tongue images from 1601 patients, to detect liver fibrosis and simultaneously classify seven key tongue features. The model achieved an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.8061, outperforming State-of-the-Art methods such as DiffMIC-v2 (0.6929), HorNet (0.7018), InceptionNeXt (0.7012), LSNet (0.6971), and TransXNet (0.7062). TongVMoe also demonstrated robust recognition of tongue features, with AUCs of 0.9752 for cracks and 0.9232 for greasy coating. Among these features, petechiae emerged as a significant clinical indicator, showing a strong correlation with liver fibrosis (χ² = 19.516, P < 0.001). We further integrated the model into a WeChat mini-program and simulated remote screening, achieving an accuracy of 77.8% and a sensitivity of 86.2%. These findings suggest that the TongVMoe has the potential to serve as an interpretable and mobile-compatible tool for the early detection and monitoring of liver fibrosis, particularly in resource-limited areas.

PubMed,deep learning,SALT: Introducing a framework for hierarchical segmentations in medical imaging using label trees.,Sven S Becker; Giulia Baldini; Cynthia S Schmidt; Olivia B Pollok; Obioma Pelka; Judith Kohnke; Katarzyna Borys; Christoph M Friedrich; Benedikt M Schaarschmidt; Michael Forsting; Lale Umutlu; Johannes Haubold; Felix Nensa; René Hosch,10.1038/s41598-025-31639-1,2025-12-19,Scientific reports,"Traditional segmentation networks treat anatomical structures as isolated elements, often neglecting their hierarchical relationships. This study introduces Softmax for Arbitrary Label Trees (SALT), a novel method that leverages these hierarchical connections to improve segmentation efficiency and interpretability. SALT is a novel activation function that extends the softmax to arbitrary hierarchical label trees by modeling conditional probabilities along parent-child relations in imaging data. This enables anatomical hierarchies in CT imaging to be represented naturally, allowing segmentations to propagate from broader regions to detailed structures. Using the SAROS dataset from The Cancer Imaging Archive (TCIA), which comprises 900 body segmentations from 883 patients and was enhanced by TotalSegmentator to include 113 anatomical labels, the model was trained on 600 scans, with validation and testing on 150. Dice scores across SAROS, CT-ORG, FLARE22, LCTSC, LUNA16, and WORD datasets measured performance, with 95% confidence intervals (CI) from 1000 bootstrapping rounds. SALT achieved top performance on the LUNA16 and SAROS datasets, with Dice scores of 0.93 (95% CI: 0.919-0.938) and 0.929 (95% CI: 0.924-0.933). Reliable accuracy was also observed in CT-ORG (0.891, 95% CI: 0.869-0.906), FLARE22 (0.849, 95% CI: 0.844-0.854), LCTSC (0.908, 95% CI: 0.902-0.914), and WORD (0.844, 95% CI: 0.839-0.85). SALT can segment a 1000-slice CT in 35 s. By leveraging hierarchical body structures, SALT enables rapid whole-body segmentation, processing CT scans in 35 s on average. This capability supports its integration into clinical workflows, enhancing efficiency in automated full-body segmentation and contributing to improved diagnostic workflows and patient care."

With a focus on the prevalent psychological complications following the onset of this condition, this study aimed to explore the correlation between antenatal depression and Corona disease anxiety, personality traits, and postpartum depression during the COVID-19 pandemic.                                                           Materials and Methods:                     This cross-sectional descriptive-analytical study investigated women receiving care at health centers affiliated with Kerman University of Medical Sciences during the last month of their pregnancy and the postpartum period in 2022. Following the acquisition of informed consent, participants were assessed using various measures, including demographic and obstetric information, the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale, the Corona Disease Anxiety Scale (CDAS), and the NEO Personality Inventory-Revised during their third trimester of pregnancy. The same group of participants completed the Edinburgh Depression Scale and the Corona Disease Anxiety Scale (CDAS) 4-6 weeks after childbirth.                                                           Results and Discussion:                     There was a significant correlation between family income, unwanted pregnancy as perceived by both the mother and father, and antenatal depression. Additionally, marital satisfaction played a significant role in postpartum depression. Furthermore, antenatal depression was significantly associated with neuroticism, agreeableness, and physical symptoms related to Corona disease anxiety. Personality traits, with the exception of extroversion and conscientiousness, and various domains of Corona disease anxiety, excluding psychological symptoms, were also significantly associated with postpartum depression.                                                           Conclusion:                     During pandemics or epidemics, such as the COVID-19 outbreak, experiencing mental distress during pregnancy can contribute to mental health issues during the postpartum period. This risk is particularly true in individuals with unique personality traits, emphasizing the need for increased focus on mental health within prenatal care during these crises."

Method:                     This cross-sectional study was conducted in Kerman, Iran. Data were collected from patients who visited Afzalipour Hospital in Kerman more than twice during the COVID-19 epidemic from the end of February 2020 to March 21, 2021. We conducted two key analyses: 1. Mixed effect logistic regression was used to check the relationship between the variables and COVID-19 severity. 2. Mixed effect linear regression was used to check the relationship between the variables and the length of stay in the hospital.                                                           Results:                     The findings indicated that the most important risk factors for the severity of COVID-19 were heart diseases (OR=1.67,95%CI:1.20-2.30), increasing age (OR=2.23 for age&gt;54, 95%CI:1.70- 2.90), male gender (OR=1.47,95%CI:1.10-1.96), respiratory diseases other than asthma, and frequency of admission (OR=1.60,95%CI:1.20-2.15). All patients who underwent readmission experienced a shorter duration of hospitalization during their subsequent admission (OR=0.94,95%CI:0.91,0.96) and had a higher mortality rate (30% within 14 days, 26.6% between 14-90 days). Patients readmitted at intervals of 14-90 days and greater than 90 days exhibited lower disease severity compared to those readmitted within the 0-14 day period.                                                           Conclusion:                     Examining readmissions, the severity of COVID-19, and the length of hospital stay in affected patients are important factors for planning and allocating resources for COVID-19 management and treatment. These factors can help policymakers develop effective clinical guidelines for hospitalization or outpatient treatment of COVID-19 patients and contribute to reducing the burden of disease in the community."

Kinovea, as an accessible motion-analysis software, provides both visual and quantitative feedback. However, its application in supporting technique development among beginner athletes remains insufficiently explored. Aim: This study aims to describe the use of Kinovea in biomechanics training and examine its contribution to the awareness of kinematic characteristics and movement techniques among beginner athletes. Methods: A descriptive qualitative design involved 72 beginner athletes aged 18–25 years selected through purposive sampling. Data were collected over 16 weeks through interviews, field observations, and motion video recordings analyzed using Kinovea. Kinematic data focused on joint angles, stride behavior, and movement phases during walking, running, and the flight phase. Qualitative data were analyzed using content analysis with NVivo 12, while kinematic results were interpreted descriptively to identify performance patterns and areas for technical refinement. Result: Kinematic analysis showed coordinated joint-angle patterns across all phases. Walking analysis identified arm swing angles of 50.9°–58.8° and leg separation angles of 64.3°–67.2°, indicating a stable gait rhythm. The running analysis revealed knee angles of 68.8°–69.8° and elbow angles of 87.6°–89.1°, indicating efficient propulsive mechanics. The flight phase demonstrated knee angles of 81.2°–87.8° and elbow angles of 80.4°–88.3°, suggesting effective momentum use and postural stability. These measurements supported stride-efficiency assessment and technique evaluation. Qualitative findings revealed that Kinovea enabled athletes to interpret movement phases and identify technical inefficiencies through slow-motion and frame-by-frame visualization. Conclusion: Kinovea supports basic motion analysis by providing clear kinematic information and helping beginner athletes observe and refine their movement techniques. The findings also offer practical value for coaches by enabling more precise identification of inefficient patterns and guiding targeted corrections during early-stage training."

OpenAlex,aortic stenosis,Outcomes of Surgical versus Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement: A Clinical Review,"Stang, Grace",,2026-01-01,Digital Commons - Gardner-Webb University (Gardner–Webb University),"Introduction: Surgical aortic valve replacement (SAVR) has been the predominant treatment for aortic stenosis (AS) for decades. However, transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) is becoming increasingly popular. Originally, TAVRs were only performed on patients who were deemed high-risk for surgery and would have died without the valve replacement. The purpose of this paper is to determine if TAVR or SAVR has better health outcomes for all patients no matter their surgical risk. Methods: A search via PubMed database was done using the key words “aortic stenosis”, “surgical aortic valve replacement”, “transcatheter aortic valve replacement”, and “mortality.” Additional search filters were applied for randomized control trials, systematic reviews, and meta- analyses. Dates were restricted to the last 5 years, and restrictions were added for English language and free full text only. This yielded 67 results and 5 were selected. Results: Of the five reviewed articles, all were meta-analyses and one systematic review. There was a total of 52122 patients. Primary endpoints across all articles were that there is no significant difference between TAVR and SAVR in the outcomes studied. Discussion: This review of studies provided supportive evidence that both TAVR and SAVR are valid treatment options or AS. TAVR had better short-term outcomes while SAVR had better long-term outcomes."

Trace elements are involved in cellular and physiological processes, playing regulatory and signaling roles. Their concentrations may be altered in various pathological conditions. The aim of our study was to compare trace metal concentrations in patients with severe aortic stenosis with and without coexisting coronary artery disease. Methods: In 53 patients (25 male, 47.2%, median age of 78 (75–81) years) with severe aortic stenosis, CAD coexistence and progression were analyzed based on the most recent coronary angiography report and history of revascularization. Blood samples for trace element analysis were collected prior to the implantation of the prosthesis, from the peripheral artery and by the pigtail catheter at the aortic root. Results: Twenty-six patients presented any degree of CAD, and were further differentiated into more advanced disease stages. The analysis found that patients with CAD had lower median concentrations of aluminum and calcium in the peripheral blood, and manganese and selenium in the aorta. Furthermore, in most advanced CAD patients, the concentration of magnesium, calcium, nickel, and copper in peripheral blood, along with chromium and selenium in aortic blood, was found to be lower compared to non-CAD patients. Lower selenium in aortic blood samples was predictive of an advanced stage of CAD. Conclusions: Patients with severe aortic stenosis and coexisting CAD present significantly lower blood concentrations of trace elements compared to those with the isolated disease."

Baranov,10.21688/1681-3472-2025-3-35-45,2025-12-18,Patologiya krovoobrashcheniya i kardiokhirurgiya,"Background: Nowafays, transcatheter aortic valve implantation is an effective method for treating patients with severe aortic stenosis in all surgical risk groups. Despite significant achievements, the transcatheter aortic valve implantation proceeding is often accompanied by a number of obstacles associated with suboptimal location of the bioprosthesis, its geometry and subsequent hydrodynamic disturbances. Objective: The aim of the study was to develop and validate a comprehensive mathematical model taking into account fluid-structure interaction to simulate the hemodynamic characteristics of transcatheter aortic valves. Methods: To construct a comprehensive model describing the hemodynamics of the aortic valve, the first step was to develop a geometric model including the aortic root, the valve frame, and the leaflet apparatus connected to the valve skirt. Next, the overall topic on modeling the flow and soft tissue response during valve placement was solved using the ALE formulation for fluid-structure interaction, which combines the Eulerian description of fluid motion with the Lagrangian description of solid deformation. Results: Stress distributions in the valve frame and cusps were obtained. The highest stress occurred at the frame nodes and reach 270 MPa. The valve cusps were most susceptible to high stress in the inflection zone. Stress values ranged from 5–10 MPa. Furthermore, aortic wall dilation due to valve frame expansion was determined to be in the range of 0.6–1.2 mm and consistent with clinically observed values. The maximum flow velocity after surgery did not exceed 1.4 m/s that was within a range for healthy people. Conclusion: The study demonstrates the possibility of using a comprehensive approach based on the fluid-structure interaction to simulate the hemodynamics of a transcatheter aortic valve bioprosthesis. The developed model covers both the anatomically correct geometry of the aortic root and valve elements, and realistic boundary conditions based on clinical echocardiography data and a physiological pressure profile that ensures high reliability of the numerical experiment. Thus, the presented methodological approach can be effectively used to assess and predict the results of transcatheter aortic valve implantation and optimize new designs of transcatheter aortic bioprostheses, analyze their interaction with the anatomical structures of the patient, as well as to reduce the risk of complications and increase the durability of prostheses."

It remains unclear, however, if different SEVs yield similar outcomes in BAV stenosis, a class effect, or if the unique design features of different SEVs produce disparate clinical results. Objectives: This is a “proof-of-concept” study that compares procedural and clinical outcomes of Acurate neo2 and Evolut Pro/Pro+/Fx platforms in Sievers type 1 BAV stenosis. Methods: The CLASS effect is a retrospective, multicenter registry that enrolls patients with raphe-type 1 BAV stenosis undergoing TAVI at 29 international centers, who received Acurate neo2 and Evolut Pro/Pro+/Fx devices. An inverse probability of treatment weighting (IPTW) analysis was performed to adjust for baseline imbalances. Primary endpoints included VARC-3 technical success, 30-day device success, and early safety according to VARC-3. Results: Among 389 eligible patients, 155 and 234 patients were treated with Acurate neo2 and Evolut platforms, respectively. A higher rate of technical success was observed in the Evolut group (Acurate neo2 vs. Evolut: 93.4% vs. 97.1%, OR 0.41, 95% CI 0.19–0.83, and p = 0.017). At 30 days, device success was comparable (90.1% vs. 89.4%, OR 1.09, 95% CI 0.68–1.75, and p = 0.733), whereas Acurate neo2 was associated with a higher rate of early safety (84.1% vs. 70.4%, OR 2.22, 95% CI 1.56–3.17, and p &lt; 0.001), which was mainly driven by a lower risk of new permanent pacemaker implantation (PPI) (6.3% vs. 19.5%, OR 0.28, 95% CI 0.16–0.46, and p &lt; 0.001). Conclusions: Acurate neo2 and Evolut Pro/Pro+/Fx platforms provide similarly effective procedural and short-term outcomes in Sievers type 1 BAV stenosis. However, Evolut was associated with a higher technical success, while Acurate neo2 demonstrated a lower incidence of new PPI."
OpenAlex,aortic stenosis,Emerging therapies targeting lipoprotein(a): the next frontier in cardiovascular risk reduction,Ibrahim S. Alhomoud,10.3389/fmed.2025.1727918,2025-12-18,Frontiers in Medicine,"Lipoprotein(a) [Lp(a)] is a genetically determined lipoprotein particle composed of apolipoprotein B-100 covalently linked to apolipoprotein(a) [apo(a)] via a disulfide bond. The Lp(a) particle is enriched with oxidized phospholipids (OxPLs), which confer enhanced atherogenic and pro-inflammatory properties compared with low-density lipoprotein (LDL). Robust genetic and epidemiologic evidence demonstrates that elevated Lp(a) levels are independently associated with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease and calcific aortic valve stenosis. However, no pharmacologic therapy has yet been approved that specifically lower Lp(a) or to demonstrate a reduction in cardiovascular events. Antisense oligonucleotides (e.g., pelacarsen), small-interfering RNAs (e.g., olpasiran, lepodisiran, and zerlasiran), and oral small-molecule Lp(a) inhibitors (e.g., muvalaplin) have demonstrated profound reductions in circulating Lp(a) concentrations, typically achieving decreases of 80–90%. In some studies, the reductions approached or achieved a near-complete suppression. Current genetic and modeling evidence suggests that an absolute reduction of at least 50 mg/dL in Lp(a) levels is required to achieve meaningful cardiovascular benefits. Large-scale outcome trials are now underway to assess the effects of these emerging therapies on cardiovascular and valvular outcomes. Early findings indicate favorable effects on oxidized phospholipids and vascular inflammation, suggesting broader anti-atherogenic potential. As these agents progress toward clinical use, routine Lp(a) measurement and risk stratification will become increasingly essential for personalized cardiovascular prevention. This review summarizes the molecular biology of Lp(a), highlights the limitations of current therapies, and discusses emerging RNA-based and small-molecule approaches with the potential to redefine the management of residual cardiovascular risk."

Multidetector computed tomography (MDCT)-derived methods for calculating aortic valve area (AVA) may improve diagnostic concordance, but their diagnostic performance, validation against invasive hemodynamics, and the influence of left ventricular outflow tract (LVOT) morphology on severity grading remain insufficiently investigated. Methods: We retrospectively analyzed 307 patients with normal-flow, high-gradient calcific AS who underwent echocardiography, MDCT, and cardiac catheterization. AVA was calculated using (1) echocardiographic LVOT diameter, (2) hybrid Doppler–MDCT planimetric LVOT area, and (3) corrected echocardiographic LVOT diameter (×1.13). Agreement, correlation, and diagnostic performance were assessed using Bland–Altman analysis, Pearson correlation, ROC analysis, and McNemar’s test. Subgroups defined by diagnostic concordance and MDCT-derived LVOT size were compared using ANOVA. Results: Hybrid AVA showed a strong correlation with echocardiographic AVA (r = 0.749, p &lt; 0.001), with a mean difference of +0.11 ± 0.15 cm2. Both methods demonstrated similar relationships with invasive and non-invasive hemodynamic markers of AS severity. When combined with echocardiography, the hybrid method increased concordant classification of severe AS by 8%. In contrast, corrected AVA performed significantly worse, leading to more discordant classifications. LVOT size was significantly associated with variability in AVA and Doppler velocity index, independent of flow status. Conclusions: Hybrid MDCT-derived AVA provides diagnostic performance equivalent to echocardiography and improves concordance in selected patients. LVOT size influences key echocardiographic parameters and may warrant tailored diagnostic thresholds."

All patients received optimal medical therapy before and after undergoing the procedure. Predictors of 5-year mortality were assessed using exploratory machine-learning methods, including random forest and Shapley additive explanations. Results: During 5-year follow-up, 13 cardiovascular deaths were recorded. Five key predictors of mortality were identified: left ventricular ejection fraction, 6 min walk distance, mean pulmonary artery pressure, systolic relaxation coefficient, and degree of mitral regurgitation. The exploratory predictive model showed high accuracy (92%) in terms of classifying the outcomes. Conclusions: Atrioventricular node ablation (AVNA) combined with CRT-D was associated with the observed long-term clinical outcomes observed in patients with drug-refractory tachysystolic atrial fibrillation. The exploratory machine learning analysis identified key mortality-associated factors, which may support future efforts in personalized risk stratification and hypothesis generation. The combination of AVNA and CRT-D was associated with the observed long-term outcomes in this real-world cohort."

Advances in endoscopic visualization and surgical instrumentation have enhanced precision while minimizing trauma, improving both functional and esthetic outcomes. This study presents a single-center experience with total endoscopic mitral valve repair (MVR) performed using two- or three-dimensional video-assisted technology. Methods: Between October 2022 and September 2025, 239 patients underwent total endoscopic MVR at our institution. Demographic, operative, and postoperative data were collected and analyzed. Results: Median age was 63 years, with 64.4% male. Median logistic EuroSCORE and EuroSCORE II were 2.53 and 0.83, respectively. Most patients were NYHA class II (54.4%), and 47.7% had pulmonary hypertension. Mitral annuloplasty was performed in 99.2% of cases; 78.6% received Gore-Tex chordae, 6.3% underwent posterior leaflet resection, and 11.7% edge-to-edge repair. Conversion to sternotomy occurred in 0.4%. In-hospital mortality was 1.3%; stroke occurred in 0.4%. Postoperative atrial fibrillation developed in 26.8%, while major complications such as sepsis (2.1%) and renal failure requiring dialysis (1.3%) were infrequent. Median ventilation time was 5 h, ICU stay was 2 days, and hospital stay was 7 days. Pre-discharge echocardiography showed ≤mild regurgitation in 99.2%. Conclusions: Total endoscopic MVR using two- or three-dimensional video assistance is safe, feasible, and yields excellent clinical, functional, and cosmetic results, with low morbidity and rapid recovery."

Understanding the mechanism of MR, whether primary, due to intrinsic valve abnormalities, or secondary, resulting from atrial or ventricular remodeling, is essential for optimal management. Echocardiography, particularly advanced modalities such as three-dimensional imaging and strain analysis, plays a central role in this process. It allows accurate quantification of MR severity, detailed characterization of valve and ventricular anatomy, and assessment of remodeling, all of which are critical for determining the optimal timing for intervention. Beyond diagnosis, echocardiography is indispensable in guiding therapy selection: it informs surgical planning by defining leaflet pathology for repair versus replacement strategies, and directs transcatheter interventions by guiding interatrial septal puncture, catheter orientation, and device deployment in real time. While surgery remains the gold standard for primary MR, transcatheter approaches including edge-to-edge repair and emerging mitral valve replacement are increasingly relevant, particularly in patients at high surgical risk or with complex anatomy. This review emphasizes the pivotal role of echocardiography in the pre-procedural assessment of MR, highlighting its ability to integrate anatomical, functional, and hemodynamic information to guide patient-tailored therapeutic strategies and optimize outcomes within a Heart Team framework."

It examines the potential treatment for sickle cell anaemia and other chronic or acute diseases like myocardial infarction, angina, CHF, hypertension, rheumatic heart disease, ischemic mitral regurgitation, cardiomyopathy, platelet aggregation, oxidative stress, endothelial dysfunction, and thrombotic conditions. The review examines the potential of Terminalia arjuna leaf gall in SCD treatment, identifying its main bioactive compound, 5-Hydroxymethylfurfural, known for its anti-sickling properties. Galls form when plants react to insect attacks, notably from Trioza fletcheri in T. arjuna. Studies indicate that extracts from Terminalia arjuna exhibit significant anti-sickling effects. While the pharmacological potential of these extracts is promising, further clinical studies and safety assessments are necessary to validate efficacy and standardisation for therapeutic use. The review examines how Arjuna bark decoction has been used in the Indian subcontinent for centuries to manage anginal pain, hypertension, congestive heart failure, and dyslipidemia. While its potential in cardiovascular diseases warrants further study, recent literature highlights its anti-ischemic, antioxidant, hypolipidemic, and antiatherogenic effects, primarily due to its beneficial phytoconstituents like triterpenoids and flavonoids. Arjuna has shown promise in treating ischemic cardiomyopathy, with no serious side effects reported; however, long-term safety remains unclear.

OpenAlex,mitral regurgitation,Three-Dimensional Echocardiographic Approach to Mitral Valve After Transcatheter Edge-to-Edge Repair,Rishi Kumar; Serena S. Dasani; Kara G.

Shernan; Sergey Karamnov,10.1213/ane.0000000000007756,2025-12-15,Anesthesia & Analgesia,"BACKGROUND: Evaluation of the mitral valve during transcatheter edge-to-edge repair (TEER) for management of mitral regurgitation is commonly guided by intraprocedural interventional transesophageal echocardiography (TEE). The risk of iatrogenic mitral stenosis (MS) remains a concern, particularly in patients requiring multiple clips, since the mitral valve orifice area (MVA) is reduced. The value of conventional flow-based echocardiographic methods to rule out MS is limited by intraprocedural and general anesthesia (GA)-induced hemodynamic variability. This retrospective study introduces the novel adaptation of a 3-dimensional (3D) Orifice Area (3DOA) technique to evaluate post-TEER MVA. We evaluated the degree of agreement between MVAs derived via TEE 3DOA, TEE pressure half-time (PHT), and postprocedure transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) PHT with patients awake. METHODS: TEE and TTE images from 20 adult patients with severe mitral regurgitation undergoing a TEER (MitraClip, Abbott) procedure were retrospectively reviewed. MVAs obtained by MTEE 3DOA and TEE PHT under GA were compared to those acquired with TTE PHT with patients awake. Agreement was assessed via calculation of Bland–Altman 95% limits of agreement and Lin’s concordance correlation coefficients, both with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). RESULTS: There was good agreement between TEE 3DOA-derived MVA measurements under GA and TTE PHT-derived MVA measurements in awake patients, as reflected by Bland–Altman (lower limit of agreement: −.0.45 [95% CI, −.58 to −.31] and upper limit of agreement: 0.26 [95% CI, 0.12–0.4]), and an excellent concordance correlation coefficient value (0.95 [95% CI, 0.86–0.98]). In contrast, agreement between TEE PHT-derived MVA and TTE PHT-derived MVA was weak, with much broader limits of agreement (lower limit of agreement: −1.6 [95% CI, −2.19 to −1.02] and upper limit of agreement: 1.43 [95% CI, 0.84–2.01]) and a weak concordance correlation coefficient value (0.46 [95% CI, 0.02–0.75]). CONCLUSIONS: In this retrospective cohort study, we demonstrated excellent agreement between TEE-3DOA-derived MVA under GA and TTE PHT-derived MVA in awake patients, but not between TEE versus TTE PHT. These findings warrant further validation in larger patient datasets to assess the utility of 3D echocardiographic approaches in evaluating MVA after TEER."

OpenAlex,mitral regurgitation,To study and analyze the association of diabetic retinopathy and its severity with left ventricular dysfunction and hypertrophy among type 2 diabetes mellitus patients – A hospital-based analytical cross-sectional study,Binayak Bibek Das,10.25259/lajo_19_2025,2025-12-13,Latin American Journal of Ophthalmology,"Objectives: Diabetes is among the prevalent contributors to vision loss. Due to similarity in their risk factors and pathophysiology, an association between diabetic retinopathy (DR) and cardiovascular events is expected. The objective of the study was to analyze the effects of different types of DR on left ventricular hypertrophy and dysfunction in patients with type 2 diabetes. Material and Methods: A hospital-based analytical cross-sectional study was conducted from 2020 to 2022 in a tertiary care facility in Tamil Nadu, and it analyzed the data of patients with type 2 diabetes for over 5 years. The participants were divided into two groups: Non-proliferative DR (NPDR) and proliferative DR (PDR). Results: In the present study, with respect to DR, the echo results showed a strong connection between the left ventricular mass, end diastolic diameter, mean E wave/A wave ratio, and mean isovolumetric relaxation time. There was also a correlation between the echo results and the volume of the mitral regurgitation jet. Furthermore, we found that 29 cases with left ventricular dysfunction (LVD) had NPDR, while 32 cases without LVD had PDR ( P &lt; 0.05). Conclusion: Regular screening of all diabetic patients for potential complications, followed by strain echocardiography for high-risk individuals, is crucial for early detection and management. It is a cost-effective strategy for diagnosis, treatment, and prognosis. A key takeaway from this study is the importance of identifying high-risk patients during their asymptomatic stage by assessing microvascular complications."
