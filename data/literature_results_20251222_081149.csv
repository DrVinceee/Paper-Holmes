This study evaluates long-term outcomes of functional TR in TAVR patients.
All patients undergoing TAVR at a single institution from 2011-2022 with complete pre- and post-TAVR echocardiogram follow-up were stratified by pre-procedure TR grade (none, mild, moderate, or severe). Primary outcomes were TR improvement or persistence/progression, and long-term survival. Time-to-event analysis and Cox proportional hazards models were used to compare long-term mortality. Median time to most recent post-TAVR echocardiogram was 12 months, and median clinical follow-up was 24 months.
Of 1,668 TAVR patients in the study cohort, 55% (925) had TR of any severity. TR persisted in 70% of these patients though few ever underwent later TR intervention. Moderate-severe TR was found in 20% (331) patients and persisted or worsened in 47% of cases. Moderate-severe TR was associated with worse unadjusted median survival when compared to patients with no-mild TR (median survival 39 vs. 62 months, p<0.001). Adjusting for age, sex, surgical risk, and other non-cardiac and cardiac comorbidities including mitral regurgitation, moderate-to-severe TR was an independent predictor of worse survival (HR 1.39, p=0.004, Figure 1).
Degree of tricuspid regurgitation is unlikely to improve following TAVR. Moderate-severe TR was a predictor of worse long-term survival. The presence of concurrent moderate or severe TR should be considered when deciding between transcatheter and surgical approaches."

The CAPRI score previously showed promising results in predicting 1-year all-cause mortality, by combining manually measured thoracic aortic calcium (TAC) volume with clinical risk factors. This study introduces an enhanced CAPRI score (eCAPRI), which automates TAC volume measurement and incorporates additional automatically extracted biomarkers from pre-operative CT scans.
TAC volume extraction was automated using a deep learning model trained on 66 patients and evaluated on 1111 CT scans. Additional automatically extracted imaging biomarkers were incorporated into the eCAPRI score, following the original methodology for biomarker selection. The eCAPRI score was trained on 765 pre-TAVI CT scans for one-year mortality prediction and then compared to CAPRI and EuroSCORE Logistic using AUC, bootstrap tests, and calibration curves on 192 CT scans.
Automated TAC segmentation achieved a mean Dice score of 0.777 ± 0.108. The eCAPRI score included body surface area (BSA)-indexed right ventricle volume, BSA-indexed pulmonary arteries max diameter, and abdominal muscles surface at L3 level in addition to automatically computed TAC volume and clinical biomarkers previously identified in the CAPRI score. On the evaluation dataset, eCAPRI showed an AUC of 0.731, outperforming CAPRI (AUC = 0.669) and EuroSCORE Logistic (AUC = 0.588) significantly (p = 0.034), with better calibration.
The eCAPRI score, combining fully automated TAC volume extraction and additional imaging biomarkers, improved one-year mortality prediction over CAPRI and EuroSCORE Logistic. It may support standardized risk stratification in TAVI patients.
Question Can an eCAPRI using imaging biomarkers from pre-operative CT scans improve the prediction of one-year mortality in patients undergoing transcatheter aortic valve replacement? Findings The eCAPRI score, integrating automated TAC volume and additional biomarkers, outperformed CAPRI and EuroSCORE Logistic in predicting one-year mortality (AUC = 0.731, p = 0.034). Clinical relevance The eCAPRI score provides a standardized approach to mortality risk assessment in transcatheter valve procedures. By improving prediction accuracy, it supports more informed clinical decisions and personalized care planning, ultimately contributing to better outcomes for patients undergoing TAVI."

Incorporating the aortic valve measurement GWAS with aortic stenosis GWAS using multitrait analysis of GWAS (MTAG), we identified 166 distinct loci (134 with aortic valve traits, 134 with aortic stenosis and 166 unique loci across all GWAS), including PCSK9 and LDLR.

Using Mendelian randomization, we found evidence supporting a potential causal role for Lp(a) and LDL on aortic valve function. These findings have implications for the early pathogenesis of aortic stenosis and suggest modifiable pathways as targets for preventive therapy."

Atypical forms (such as duplications, vascular rings, or functional obstructions) lie outside standard classifications and they are very uncommon. These variants can confound diagnosis and require adapted strategies.
We retrospectively reviewed 43 EA cases (2018-2021) and identified three with atypical anatomic or functional presentations. Clinical, radiologic, and endoscopic findings were analyzed. Each case demanded a bespoke diagnostic and surgical plan.
Case 1: A neonate with EA/TEF had a long esophageal duplication with an internal septum. The septum was divided and the esophagus anastomosed; although the repair was intact, the infant later died from aspiration pneumonia. Case 2: EA repair was complicated by a right aortic arch (≈6 % of EA/TEF patients). We tunneled the distal esophagus behind the arch for a thoracoscopic anastomosis. A mild stricture was dilated, and the infant tolerated full feeds. Case 3: Initial imaging suggested EA, but endoscopy showed a continuous but narrowed esophagus (likely a motility disorder). Tube feeding led to normalization by 1 month, avoiding surgery. Two infants survived with good feeding outcomes.
These cases (≈7 % of our EA cohort) illustrate that atypical EA variants require individualized management. Detailed imaging and endoscopy were critical to identify unusual anatomy. Tailored thoracoscopic techniques (such as septum resection and retro-arch anastomosis) restored continuity in two infants, while recognizing a motility obstruction in the third obviated surgery. Awareness of atypical anatomy is essential to improve outcomes.

Fractional flow reserve (FFR) may improve the identification of ischaemia-producing lesions compared to angiographic assessment alone, but data in the TAVI population are lacking.
In this multicentric, open-label, randomized, superiority trial with blind adjudication of adverse events, patients with aortic stenosis and intermediate coronary lesions undergoing TAVI were randomized 1:1 to FFR-guided or angiography-guided percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). The trial was registered at ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT03360591). All randomized patients were included in the primary analysis according to the intention-to-treat principle. The primary endpoint was a major adverse cardiac and cerebrovascular event (MACCE) at 12 months of follow-up, defined as a composite of all-cause death, myocardial infarction, ischaemia-driven target vessel revascularization, disabling stroke, or major bleeding.
A total of 320 patients were enrolled across 15 Italian centres. The median age of the patients was 86 years [interquartile range (IQR) 83-90], and the median STS score was 3% (IQR 2-5). The median SYNTAX score was 7 (IQR 5-11). FFR-guided PCI was associated with a significantly lower rate of MACCE at 12 months compared with angiography-guided PCI (8.5% vs 16.0%; hazard ratio .52; 95% confidence interval .27-.99; P = .047). The difference in the primary endpoint was primarily driven by a reduction in all-cause mortality (hazard ratio .31; 95% confidence interval .10-.96). Other components of the composite were numerically lower but not statistically significant.
In patients undergoing TAVI with intermediate coronary lesions, FFR-guided PCI was associated with a reduced risk of MACCE at 12 months. These findings support a physiology-based revascularization strategy in this frail, elderly population."
PubMed,aortic stenosis,Hemodynamic Analysis of Non-uniformly Calcified Aortic Valve Using a Partitioned Fluid-Structure Interaction Framework.,Mishal Raza-Taimuri; Ian Y Chen; Hamid Sadat,10.1007/s13239-025-00811-z,2025-12-19,Cardiovascular engineering and technology,"Calcific Aortic Valve Disease (CAVD) is a common cause for aortic stenosis characterized by the progressive calcification and stiffening of the aortic valve, often leading to significant hemodynamic changes and impaired cardiac function. Several Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulations have been conducted in the literature to provide more detailed analysis of CAVD, but are mainly reliant on uniform calcification. Also, outcomes from current clinical diagnostic techniques do not account for the effect of non-uniform calcification. The purpose of this study is to extend previous CFD simulations to non-uniformly calcified aortic valves and to evaluate the accuracy of clinical diagnostic methods under these conditions.
High-fidelity simulations of non-uniformly calcified aortic valves are performed by coupling fluid and solid solvers using a partitioned fluid-structure interaction (FSI) method for a patient-specific valve model extracted from computed tomography (CT) images. Non-uniform calcification is modelled by varying the elasticity along the leaflet, with several levels of calcification ranging from mild to severe.
Non-uniform calcification alters flow physics, leading in up to 35-50% increase in maximum jet velocity and up to 150-170% rise in TPG compared to the normal valve, significant vortex shedding, extended flow separation regions, and intensified wall shear stress (WSS) fluctuations, especially on the ventricular side of the leaflet. The results indicate that the severity of calcification cannot be accurately predicted by several clinical diagnostic methods, with only effective orifice area (EOA) and maximum opening ratio (MOR) emerging as the reliable predictors.
The progression of non-uniform calcification on the aortic valve leaflets significantly impacts both hemodynamics and leaflet mechanics, with clear alterations in flow patterns and biomechanical responses as calcification severity increases. These findings highlight the need for more accurate diagnostic techniques and may drive the development of improved clinical strategies for the management and treatment of CAVD."

However, comparative data with surgical aortic valve replacement (SAVR) within the Brazilian public health system (SUS) remain limited.
To compare clinical outcomes and perform a cost-analysis of TAVI versus SAVR in SUS patients.
This retrospective, single-center study evaluated clinical outcomes and direct medical costs, using a statistical significance threshold of 5%.
Between 01/2018 and 12/2022, 320 patients (139 TAVI, 181 SAVR) were included. TAVI patients were older (77.9 vs. 64.9 years, p<0.001) and had higher surgical risk (STS 3.62% vs. 1.64%, p<0.001). Mortality (2.9% vs. 5.0%) and stroke rates (1.4% vs. 3.3%) were numerically lower for TAVI, but not statistically significant. In a risk-adjusted composite outcome (death, stroke, re-hospitalization), TAVI showed potential superiority (5.8% vs. 12%, OR 2.68, 95% CI 1.04-7.65, p=0.05), though not statistically significant. TAVI was associated with a shorter hospital stay (2.0 vs. 8.0 days, p<0.001). TAVI's total cost was significantly higher than SAVR's (R$ 55,750.90 [52,345.30; 92,286.80] vs R$ 22,518.10 [19,130.60; 25,875.10, - p<0.001]).
In this study, TAVI displayed similar clinical outcomes compared to SAVR, while being performed on older patients with higher surgical risk. From an economic perspective, costs of TAVI treatment were significantly higher than SAVR, driven mainly by device costs, while in-hospital length of stay was significantly lower. With extended follow-up and reduced procedural costs, TAVI may become a cost-effective option in the SUS."

This study aimed to assess in-hospital costs and outcomes of isolated TAVR versus surgical aortic valve replacement (SAVR) in low-risk patients with AS in real-world practice in Japan.
We retrospectively analyzed 128 low-risk (Society of Thoracic Surgeons [STS] score < 4%) patients with AS who underwent isolated TAVR (n = 80) or SAVR (n = 48) between August 2021 and December 2024 at The University of Osaka Hospital.
Both groups achieved excellent outcomes, with no in-hospital or 30-day mortality. Patients who underwent TAVR had shorter intensive care unit (ICU) stays (1 [1-1] vs. 3 [2-4] days) and shorter postoperative stays (7 [5-11] vs. 14 [11-18] days). However, total in-hospital and combined operative plus postoperative costs were significantly higher for TAVR (5.62 vs. 5.11 million Japanese Yen (JPY), p < 0.0001), (5.29 million vs. 4.80 million JPY, p = 0.0002).

NT-proBNP is a biomarker of decompensation and independent predictor of poor prognosis: its elevation above 5000 pg/ml is associated with high mortality risk. Balloon valvuloplasty is used as a palliative measure and a bridge to radical treatment in patients with high surgical risk. This procedure allows not only to reduce surgical risk by 30-40% but also to transfer the patient from inoperable category to extremely high-risk group. This article presents comprehensive treatment of a 35-year-old patient with critical aortic stenosis complicated by severe heart failure and multiple organ failure. Due to decompensation of chronic heart failure and signs of liver cytolysis, a staged approach was employed. The first stage involved palliative balloon valvuloplasty that was complicated by cardiac arrest with successful cardiopulmonary resuscitation. Eight days later, radical treatment was performed: ascending aortic and aortic valve replacement, thrombectomy from the left ventricle and DeVega tricuspid valve annuloplasty. The patient was discharged. This strategy demonstrated safety and efficacy in a patient with critical aortic stenosis and multiple organ failure, as well as feasibility of radical surgical treatment in patients with high surgical risk."

Advances,"In aortic stenosis (AS), chronic pressure overload of the left ventricle (LV) may sustain an intrinsic, afterload-dependent adaptive response known as the Anrep effect, characterized by increased myocardial contractility and prolonged systolic duration. Whether this response resolves following transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) remains unknown.
The objective of the study was to determine whether the Anrep is chronically activated in severe AS and acutely reverses after TAVR.
We studied 119 patients with high-gradient AS undergoing TAVR. Pressure-volume (PV) loops were analyzed by echocardiography before and 24-hours after intervention. The ""Anrep triad"", defined as elevated afterload (LV end-systolic pressure, effective arterial elastance), enhanced contractility (end-systolic elastance, end-systolic volume at 150 mm Hg), and prolonged systolic ejection time, was assessed. Stroke work (SW), potential energy, PV area (PVA), and mechanical efficiency (SW/PVA) quantified LV energetics.
TAVR reduced afterload (LV end-systolic pressure: 220 vs 143 mm Hg; effective arterial elastance: 2.8 vs 2.0 mm Hg/mL) and contractility (end-systolic elastance: 4.5 vs 2.6 mm Hg/mL; end-systolic volume at 150 mm Hg: 39 vs 53 mL), while shortening systolic duration (systolic ejection time: 390 vs 321 ms) (all P < 0.0001). LV ejection fraction was unchanged (56% vs 56%, P = 0.44). Mechanical workload decreased (SW: 9,017 vs 6,257 mm Hg mL; PVA: 14,261 vs 10,017 mm Hg mL, P < 0.0001), while efficiency was preserved (64% vs 63%, P = 0.101).
In severe AS, the Anrep effect supports output at high energetic cost. TAVR reverses this state, unloading the heart and reducing mechanical demand without altering ejection fraction. This identifies the Anrep as a clinically relevant load-dependent mechanism in AS and highlights its reversibility post-TAVR."

Although TAK primarily affects young adult females, its occurrence in pediatric patients is uncommon and frequently associated with a more aggressive clinical course. We report a severe neurovascular presentation of TAK in a 16-year-old Mexican female patient who developed sudden-onset right hemiparesis, global aphasia, and multiple syncopal episodes. Marked interlimb blood pressure discrepancies were recorded, with upper limbs showing 63/30 mmHg and 66/35 mmHg compared with 127/47 mmHg and 135/52 mmHg in the lower limbs. Initial computed tomography revealed extensive cerebral ischemia involving the right posterior and left middle cerebral arteries. Diagnostic digital subtraction angiography (DSA) performed via a femoral 7-Fr introducer and JB2/pigtail catheters demonstrated complete occlusion of the supra-aortic trunks with collateral filling from intercostal arteries at T2-T4, consistent with type IIB TAK according to the Numano classification. Intra-arterial pressure measurements confirmed a systolic gradient exceeding 20 mmHg across the aortic arch. The patient required vasopressor support to maintain cerebral perfusion and received corticosteroids, anticoagulation, and neurocritical care. Clinical improvement was achieved with partial recovery of right-sided strength and language function. The absence of renal involvement and the coexistence of hidradenitis suppurativa raise potential questions about overlapping autoimmune mechanisms. This report emphasizes the neuroendovascular diagnostic approach and the importance of early vascular imaging and hemodynamic assessment in pediatric TAK presenting with cerebral ischemia."

While generally safe, the procedure can, in rare instances, lead to severe vascular complications.
A 64-year-old male with a prior history of esophagectomy for cancer presented with dysphagia due to an anastomotic stricture. Shortly after undergoing endoscopic balloon dilation, he developed hoarseness. Computed tomography (CT) identified a penetrating aortic ulcer (PAU) with contained rupture and an associated hematoma compressing the left recurrent laryngeal nerve, consistent with Ortner's syndrome. The patient was successfully managed with emergent thoracic endovascular aortic repair (TEVAR). At the three-month follow-up, the aortic stent remained, and his hoarseness had significantly improved.
This rare case of a PAU and Ortner's syndrome following endoscopic dilation underscores the critical importance of vigilance for life-threatening vascular injuries after seemingly routine procedures. It highlights the necessity of considering such complications in the differential diagnosis of post-procedural symptoms and demonstrates the efficacy of endovascular repair as a definitive treatment option."

The classic description of feline subaortic stenosis reflects the presence of a fibrous ring just underneath the aortic valve. The present case has a unique morphological aspect, analogous with a rare human stenosis. A 15-month-old, ESH female presented with an anamnesis consisting of respiratory distress, apathy, and anorexia. The clinical examination displayed a patient with lethargy and severe dyspnea, whilst lung auscultation identified generalized bilateral pulmonary crackles. A systolic IV/VI parasternal murmur was identified on the left thorax, while the murmur intensity on the right side was III/VI. Electrocardiogram showed a sinus rhythm interrupted by ventricular ectopic beats. Two-dimensional (2D) echocardiography revealed a concentric hypertrophy of the left ventricle, with severe left atrium enlargement and mild pleural and pericardial effusion. A subaortic, hyperechoic structure was seen from the right parasternal five-chamber view, accompanied by post-stenotic aortic dilatation. The aortic peak velocity was 5.2 m/s, a feature that characterizes the severe form of aortic stenosis. The cat died shortly after presentation and necropsy was performed. Subaortic stenosis was confirmed on gross examination. The structure that induced stenosis of the left ventricle outflow tract (LVOT) had the appearance of a rudimental valve with moderator bands attached. Microscopically, it contains fibrous and smooth muscular tissue and cardiac conduction fibers. This type of subaortic stenosis resembles the cushion-like pseudovalve type described only in human cardiology. This is the first case describing clinical signs, ECG, echocardiography, and histopathological findings in a cat with cushion-like pseudovalve subaortic stenosis. Fixed subaortic stenosis is a rare congenital disease in cats, which should be taken into consideration in young cats with dyspnea and left ventricular hypertrophy."

Fetoscopic laser photocoagulation (FLP) is the standard treatment, although neonatal outcomes remain variable. This review aimed to summarize immediate, short-term, and long-term neonatal outcomes following FLP for TTTS. A narrative review of published clinical trials, cohort studies, and meta-analyses was conducted, focusing on survival, neurological, cardiovascular, and renal outcomes in neonates following FLP, including comparisons between selective and Solomon techniques. FLP significantly improves survival rates, with at least one twin surviving in 80-90% of cases. However, prematurity remains frequent, with median delivery at 32-34 weeks. Short-term brain injury occurs in 2-8% of cases, and long-term neurodevelopmental impairment affects 3-14% of survivors. Cardiovascular complications, such as pulmonary stenosis and aortic coarctation, develop at follow-up in 8% of cases, while renal dysfunction, primarily in donors, is reduced after FLP compared with expectant management.
FLP substantially enhances survival in TTTS, but neonatal morbidity remains a subject of concern. Persistent neurological, cardiac, and renal complications warrant multidisciplinary, long-term follow-up to optimize developmental outcomes for survivors.
• Fetoscopic laser photocoagulation improves survival in severe twin-to-twin transfusion syndrome compared with amnioreduction.
• Despite improved survival, long-term neurological, cardiac, and renal morbidities remain significant, emphasizing the need for multidisciplinary, prolonged postnatal follow-up of TTTS survivors."

Metformin, an oral anti-diabetic drug, has been suggested to protect valvular interstitial cells (VICs) from calcification, but its role in preventing organic phosphate-induced degeneration in VICs and aortic valve (AV) leaflets remains unclear. Using an ex vivo three-dimensional tissue model, we induced degeneration with organic phosphate-rich conditions in ovine VICs and AV leaflets. Metformin treatment reduced calcium deposition, as assessed by alizarin red staining (VICs: p < 0.0001; AV leaflets: p < 0.05), and preserved reduced opacity of AV leaflet (p < 0.01). It inhibited early osteogenic differentiation, evidenced by reduced alkaline phosphatase activity (VICs: p < 0.0001; AV leaflets: p < 0.05), and mitigated gene expression of myofibroblastic markers. Furthermore, metformin improved proliferation (VICs: p < 0.0001; AV leaflets: p < 0.05), lowered lactate dehydrogenase levels (VICs: p < 0.01; AV leaflets: p < 0.001), preserved extracellular matrix architecture, and ameliorated extracellular matrix remodeling at gene expression level. AMPK phosphorylation was increased in both VICs (28%, p < 0.001) and AV leaflets (21%, p < 0.05) under pro-degenerative conditions and metformin treatment. In conclusion, metformin protects against organic phosphate-induced degeneration in both VICs and AV leaflets, highlighting its therapeutic potential in CAVD."

However, limited data is currently available in pediatric population, partially due to increased technical challenges in this subgroup of patients.
From December 2018 through December 2024, 63 patients with oHCM aged 5 to 18 years underwent conventional septal myectomy (CSM, n=28) or transapical beating-heart septal myectomy (TA-BSM, n=35). All patients had clinical and multimodality imaging evaluations before operation and at follow-up.
Two groups of patients had largely similar baseline clinical characteristics. The median age of patients was 14 (IQR: 11-16) years, and 18 of them (28.6%) were female. The median preoperative left ventricular outflow tract (LVOT) gradient was 58 (IQR: 32-85) mmHg. Around 55.6% of the patients had more than moderate mitral regurgitation (MR, CSM n=12, TA-BSM n=23). Both approaches demonstrated equivalent efficacy for eliminating LVOT obstruction, with a median postoperative LVOT gradient of 8 and 10 mmHg (p=0.852) in the CSM and TA-BSM groups, respectively. The degree of MR decreased to ≤ mild upon follow-up in 9 (75% of 12) in the CSM group, and 20 (87% of 23) in the TA-BSM group (p=0.223). Compared to those in the CSM group, patients in the TA-BSM group experienced shorter durations of surgery (1.0 vs 5.5 hours, p<0.001), mechanical ventilation (3.6 vs 20.5 hours, p<0.001), and ICU stay (23.2 vs 56.5 hours, p=0.001), with less 24-hour drain outputs (100 vs 250 mL, p<0.001). The median weight of resected myocardium was much greater following TA-BSM than that in the CSM group (p=0.013). Two post-CSM patients received permanent pacemaker implantation due to atrioventricular block. One patient required intraoperative thoracoscopic mitral repair due to mitral chordae tendineae fracture during TA-BSM and was discharged from hospital in normal condition. No 30-day mortality or septal perforation occurred in either group of patients.
TA-BSM is a simple, safe, and effective septal reduction treatment for pediatrics with oHCM. Compared with CSM, reduced surgical trauma in the TA-BSM group led to quicker postoperative rehabilitation and recovery. More importantly, with real-time transesophageal echocardiographic guidance and evaluation, the TA-BSM approach can help to overcome the technical difficulties posed by a narrowed transaortic exposure in CSM in pediatric patients."

VWD is the most common inherited bleeding disorder, significantly complicating surgical procedures due to impaired hemostasis. Surgical treatment of patients with VWD, particularly in the context of cardiovascular surgery involving CPB, requires an individualized approach. This includes the optimization of von Willebrand factor (vWF) and factor VIII (FVIII) levels, which are critical to preventing perioperative bleeding. The article describes the perioperative anesthetic management of the patient, emphasizing the importance of hemostasis monitoring, an individualized approach, and personalized dosing of replacement therapy to ensure effective treatment and minimize the risk of bleeding and thromboembolic complications.
A 36-year-old male (181 cm, 92 kg) with type 2 von Willebrand disease and a history of childhood cardiac surgery (atrial septal defect repair, right ventricular outflow tract reconstruction) was admitted for elective aortic valve replacement with a bioprosthesis due to severe aortic regurgitation. Echocardiography revealed residual ventricular septal defect shunting, aortic root dilation, moderate mitral regurgitation, and cusp prolapse. The patient had a significant bleeding history and laboratory evidence of low vWF antigen/activity and FVIII deficiency. Perioperative management included ultrasound-guided vascular access, balanced general anesthesia, moderate hypothermic cardiopulmonary bypass, antifibrinolytic therapy, and tailored hemostatic replacement with vWF concentrate, FVIII, cryoprecipitate, platelets, and plasma. The patient was extubated 6 h after surgery, required minimal transfusion support, and recovered without hemorrhagic or thromboembolic complications. He was discharged on postoperative day 10 in good condition.
Proper management of the perioperative period is identified as a complex challenge for anesthesiologists, requiring a clear understanding of therapeutic mechanisms and their impact on coagulation."

Surgical sponges remain the most frequently retained items, with gauze marker strand retention being an uncommon mechanism.
A 69-year-old male with severe mitral regurgitation and triple-vessel coronary artery disease underwent mitral valve replacement with coronary artery bypass grafting. All surgical counts were verified as correct at the conclusion of surgery. Postoperative chest radiography, however, revealed two linear radio-opaque foreign bodies near the left lower sternum. Mediastinal re-exploration identified two radio-opaque strands, measuring 3.0 cm and 2.0 cm, attached to the left lower chest wall near the internal mammary artery stump. These were confirmed to be detached marker strands from Raytec gauzes. The patient's recovery was uneventful and he was discharged well.
This case illustrates that retained gauze fragments can occur despite correct counts due to fragmentation of radiopaque markers. Surgeons and operating room nurses should inspect gauzes for integrity, maintain vigilance when manipulating sponges in confined operative fields, and consider adjunct technologies such as radiofrequency or barcode tracking. In high-risk surgeries, postoperative imaging may be warranted even with accurate counts to ensure patient safety."

Although the disease most commonly affects the respiratory and lymphatic systems, extrapulmonary manifestations involving the brain and heart also occur. Neurosarcoidosis may cause dysfunction of the cranial nerves, meninges, peripheral nerves, or the pituitary system. Cardiac sarcoidosis may lead to arrhythmias, cardiomyopathy, or heart failure. These specific diagnoses can be challenging because they may masquerade as isolated pathologies. In this clinical vignette, we present a rare case of systemic sarcoidosis with concomitant neurological and cardiac involvement. CASE REPORT A woman in her late 50s with a history of bilateral anterior uveitis presented with stroke-like symptoms. Initial workup was negative for stroke, but imaging identified a prevascular mediastinal lymph node and moderate mitral regurgitation. Lumbar puncture results were consistent with neurosarcoidosis, and steroids initiation led to symptom improvement. The patient subsequently exhibited non-sustained ventricular tachycardia, and further investigation revealed findings consistent with cardiac sarcoidosis. An implantable cardioverter-defibrillator was placed. The patient continued steroids and immunosuppressive therapy with favorable results. CONCLUSIONS Diagnosis of systemic sarcoidosis can be difficult because of its variable presentation. This challenge is enhanced when uncommon organs such as the brain and heart are affected. Thorough evaluation is therefore essential when evaluating systemic diseases."

This study evaluated whether the effects of M-TEER on clinical outcomes vary by baseline health status, as measured by the Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire (KCCQ), and assessed the impact of M-TEER on health status post-randomization.
The RESHAPE-HF2 trial included patients with symptomatic HF and moderate-to-severe vSMR (mean effective regurgitant orifice area .25 cm2; 14% >.40 cm2, 23% <.20 cm2). The impact of baseline KCCQ-clinical summary score (CSS) on the effect of M-TEER on clinical outcomes was assessed using Cox proportional hazards models. Changes post-randomization in health status and responder analyses were performed to assess the odds ratio (OR) of improvement and deterioration in KCCQ scores.
Among 505 patients, M-TEER reduced cardiovascular death or HF hospitalization risk [hazard ratio (HR): .71 (.48-1.05), .50 (.29-.85), and .73 (.38-1.41)] across KCCQ-CSS tertiles of <38.9, 38.9-66.1, and >66.1, respectively (P-trend = .53). Similar results were seen for total HF hospitalization (P-trend = .48). M-TEER improved KCCQ-CSS, total symptom score, and overall summary score at 1, 6, 12, and 24 months compared to medical therapy alone (P < .05 at all time points). More patients in the M-TEER arm experienced a ≥5-point [OR 3.38 (2.09-5.45)], ≥10-point [OR 3.12 (1.93-5.02)], and ≥15-point [OR 3.25 (1.94-5.45)] improvement, and less patients had a ≥5-point deterioration [OR .34 (.19-.57)] in KCCQ-CSS at 6 months. Similar results were seen across other KCCQ domains and all time points.
In patients with HF and moderate-to-severe vSMR, M-TEER showed a consistent trend towards a lower risk of HF hospitalization, with or without cardiovascular death, across all KCCQ-CSS tertiles and improved health status over time."

This study evaluated left ventricular (LV) global longitudinal strain (GLS) in pediatric SCD patients, and its relationship with traditional LV function indices, disease complications, hemolysis markers, and diseasemodifying therapy. We retrospectively analyzed 278 echocardiograms from 185 participants (118 SCD patients, mean age 12.2 years; 67 age- and sex-matched controls, mean age 11.8 years) obtained between 2015 and 2023. Among the SCD cohort, 66.1% had the HbSS genotype, 9.3% had HbSβ°-thalassemia, and 17.8% had HbSβ⁺-thalassemia; the majority (83.9%) were on hydroxyurea. Compared to controls, SCD patients had significantly lower, but still normal, GLS (-21.5% vs. -22.3%; p < 0.001), along with significantly larger chamber diameters, elevated mitral valve E velocity, E/A ratio, and tricuspid regurgitation maximal velocity. Prior stroke (β = 0.9) and avascular necrosis (β = 1.51) were independently associated with worse GLS. The different genotypes did not exhibit significant difference in GLS. The strain values did not correlate with hemolysis markers, suggesting that other mechanisms may underlie myocardial impairment. A significant age-related decline in GLS was detected, with an inflection point at approximately 9.9 years. Longitudinal analysis of LV strain in the SCD cohort demonstrated a small decline from -21.6% to -21.2% over a 3.7-year follow-up period. Finally, pediatric SCD patients exhibit significant cardiac remodeling and diastolic dysfunction with preserved, yet lower, LV GLS, underscoring the need for further research in this population."

Patients eligible to mitral valve (MV) intervention were compared with those deemed ineligible and left on medical therapy. The primary endpoint was 2-year all-cause mortality.
After exclusion for treatment refusal or non-MV surgery, a total of 823 patients were analysed: 662 eligible versus 161 ineligible to MV intervention. Among the 662 eligible patients, 382 (57.7%) underwent transcatheter edge-to-edge repair, 215 (32.5%) MV surgery, 40 (6.0%) transcatheter MV replacement and 25 (3.8%) were either on the waiting list at the end of follow-up (n=12) or had died before intervention (n=13). Ineligible patients had higher surgical risk scores (median EuroSCORE II 4.2% vs. 3.3%; P=0.003; median Society of Thoracic Surgeons mortality risk score 4.3% vs. 3.5%; P=0.023) and more advanced left ventricular (LV) impairment (mean LV ejection fraction 49.7% vs. 56.6%; P<0.001). At 2years, all-cause mortality was significantly higher in ineligible versus eligible patients (36.3% vs. 18.0%; P<0.0001).

The combined strategy of transcatheter edge-to-edge repair of mitral valves and percutaneous mechanical circulatory support devices to treat high-risk patients with severe mitral regurgitation and cardiogenic shock has not been evaluated in randomized controlled trials.
In this multicenter registry we aimed to assess the outcomes (all-cause mortality, other important secondary outcomes included freedom from 30-day cardiac death or cardiac readmission, 30-day all-cause mortality, 30-day cardiovascular mortality, and 30-day MACE events) of the combined strategy of Transcatheter Edge-to-Edge Repair of Mitral Valve and Percutaneous Mechanical Circulatory Support Device to Treat High-Risk Patients with Severe Mitral Regurgitation and Cardiogenic Shock.
This multicenter registry retrospectively evaluated all consecutive patients who presented with severe MR, had persistent cardiogenic shock (CS) despite appropriate therapy (including mechanical circulatory support [MCS]), were turned down for surgery due to operative risk from acuity at presentation, and were considered for TEER by a heart team.
Twenty-one consecutive patients with severe acute or acute-on-chronic MR (anatomy suitable for M-TEER) and CS who were undergoing TEER after surgical turndown were included. Mean age was 63 years (SD ± 12.4), 71 % males, mean Society of Thoracic Surgeons Score predicted risk of mortality (STS-PROM) was 20.1 ± 19.2 % (range: 3.1 to 82), 71 % required mechanical ventilation, 52 % had pulmonary edema, 48 % had index acute myocardial infarction (AMI), 19 % required dialysis, 100 % had Impella™ in place. Immediate procedural outcomes included 100 % technical success, MR grade 1.2+ (mild, p < 0.001), and no events for device-device interaction were observed. The primary outcome of in-hospital all-cause mortality was 4.7 % (1 death from multiorgan failure). All-cause mortality at 30 days was 14 %, and three patients died. The procedural success rate was 81 %, with one readmission for DVT that was treated with oral anticoagulation, and none of the patients required mitral valve reintervention at 30-day follow up.

A computerized tomography scan found severe LA dilation up to 17.8 cm. The patient underwent mitral valve replacement, tricuspid valve repair, and LA reduction. MR is known to result in LA dilation due to increased LA volume and pressure. While large LA sizes have been reported, they are often related to congenital conditions and rarely grow to the size identified in this case. AF and LA dilation both predict adverse outcomes, increasing the risk of thrombus formation in such a large chamber."

Advances,"A cardiac computed tomography (CT)-based mitral annular calcification (MAC) scoring system systematically grades MAC severity, but its correlation with three-dimensional transesophageal echocardiography (3D-TEE) remains unclear.
The authors aimed to compare MAC severity assessment by 3D-TEE vs CT and evaluate their associations with hemodynamic parameters indicative of mitral valve disease.
We analyzed patients with MAC enrolled in the MITRAL (Mitral Implantation of TRAnscathether vaLves) II trial (NCT04408430) across 13 centers undergoing transcatheter mitral valve replacement screening. Core laboratories assessed MAC severity using 3D-TEE and CT. Correlation and agreement were assessed via Spearman and intraclass correlation coefficients. Hemodynamic parameters of mitral stenosis (MS) and regurgitation were obtained from two-dimensional transthoracic echocardiography (2D-TTE) and 3D-TEE. Linear regression evaluated associations with MAC scores.
The analysis included 164 patients (75% females, mean age 75.5 ± 9.1 years). The mean MAC scores were 8.0 ± 0.44 by CT and 8.2 ± 0.45 by 3D-TEE. A modest positive correlation (Spearman correlation coefficient = 0.34; P < 0.001) was observed between 3D-TEE and CT scores, with better agreement in severe MAC. Each unit increase in the 3D-TEE MAC score was associated with a 0.15 cm2 decrease in 3D-TEE mitral valve area, a 0.05 cm2 decrease in 2D-TTE mitral valve area, and an increase in mean diastolic pressure gradient (1 mm Hg by 3D-TEE; 0.96 mm Hg by 2D-TTE). 3D-TEE MAC scores showed no significant correlation with regurgitation parameters. CT-MAC scores showed weak, nonsignificant correlations with both MS and mitral regurgitation.
3D-TEE provides complementary and functionally relevant MAC assessment, correlating with MS severity. It may serve as a useful adjunct to CT in transcatheter mitral valve replacement evaluation, especially when contrast imaging is limited."

The most commonly used devices were the Impella 5.0 (41%, 11/27) and Impella CP (22%, 6/27). Aortic regurgitation (AR) developed in 67% of patients (18/27). Mitral regurgitation (MR) developed in 33% (9/27) of patients, all of which were severe. The median duration of microaxial support was 10 [3-15] days. Overall, 74% (20/27) of patients underwent surgical management, 11% (3/27) underwent transcatheter treatment, and 15% (4/27) were managed nonoperatively. In-hospital/30-day mortality was 11% (3/27), including two deaths among patients with MR (22%) and one in a patient with AR (5.6%) with a pre-existing bioprosthetic aortic valve (p = 0.19). When considering the patients with only native valves and excluding the bioprosthetic aortic valve, mortality was significantly higher among MR patients compared to those with AR (MR: 22%; AR: 0%, p = 0.04). At a median follow-up of 183 [30-365] days, overall survival was 89% (24/27).
AR was more common than MR; however, all MR cases were severe. MR may be associated with worse outcomes. Surgical management appears to be the most frequently employed strategy for valvular injury."

We aimed to investigate the impact of chronic kidney disease (CKD) on survival in patients with functional mitral regurgitation (FMR) undergoing indirect mitral annuloplasty using the Carillon Mitral Contour System.
In a retrospective analysis, a total of 100 consecutive FMR patients were assigned according to baseline renal function into three groups: estimated Glomerular Filtration Rate (eGFR) > 60 mL/min/1.73 m2, eGFR 30-59 mL/min/1.73 m2 and eGFR < 30 mL/min/1.73 m2. At 3- and 12-months follow-up after indirect mitral annuloplasty survival, NYHA classification and transthoracic echocardiography were evaluated.
30 patients revealed a baseline eGFR > 60 mL/min/1.73 m2 (30%), 51 an eGFR 30-59 mL/min/1.73 m2 (51%) and 19 patients an eGFR < 30 mL/min/1.73 m2 (19%). 1-year mortality was significantly higher in eGFR 30-59 mL/min/1.73 m2 and eGFR < 30 mL/min/1.73 m2 compared to a preserved renal function of eGFR > 60 mL/min/1.73 m2 (Log Rank test P value: 0.036). FMR patients with postprocedural acute kidney injury (AKI), defined as an increase in serum creatinine levels ≥0.3 mg/dL within 48 h or ≥1.5 times baseline within 7 days post procedure, showed significantly increased mortality after indirect annuloplasty (Log Rank test P Value: 0.002). Carillon device implantation resulted in FMR reduction and improved NYHA classification at 3- and 12-months follow-up regardless of CKD.
CKD in patients undergoing indirect mitral annuloplasty seems to be a negative predictor of outcome in FMR patients. However, Carillon device implantation improved NYHA and FMR classification regardless of renal function."

The combination of annular dilatation and abnormal annular motion increases mechanical stress on the mitral leaflets, triggering the degenerative process.
This review summarizes the major pathophysiologic, diagnostic and therapeutic measures for the treatment of patients with MAD and an indication for mitral surgery.
The diagnosis is primarily based on non-invasive imaging techniques. Echocardiography is the first choice due to its ability to assess real-time mitral valve function. Cardiac Computed tomography and Magnetic Resonance Imaging provide more comprehensive information on the extend of MAD and the presence of calcifications. Indications for surgical mitral valve treatment are based on current recommendations. In cases with MAD and moderate mitral regurgitation, early intervention may be advocated in the presence of arrhythmogenic MVP. Long-term outcomes after treatment are assessed through multimodal imaging and electrocardiogram monitoring. A ring annuloplasty is an important cornerstone of treatment. Stabilization of the mitral annulus abolishes functional prolapse and increases the antiarrhythmic effect of mitral surgery. However, postoperative arrhythmic burden may persist in some cases, requiring continuous monitoring and sometimes an additional device therapy.
MAD represents a complex anatomical and functional entity associated with diagnostic challenges and rhythm abnormalities. Although the current indications for surgical treatment follow the recommendations for treatment of primary mitral regurgitation, early treatment may be important especially in patients with arrhythmias."

We analyzed 62 patients with secondary MR who underwent TEER. In 32 (51.6%) patients with residual PH after TEER, adverse clinical events were observed more frequently compared with those without residual PH. Multivariate analysis confirmed residual PH as an independent predictor of all-cause death or hospitalization for heart failure.
In patients with secondary MR, residual PH after TEER is an independent predictor of adverse clinical outcomes."

Current American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association guidelines include class I recommendations for intervention for severe primary MR at the onset of symptoms, significant left ventricular (LV) enlargement (end-systolic dimension ≥40 mm), or dysfunction (ejection fraction ≤60%), with a class IIA recommendation for mitral valve repair when performed at an experienced surgical center. Recent data suggest a survival penalty when waiting for class I surgical guideline indications, and novel markers of decompensation are under investigation.
Comprehensive assessment of MR severity using echocardiography is critical, and when warranted, cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) is complementary. Assessment of LV size and function, as well as serial changes in both, is crucial for determining timing of surgery. New-onset atrial fibrillation, left atrial enlargement, pulmonary hypertension, and exercise-induced changes in LV function should also be considered in borderline scenarios. The roles of LV volumes, global longitudinal strain, CMR-derived measures of myocardial dysfunction, and cardiac biomarkers are worthy of further investigation regarding consideration for early surgical intervention.
A more refined approach incorporating assessment of extravalvular cardiac injury, novel imaging markers, and biomarkers is needed to optimize surgical timing in primary MR. Further research is warranted to validate these emerging parameters and refine guidelines to improve patient outcomes."

With a focus on the prevalent psychological complications following the onset of this condition, this study aimed to explore the correlation between antenatal depression and Corona disease anxiety, personality traits, and postpartum depression during the COVID-19 pandemic.                                                           Materials and Methods:                     This cross-sectional descriptive-analytical study investigated women receiving care at health centers affiliated with Kerman University of Medical Sciences during the last month of their pregnancy and the postpartum period in 2022. Following the acquisition of informed consent, participants were assessed using various measures, including demographic and obstetric information, the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale, the Corona Disease Anxiety Scale (CDAS), and the NEO Personality Inventory-Revised during their third trimester of pregnancy. The same group of participants completed the Edinburgh Depression Scale and the Corona Disease Anxiety Scale (CDAS) 4-6 weeks after childbirth.                                                           Results and Discussion:                     There was a significant correlation between family income, unwanted pregnancy as perceived by both the mother and father, and antenatal depression. Additionally, marital satisfaction played a significant role in postpartum depression. Furthermore, antenatal depression was significantly associated with neuroticism, agreeableness, and physical symptoms related to Corona disease anxiety. Personality traits, with the exception of extroversion and conscientiousness, and various domains of Corona disease anxiety, excluding psychological symptoms, were also significantly associated with postpartum depression.                                                           Conclusion:                     During pandemics or epidemics, such as the COVID-19 outbreak, experiencing mental distress during pregnancy can contribute to mental health issues during the postpartum period. This risk is particularly true in individuals with unique personality traits, emphasizing the need for increased focus on mental health within prenatal care during these crises."

Method:                     This cross-sectional study was conducted in Kerman, Iran. Data were collected from patients who visited Afzalipour Hospital in Kerman more than twice during the COVID-19 epidemic from the end of February 2020 to March 21, 2021. We conducted two key analyses: 1. Mixed effect logistic regression was used to check the relationship between the variables and COVID-19 severity. 2. Mixed effect linear regression was used to check the relationship between the variables and the length of stay in the hospital.                                                           Results:                     The findings indicated that the most important risk factors for the severity of COVID-19 were heart diseases (OR=1.67,95%CI:1.20-2.30), increasing age (OR=2.23 for age&gt;54, 95%CI:1.70- 2.90), male gender (OR=1.47,95%CI:1.10-1.96), respiratory diseases other than asthma, and frequency of admission (OR=1.60,95%CI:1.20-2.15). All patients who underwent readmission experienced a shorter duration of hospitalization during their subsequent admission (OR=0.94,95%CI:0.91,0.96) and had a higher mortality rate (30% within 14 days, 26.6% between 14-90 days). Patients readmitted at intervals of 14-90 days and greater than 90 days exhibited lower disease severity compared to those readmitted within the 0-14 day period.                                                           Conclusion:                     Examining readmissions, the severity of COVID-19, and the length of hospital stay in affected patients are important factors for planning and allocating resources for COVID-19 management and treatment. These factors can help policymakers develop effective clinical guidelines for hospitalization or outpatient treatment of COVID-19 patients and contribute to reducing the burden of disease in the community."

Kinovea, as an accessible motion-analysis software, provides both visual and quantitative feedback. However, its application in supporting technique development among beginner athletes remains insufficiently explored. Aim: This study aims to describe the use of Kinovea in biomechanics training and examine its contribution to the awareness of kinematic characteristics and movement techniques among beginner athletes. Methods: A descriptive qualitative design involved 72 beginner athletes aged 18–25 years selected through purposive sampling. Data were collected over 16 weeks through interviews, field observations, and motion video recordings analyzed using Kinovea. Kinematic data focused on joint angles, stride behavior, and movement phases during walking, running, and the flight phase. Qualitative data were analyzed using content analysis with NVivo 12, while kinematic results were interpreted descriptively to identify performance patterns and areas for technical refinement. Result: Kinematic analysis showed coordinated joint-angle patterns across all phases. Walking analysis identified arm swing angles of 50.9°–58.8° and leg separation angles of 64.3°–67.2°, indicating a stable gait rhythm. The running analysis revealed knee angles of 68.8°–69.8° and elbow angles of 87.6°–89.1°, indicating efficient propulsive mechanics. The flight phase demonstrated knee angles of 81.2°–87.8° and elbow angles of 80.4°–88.3°, suggesting effective momentum use and postural stability. These measurements supported stride-efficiency assessment and technique evaluation. Qualitative findings revealed that Kinovea enabled athletes to interpret movement phases and identify technical inefficiencies through slow-motion and frame-by-frame visualization. Conclusion: Kinovea supports basic motion analysis by providing clear kinematic information and helping beginner athletes observe and refine their movement techniques. The findings also offer practical value for coaches by enabling more precise identification of inefficient patterns and guiding targeted corrections during early-stage training."

As such, this study aimed to further evaluate the diagnostic utility of ePLAR in a large cohort of patients with PHTN. Methods and Results All RHCs between 2018-2023 across three tertiary centers were retrospectively reviewed. Patients with PHTN were characterized as pre-capillary or post-capillary (isolated or combined). Concurrent ePLAR was calculated. ROC analysis evaluated the accuracy of ePLAR in detecting pre-capillary PHTN. Overall, 2235 patients had PHTN by RHC, mean age 63.5 ± 14.7 years, 53.5% male. Of these, 43.3% had pre-capillary PHTN. ROC analysis demonstrated ePLAR to have good accuracy in detection of pre-capillary PHTN (AUC 0.760), with a cutoff of 0.20m/s demonstrating a sensitivity and specificity of 77% and 60% respectively. This persisted on sensitivity analysis for contemporaneous investigations and for right ventricular function. Conclusions In this large cohort, ePLAR was validated as an accurate tool for identifying patients with pre-capillary PHTN. This widely available, non-invasive, and reproducible parameter can have an important role in the work up of PHTN and may guide the need for invasive testing."

Methods: This prospective single-center cohort study included 101 patients with chronic heart failure (mean age 62 ± 15.5 years; 70.3% male) with paroxysmal or persistent drug-refractory atrial fibrillation who underwent atrioventricular node ablation and CRT-D implantation. All patients received optimal medical therapy before and after undergoing the procedure. Predictors of 5-year mortality were assessed using exploratory machine-learning methods, including random forest and Shapley additive explanations. Results: During 5-year follow-up, 13 cardiovascular deaths were recorded. Five key predictors of mortality were identified: left ventricular ejection fraction, 6 min walk distance, mean pulmonary artery pressure, systolic relaxation coefficient, and degree of mitral regurgitation. The exploratory predictive model showed high accuracy (92%) in terms of classifying the outcomes. Conclusions: Atrioventricular node ablation (AVNA) combined with CRT-D was associated with the observed long-term clinical outcomes observed in patients with drug-refractory tachysystolic atrial fibrillation. The exploratory machine learning analysis identified key mortality-associated factors, which may support future efforts in personalized risk stratification and hypothesis generation. The combination of AVNA and CRT-D was associated with the observed long-term outcomes in this real-world cohort."

Advances in endoscopic visualization and surgical instrumentation have enhanced precision while minimizing trauma, improving both functional and esthetic outcomes. This study presents a single-center experience with total endoscopic mitral valve repair (MVR) performed using two- or three-dimensional video-assisted technology. Methods: Between October 2022 and September 2025, 239 patients underwent total endoscopic MVR at our institution. Demographic, operative, and postoperative data were collected and analyzed. Results: Median age was 63 years, with 64.4% male. Median logistic EuroSCORE and EuroSCORE II were 2.53 and 0.83, respectively. Most patients were NYHA class II (54.4%), and 47.7% had pulmonary hypertension. Mitral annuloplasty was performed in 99.2% of cases; 78.6% received Gore-Tex chordae, 6.3% underwent posterior leaflet resection, and 11.7% edge-to-edge repair. Conversion to sternotomy occurred in 0.4%. In-hospital mortality was 1.3%; stroke occurred in 0.4%. Postoperative atrial fibrillation developed in 26.8%, while major complications such as sepsis (2.1%) and renal failure requiring dialysis (1.3%) were infrequent. Median ventilation time was 5 h, ICU stay was 2 days, and hospital stay was 7 days. Pre-discharge echocardiography showed ≤mild regurgitation in 99.2%. Conclusions: Total endoscopic MVR using two- or three-dimensional video assistance is safe, feasible, and yields excellent clinical, functional, and cosmetic results, with low morbidity and rapid recovery."

However, some patients with severe aortic stenosis exhibit eccentric remodeling with enlarged left ventricular cavities, enabling a normal flow, low ejection fraction ( NF ‐ LEF ) phenotype. We assessed the prevalence, hemodynamic characteristics, and post‐transcatheter aortic valve implantation outcomes of NF ‐ LEF . Methods In this substudy of the COMPARE‐TAVI 1 trial, 979 patients undergoing transfemoral transcatheter aortic valve implantation were stratified by left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) (&lt; or ≥50%) and stroke volume index (&lt; or ≥35 mL/m 2 ) into 4 groups: normal flow, normal LVEF, NF‐LEF, low flow, normal ejection fraction, and low flow, low ejection fraction. Results NF‐LEF was observed in 10.7% of patients. Reduced LVEF was associated with previous myocardial infarction, pacemakers, New York Heart Association class &gt;2, atrial fibrillation, moderate or worse mitral regurgitation, and larger left ventricular cavities ( P &lt;0.001) with eccentric hypertrophy ( P =0.004). Compared with low‐flow, low‐ejection fraction, patients with NF‐LEF more frequently had moderate or worse aortic regurgitation ( P =0.007), whereas low flow, low ejection fraction showed poorer diastolic indices, suggesting diastolic dysfunction with high left ventricular filling pressures. Patients with low flow, normal ejection fraction were the most symptomatic and showed less improvement in 6‐minute walk distance at 1 year compared with normal flow, normal ejection fraction. During follow‐up, both low‐flow groups demonstrated significant increases in stroke volume index ( P &lt;0.001), whereas LVEF also improved among patients with reduced LVEF ( P &lt;0.001). Conclusions NF‐LEF is a prevalent aortic stenosis phenotype characterized by preserved flow despite reduced LVEF, likely driven by eccentric remodeling with moderate or worse aortic regurgitation and more favorable diastolic properties, with similar survival and time‐to‐event outcomes across phenotypes after transcatheter aortic valve implantation at long‐term follow‐up. Despite higher comorbidity burdens, patients with NF‐LEF showed functional and clinical improvements comparable with normal flow, normal ejection fraction, indicating a severe aortic stenosis phenotype."

Understanding the mechanism of MR, whether primary, due to intrinsic valve abnormalities, or secondary, resulting from atrial or ventricular remodeling, is essential for optimal management. Echocardiography, particularly advanced modalities such as three-dimensional imaging and strain analysis, plays a central role in this process. It allows accurate quantification of MR severity, detailed characterization of valve and ventricular anatomy, and assessment of remodeling, all of which are critical for determining the optimal timing for intervention. Beyond diagnosis, echocardiography is indispensable in guiding therapy selection: it informs surgical planning by defining leaflet pathology for repair versus replacement strategies, and directs transcatheter interventions by guiding interatrial septal puncture, catheter orientation, and device deployment in real time. While surgery remains the gold standard for primary MR, transcatheter approaches including edge-to-edge repair and emerging mitral valve replacement are increasingly relevant, particularly in patients at high surgical risk or with complex anatomy. This review emphasizes the pivotal role of echocardiography in the pre-procedural assessment of MR, highlighting its ability to integrate anatomical, functional, and hemodynamic information to guide patient-tailored therapeutic strategies and optimize outcomes within a Heart Team framework."

The review examines the potential of Terminalia arjuna leaf gall in SCD treatment, identifying its main bioactive compound, 5-Hydroxymethylfurfural, known for its anti-sickling properties. Galls form when plants react to insect attacks, notably from Trioza fletcheri in T. arjuna. Studies indicate that extracts from Terminalia arjuna exhibit significant anti-sickling effects. While the pharmacological potential of these extracts is promising, further clinical studies and safety assessments are necessary to validate efficacy and standardisation for therapeutic use. The review examines how Arjuna bark decoction has been used in the Indian subcontinent for centuries to manage anginal pain, hypertension, congestive heart failure, and dyslipidemia. While its potential in cardiovascular diseases warrants further study, recent literature highlights its anti-ischemic, antioxidant, hypolipidemic, and antiatherogenic effects, primarily due to its beneficial phytoconstituents like triterpenoids and flavonoids. Arjuna has shown promise in treating ischemic cardiomyopathy, with no serious side effects reported; however, long-term safety remains unclear.

The risk of iatrogenic mitral stenosis (MS) remains a concern, particularly in patients requiring multiple clips, since the mitral valve orifice area (MVA) is reduced. The value of conventional flow-based echocardiographic methods to rule out MS is limited by intraprocedural and general anesthesia (GA)-induced hemodynamic variability. This retrospective study introduces the novel adaptation of a 3-dimensional (3D) Orifice Area (3DOA) technique to evaluate post-TEER MVA. We evaluated the degree of agreement between MVAs derived via TEE 3DOA, TEE pressure half-time (PHT), and postprocedure transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) PHT with patients awake. METHODS: TEE and TTE images from 20 adult patients with severe mitral regurgitation undergoing a TEER (MitraClip, Abbott) procedure were retrospectively reviewed. MVAs obtained by MTEE 3DOA and TEE PHT under GA were compared to those acquired with TTE PHT with patients awake. Agreement was assessed via calculation of Bland–Altman 95% limits of agreement and Lin’s concordance correlation coefficients, both with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). RESULTS: There was good agreement between TEE 3DOA-derived MVA measurements under GA and TTE PHT-derived MVA measurements in awake patients, as reflected by Bland–Altman (lower limit of agreement: −.0.45 [95% CI, −.58 to −.31] and upper limit of agreement: 0.26 [95% CI, 0.12–0.4]), and an excellent concordance correlation coefficient value (0.95 [95% CI, 0.86–0.98]). In contrast, agreement between TEE PHT-derived MVA and TTE PHT-derived MVA was weak, with much broader limits of agreement (lower limit of agreement: −1.6 [95% CI, −2.19 to −1.02] and upper limit of agreement: 1.43 [95% CI, 0.84–2.01]) and a weak concordance correlation coefficient value (0.46 [95% CI, 0.02–0.75]). CONCLUSIONS: In this retrospective cohort study, we demonstrated excellent agreement between TEE-3DOA-derived MVA under GA and TTE PHT-derived MVA in awake patients, but not between TEE versus TTE PHT. These findings warrant further validation in larger patient datasets to assess the utility of 3D echocardiographic approaches in evaluating MVA after TEER."

Severe mitral and tricuspid regurgitation were strongly associated with worse outcomes, while valve replacement and mean transvalvular gradient ≥ 40 mmHg emerged as protective factors."

Due to similarity in their risk factors and pathophysiology, an association between diabetic retinopathy (DR) and cardiovascular events is expected. The objective of the study was to analyze the effects of different types of DR on left ventricular hypertrophy and dysfunction in patients with type 2 diabetes. Material and Methods: A hospital-based analytical cross-sectional study was conducted from 2020 to 2022 in a tertiary care facility in Tamil Nadu, and it analyzed the data of patients with type 2 diabetes for over 5 years. The participants were divided into two groups: Non-proliferative DR (NPDR) and proliferative DR (PDR). Results: In the present study, with respect to DR, the echo results showed a strong connection between the left ventricular mass, end diastolic diameter, mean E wave/A wave ratio, and mean isovolumetric relaxation time. There was also a correlation between the echo results and the volume of the mitral regurgitation jet. Furthermore, we found that 29 cases with left ventricular dysfunction (LVD) had NPDR, while 32 cases without LVD had PDR ( P &lt; 0.05). Conclusion: Regular screening of all diabetic patients for potential complications, followed by strain echocardiography for high-risk individuals, is crucial for early detection and management. It is a cost-effective strategy for diagnosis, treatment, and prognosis. A key takeaway from this study is the importance of identifying high-risk patients during their asymptomatic stage by assessing microvascular complications."
