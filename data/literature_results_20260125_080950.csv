PubMed,aortic stenosis,Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement for Mixed Aortic Valve Disease: An Updated Meta-Analysis and Systematic Review.,George G Kidess; Mohammad Hamza; Jawad Basit; Mowaffak Alraiyes; M Chadi Alraies,10.1016/j.amjms.2026.01.011,2026-01-22,The American journal of the medical sciences,"Mixed aortic valve disease (MAVD) is defined by the presence of concurrent aortic stenosis (AS) and aortic regurgitation (AR). Transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) is effective in MAVD patients with mortality rates comparable to pure aortic stenosis (PAS). While most TAVR complications also occur at similar rates between the MAVD and PAS populations, recent studies have shown conflicting results.
A systematic literature review was conducted on PubMed and Embase for studies on the outcomes of TAVR in MAVD from inception until May 2024. Primary outcomes were short- and long-term mortality. Secondary outcomes were paravalvular regurgitation (PVR), vascular and bleeding complications, pacemaker implantation, and cerebrovascular complications. A random-effects model was used to pool risk ratios (RR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI).
Eleven observational studies, including 133,558 patients, were included in the analysis. There were no significant differences in primary endpoints (p>0.05). MAVD was associated with a higher risk of paravalvular regurgitation (RR: 1.29, 95% CI: 1.07-1.55) and higher risk of vascular complications (RR: 1.20, 95% CI: 1.01-1.44). No significant differences were noted in other secondary outcomes (p>0.05), although there was a nonsignificant trend towards a decreased risk of cerebrovascular complications associated with TAVR in MAVD patients.
TAVR is an intervention with similar mortality and complication risk in MAVD and PAS patients. Future research is needed to further clarify the outcomes of TAVR in patients with MAVD, especially regarding cerebrovascular complications, long-term mortality, and the association of paravalvular regurgitation with mortality."

Advances,"Homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (HoFH) is a rare genetic disorder characterized by extreme elevations in low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels and premature cardiovascular disease.
The objective of this study was to assess the prevalence, clinical presentation, and current therapeutic approaches for aortic stenosis in Canadian patients with HoFH.
Demographic data, lipid profiles, and genetic testing results for patients with HoFH were collected prospectively since 2008. Reports from echocardiography, cardiac catheterization, and surgical or transcatheter interventions involving the aortic valve and/or ascending aorta were retrieved from medical records.
Data were available for 63 patients with either a clinical diagnosis (n = 14, 22.2%) or genetic confirmation (n = 49, 77.8%) of HoFH. The median age at diagnosis was 14.0 years (Q1-Q3: 6.0 to 31.0), the median highest recorded low-density lipoprotein cholesterol level was 13.0 mmol/L (Q1-Q3: 10.6-16.3), and 17 patients (27.0%) developed moderate-to-severe aortic stenosis. Extensive calcification of the aortic valve and ascending aorta, combined with severe valvular and/or supravalvular stenosis and coronary ostial stenosis, necessitated complex and often consecutive surgical procedures. Six transcatheter aortic valve replacements were performed in 4 patients, 4 of which failed. Thirteen patients (20.6%) underwent at least 1 surgical aortic valve procedure. Patients developed aortic stenosis at a young age despite intensive treatment, including lipoprotein apheresis started at an early age.
Moderate-to-severe aortic stenosis was observed in 27.0% of patients in the Canadian HoFH Registry, with 20.6% requiring invasive intervention. The severe aortic phenotype associated with HoFH requires complex, multidisciplinary surgical management in specialized centers with appropriate expertise."

Comparative outcome data for balloon-expandable valves (BEV) and self-expanding valves (SEV) in this population remain scarce.
This retrospective single-center study evaluated 246 consecutive subjects with left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) < 50% who underwent transfemoral TAVR between January 2015 and June 2025. Clinical, echocardiographic, and procedural characteristics were compared between BEV (n = 96) and SEV (n = 150) recipients. Long-term all-cause mortality served as the primary endpoint.
Individuals treated with BEV were older (78.8 +- 7.9 vs. 75.7 +- 9.8 years; P = 0.019) and demonstrated higher EuroSCORE II (European System for Cardiac Operative Risk Evaluation II) values (24.9 +- 6.2% vs. 22.2 +- 15.8%; P = 0.01). Periprocedural and in-hospital clinical outcomes, including mortality, vascular complications, and pacemaker requirement, were comparable between groups. SEV implantation yielded lower post-procedural transvalvular gradients (mean 7.8 +- 4.0 mmHg vs. 9.6 +- 4.1 mmHg; P = 0.001). Although crude mortality was observed more frequently among BEV patients (50.0% vs. 36.0%; P = 0.041), Kaplan-Meier survival curves showed no survival difference (log-rank P = 0.92). In multivariable Cox regression, predictors of long-term mortality included older age (hazard ratio [HR] 1.05; P = 0.007), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) (HR: 2.64; P < 0.001), coronary artery disease (HR: 2.08; P = 0.018), lower serum albumin (HR: 0.63; P = 0.011), and lower hemoglobin (HR: 0.84; P = 0.023); valve type was not predictive.
In patients with LVSD undergoing TAVR, BEV and SEV provided comparable procedural and long-term outcomes. Although SEV yielded lower postoperative gradients, valve type did not affect survival. Future studies with larger samples and higher use of new-generation devices are warranted to refine valve selection in this high-risk group."

We aimed to determine the incidence and risk factors for CVE at 30 days and 1 year after TAVI in a large, real-world patient cohort and evaluate the association of these events with all-cause mortality at 1 year.
All consecutive patients undergoing TAVI at a single centre between April 2008 and February 2024 were included in the analysis. CVE were defined as a composite of stroke and transient ischaemic attack.
One thousand and three patients (mean age 81.8 ± 7.0 years, 52.6% male, median EuroSCORE II 6% [Q1 = 3.51%; Q3 = 10.9%]) underwent TAVI with a self-expandable valve (SEV) (n = 275; 27.4%) or balloon-expandable valve (BEV) (n = 728; 72.6%). The cumulative incidence of CVE was 3.6% (95% confidence interval (95% CI) = [2.6%; 4.9%], n = 36) at 30 days (77.8% within 48 h) and 6.2% (95% CI = [4.8%; 7.8%], n = 62) at 1 year. Risk factors associated with a lower risk of CVE at 30 days included BEV vs. SEV (OR 0.32 [0.16-0.63], p = 0.0009) and larger baseline aortic valve area (AVA) (ORUnit = 0.1 cm2 0.74 [0.61-0.91], p = 0.0035), while the risk was higher in the case of new-onset atrial fibrillation (AF) (OR 3.19 [1.18-8.59], p = 0.0218), diabetes (OR 2.00 [1.01-3.97], p = 0.0484), and conversion to sternotomy (OR 16.57 [4.62-59.48], p < 0.0001). Analysis at 1-year follow-up identified the same associations. Finally, the occurrence of CVE significantly increased 1-year all-cause mortality (OR 2.44 [1.32-4.50], p = 0.0045).
CVE after TAVI were associated with double the odds of 1-year all-cause mortality. Risk factors associated with CVE include the use of a SEV, new-onset AF, diabetes, conversion to sternotomy, and a smaller AVA."

This shift raises important questions about valve durability, reintervention strategies, and long-term outcomes compared with surgical aortic valve replacement. Younger patients often present with unique anatomical challenges, including bicuspid aortic valves, and are expected to outlive their first valve prosthesis, making lifetime management a central concern. While new valve technologies show promise, long-term data remain limited. Careful patient selection, shared decision-making, and ongoing prospective studies are essential to guide the role of TAVR in this population."

Digital health,"There is a lack of studies investigating the pathophysiologic and phenotypic distinctiveness of aortic stenosis (AS). This heterogeneity has important implications for identifying optimal intervention timing and potential medical management. This study seeks to identify phenogroups of AS using unsupervised machine learning to improve risk stratification.
A total of 349 patients with asymptomatic AS from the PROGRESSA study were included in this analysis. Echocardiographic, clinical and blood sample data were used in the unsupervised clustering process. Longitudinal echocardiographic data were used to evaluate AS progression. Five clusters of patients were revealed using 18 variables selected by an unsupervised machine learning algorithm. Amongst them, aortic valvular phenotype, mean gradient, peak jet velocity (Vpeak), and left ventricle stroke volume were selected as discriminatory variables. Following the clustering process, characteristics differed between clusters, including age, body mass index, and sex ratio (all P < 0.001). Of note, cluster 1 showed higher AS severity at baseline with significantly higher initial Vpeak (344 [314; 376] cm/s) and calcium score (1257 [806; 1837] UA) (P < 0.001). Patients from cluster 1 had a faster AS progression (progression of Vpeak = 22 [9; 39] cm/s/year), and calcium score (213 [111; 307] UA/year) (P < 0.001). Cluster 1 was also associated with a higher composite risk of mortality and aortic valve replacement when adjusted for age, sex, and baseline AS severity (P < 0.001).
Artificial intelligence-guided phenotypic classification revealed 5 distinct groups and enhanced risk stratification of patients with AS. This approach may be useful to optimize and individualize medical and interventional management of AS."

While Impella-supported high-risk PCI (HRPCI) has demonstrated improved outcomes, its safety in patients with AS remains inadequately established.
We evaluated the effectiveness and safety of Impella support in patients with AS undergoing HRPCI.
Patients from the PROTECT III study (NCT04136392), a single-arm, FDA-audited, multicenter investigation of Impella-supported HRPCI, were assessed. AS severity was classified as none/trivial, mild, moderate, or severe. The primary outcome was 90-day major adverse cardiac and cerebrovascular events [MACCE, defined as the composite of all-cause mortality, MI, stroke/transient ischemic attack (TIA), and revascularization]. Secondary outcomes included in-hospital complications, stroke/TIA, and vascular complications requiring surgery.
Of the 594 patients with available echocardiographic data, 490 had none/trivial AS, while 34, 24, and 46 had mild, moderate, or severe AS, respectively. Patients with AS were older, had fewer incidences of diabetes, were more likely to have left main disease, and had higher left ventricular ejection fraction. Severely calcified lesions and atherectomy were more frequent among patients with moderate or severe AS. No significant differences were observed in PCI-related complications, stroke/TIA, and 30-day or 90-day MACCE across AS severity groups. However, transfusion rates were higher in patients with AS.
In patients undergoing Impella-supported HRPCI, 90-day MACCE and PCI-related complications were similar across all levels of AS severity. These findings suggest that the procedure is safe in this complex, high-risk population.

We aimed to evaluate the impact of a CVC in managing the treatment pathway of patients undergoing TAVI across Europe before and after implementing 8 Benchmark best practices.
The BENCHMARK registry (ClinicalTrials NCT04579445) was a multicenter international study of patients with severe symptomatic aortic stenosis undergoing TAVI with balloon-expandable valves across 28 European centers. Primary outcomes were hospital and intensive care length of stay (LoS). The secondary outcome was 30-day patient safety.
Of 2323 patients, 1262 were treated at centers without a pre-existing CVC and 1061 at centers with a pre-existing CVC; propensity matching resulted in 891 matched pairs. The total procedural time was significantly reduced in both groups (p < 0.001) after implementing Benchmark best practices. Hospital LoS was lower before Benchmark when a CVC was present and was significantly shorter in both groups following implementation (p < 0.001), as was the critical care LoS (p < 0.001). The presence of a CVC did not affect safety outcomes but was associated with a reduced risk of major vascular bleeding when combined with Benchmark best practices. Patient satisfaction was higher in centers with a pre-existing CVC (p < 0.001).
The addition of a CVC to the multidisciplinary team and their sustained contributions to processes of care align with the implementation of Benchmark practices, significantly decrease the health service requirements of TAVI patients, and are associated with improved patient-reported experiences."

However, the decision to continue anticoagulation therapy during the TAVR perioperative period and the optimal regimen for postoperative anticoagulation therapy remain debatable.
We searched the PubMed, EMBASE, MEDLINE, and Cochrane Library databases from their date of establishment to September 2024. We evaluated the choice of anticoagulation regimen in the TAVR perioperative and postoperative period. The primary outcomes were stroke, major bleeding, all-cause death, and net adverse clinical events (NACEs). The secondary outcomes were any bleeding, life-threatening bleeding, thrombotic events, and cardiovascular death. We conducted a meta-analysis with a RR and 95% CI. We performed subgroup analyses based on the follow-up duration, study design, and whether oral antiplatelet drugs (OAP) were used.
We compared four studies with peri-procedural continuation or discontinuation of oral anticoagulants (OACs). We did not observe a difference between the two groups with major bleeding, stroke, all-cause death, and NACEs (P > 0.05). Seventeen studies compared the effects of direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) and vitamin K antagonists (VKAs) after TAVR. The risk of NACEs (RR: 0.84, 95% CI :0.71-0.99, P = 0.04) and cardiovascular death (RR: 0.78, 95% CI: 0.69-0.87, P < 0.0001) was significantly lower in the DOACs than in the VKAs, but there were no statistically significant differences between the two groups with other outcomes. In the subgroup analysis, the beneficial effects of DOACs on NACEs were observed in the early postoperative (P < 0.05). During the long-term follow-up time after TAVR, DOACs had a lower risk of all-cause mortality and cardiovascular death compared to VKAs (P < 0.05), but an increased risk of any bleeding (P < 0.05). In RCTs, the risk of any bleeding owing to DOACs was higher (P < 0.05). In cohort studies, DOACs led to lower NACEs and cardiovascular death (P < 0.05). When administered in combination with OAP drugs, DOACs posed a lower risk for cardiovascular death and all-cause death than VKAs (P < 0.05). If not administered in combination with OAP drugs, DOACs posed a lower risk for all-cause death (P < 0.05).
In patients undergoing TAVR with established indications for OACs, periprocedural continuation of OACs may offer comparable clinical outcomes to temporary discontinuation. Furthermore, DOACs after TAVR appear to be associated with more favorable clinical outcomes than VKAs, although this benefit must be weighed against a potentially increased risk of bleeding. Further large-scale RCTs are warranted to validate these findings."

Despite advances, stroke remains a serious complication, impacting morbidity, mortality, and long-term cognitive function, thus the need for effective prevention strategies.
Based on a targeted review of the PubMed literature, this review addresses mechanisms and risk factors for stroke after TAVR and evaluates current preventive approaches. Cerebral embolic protection devices (CEPDs), particularly the Sentinel system, are discussed alongside other devices. Antithrombotic strategies before, during, and after TAVR are also reviewed, emphasizing the balance between thromboembolic protection and bleeding risk in an elderly population.
While some studies suggest CEPDs may reduce stroke, randomized trials have not confirmed broad and robust benefit, and high cost limits routine adoption. Future work should focus on high-risk subgroups, device refinement, and large-scale trials. For now, individualized antithrombotic therapy and selective CEPD use remain central to stroke prevention in TAVR."

Nested, longitudinal, qualitative substudy of an ongoing randomised controlled trial (RCT) (NCT04204915) testing early intervention (EI) versus watchful waiting (WW) in patients with asymptomatic severe AS.
Six select UK sites of the RCT.
Select participants of the RCT, their next-of-kin and some who declined RCT participation.
73 interviews were conducted, with 41 participants.Few knew much about AS before diagnosis. Uncertainty and the need for reliable information regarding symptoms and progress was a significant problem.While some expressed unease at a major intervention for an asymptomatic condition, there were no outright objections to the idea.Those who declined participation in the RCT did so for personal reasons, for example, their home circumstances did not permit the required period of recovery or they felt too old to risk intervention.Reasons for accepting early intervention included the belief that the condition was serious and likely to deteriorate, and so better to have the intervention before such deterioration, as well as avoiding long waiting lists. Trusting clinicians' judgement played a part in some decisions. Patients also wanted choice in the type of intervention received.The longitudinal interviews (n=32) showed satisfaction in the early intervention group despite some problems in the the early recovery phase, especially for those undergoing surgical AVR.
Where evidence supports major intervention for an asymptomatic condition, patients are likely to accept the offer, although personal circumstances play an important role in decision-making. Where a condition is not well known to the public, such as AS, patients rely on clinicians and other resources to help decide. Liaison with patient groups in developing shared decision-making resources may help with complex decisions.

It demonstrates that not all aortic diseases are amenable to endovascular treatment and that open surgical treatment remains highly important, especially in younger patients with hereditary aortic diseases."

Cardiovascular Imaging,"Assessing cardiac function is critical for managing cardiovascular disease, guiding treatment, monitoring progression, and risk stratification. While left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) is firmly established, it has limitations. Myocardial contraction fraction (MCF) - the ratio of stroke volume to myocardial volume, is simple to compute without additional analysis and offers a promising alternative to LVEF.
MCF was assessed across four datasets spanning healthy controls and chronic structural cardiac disease, with direct comparison to LVEF. Association between age, sex and MCF were investigated in 3,541 healthy subjects from the UK Biobank and sex-specific reference ranges derived. Several cohorts were recruited to investigate the discriminative power of MCF and LVEF between health and physiological adaption (n=278 veteran athletes), pathological hypertrophy (hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, amyloid, Fabry, severe aortic stenosis, and hypertension; n=633) and dilatation (n=103 dilated cardiomyopathy). Ability to track disease severity was assessed by looking at 41,558 subjects from the UK Biobank. Finally, prognostication was assessed on 1,277 consecutive patients from an independent external dataset. All images were analysed using the same validated AI algorithm.
MCF varied with sex (mean MCF: 0.94 male; 1.1 female) but not age. Sex-specific reference ranges were established: [0.68-1.20] for male, [0.82-1.38] for female. MCF decreased in pathological disease (e.g. mean MCF: 0.72 HCM; 0.69 severe AS; 0.5 amyloid; 0.9 hypertension) but there was no significant decrease in LVEF other than in amyloid (mean EF: 76% HCM; 64% severe AS; amyloid 56%; 65% hypertension). Both MCF and EF decreased in DCM (EF 34%; MCF 0.58). MCF decreased with worsening hypertension, whereas LVEF increased (P<0.05). MCF had superior prognostic ability to LVEF (MCF vs LVEF: HR=0.772 vs HR=0.816; χ²=198 vs χ²=151; p<0.001).
We established MCF reference ranges, showing superior performance for detecting early disease and tracking progression compared to LVEF. MCF offers enhanced prognostic utility, complementing established metrics of LV function."

This study sought to investigate 5-year clinical outcomes in patients with severe aortic stenosis with a small annulus compared with those with a large annulus following transcatheter aortic valve replacement with newer-generation balloon-expandable valves.
A total of 3182 patients with aortic stenosis treated with balloon-expandable valves were divided into small-annulus (≤430 mm2) and large-annulus (>430 mm2) groups. A 1:1 propensity-matched analysis was performed to adjust baseline differences. The primary end point was all-cause death at 5-year follow-up. Secondary end points included heart failure hospitalization, bioprosthetic valve failure, and aortic valve reintervention.
Among 533 matched pairs, compared with the large-annulus group, the small-annulus group had higher rates of aortic valve mean gradients ≥20 mm Hg (14.1% versus 2.9%; P<0.001) and severe prosthesis-patient mismatch (9.8% versus 5.2%; P=0.019). At 5 years, there were no significant differences in all-cause death (hazard ratio, 0.75 [95% CI, 0.52-1.09]; P=0.13). The incidence of heart failure rehospitalization, bioprosthetic valve failure, and aortic valve reintervention were similar between groups. Both groups achieved similar sustained improvements in New York Heart Association functional class and Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire-Overall Summary scores.
Despite higher transvalvular gradients and a greater rate of severe prosthesis-patient mismatch, 5-year clinical outcomes in patients with a small annulus were comparable to those with a large annulus following transcatheter aortic valve replacement using newer-generation balloon-expandable valves."

Cardiovascular imaging,"Computed tomography based planimetric assessment of the anatomic aortic valve area (aAVACTA) in aortic stenosis is routinely performed. Unlike transthoracic echocardiography-based effective AVA by transthoracic echocardiography, it lacks clearly defined severity cutoff values, limiting clinical utility.
In this retrospective single-center analysis with computed tomography angiography data from 2013 to 2025, cutoffs were determined from 1294 transthoracic echocardiography-based conclusive severe or nonsevere patients by congruence of maximum velocity, mean pressure gradient, and effective AVA by transthoracic echocardiography. In separate receiver operator curves analyses for tricuspid and bicuspid valves, the severe stenosis likely cutoff was defined by Youden index and the unlikely cutoff by a negative likelihood ratio <0.1. Cutoffs were internally validated in 480 patients, compared with the Agatston score by net reclassification index, and tested in 190 separate normal flow-low gradient-aortic stenosis cases.
Correlation between aAVACTA and effective AVA by transthoracic echocardiography was moderate and strong in tricuspid and bicuspid valves, respectively (Pearson r 0.67 and 0.78; P<0.001). Severe stenosis was likely in tricuspid valves at aAVACTA ≤0.95 cm² (sensitivity 87%, specificity 78.9%) and unlikely at ≥1.10 cm² (negative likelihood ratio, 0.092). In bicuspid valves severe stenosis was likely at aAVACTA ≤1.08 cm² (sensitivity 88.3%, specificity 77.3%) and unlikely at ≥1.20cm2 (negative likelihood ratio, 0.091). Validation showed comparable results. Net reclassification index compared with the Agatston score was 0.16 for likely and 0.17 for unlikely cutoffs (P<0.001). Cutoffs were applied to 190 suspected severe low-gradient cases. Adding aAVACTA as an additional severity marker led to reclassification to nonsevere in 5.8% of cases.
Direct planimetry of AVA is feasible and shows utility in low gradient-aortic stenosis. However, as the hemodynamic effect is impacted by valve shape, cutoff values should differentiate between tricuspid and bicuspid valves."

This retrospective study consecutively enrolled 175 patients with severe AS who underwent either SAVR or TAVR. Transthoracic echocardiograms obtained at baseline, 30 days, and 1 year after the procedure were analyzed by multiple echocardiographers at our institution.
At baseline, the TAVR group was significantly older (74 ± 7 years vs. 62 ± 9 years, p < 0.001) and had a higher prevalence of hypertension (53.5% vs. 31.0%, p = 0.003), coronary artery disease (38.4% vs. 23.0%, p = 0.028), and atrial fibrillation (16.3% vs. 2.3%, p = 0.002). Additionally, the TAVR cohort demonstrated significantly worse cardiac functional status (p < 0.001). Compared to TAVR patients, SAVR patients (N = 87) exhibited a more pronounced reduction in left ventricular end-systolic dimension (-0.5 ± 0.65 cm vs. -0.2 ± 0.47 cm, p < 0.001) and left ventricular end-diastolic dimension (-0.6 ± 0.64 cm vs. -0.3 ± 0.55 cm, p < 0.001) at the 1-month follow-up. A decrease in left ventricular mass was observed in both groups from baseline to 1 month postoperatively, with the SAVR group showing a significantly greater reduction (LV mass: -67.3 ± 59.31 g vs. -38.2 ± 46.49 g, p = 0.003; LVMI: -39.1 ± 33.93 g/m2 vs. -22.5 ± 27.08 g/m2, p = 0.005). However, these differences were not sustained at the 1-year follow-up. SAVR patients experienced a transient decline in right ventricular function at 1 month, which recovered by 1 year postoperatively. At the 1-year follow-up, the TAVR group experienced a higher incidence of Major Adverse Cardiac Events (MACE) (p = 0.01), despite showing significant improvement in the severity of both mitral and tricuspid regurgitation compared to baseline (p < 0.001). Although pulmonary artery pressure improved in both groups after AVR, the SAVR group demonstrated significantly lower pressure at 1 year (p < 0.001).
In patients with severe aortic stenosis, SAVR was associated with more significant regression of left ventricular dimensions and mass at 1 month compared to TAVR, alongside a transient impairment of right ventricular function. By 1 year postoperatively, however, no significant differences in ventricular remodeling were observed between the two groups."

To investigate the efficacy of different treatment methods. Methods: A retrospective analysis was conducted on 181 sECD patients admitted to the First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University between June 2018 and February 2025, of whom 23 had bilateral involvement, resulting in a total of 204 dissected vessels. Based on the Borgess classification, 204 dissected vessels were categorized into 2 groups: type Ⅰ (intact intima, 71 vessels) and type Ⅱ (with an intimal tear, 133 vessels). Patients were followed up at 3, 6, and 12 months, and every 12 months thereafter via outpatient visits or readmission. Demographic data, clinical manifestations, imaging features, treatment regimens, and follow-up data were collected to analyze and compare the incidence of cerebral ischemic events, cerebral hemorrhage, and mortality during hospitalization and follow-up between the 2 groups. To observe the efficacy between surgical and conservative treatments as well. Results: A total of 181 patients aged (50±11) years were included, comprising 139 males and 42 females. Compared with type Ⅱ sECD, type Ⅰ were younger [48 (40, 56) vs 51 (44, 57) years, P=0.043] and had higher National Institute of Health Stroke Scale scores at admission and discharge [2 (0, 5) vs 0 (0, 3) points, P=0.029; and 0 (0, 2) vs 0 (0, 1) points, P=0.026, respectively]. The incidence of ischemic stroke was significantly higher in type Ⅰ sECD [60.6% (43/71) vs 43.6% (58/133), P=0.021]. Type Ⅰ sECD also exhibited a higher proportion of true lumen stenosis >70% [78.9% (56/71) vs 36.8%(49/133), P<0.001]. A total of 67 patients (71 vessels) underwent surgical treatment with a 100.0% (71/71) success rate and no perioperative complications. Among 114 patients (133 vessels) receiving conservative treatment, the cerebral ischemia recurrence rate was 3.7% (2/53) for type Ⅰ and 6.3% (5/80) for type Ⅱ, with no statistically significant difference (P>0.05). However, the complete and partial healing rates were higher in type I sECD than in type Ⅱ [88.7% (47/53) vs 30.0% (24/80), P<0.001]. Conclusions: Type Ⅰ sECD is more common in younger patients and is associated with a higher risk of severe ischemic stroke, yet it exhibits better healing rates with antithrombotic therapy. Surgical treatment intervention is safe and effective for both types."

Baseline clinical, laboratory, and echocardiographic parameters were analyzed. A composite endpoint comprising cardiovascular death, heart failure hospitalization, and appropriate implantable cardioverter-defibrillator shocks was assessed. Logistic regression analyses were used to identify independent associations, and receiver operating characteristic analysis was performed to evaluate discriminative ability.ResultsThe uric acid-to-albumin ratio was higher in patients with obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy than in those with nonobstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and controls (1.56 ± 0.15 vs 1.21 ± 0.08 vs 1.15 ± 0.11; p < 0.001). Adverse events occurred in 32 patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (25.8%) and were more frequent in the obstructive group (34.5% vs 18.2%; p = 0.038). In multivariable analysis, higher uric acid-to-albumin ratio (per 0.1 increase; OR, 1.50; 95% confidence interval: 1.18-1.90; p = 0.001) and septal thickness (OR, 1.65; 95% confidence interval: 1.30-2.10; p < 0.001) were independently associated with adverse outcomes. Receiver operating characteristic analysis yielded an area under the curve of 0.717 (p < 0.001).ConclusionsElevated uric acid-to-albumin ratio was independently associated with adverse outcomes in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and may serve as a simple and inexpensive biomarker for risk stratification."

This study compared early and late outcomes of the two approaches in patients with degenerative mitral regurgitation (MR).
A single-center retrospective analysis was performed of 976 patients (mean age 60 ± 13 years) who underwent mitral valve repair, with or without concomitant procedures, between 2001 and 2022. Patients were categorized by surgical approach: sternotomy (n = 437) or right mini-thoracotomy (n = 539).Early outcomes, long-term mortality, cumulative incidence of mitral-related reintervention, and serial echocardiographic changes were evaluated.
Median (interquartile range) clinical follow-up was 12.8 (8.4-16.6) years in the sternotomy group and 4.9 (3.1-7.1) years in the mini-thoracotomy group. In the matched cohort, the mini-thoracotomy approach was associated with shorter operative time and reduced hospital stay. In-hospital mortality was 0% in both approaches. The long-term all-cause mortality and cumulative incidence of mitral-related reoperation were comparable between the approaches. The mixed-effect model indicated both approaches achieved durable MR reduction and favorable left ventricular remodeling, while mini-thoracotomy showed greater reductions in left atrial size and tricuspid regurgitation gradient.
Compared with sternotomy, right mini-thoracotomy mitral repair provided excellent early safety and faster recovery. Long-term repair durability, reflected by comparable cumulative incidence of mitral-related reoperation, was similar to sternotomy, while survival estimates should be interpreted in the context of differential follow-up duration. When performed at experienced centers, minimally invasive mitral valve repair represents a viable alternative for degenerative MR."

Advances,"Mitral annular calcification (MAC) is a progressive degenerative condition characterized by calcium deposition on the mitral apparatus, and is associated with adverse outcomes. Data on mitral regurgitation (MR) caused by MAC are limited.
This study evaluates the prognostic significance of left atrial strain (LAS) in patients with severe MR due to MAC.
We conducted a retrospective, single-center cohort study including patients with isolated severe MR due to MAC. Clinical data were retrieved, and the primary outcome was all-cause mortality. Echocardiographic parameters including LAS were recorded. The cohort was stratified by the median reservoir LAS (LASr).
Between January 2010 and August 2023, 128 patients with isolated severe MR due to MAC were identified and followed for a median of 134 days (IQR: 33-1,812 days). The median age was 81 years (IQR: 71-88), and 93/128 patients (72.7%) were females. A total of 45/128 patients underwent mitral valve (MV) intervention, whereas 83/128 received conservative management. During follow-up, 63/128 patients died. Patients with LASr ≤13.6% had significantly poorer outcomes (P = 0.031), whereas MV intervention improved survival across the spectrum of LASr (P < 0.05). In multivariate Cox analysis, mortality risk increased as LASr worsened (HR: 1.054; 95% CI: 1.002-1.109), whereas MV intervention improved prognosis (HR: 0.173; 95% CI: 0.075-0.397).
LASr is associated with all-cause mortality in patients with isolated severe MR due to MAC and can serve as a valuable prognostic imaging marker for risk stratification. MV intervention improves prognosis across the spectrum of LASr."

The renal, internal carotid, and vertebral arteries are most frequently involved. Secondary arterial hypertension and stroke are common clinical manifestations of FMD, as illustrated in the present case. A 39-year-old leucodermic male with a history of arterial hypertension, treated with amlodipine 10 mg and valsartan 160 mg, with poor compliance, presented to the emergency department with a one-week history of left-sided weakness and inability to walk. On examination, he was hypertensive (189/98 mmHg), with normal cardiac and pulmonary auscultation, left-sided hemiparesis predominantly affecting the leg, and a hemiparetic gait. Initial and 24-hour follow-up brain CT scans showed no evidence of acute ischemic or hemorrhagic lesions. ECG revealed sinus rhythm and voltage criteria for left ventricular hypertrophy. Echocardiography demonstrated left ventricular hypertrophy, left atrial dilation, and mild mitral regurgitation. Transcranial Doppler showed no right-to-left shunt. Brain MRI revealed an ischemic lesion in the right side of the pons, and magnetic resonance angiography demonstrated the absence of flow in the V4 segment of the left vertebral artery and reduced caliber of the left internal carotid artery. Laboratory tests showed worsening renal function after initiation of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor therapy. Thrombophilia screening was negative. Due to suspected renal artery stenosis, CT angiography was performed, revealing saccular dilatations in both renal arteries with a ""string-of-beads"" appearance, suggestive of FMD. The patient was managed medically with blood pressure control. He began motor rehabilitation with partial recovery of neurological deficits and was discharged for follow-up in the outpatient clinic. In this patient, FMD was the underlying cause of the ischemic stroke that prompted hospitalization. The coexistence of difficult-to-control hypertension and target-organ damage in a young adult raised suspicion of secondary hypertension, and subsequent etiologic investigation led to the diagnosis of FMD."

Consequently, to address this challenge, intraoperative assessment of mitral valve coaptation pressure (MCP) has emerged as a promising approach. This study presents the first precise transcatheter measurement of MCP in animal hearts. Data were obtained using two custom-made force sensors: a 3Fr piezoresistive pressure catheter and a 15Fr flexible piezoelectric sensor. Experiments were conducted in both ex vivo (excised pig hearts activated by a pump) and in vivo (transseptal approach in a living pig) models. In a living pig with a healthy MV under normal hemodynamic conditions (peak systolic left ventricular pressure of 100 mmHg), the MCP ranged from 200 to 300 mmHg (25-40 kPa). Ex vivo experiments demonstrated that MCP was affected by transmitral pressure, mitral function changes (i.e., regurgitation), and MV morphology. These findings provide valuable insights into MV biomechanics and establish a solid foundation for developing medical devices to guide MVr procedures."

Asia,"Current guidelines do not include phenotypical classifications in functional mitral regurgitation (FMR).
The study sought to classify FMR into 3 morphological phenotypes and assess determinants of mortality.
We included patients with ≥moderately severe FMR from 2 tertiary centers. FMR was classified as ventricular functional mitral regurgitation with symmetrical tethering (VFMRst), ventricular functional mitral regurgitation with asymmetrical tethering (VFMRat), or atrial functional mitral regurgitation (AFMR). The primary composite endpoint was cardiovascular death and death equivalent (ie, left ventricular assist device implantation or heart transplantation).
Of 699 patients (70 years [Q1-Q3: 60-79 years], 46% female), VFMRst was the most prevalent (54%). VFMRat exhibited larger mitral regurgitation vena contracta (7.7 mm [Q1-Q3: 7-8.7 mm] vs 7.3 mm [Q1-Q3: 6.7-8.2 mm]) but smaller left ventricular end-diastolic volume index (100 mL/m2 [Q1-Q3: 83-128 mL/m2] vs 106 mL/m2 [Q1-Q3: 88-132 mL/m2]) than VFMRst (both P ≤ 0.037). AFMR with hamstrung posterior mitral valve (MV) exhibited larger left atrial volume index (96 mL/m2 [Q1-Q3: 77-145 mL/m2] vs 78 mL/m2 [Q1-Q3: 63-97 mL/m2]) and mitral regurgitation vena contracta (7.5 mm [Q1-Q3: 6.8-8.6 mm] vs 7.0 mm [Q1-Q3: 6.4-8.2] mm) than AFMR with central MV malcoaptation (both P ≤ 0.010). At a median follow-up of 2.6 years (Q1-Q3: 0.9-5 years), 193 primary endpoints occurred. Five-year event-free survival was higher in AFMR (71 ± 4%) than VFMRst (64 ± 3%) and VFMRat (63 ± 4%) (P ≤ 0.030), but adjusted outcomes were similar across groups (all P ≥ 0.139). Besides conventional markers, multivariable models demonstrated that low diastolic blood pressure (DBP), left atrial reservoir strain (LASr), and left ventricular longitudinal strain from the apical 4-chamber view (A4C-LVLS) independently linked to primary endpoints (all P ≤ 0.043). Adjusted spline curves showed increased primary endpoint risk with DBP ≤73.7 mm Hg, LASr ≤14.8%, and A4C-LVLS ≤9.3%.
VFMRat exhibited more disproportionate features than VFMRst. AFMR with hamstrung posterior MV may indicate a more advanced disease stage. Morphological phenotypes alone were not associated with adjusted outcomes. LASr, A4C-LVLS, and DBP may assist in risk stratification in FMR."

Advances,"Acute mitral regurgitation (MR) is a serious complication of takotsubo syndrome (TTS). However, its incidence and prognostic implications are still poorly investigated.
This study aimed to assess the clinical characteristics, short- and long-term outcomes of patients with TTS complicated by acute, reversible, moderate or severe MR.
The study included TTS patients from the Takotsubo Italian Network multicenter registry. The primary outcome was the composite of in-hospital acute heart failure, cardiogenic shock, and mortality. Secondary outcomes included mortality and the recurrence of TTS at the longest available follow-up. The propensity score weighting technique was performed to account for potential confounders between patients with and without acute moderate or severe MR.
The study included 1,025 patients (mean age 70 ± 11 years, 91.6% females); of them, 186 (18.2%) showed acute moderate or severe MR. Logistic regression analysis showed a significantly higher risk for the primary outcome (adjusted OR: 2.29; 95% CI: 1.83-2.88), acute heart failure (adjusted OR: 2.17; 95% CI: 1.70-2.77), and cardiogenic shock (adjusted OR: 2.46; 95% CI: 1.69-3.59) in patients with acute MR compared to those without. Also, the coexistence of left ventricular outflow tract obstruction with acute MR further increased the risk for the primary outcome (adjusted OR: 5.26; 95% CI: 3.22-8.59). At long-term follow-up (median 29 months), patients who developed acute MR during hospitalization showed a significantly higher risk of mortality (adjusted HR: 1.82; 95% CI: 1.21-2.74).
In this real-world study, acute MR was associated with a significantly higher risk of adverse events during hospitalization and long-term mortality. Early echocardiographic detection of acute MR can support prognostic stratification and management of TTS patients."

Traditionally, physiologic pacing has been achieved with biventricular pacing with a right ventricular lead and a coronary sinus branch lead. Randomized trials involving more than 10,000 patients with heart failure have shown clinical, exercise, and quality-of-life benefits associated with biventricular pacing, as well as improved LVEF and reduced mitral regurgitation and ventricular volumes. These benefits are greatest in patients with left bundle-branch block and a QRS duration of 150 msec or longer. Recent studies support targeting the His bundle or left bundle branch as an alternative cardiac physiologic pacing strategy. Ongoing randomized trials are expected to more clearly define the comparative efficacy and safety of conduction system pacing as compared with biventricular pacing."

A single-center retrospective cohort study included 54 patients who underwent mitral valve repair for mitral regurgitation between January 2020 and July 2021. We measured the distance between the mitral annulus and the LCX (ML distance) using MPR of intraoperative TEE images. As an exploratory analysis, we compared the ML distance between patients with MAD (group D: N = 11) and those without (group N: N = 43).
The LCX was closest to the mitral annulus at 70-90 degrees counterclockwise from the anteroposterior axis. No cases of LCX injury were observed. MAD was most frequently observed at P1, and all patients in group D had disjunction at P1. The minimum ML distance was significantly shorter in group D than in group N (3.2 [1.1] mm in group D, and 4.9 [2.1] mm in group N). Overall, the ML distance was shorter in group D than in group N, and was significantly shorter at 70-100 degrees.
MPR of intraoperative TEE images is a less invasive and useful tool to detect patients with a short ML distance. The area of the closest distance from the mitral annulus to the LCX is near the anterolateral commissure, especially in patients with MAD."

Data were retrieved from the multicenter European Registry of Type A Aortic Dissection (ERTAAD). Bootstrapped least absolute shrinkage and selection operator logistic regression and multilevel multivariate logistic regression were performed for variable selection to identify predictors of hospital death, and logistic regression was used for the prediction of CABG.
A total of 292 (8.04%) of 3633 patients required additional CABG. The in-hospital mortality rate was 33% for patients undergoing CABG vs 16% of non-CABG recipients (P < .001; odds ratio [OR], 2.52; 95% CI, 1.93-3.35).

The need for additional CABG is not a rare occurrence during repair of type A aortic dissection and is associated with an increased mortality risk. Intimal tear localization and right coronary sinus dissection should be carefully examined in the preoperative image evaluation to stratify the risk of revascularization and plan the most appropriate approach."

No previous report to our knowledge has described iPMR with pathologic findings following transcatheter embolization for guidewire perforation of coronary artery.
An 83-year-old man with unstable angina underwent a percutaneous coronary intervention. On the same night as the percutaneous coronary intervention, a guidewire perforation of the left circumflex artery side branch was identified, resulting in cardiac tamponade. Transcatheter embolization of the culprit vessel was performed using gelatin sponge particles. Severe acute mitral regurgitation with circulatory collapse developed 30 hours later secondary to anterolateral iPMR. Despite mechanical circulatory support, the patient died 2 days after mitral regurgitation onset.
Pathologic findings revealed embolic materials within the anterolateral papillary muscle, causing new papillary muscle necrosis and rupture.
Gelatin sponge embolization may achieve hemostasis in coronary guidewire perforation but poses a significant risk of iPMR."

Case reports,"We describe a successful mitral valve transcatheter edge-to-edge repair in a patient with primary ciliary dyskinesia and situs inversus (Kartagener syndrome).
Preprocedural imaging was conducted to understand mirror-image anatomy. Transesophageal echocardiography angulation adjustment was needed for dextrocardia, and the MitraClip system was rotated by 180°for maneuverability. Sequential clip placement was performed with real-time three-dimensional guidance.
Altered anatomy complicates standard echocardiographic views. MitraClip orientation and steerability challenges require device rotation. Transesophageal echocardiography visualization may be impaired by acoustic shadowing; preoperative imaging in supine position is recommended. Vascular anomalies associated with Kartagener syndrome may complicate venous access.
Mitral valve transcatheter edge-to-edge repair is feasible in situs inversus with proper imaging and procedural adjustments. Operator-echocardiographer coordination is critical for procedural success."

A 27-year-old woman presented with systemic embolization and was found to have NBTE involving the aortic and mitral valves caused by ROS1-positive lung adenocarcinoma. She underwent mechanical aortic valve replacement and mitral debridement. Progressive MR led to cardiac decompensation. Mitral valve transcatheter edge-to-edge repair (M-TEER) achieved hemodynamic stabilization and enabled surgical tumor resection.
This case highlights the role of M-TEER in stabilizing high-risk, non-operable patients with cancer-associated valve disease. While established in older patients with degenerative MR, its use in young oncology patients with NBTE is rarely reported.
NBTE may be the first sign of malignancy and should be considered in patients with embolism and sterile valve lesions. M-TEER can stabilize high-risk patients and enable timely, potentially curative cancer treatment."

TTVR is a promising, less-invasive alternative treatment for patients with severe symptomatic tricuspid regurgitation deemed unsuitable for surgery. Despite the increasing adoption of TTVR, patients with RHD are frequently excluded from major clinical trials, leading to limited evidence supporting the use of this intervention in this population.
As TTVR technology advances, its application in RHD warrants further exploration. The routine exclusion of RHD patients or pathology from TTVR clinical trials should also be reconsidered."

Cardiovascular interventions,"Atrial secondary mitral regurgitation (aSMR) is a distinct subtype of SMR characterized by normal leaflets, annular dilatation, left atrial (LA) enlargement, and preserved left ventricular function. Treatment pathways for aSMR are undefined, and limited data exist regarding outcomes following mitral transcatheter edge-to-edge repair (MTEER). The analysis aimed to evaluate outcomes in patients with aSMR treated with MTEER from the EXPANDed studies.
One-year outcomes were assessed in patients from the EXPANDed studies (EXPAND and EXPAND G4) who met criteria for aSMR. aSMR was defined by the presence of atrial fibrillation, left ventricular ejection fraction ≥45%, and at least 1 dilated LA parameter per echocardiographic core laboratory assessment: LA volume index, LA diameter, or LA diameter index.
Of the 967 patients with SMR treated with MTEER in the EXPANDed data set, 160 (17%) met criteria for aSMR. Patients with aSMR were elderly (78±8 years), symptomatic (Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire Overall Summary score, 48±27 pts), and had small left ventricular and large LA dimensions at baseline. Acute procedural success was achieved in 97.5% of patients with aSMR, with MR reduction to ≤1+ in 95.2% at 1 year. There were significant 1-year improvements in quality of life (+19 pt Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire Overall Summary) and functional capacity (New York Heart Association I/II 80%). The 1-year all-cause mortality rate was 9%, with patients experiencing a 56% reduction in 1-year heart failure hospitalization rates from pre- to post-MTEER.
In the largest population of patients with aSMR assessed by an echocardiographic core laboratory, MTEER safely and significantly reduced MR with improvements in quality of life and reduction in heart failure hospitalization through 1 year."

Outcomes in patients with MVA <4.0 cm² remain limited, as this population has been largely excluded from clinical trials.
We retrospectively analyzed 305 consecutive patients who underwent M-TEER (2014-2022). Patients were stratified by baseline MVA (<4.0 cm2 vs. ≥4.0 cm2). The primary endpoint was 2-year all-cause mortality. Secondary endpoints included heart failure hospitalization (HFH), mitral regurgitation (MR) reduction, New York Heart Association functional class improvement, and postprocedural TMPG.
Of 305 patients, 66 (21.6%) had MVA <4.0 cm². Women were more prevalent in the small MVA group (57.6% vs. 42.7%; p = 0.03). Patients with smaller MVA received fewer clips (1.3 ± 0.07 vs. 1.5 ± 0.04; p = 0.03). Procedural success and in-hospital outcomes were comparable. At discharge, residual MR (<moderate) and New York Heart Association class were similar, although TMPG was higher in the small group (3.9 ± 0.2 vs. 3.3 ± 0.1 mmHg; p = 0.006). At 30 days and 1 year, mortality, HFH, and residual MR rates remained similar. Two-year Kaplan-Meier analyses showed no differences in survival, HFH, or composite outcomes. In multivariable analysis, age, creatinine, and hemoglobin predicted mortality, while age, LVEF, and hemoglobin predicted the composite outcome. Indexed MVA did not predict mortality or elevated TMPG.

This study sought to investigate propofol sensitivity and establish specific electroencephalography (EEG) biomarkers to guide safer anesthesia delivery in this high-risk population.
In this prospective observational trial, 40 patients (20 VD vs. 20 non-cardiac controls) received Schnider model-guided propofol target-controlled infusion. Primary outcome was effect-site propofol concentration at loss of consciousness (CeLOC). Prefrontal EEG dynamics (spectral power, bicoherence, burst suppression) were analyzed.
VD patients exhibited 34% lower CeLOC versus controls (2.8 vs. 4.25 µg/mL; p = 0.0001). EEG revealed distinct neurosignatures: elevated β and θ power (β: 3.16 vs. 1.68, p = 0.0303; θ: 1.21 vs. 0.88, p = 0.0166), higher spectral power ratio (SPR: 1.38 vs. 1.98; p = 0.022), and intensified burst suppression (ratio: 0.11 vs. 0.32; p < 0.0001). Bicoherence analysis demonstrated impaired cross-frequency coupling in β and δ bands (β: 40.95 vs. 34.75, p = 0.0253; δ:43.5 vs. 30.95, p < 0.0001).
VD is associated with heightened propofol sensitivity and distinct EEG signatures, including patterns suggestive of thalamocortical dysrhythmia and cortical suppression. These findings suggest that disease-specific EEG monitoring may inform the development of precision anesthesia protocols for cardiac populations."

Congenital anomalies of the atrioventricular valve or septum (CAAVAS) and functionally univentricular heart (FUH) are complex subtypes of CHD, where disruptions in key molecular pathways are implicated. This study investigates the genetic burden contributing to these anomalies. This case-control study included 48 participants: 24 patients diagnosed with CAAVAS or FUH and 24 healthy controls. Whole-exome sequencing (WES) was conducted to assess genetic burden by evaluating minor allele frequencies (MAF) using gnomAD and predicting functional impact of variants with REVEL scores. A secondary filtration was performed, focusing on 349 genes associated with abnormal heart valve morphology (HP:0001654) as defined by the Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) database, to identify pathogenic variants exclusive to the case group. Genetic burden risk (GBR) analysis revealed a significantly higher median number of common variants in the case group compared to controls (p = 0.035). Genetic analysis identified variants in genes involved in contractile cardiac and cytoskeletal proteins (MYH3, ACTC1), extracellular matrix proteins (FBN1, FREM1, HSPG2), ciliary proteins (EVC2, PKD1L1), enzymes (POLG, DNASE1L3), cell-signaling proteins (TGFB2, CCDC22) and transcription factors (NKX2-5, NONO). This study highlights the significant role of genetic burden and gene variants associated with congenital mitral and tricuspid valve anomalies. Our findings reinforce the strong genetic predisposition underlying these malformations, as evidenced by the increased genetic burden in affected individuals compared to controls without CHD."

However, valvular heart disease and somnolence, mainly caused by activating the serotonin 5-HT2B receptor (5-HT2BR) and dopamine D3 receptor (D3R), respectively, currently challenge their clinical use. Here, we aimed to develop a novel dopamine receptor agonist with superior therapeutic efficacy for PD, while minimising adverse reactions.
Matsupexole, a novel nonergot dopamine receptor agonist, was evaluated by agonist activity for D2LR and a 6-hydroxydopamine-lesioned male rat PD model. To explore its adverse effects, the agonist activity for other receptors, including 5-HT2BR and D3R, and the resulting porcine heart valve interstitial cell (PHVIC) proliferation and non-rapid eye movement (REM) sleep induction in male rats were evaluated, in comparison with existing dopamine receptor agonists.
Matsupexole exhibited potent agonist activity for D2LRs without inducing 5-HT2BR activation or promoting PHVIC proliferation. Matsupexole demonstrated sustained efficacy in the PD model. In contrast, despite its strong D2LR agonist activity, cabergoline, an ergot dopamine receptor agonist, significantly evoked PHVIC proliferation. Reflecting its higher D2LR/D3R selectivity, matsupexole did not affect non-REM sleep induction. Although pramipexole, a D3R-favouring nonergot agonist, showed efficacy in the rat PD model, its effect was shorter in duration, and it strongly promoted non-REM sleep. The stabilised interaction between Val1905.39 in D2LR and matsupexole, but not pramipexole, further supports the higher D2LR/D3R selectivity of matsupexole.
Matsupexole is a promising future, potentially best-in-class dopamine receptor agonist for treating PD."

Histoplasma infection occurs through inhalation of spores typically found in contaminated soil. The clinical forms are variable, ranging from asymptomatic to fatal presentations. Asymptomatic individuals may develop reactivated disease years after the primary exposure. Most cases of histoplasmosis are confined to the pulmonary system. In rare instances, fungal elements disseminate to the heart valves, where destructive injury occurs. CASE REPORT A 59-year-old woman presented with vascular bypass occlusion, 2 months after aortobifemoral bypass for aortoiliac occlusive disease. She reported severe, unrelenting nausea and vomiting; a large aortic valve mass was detected on transthoracic echocardiography. Bacterial endocarditis was initially suspected, but cultures were unrevealing. Follow-up microbial cell-free DNA testing identified Histoplasma capsulatum and low-level Streptococcus mitis/oralis, prompting further evaluation for disseminated histoplasmosis. Bone marrow biopsy showed Histoplasma negativity according to polymerase chain reaction. The patient subsequently underwent aortic valve replacement, and pathology confirmed fungal elements consistent with H. capsulatum. Gram and acid-fast bacilli staining of the aortic valve yielded negative results. CONCLUSIONS Fungal endocarditis carries substantial morbidity and is challenging to diagnose due to its nonspecific presentation over time and the absence of standardized blood culture protocols. Treatment options include surgical valve replacement and targeted antifungal therapy. This case underscores the diagnostic difficulties associated with fungal endocarditis, particularly in the context of negative cultures and a history of travel to endemic areas, when microbial coinfection cannot be definitively excluded."

A retrospective review was performed on 171 patients with DCVSDs of all ages who underwent the MRVIAT procedure between 2022 and 2024.
The procedure was successfully completed in all 171 patients without conversion to median sternotomy or in-hospital mortality. The median age was 1.3 years (range, 0.1-39.0 years), with seven patients (4.1%) aged ≥18 years. The median weight was 10.2 kg (range, 3.8-86.6 kg). Among them, nine patients (5.3%) weighed ≤5 kg, 83 (48.5%) weighed ≤10 kg, 81 (47.4%) weighed 10-50 kg, and seven (4.1%) weighed ≥50 kg. Complications included mild residual shunting in two cases (1.2%), incision infection in one case (0.6%), and pulmonary infection in one case (0.6%). Over a median follow-up of 1.3 years (range, 0.3-2.5 years), no thoracic deformities or moderate-to-severe valvular regurgitation were observed.
The MRVIAT technique is a safe and viable option for the surgical treatment of DCVSD in patients across all age groups. It provides a minimally invasive approach with a small, inconspicuous incision and avoids peripheral cannulation, making it a promising alternative to median sternotomy."

Balloon pulmonary valvuloplasty (BPV) is a potentially viable palliative option for selected patients with severely stenotic pulmonary valve and are unsuitable for definitive surgical repair METHODS: A retrospective chart review was conducted (2002 to 2024, age >12 years). BPV was considered for those with a significant component of valvular pulmonary stenosis (PS) on echocardiography. A strategy of stepwise dilation using progressively larger balloon sizes, andmonitoring pulmonary artery pressures between each dilation, was adapted.
Thirty patients [TOF (n=13), DORV/DILV (n=7/2), single ventricle/Unbalanced AVCD (n=3), and corrected transposition (n=5)] with median age: 20.5 years (IQR: 14.0-26.8), weight: 49 kg (IQR: 44.1-57.7) underwent BPV. The fluoroscopy and procedure times were 17.8 minutes (IQR:12.7-25.7) and 71 ± 26 minutes (mean ± SD), respectively. The balloon-to-annulus ratio was 1.01 (0.96-1.2). Saturation improved significantly from 76.7±9.6% to 90.2±4.4%. Complications included transient arrhythmias in five patients and fatal re-perfusion pulmonary edema during repeat BPV in one. At a median follow-up of 51 months (IQR: 26.75-139.25 months), majority of patients demonstrated sustained symptomatic relief. Seven patients underwent corrective surgery, and four required repeat BPV.
In a selected subgroup of anatomically suited patients with CCHD and PS, stepwise dilatation of the pulmonary valve resulted in improved oxygenation and symptomatic relief, which was sustained on follow-up, making it an attractive low-resource option for palliation, particularly in resource constrained LMIC settings."

Delirium resolved with optimization of medical status, reduction of deliriogenic medications and short-term low-dose olanzapine, yet she retained a fixed belief that these ward events had truly occurred. For almost a year, including during a later admission for prosthetic valve endocarditis with paravalvular leak and an unsuccessful percutaneous closure attempt, she repeatedly reported these experiences as factual abuse despite psychotherapy and psychoeducation. Only during a subsequent elective admission, when reconsidering a high-risk redo valve operation that she ultimately declined, did she spontaneously reframe the memories as symptoms of ""a mental disorder"" and apologize to staff.
This case highlights how delirium-related persecutory experiences can consolidate into persistent trauma-like autobiographical memories with prolonged delusional conviction, and underscores the need for structured delirium follow-up, explicit psychoeducation for patients and families, and close collaboration between cardiology, cardiac surgery, psychiatry and psychology."

This study aimed to clarify whether the type of aortic root surgery, in case of at least grade 2 aortic regurgitation associated with myocardial dysfunction, affects the outcomes.
Extraction from the Heart Valve Society aortic valve database (Aortic Valve Insufficiency and ascending aorta Aneurysm InternATiOnal Registry [AVIATOR]) was performed and two groups of patients operated between July 2007 and December 2022 were identified: Group 1 including patients undergoing VSRR with ejection fraction (EF) ≤50% (n=279) and Group 2 including patients undergoing Bentall with EF ≤50% (n=46). All patients had at least grade 2 aortic regurgitation.
Similar cardiopulmonary bypass and cross-clamping time were reported. No statistically significant difference was reported between the groups in terms of postoperative bleeding, transfusion rate, reoperations, pacemaker rate implantation, ischaemic complications, and acute kidney injury. Follow-up mortality was similar between the groups, without any significant differences, and the weighted mixed-effect linear models showed improvement in EF in both groups; progressive inverse left ventricular remodelling is significantly higher in Group 2.
While both techniques can improve left ventricular function in patients with reduced EF, the Bentall procedure offers marginally better results in terms of left ventricular inverse remodelling. However, the choice between Bentall and VSRR should ultimately be determined by the surgeon's expertise and familiarity with each technique."

Heart disease caused by radiotherapy can include pericardial lesions, cardiac dysfunction, valvular defects, coronary artery damage, and cardiac arrhythmias. Risk factors primarily include those related to the mean heart dose of radiation, but with the development of modern radiotherapy techniques, this problem is optimistically decreasing. However, concurrent pharmacological anticancer therapies still significantly impact the vessels and heart. The key problem, however, is pre-existing heart disease, often based on atherosclerosis or arterial hypertension. Efforts should be made to ensure that radiotherapy produces at most permissive cardiotoxicity, which will not affect the quality of life or survival. Hence, effective pharmacotherapy for primary and secondary cardioprotection is searching."

Clinical data of VHD patients who underwent surgical treatment in Qingdao Cardiovascular Hospital from March 2022 to February 2024 were retrospectively collected. The patients were divided into a modeling group (n = 215) and a validation group (n = 54) in an 8:2 ratio. The modeling group was further divided into an HB group (n = 73) and a non-HB group (n = 142) based on whether HB occurred within one week after surgery. Multivariable logistic regression analysis was used to analyze the risk factors for HB in VHD patients. Risk prediction nomogram models were established using R3.6.1 software, and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves and calibration curves were plotted to evaluate the predictive performance and accuracy of the nomogram models.
The results of multivariable logistic regression analysis showed that the type of surgery (OR = 4.959, 95% CI: 2.592-9.487), preoperative MELD score (OR = 4.332, 95% CI: 2.061-9.105), CPB time (OR = 3.851, 95% CI: 1.591-9.321), aortic cross-clamp time (OR = 3.667, 95% CI: 1.521-8.841), intraoperative total blood transfusion volume (OR = 4.125, 95% CI: 1.982-8.586), and mechanical ventilation time (OR = 4.089, 95% CI: 2.000-8.362) were risk factors for the occurrence of HB in the modeling group (P < 0.05). The ROC analysis results showed that the area under the curve (AUC) of the nomogram model for predicting HB in the modeling group and validation group was 0.901 and 0.904, respectively. The calibration curve analysis results showed good consistency between the predicted and actual occurrence of HB in the predictive model, with Hosmer-Lemeshow chi-square statistics of 4.32 and 1.95 and corresponding P-values of 0.821 and 0.199.
The type of surgery, preoperative MELD score, CPB time, aortic cross-clamp time, intraoperative total blood transfusion volume, and mechanical ventilation time are risk factors for the occurrence of HB in patients with VHD. The nomogram model constructed based on these risk factors has good predictive value and accuracy."

Existing encoding methods often fail to capture both local and long-range dependencies simultaneously.
We introduce EDEN (Expected Density of Nucleotide Encoding), a unified multiscale encoding framework based on kernel density estimation. EDEN captures position-specific and context-dependent nucleotide patterns and integrates them into a hybrid deep learning architecture. Across sixteen benchmark datasets covering promoter detection, core promoter detection, and transcription factor binding prediction, EDEN achieves the best average performance while using orders of magnitude fewer parameters compared with state-of-the-art models. All source code, pretrained models, and datasets are publicly available at: https://github.com/zabihis/EDEN.
EDEN provides an efficient, biologically informed, and interpretable multiscale representation for genomic sequence classification. Its favorable parameter-performance ratio and robust consistency across tasks underscore its practicality for large-scale genomic applications."

State-of-the-art approaches for automatic detection of SCD use deep learning (DL) based models, which require a large amount of training data for efficient training. However, such large training datasets are often not available, significantly limiting the efficiency of DL-based models. In this paper, we propose different approaches to address this issue. Firstly, we propose to use a transfer-learning based approach, where we use pre-trained models like ResNet-50, DenseNet-121, and EfficientNet-B0 and fine-tune them for SCD detection. To further enhance the efficiency of the models, we then propose to include contrastive-learning-based approach using triplet loss. We also use focal loss to handle class imbalance. Additionally, we integrate Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) methodologies to interpret and explain the model's predictions, ensuring transparency and trustworthiness in clinical settings. Experiments on a publicly available SCD image dataset show that models trained with transfer learning and triplet loss outperform those trained with binary cross-entropy or focal loss."

This study proposes NASNet-ViT, a novel deep learning framework that integrates the powerful convolutional feature extraction of NASNet with the global attention mechanisms of the Vision Transformer (ViT). To enhance diagnostic precision, a multi-stage preprocessing pipeline, termed MixProcessing, is introduced, combining wavelet transform decomposition, adaptive histogram equalization, and morphological filtering to improve image quality and feature clarity. The proposed NASNet-ViT model classifies lung images into five categories, normal, lung cancer, COVID-19, pneumonia, and tuberculosis achieving outstanding performance metrics: 98.9% accuracy, 0.99 sensitivity, 0.989 F1-score, and 0.987 specificity. Compared to established architectures such as MixNet-LD, D-ResNet, MobileNet, and ResNet50, NASNet-ViT demonstrates superior accuracy while maintaining a lightweight model size of only 25.6 MB and fast inference time of 12.4 seconds, making it practical for deployment in real-time, resource-constrained clinical environments.

Part A, Molecular and biomolecular spectroscopy","Accurate quantification of furfural concentration in transformer oil is crucial for assessing the aging status of insulating paper; however, conventional quantitative models face significant challenges in generalizing due to interference from complex oil matrices. To address this, we propose a quantitative analytical framework integrating an improved residual network (ResNet) with transfer learning. Initially, a deep convolutional generative adversarial network (DCGAN) was introduced to augment the Raman spectral dataset of furfural, generating high-fidelity spectra (peak signal-to-noise ratio, PSNR = 46.02; structural similarity index, SSIM = 0.98) to mitigate the risk of overfitting due to small sample sizes. Subsequently, an improved ResNet model was developed by simplifying network structure and embedding Dropout regularization, significantly enhancing feature extraction capability and robustness (correlation coefficient, R2 = 0.9921). To accommodate spectral distribution differences among multi-source oil samples, a transfer learning framework (Transfer-ResNet) was constructed by freezing lower network layers and fine-tuning deeper residual blocks, thus achieving cross-domain generalization (R2 = 0.9914). Furthermore, Grad-CAM++ interpretability analysis revealed the model's multi-frequency response mechanisms, identifying key molecular features such as C-H/C-C vibrations and CN stretching. This proposed method provides a novel strategy for accurate, interpretable quantitative SERS detection of furfural in transformer oil, demonstrating significant potential for transformer condition assessment."

The generalizability of such models, however, is often degraded due to the large variations between the training data and the data to be predicted. Model transfer showed great potential in this regard, which improved the prediction on the test data without re-building a new model from scratch. We developed a method based on Siamese neural network (SNet) and compared it with two basis models as well as two model transfer methods score movement (MS) and extensive multiplicative scattering correction (EMSC). The performance was systematically verified with a Raman spectral dataset measured from four bacterial species, each consisting of nine biological replicates. Its generalizability was further tested on a second Raman dataset from mice tissue samples. Siamese network was demonstrated to outperform the MS and EMSC, especially given large training datasets. The load on training data, however, is substantially lower than conventional networks and can be slightly reduced when variability between training and test data is properly incorporated into the loss function. Unlike MS and EMSC, more importantly, Siamese network does not require information of test data for model adjustment or data space adaptation, which makes it more advantageous in practice."

However, a comprehensive national database of these facilities remains limited. This study presents a framework to detect open feedlots across the Contiguous U.S. (CONUS) using the You Only Look Once (YOLO) object detection model and aerial images from the National Agriculture Imagery Program (NAIP). We visually identified and labeled a total of 11,746 feedlots across highly productive counties in Nebraska, Kansas, and Texas. To reduce false detections, we also included 13,000 background patches (image subsets without feedlots). Together, this dataset was used to train, validate, and test YOLOv11 object detection model variants. All NAIP county-level images (43 TB of GeoTIFF, resampled to 1 m resolution) were acquired over the CONUS in 2019-2022, and processed into thousands of 640 × 640-pixel image patches for nationwide inference. Model performance was evaluated using precision, recall, F1-score, and Intersection Over Union (IoU). YOLOv11m achieved the best performance, with a precision of 0.88, recall of 0.85, and F1-score of 0.86, detecting more than 24,000 facilities. Feedlots were identified in most U.S. states, with particularly high concentrations in the Midwest, especially Nebraska, South Dakota, and Iowa. Texas, on the other hand, was characterized by having the largest facilities, often consisting of multiple lots. Environmental stressors associated with feedlot locations were also assessed. Feedlots across the South, parts of the Midwest, and the West experienced extreme summer heat, increasing the risk of heat stress and related animal welfare concerns. At the same time, favorable conditions for stable fly development peaked in June, which could potentially affect more than 10,000 Midwest feedlots. Automated detection of feedlot facilities provides valuable insights into U.S. beef production, enabling strategies to improve animal welfare and mitigate environmental impacts."

The Institutional Review Boards oftwo participating institutions approved this prospective study. Seventy patients were enrolled from these two institutions. All the participants underwent both conventional and accelerated L-spine MRI during the same session, resulting in 140 MRI scans. Quantitative analyses included signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR), whereas qualitative image quality assessments were conducted by four radiologists blinded to the scan type and patient information. The interchangeability between conventional and accelerated MRI with DL-based enhancement protocols was evaluated for five key pathologic findings. Automated structured reports were generated using a commercially available VLM-based spine interpretation software and compared with radiologist consensus reports. Statistical analyses were performed, with p < 0.05 considered statistically significant.
Accelerated L-spine MRI with DL-based enhancement reduced the acquisition time by approximately 80-86% when compared with conventional MRI, while maintaining diagnostic interchangeability. Quantitative analyses revealed superior SNRs and CNRs, and qualitative evaluations supported comparable image quality. Automated reporting demonstrated substantial to almost perfect agreement across key pathologies.
DL-enhanced accelerated MRI produced high-quality diagnostic images within 2 min, and VLM-based automated reporting demonstrated strong agreement with the radiologists. These findings provide prospective evidence supporting the clinical feasibility of integrating AI into both the acquisition and interpretation workflows in L-spine MRI, with the potential to enhance the efficiency, consistency, and scalability of musculoskeletal imaging."

With a focus on the prevalent psychological complications following the onset of this condition, this study aimed to explore the correlation between antenatal depression and Corona disease anxiety, personality traits, and postpartum depression during the COVID-19 pandemic.                                                           Materials and Methods:                     This cross-sectional descriptive-analytical study investigated women receiving care at health centers affiliated with Kerman University of Medical Sciences during the last month of their pregnancy and the postpartum period in 2022. Following the acquisition of informed consent, participants were assessed using various measures, including demographic and obstetric information, the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale, the Corona Disease Anxiety Scale (CDAS), and the NEO Personality Inventory-Revised during their third trimester of pregnancy. The same group of participants completed the Edinburgh Depression Scale and the Corona Disease Anxiety Scale (CDAS) 4-6 weeks after childbirth.                                                           Results and Discussion:                     There was a significant correlation between family income, unwanted pregnancy as perceived by both the mother and father, and antenatal depression. Additionally, marital satisfaction played a significant role in postpartum depression. Furthermore, antenatal depression was significantly associated with neuroticism, agreeableness, and physical symptoms related to Corona disease anxiety. Personality traits, with the exception of extroversion and conscientiousness, and various domains of Corona disease anxiety, excluding psychological symptoms, were also significantly associated with postpartum depression.                                                           Conclusion:                     During pandemics or epidemics, such as the COVID-19 outbreak, experiencing mental distress during pregnancy can contribute to mental health issues during the postpartum period. This risk is particularly true in individuals with unique personality traits, emphasizing the need for increased focus on mental health within prenatal care during these crises."

Method:                     This cross-sectional study was conducted in Kerman, Iran. Data were collected from patients who visited Afzalipour Hospital in Kerman more than twice during the COVID-19 epidemic from the end of February 2020 to March 21, 2021. We conducted two key analyses: 1. Mixed effect logistic regression was used to check the relationship between the variables and COVID-19 severity. 2. Mixed effect linear regression was used to check the relationship between the variables and the length of stay in the hospital.                                                           Results:                     The findings indicated that the most important risk factors for the severity of COVID-19 were heart diseases (OR=1.67,95%CI:1.20-2.30), increasing age (OR=2.23 for age&gt;54, 95%CI:1.70- 2.90), male gender (OR=1.47,95%CI:1.10-1.96), respiratory diseases other than asthma, and frequency of admission (OR=1.60,95%CI:1.20-2.15). All patients who underwent readmission experienced a shorter duration of hospitalization during their subsequent admission (OR=0.94,95%CI:0.91,0.96) and had a higher mortality rate (30% within 14 days, 26.6% between 14-90 days). Patients readmitted at intervals of 14-90 days and greater than 90 days exhibited lower disease severity compared to those readmitted within the 0-14 day period.                                                           Conclusion:                     Examining readmissions, the severity of COVID-19, and the length of hospital stay in affected patients are important factors for planning and allocating resources for COVID-19 management and treatment. These factors can help policymakers develop effective clinical guidelines for hospitalization or outpatient treatment of COVID-19 patients and contribute to reducing the burden of disease in the community."

Kinovea, as an accessible motion-analysis software, provides both visual and quantitative feedback. However, its application in supporting technique development among beginner athletes remains insufficiently explored. Aim: This study aims to describe the use of Kinovea in biomechanics training and examine its contribution to the awareness of kinematic characteristics and movement techniques among beginner athletes. Methods: A descriptive qualitative design involved 72 beginner athletes aged 18–25 years selected through purposive sampling. Data were collected over 16 weeks through interviews, field observations, and motion video recordings analyzed using Kinovea. Kinematic data focused on joint angles, stride behavior, and movement phases during walking, running, and the flight phase. Qualitative data were analyzed using content analysis with NVivo 12, while kinematic results were interpreted descriptively to identify performance patterns and areas for technical refinement. Result: Kinematic analysis showed coordinated joint-angle patterns across all phases. Walking analysis identified arm swing angles of 50.9°–58.8° and leg separation angles of 64.3°–67.2°, indicating a stable gait rhythm. The running analysis revealed knee angles of 68.8°–69.8° and elbow angles of 87.6°–89.1°, indicating efficient propulsive mechanics. The flight phase demonstrated knee angles of 81.2°–87.8° and elbow angles of 80.4°–88.3°, suggesting effective momentum use and postural stability. These measurements supported stride-efficiency assessment and technique evaluation. Qualitative findings revealed that Kinovea enabled athletes to interpret movement phases and identify technical inefficiencies through slow-motion and frame-by-frame visualization. Conclusion: Kinovea supports basic motion analysis by providing clear kinematic information and helping beginner athletes observe and refine their movement techniques. The findings also offer practical value for coaches by enabling more precise identification of inefficient patterns and guiding targeted corrections during early-stage training."

METHODS: We analyzed 2 multicenter registries that consecutively enrolled patients with severe aortic stenosis before and after the introduction of transcatheter AVR in Japan (CURRENT AS [CURRENT AS, Contemporary Outcomes After Surgery and Medical Treatment in Patients With Severe Aortic Stenosis] Registry-1: 2003–2011; Registry-2: 2018–2020). Data were derived from hospital electronic health records. The primary outcome was 1-year all-cause mortality. Secondary outcomes included hospitalization for heart failure, cardiovascular death, and noncardiovascular death. we Multivariable Cox proportional hazards models were adjusted for age, sex, body mass index, hypertension, current smoking, diabetes on insulin therapy, prior myocardial infarction, prior symptomatic stroke, atrial fibrillation or flutter, aortic or peripheral vascular disease, creatinine level, hemodialysis, anemia, liver cirrhosis (child B or C), malignancy currently under treatment, chronic lung disease (moderate or severe), coronary artery disease, peak aortic jet velocity, any combined moderate or severe valvular disease, and tricuspid regurgitation pressure gradient. RESULTS: A total of 6645 patients (Registry-1: 3448 patients, and Registry-2: 3197 patients) were included. Patients in Registry-2 were older than those in Registry-1 (81.7 versus 77.8 years), and an initial AVR strategy was more frequently selected (49.9% versus 31.3%). The cumulative 1-year incidence and adjusted risk of 1-year all-cause mortality were lower in Registry-2 than in Registry-1 (10.2% versus 16.0%, P &lt;0.001, hazard ratio, 0.55 [95% CI, 0.47–0.63]). In contrast, the incidence and adjusted risk of hospitalization for heart failure did not differ between Registry-2 and Registry-1 (8.5% versus 9.0%, P =0.66, hazard ratio, 0.88 [95% CI, 0.75–1.04]). CONCLUSIONS: The overall 1-year mortality outcome of patients with severe aortic stenosis improved in the posttranscatheter AVR era compared with the pretranscatheter AVR era, with no noticeable improvement in hospitalization for heart failure."

We report a 15‐year‐old girl presenting with exertional dyspnea, chest pain, and palpitations. Echocardiography and multidetector computed tomography (MDCT) confirmed severe supravalvular aortic stenosis, myxomatous mitral valve with moderate to severe mitral regurgitation, and reduced ejection fraction. A double patch aortoplasty was performed with a successful outcome. This case underscores the importance of early diagnosis and tailored surgical intervention along with continued monitoring during follow up visits in managing complex congenital heart disease (CHD) diagnosed at an early age."

Merlet; Stéphane Avril; Léonard Féasson; F. Hoffmann-La Roche; M. Bäck; David Hupin,10.3389/fcvm.2025.1625436,2026-01-23,Frontiers in Cardiovascular Medicine,"Postoperative atrial fibrillation (POAF) affects 38%–63% of patients undergoing surgical replacement for calcific aortic valve stenosis (CAVS), increasing morbidity, stroke risk, and hospital stay. POAF results from an interplay between pre-existing arrhythmogenic substrates, acute surgical triggers, unresolved inflammation, and autonomic nervous system (ANS) imbalance. Specialized pro-resolving mediators (SPMs) orchestrate inflammation resolution and tissue homeostasis; their deficiency may sustain valvular inflammation and promote arrhythmogenesis. Transcutaneous vagus nerve stimulation (tVNS) is a non-invasive approach that enhances parasympathetic tone, restores sympathovagal balance, and modulates inflammatory pathways. While tVNS has been applied postoperatively, its preoperative, preventive use in POAF has not been explored, representing a novel therapeutic strategy. In patients with CAVS, preoperative tVNS could reduce POAF by regulating ANS activity and limiting perioperative inflammation. Mechanistic insights may be gained through perioperative sampling, analysis of excised valvular and atrial tissue, and biomechanical assessments comparing stimulated and control groups. Preoperative tVNS thus offers a promising strategy to prevent POAF while addressing valvular inflammation, bridging translational physiology with clinical cardiology and potentially opening new avenues for the management of CAVS."

Gullestad; Kaspar Broch; Kristoffer Russell,10.3389/fcvm.2025.1740710,2026-01-22,Frontiers in Cardiovascular Medicine,"Background and aims Conventional echocardiographic measurements like ejection fraction (EF) and global longitudinal strain (GLS) evaluate left ventricular (LV) function without considering concurrent loading conditions. A more comprehensive characterization of cardiac function and energetics can be achieved through pressure-volume analysis, but its clinical application is limited by the requirement for invasive measurements. We aimed to develop a clinically accessible, non-invasive method for pressure-volume loop analysis. Methods We obtained simultaneous 3-dimensional echocardiograms and invasive LV pressures with micromanometer-tipped catheters during transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) for severe aortic stenosis. Volume-time traces from the echocardiograms were combined with invasive LV pressures and non-invasive pressure estimates to construct pressure-volume loops. We used echocardiograms before and after TAVR to evaluate changes in myocardial function via non-invasive pressure-volume studies. Results In same-beat comparisons, stroke work calculated using non-invasive LV pressure estimations correlated well with stroke work calculated using invasive LV pressures ( r = 0.95, ICC = 0.95, p &amp;lt; 0.0001, y = 0.90X + 1,836, mean bias −549 mmHg*mL, standard deviation 774 mmHg*mL; 95% limits of agreement: −2,006 to +967 mmHg*mL). After TAVR, stroke work fell substantially, ventricular efficiency increased, ventriculo-arterial coupling improved, and both total and resting energy consumption decreased. On the other hand, LV biplane EF and GLS remained unchanged. Conclusions This study confirms the validity and clinical accessibility of non-invasive pressure-volume loop analysis in patients with aortic stenosis. The method identified and characterized changes in myocardial energetics, function, and ventriculo-arterial interaction, that are not typically detected by conventional echocardiography. These findings highlight the potential of non-invasive pressure-volume analysis in clinical and research practice."
OpenAlex,aortic stenosis,Outcomes of aortic valvuloplasty with pericardium patch for congenital aortic stenosis and regurgitation in pediatric patients,Pinyan Huang; Junjie Zong; Weicong Ye; Song Wang; Ran Li; Han Zhang; Zilong Luo; Jiahong Xia; Jizhang Yu; Jian Wu; Cheng Zhou,10.3389/fcvm.2025.1724329,2026-01-21,Frontiers in Cardiovascular Medicine,"Background Surgical strategies for congenital aortic stenosis and regurgitation in children, particularly in infants (&amp;lt;1 year), remain controversial. Aortic valvuloplasty (AVP) with pericardial patch has gained increasing attention, but its durability and clinical benefits remain uncertain. Methods We retrospectively analyzed pediatric patients (≤12 years) undergoing AVP with pericardial patch in our center between July 2017 and July 2025. Infants (&amp;lt;1 year) were analyzed separately as subgroups. Primary outcome was the change in aortic valve hemodynamics, including median peak gradient, median peak velocity, and degree of aortic regurgitation. Secondary outcomes included major complications, overall survival, and freedom from reoperation. Results A total of 35 patients were included, with a median age of 2 years. Among them, 17 were infants, with a median age of 2 months. The median peak aortic valve gradient decreased from 67.0 mmHg to 33.0 mmHg ( p &amp;lt; 0.001), and the median peak velocity decreased from 4.1 m/s to 2.9 m/s ( p &amp;lt; 0.001), postoperatively. No new moderate or severe aortic regurgitation was observed early postoperatively, and preexisting lesions of this severity were resolved. There were no in-hospital deaths or severe complications. At four years, survival was 96% and freedom from reoperation 75.4% in the overall cohort; in infants, survival was 100% with 66.7% freedom from reoperation. Conclusions AVP with pericardium patch is a safe and effective procedure for congenital aortic stenosis and regurgitation in pediatric patients. It represents a promising surgical option for pediatric patients, including infants."

Transcatheter aortic valve replacement has become a revolutionary treatment practice, utilizing various access options, including transfemoral, transaortic, transapical, and other alternatives. The choice of access significantly impacts the safety and outcomes of the procedure. Objective: The study was aimed to analyze the immediate and long- term outcomes on adoption of transapical and transaortic accesses in aortic valve replacement using the domestic MedLab-KT prosthesis. Methods: From June 2018 to September 2025, 66 transcatheter aortic valve replacement surgeries were performed via transapical and transaortic approaches using the “MedLab-KT” prosthesis, including 4 repeat procedures for dysfunction of the biological aortic valve prosthesis by the valve-in-valve technique. A retrospective analysis of the results was conducted, assessing preoperative, intraoperative, and early and late postoperative data. Criteria for technical success, device success, and early safety were assessed. Patients were divided into groups according to time intervals, namely 2018–2021 and 2022–2025, to evaluate the impact of accumulated experience on immediate and long-term surgical outcomes. Results: Intraoperative mortality was recorded in a single case (1.6 %). The rate of 30-day mortality was 9 % (6 patients). The aortic valve implantation procedure was technically successful in 62 cases (93.9 %). Device success was recorded in 56 patients (84.9 %). The early safety rate was 83.3 %. The average follow-up period was 3.5 years. With the accumulation of experience, the early safety rate increased by 15 % but no significant difference was revealed. The rate of 5-year freedom from reoperations was 100 %; 5-year survival rate was 87.9 %. Moreover, 5-year freedom from valve dysfunction was 97.5 % (95 % CI 0.92; 1). Conclusion: The results of this study demonstrate the efficacy and safety of the transapical and transaortic approaches in transcatheter aortic valve replacement using the domestic prosthesis “MedLab-KT”, which demonstrates satisfactory hemodynamic characteristics for the mid-late postoperative period. Analysis of the immediate and long- term results allows us to recommend the transaortic and transapical approaches as alternatives when the transfemoral approach is not possible."

Although TAVI generally has favorable outcomes, prosthetic valve endocarditis (PVE) remains a serious complication, with high morbidity and mortality. Registry data show post-procedural bacteremia in 4.2% of TAVI patients, mainly caused by Enterococcus spp, streptococci, and Staphylococcus aureus. Antibiotic prophylaxis is recommended, but guidelines are based on limited evidence. Methods A survey of 39 major TAVI centers in Europe and North America assessed peri-procedural antibiotic practices. Thirty-seven centers (95%) responded, providing data on antibiotic type, dosage, and timing. Results Cephalosporins were used in 70% of centers, typically as a single dose; penicillin-based regimens and amoxicillin/clavulanic acid were less common. There was notable variability in antibiotic selection, dosage, and timing. Concerns about cephalosporin efficacy against Enterococci led to interest in alternative regimens. Conclusion Significant variation exists in peri-procedural antibiotic regimens for TAVI. Randomized trials are needed to identify optimal prophylaxis, especially for preventing Enterococcal PVE, and to guide future recommendations."

Methods In this retrospective cohort study, we analysed 22 906 patients with HF undergoing echocardiography between 2010 and 2020. AS was classified as mild, moderate, low-gradient (LG) or severe according to guideline criteria. Outcomes were assessed using Cox regression, stratified by HF subtype and adjusted for clinical confounders. The primary endpoint was event-free survival, defined as all-cause mortality or aortic valve replacement (AVR). Results Moderate AS was present in 5.5%, LG AS in 2.5% and severe AS in 6.5% of HF patients, with HF with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) being the most common HF subtype across all AS grades. Increasing AS severity was associated with a stepwise increase in adverse outcomes compared with HF patients without AS (adjusted HR 2.20 (95% CI 2.00 to 2.41) for moderate AS; 3.32 (95% CI 2.97 to 3.72) for LG AS and 6.20 (95% CI 5.74 to 6.69) for severe AS). These associations were consistent across HFpEF, HF with mildly reduced EF and HF with reduced EF. Despite established guideline indications, only 59.5% (95% CI 57% to 62%) of HF patients with severe AS underwent AVR within 2 years. Conclusions AS is common in HF and is associated with substantially worse long-term outcomes across all HF subtypes, even at non-severe stages. The high mortality risk and frequent lack of intervention highlight major treatment gaps and underscore the need for prospective trials evaluating earlier intervention strategies."
OpenAlex,aortic stenosis,The immunophenotype of peripheral blood monocytes in aortic stenosis during different rates of disease progression,Henrik Janning,10.15496/publikation-115495,2026-01-21,Universitätsbibliothek Tübingen,"Aortic stenosis (AS) is a common valvular heart disease (Iung et al., 2019) with an increasing prevalence (Danielsen et al., 2014) and potentially fatal consequences (Members et al., 2012). Currently, treatment is mainly limited to surgical or interventional aortic valve replacement (Otto et al., 2021b). Disease progression varies significantly between patients, and predicting its course remains challenging (Willner et al., 2023), partly due to an incomplete understanding of the underlying pathophysiology. Recent research has shifted away from the theory of passive development toward an active process heavily influenced by various immune cells (Goody et al., 2020b, Bartoli-Leonard et al., 2021). Monocytes are gaining growing interest due to their influence on disease initiation and progression (Lassalle et al., 2022, Zhang et al., 2022b). The aim of this study was to gain deeper insights into the influence of monocytes on the progression rate of AS. Patients with severe symptomatic aortic stenosis were divided into two groups based on the annualized change in maximum transvalvular flow velocity measured during echocardiography: (1) fast progressive AS (FP-AS) and (2) slow progressive AS (SP-AS). Peripheral blood monocytes from both patient groups were analysed using flow cytometry, including both traditional and unsupervised analytical approaches. A comparison of the monocyte immunophenotypes revealed significant differences between patients with fast AS progression and those with slow AS progression. Monocytes from FP-AS patients exhibited an elevated expression of various chemokines and receptors, which may contribute to an accelerated disease progression through their distinct functions. Most striking was the upregulated expression of the chemokine MIF, which is already known for its pro-inflammatory effects in several diseases (Calandra and Roger, 2003, Bernhagen et al., 2007). Further analyses by Mueller et al. (2024) of the same patient cohort support the pro-inflammatory influence of MIF and its interaction with immune cells in FP-AS. These findings collectively suggest a critical role for monocytes and MIF in the pathophysiology of FP-AS. Consequently, alteration of monocyte activity and Inhibition of MIF may represent promising therapeutic approaches for FP-AS and should be subject to future investigations. Furthermore, the identification of patients at risk of FP-AS might be facilitated in the future through analysis of chemokine expression profiles."

According to current guidelines, surgical treatment is recommended for severe AS in patients with symptoms of heart failure, a reduced ejection fraction (EF), and global left ventricular (LV) Strain. LVEF does not always reflect its contractility. Assessing right ventricular (RV) function is also important, as its dysfunction may persist even after aortic valve surgery. Objective: The study was aimed to assess RV global strain, strain of RV free wall and LV myocardial performance in patients with severe AS. Methods: This prospective non-randomized study included 72 patients with degenerative aortic valve disease and an effective orifice area of less than 1.0 cm2. The complex of examination methods included echocardiography and Speckle Tracking Imaging-2D Strain technology for assessing LV and RV deformation, LV myocardial function, 3D visualization of RV with subsequent construction of a 3D RV model and calculation of EF, fractional area change, linear dimensions, and tricuspid annulus displacement amplitude. Results: Decreased LV myocardial function was detected in 24 patients (33.3 %). Subclinical RV systolic dysfunction, namely decreased RV global strain, was detected in 40 (55.6 %) patients, while decreased RV free wall strain was observed in 11 (15.3 %) patients. Interplay was revealed between subclinical RV systolic dysfunction and LV myocardial performance in patients with severe AS. Conclusion: Subclinical LV and RV dysfunctions are observed in a significant number of patients with severe AS. Analysis and use of these data will enable to change the approach to the AS classification and the timing of surgical treatment in the future. Conclusion: Subclinical left and right ventricular dysfunction is observed in a significant number of patients with severe aortic stenosis based on echocardiography. Analysis and use of these data will likely lead to changes in the classification of AS and the timing of surgical treatment. Keywords: aortic stenosis, echocardiography, right ventricular systolic dysfunction, left ventricular myocardial function, right ventricular deformation."
