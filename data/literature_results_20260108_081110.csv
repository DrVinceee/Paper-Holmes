The Pullback Pressure Gradient (PPG), a novel physiological metric, categorizes coronary artery disease (CAD) into focal or diffuse patterns based on coronary physiology.
This study investigates the association between the PPG and coronary atherosclerosis, as characterized by intravascular ultrasound (IVUS).
This is a pre-specified analysis of the PPG Global study (NCT04789317). We included stable patients with hemodynamically significant lesions (FFR ≤0.80) undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) guided by IVUS. PPG was calculated from manual FFR pullbacks before PCI. Pathophysiological CAD patterns were classified as focal or diffuse based on the median PPG (0.62).
A total of 261 patients (264 vessels) with PPG and IVUS were included. The mean age was 69±11 years, 77% were male, and 33% had diabetes mellitus. A significant correlation was observed between PPG and plaque burden (r=0.53, 95% CI 0.43-0.61, p<0.001). Vessels with focal CAD exhibited significantly higher plaque burden compared to those with diffuse CAD (83±6% vs. 76±8%, p<0.001). The prevalence of attenuated plaques was greater in vessels with high PPG (68% vs. 39%, p <0.001), while calcified plaques were more frequent in vessels with low PPG (60% vs. 78%, p=0.003).
In vessels with flow-limiting stenoses, high PPG is associated with increased plaque burden. Vessels with high PPG (focal disease) predominantly exhibited lipid-rich plaques, whereas those with low PPG (diffuse disease) had a greater calcium burden."

Data on bridging stent choice in IBD are limited. The aim of this meta-analysis was to assess Advanta V12/iCast outcomes when used as bridging stent during IBD procedures.
The English medical literature was systematically searched through PubMed, Scopus, and Cochrane Library (last search: 03.01.2025). The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses statement was followed, and a predefined protocol was registered to PROSPERO. Randomized controlled trials and observational studies (2000--2025) reporting on the Advanta V12/iCast-related outcomes were eligible. The ROBINS-I tool and Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluations (GRADE) were used to assess the risk of bias and quality of evidence. Primary outcomes were technical success, stenosis/occlusion, endoleak Ic/IIIc, and reintervention rates during follow-up. Data on the outcomes of interest were synthesized using proportional meta-analysis.
From 2698 study reports, 10 observational studies (510 targeted IIAs, 467 IIAs bridged with Advanta V12/iCast) were included. According to ROBINS-I, eight studies were of low and two were of moderate quality. Technical success was 98% (95% confidence interval (CI) = 93%-100%; I2 = 0%; certainty: very low). Regarding the 30-day outcomes, the occlusion/stenosis rate was 2% (95% CI = 0%-9%; I2 = 0%), the endoleak Ic/IIIc rate was 0.3% (95% CI = 0%-3%; I2 = 0%) and the reintervention rate was 1% (95% CI = 0%-3%; I2 = 0%). The mean follow-up among studies was 23.4 months (95% CI = 14.2-32.7). During follow-up, the occlusion/stenosis rate was 4% (95% CI = 1%-11%; I2 = 19%; certainty: very low), the endoleak Ic/IIIc overall rate was 5% (95% CI = 3%-8%; I2 = 0%; certainty: very low), and the reintervention rate was 5% (95% CI = 3%-9%; I2 = 0%; certainty: very low).
The Advanta V12/iCast balloon-expandable covered stent showed low occlusion/stenosis, endoleak, and reintervention rates at 30 days and follow-up and appeared to be a reliable bridging stent choice in IBDs.Clinical ImpactThe available literature on iliac branch devices does not provide adequate evidence supporting bridging stent selection. This systematic review and meta-analysis on the use of Advanta V12/iCast as bridging stent showed a high technical success rate of 98%, along with low occlusion/stenosis, endoleak Ic/IIIc and reintervention rates at 30 days, which were maintained below 5% during the total follow-up. These results reflect on the reliability of Advanta V12/iCast when used as bridging stent in iliac branch devices. However, the low quality of evidence should be considered upon result interpretation."

Classically, TAVI is performed via femoral arterial access. However, some patients who have severe peripheral arterial disease do not have safely accessible femoral arteries. In such patients, the use of carotid access has been well described via the 'clamp-and-sew' technique. We describe a minimally invasive carotid access technique for TAVI deployment. The right common carotid is accessed by a 3 cm suprasternal incision. The carotid sheath is entered, and the surgeon obtains proximal and distal control of the carotid artery. The surgeon then makes two opposing purse strings over the anterior surface of the carotid artery. The Seldinger technique is used to obtain access to the carotid artery, followed by placement of the TAVI sheath. The valve is then deployed and echocardiographically confirmed. Upon removal of the TAVI sheath, the purse strings are tightened and sequentially tied. Haemostasis is achieved and skin is closed. This minimally invasive TAVI technique provides an option for patients with unfavourable peripheral access sites while offering the benefits of TAVI compared to open valve replacement."

The complication rate of transfemoral access BAV (transfemoral valvuloplasty [TFV]) is comparable to that of transcatheter aortic valve replacement. Transradial access BAV (transradial valvuloplasty [TRV]) is technically feasible; however, comparative data for TFV are lacking. We aim to compare TFV and TRV in terms of technical and hemodynamic success, periprocedural safety, and short-term clinical outcomes.
Consecutive patients undergoing BAV at a tertiary center from 2021 to 2024 were assessed. TRV was performed with ultrasound guidance and an 8F short sheath equipped with compatible balloons. Hemodynamic success was defined as a reduction in gradient of 30% or more. The primary outcome was the periprocedural composite of a Valve Academic Research Consortium (VARC) 3 major vascular complication, grade 3 to 4 bleeding, and balloon entrapment, and nonaccess-related events, including complete heart block, periprocedural stroke, hypotension, severe aortic insufficiency, and periprocedural death. The secondary outcome was the 30-day composite of all-cause mortality, cardiac-related hospitalization, and discharge failure. Inverse probability of treatment weighting, followed by multivariate regression, was employed to address confounders.
105 TRV and 148 TFV were included. Technical success rate was 96.2% for TRV and 98.7% for TFV (P = .21). The primary outcome event rate was significantly lower in the TRV compared to the TFV group: 2.53% vs 17.47%; adjusted odds ratio, 0.13; 95% CI, 0.04-0.49; P = .003. Technical and hemodynamic success and secondary outcomes were comparable between TRV and TFV.
In comparison to TFV, TRV is associated with lower rates of periprocedural safety events while maintaining similar short-term clinical outcomes and hemodynamic performance."

Future TAVR was classified as challenging if the simulated neo-skirt was at or above the coronary ostia and <4 mm away from the coronary ostia and/or <2 mm from the sinotubular junction or aortic wall.
A total of 245 patients were evaluated (n = 117 TAVR using SAPIEN 3 at ≤90% implant depth, n = 66 TAVR using SAPIEN 3 at >90% implant depth, n = 31 SAVR, n = 31 SAVR with ARE). The proportion of patients where the simulated neo-skirt was below both coronary arteries was the highest in TAVR with implantation depth ≤90% (47.0%), intermediate in TAVR using SAPIEN 3 at >90% implant depth (22.7%) and SAVR (12.9%), and the lowest in SAVR with ARE (0%), (p < 0.001). Challenging anatomy for future TAVR was identified in 9.8% of TAVR at ≤90% implant depth, 28.8% of TAVR at >90% implant depth, 22.6% of SAVR, and 29.0% of SAVR with ARE (p < 0.001).
Based on post-treatment computed tomography analysis, TAVR with SAPIEN 3 at implant depth ≤90% was the most repeatable initial intervention whereas SAVR with ARE did not improve the feasibility of future TAVR."

In these cases, supra-annular (SA) self-expandable valves (SEVs) may offer better results than intra-annular SEVs (IA SEVs). This study evaluated clinical and hemodynamic outcomes for SA SEVs (Evolut valves, Acurate valves) and IA SEVs (Portico/Navitor valves).
We analyzed data from patients who underwent TAVR in Sweden between 2013 and 2022 with an annular diameter ≤23 mm, using inverse probability of treatment weighting. Endpoints included mortality, device, and technical success as per Valve Academic Research Consortium 3 definitions. Other endpoints were the incidence of post-TAVR mean or peak gradients over 20 and 40 mmHg, respectively, significant paravalvular leakage, new pacemaker implantation, and postprocedural aortic valve gradients.
The study included 1068 patients, with a median age of 81.2 years, and 88% were women. After inverse probability of treatment weighting adjustment, no differences were observed in the outcomes apart from a marginally lower risk of postprocedural mortality in the Portico/Navitor valves compared to the Evolut valves (adjusted odds ratio: 0.99; p ​= ​0.05; 95% CI: 0.98-1.00). Hemodynamically, the Evolut valves showed the lowest mean gradients, followed by the Portico/Navitor valves and the Acurate valves (7.97 vs 9.02 mmHg vs. 0.84 mmHg, respectively, p ​< ​0.001; 95% CI: 0.35-1.00).
SA and IA SEVs show comparable clinical outcomes and excellent hemodynamic performance in patients with small aortic annuli. Further studies, including randomized trials, are needed to provide clearer guidance on valve selection."

It improves cardiac function by reducing left ventricular outflow tract obstruction. However, safety data in patients with liver and kidney impairment are limited.
A 68-year-old man was admitted with a history of HOCM, heart failure, gout, and chronic kidney and liver impairment. He was admitted because of worsening heart failure symptoms and an episode of upper gastrointestinal bleeding. The combined burden of these illnesses significantly impaired his ability to perform daily activities independently, leading to hospitalization for optimized management of his advanced cardiac disease.

Cavitron ultrasonic surgical aspiration (CUSA) has been reported as a method for controlled debridement of severe MAC during mitral valve surgery, however experience in the literature is limited.
We assessed 30-day and intermediate-term outcomes in 67 consecutive patients (mean age: 72 (SD 9) years; female sex: 65.7% (44/67)) with severe MAC who underwent mitral valve repair or replacement for mitral stenosis and/or regurgitation using CUSA between 3/2021 and 12/2024. Operations included isolated mitral valve replacement (41.8% (28/67)), isolated mitral valve repair (4.5% (3/67)), mitral and aortic valve replacement (37.3% (25/67), mitral valve replacement with coronary bypass (6.0% (4/67)), and mitral and aortic valve replacement with coronary bypass (10.4% (7/67)). Intermediate survival was estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method.
Mortality rate was 6.0% (4/67), stroke was 3.0% (2/67), and new postoperative atrial fibrillation was 29.0% (20/67). There were no atrioventricular groove ruptures. At a median echocardiographic follow-up time of 361 days (IQR 112, 671) moderate paravalvular leak occurred in 3.0% (1/67). Mid-term all-cause mortality was 9.0% at a mean follow-up time of 42.5 (95% CI 39.0, 46.0) months.

Here we demonstrate that sphingosine kinase 1 (SPHK1) is a key node in these contexts. Sphk1 is the most upregulated transcript in Eln(-/-) aortic SMCs at embryonic day 15.5 when these cells are initially hyperproliferative. The aorta of humans with SVAS also upregulates SPHK1. Reduced ELN increases levels of transcription factor early growth response 1, resulting in increased SPHK1 levels. SMC-specific Sphk1 deletion or pharmacological inhibition of SPHK1 attenuates SMC proliferation and mitigates aortic disease. Furthermore, treatment with a SPHK1 inhibitor reduces DA SMC accumulation, leading to DA patency in wild-type mice. These findings indicate that inhibiting SPHK1 may be a therapeutic strategy for SVAS and select congenital heart diseases in which patent DA maintains circulation."

This review examines AI applications in VIR procedures that utilize imaging modalities as input across preprocedural, intraprocedural, and post-procedural stages. A comprehensive literature search across PubMed, Embase, and Web of Science identified studies employing AI models with direct patient care impact, categorized by imaging modality (CT, MRI, fluoroscopy/DSA, ultrasound, X-ray, and multimodal) and task type (segmentation, detection, prediction, and miscellaneous). AI demonstrated substantial promise across multiple VIR domains. Deep learning models achieved high Dice similarity coefficients (0.82-0.962) for anatomical structure segmentation including aortic dissections and abdominal aortic aneurysms. Detection tasks showed excellent performance with accuracies up to 95% for endoleak detection and AUCs reaching 0.97 for vessel stenosis identification. Prediction models frequently outperformed traditional clinical assessments, with AUCs exceeding 0.90 for outcomes after EVAR, TEVAR, TACE, and TARE procedures. Radiomics-based approaches combined with machine learning proved particularly effective for treatment response prediction and risk stratification. Despite challenges including limited dataset sizes, potential bias, and interpretability concerns, AI shows transformative potential in VIR. Continued clinician AI expert collaboration will be crucial for responsible deployment and optimization of patient care in interventional radiology."

The purpose of this study was to improve the accuracy of PGAV measurements by echocardiography in small annuli and to evaluate the influence of PGAV on prognosis. The internal derivation cohort included 273 consecutive patients with aortic stenosis and a small annulus (computed tomographic scan showing an annulus circumference < 72 mm or area < 400 mm2) who underwent TAVR. Patients completed transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) and LHC measurements during TAVR, and an extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost) algorithm was trained. The primary outcome was a composite end point of all-cause mortality and readmission for heart failure. The mean PGAV level measured by TTE was overestimated compared to the LHC measurement {52.5 [interquartile range: 47.5-57.0] mmHg vs. 42.5 (interquartile range: 38.0-46.0) mmHg, P < 0.001}. After adjustments to the XGBoost, the mean PGAV measured by TTE could be significantly improved [Pearson correlation coefficient = 0.94, P < 0.001]. Importantly, patients with a predicted mean PGAV ≥ 68.6 mmHg showed a significantly increased incidence of composite end points at 2 years after the procedures (40.7% vs. 16.0%, P < 0.001). The XGBoost model could effectively improve the accuracy of the mean PGAV measured by TTE during TAVR, and the predicted mean increase in the PGAV level may lead to a worse prognosis.Clinical Trial Registration: ClinicalTrials.gov Protocol Registration System (NCT05044338)."

Procedural factors associated with THV deformation remain incompletely understood.
We aimed to investigate procedural factors associated with valve underexpansion, mainly derived from preprocedural computed tomography angiography (CTA) imaging.
A single-centre, retrospective, observational study was carried out, including patients who underwent TAVI with an ACURATE THV between January 2014 and December 2022, with available CTA and procedural fluoroscopy. Aortic calcium volume was quantified using 3mensio software. Fluoroscopy was used to determine valve frame underexpansion.
Of 3,027 patients, 480 were eligible (74 [15.4%] with an underexpanded and 406 [84.6%] with an expanded ACURATE THV). There were no differences regarding baseline clinical and procedural characteristics. Preprocedural CTA assessment showed more calcium at the annulus level in underexpanded versus expanded THVs (60.3 [interquartile range [IQR] 21.3; 135.2] mm3 vs 45.3 [IQR 15.8; 96.1] mm3, respectively; p=0.042), while post-dilatation was less frequently performed in underexpanded compared to expanded THVs (44.6% vs 64.8%, respectively; p=0.001). Multivariable regression analysis revealed that annulus calcium volume (odds ratio [OR] 2.333, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.331-4.089; p=0.003) and post-dilatation (OR 0.350, 95% CI: 0.203-0.602; p<0.001) were significantly associated with underexpanded THVs. Sensitivity analysis using annulus calcium volume as a dichotomised variable (>54 mm3) confirmed the significant association with valve frame underexpansion (OR 2.38, 95% CI: 1.37-4.19; p=0.002).
Annular calcium volume was shown to be associated with underexpanded ACURATE THVs, while post-dilatation may reduce valve deformation."

Robust genetic and epidemiologic evidence demonstrates that elevated Lp(a) levels are independently associated with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease and calcific aortic valve stenosis. However, no pharmacologic therapy has yet been approved that specifically lower Lp(a) or to demonstrate a reduction in cardiovascular events. Antisense oligonucleotides (e.g., pelacarsen), small-interfering RNAs (e.g., olpasiran, lepodisiran, and zerlasiran), and oral small-molecule Lp(a) inhibitors (e.g., muvalaplin) have demonstrated profound reductions in circulating Lp(a) concentrations, typically achieving decreases of 80-90%. In some studies, the reductions approached or achieved a near-complete suppression. Current genetic and modeling evidence suggests that an absolute reduction of at least 50 mg/dL in Lp(a) levels is required to achieve meaningful cardiovascular benefits. Large-scale outcome trials are now underway to assess the effects of these emerging therapies on cardiovascular and valvular outcomes. Early findings indicate favorable effects on oxidized phospholipids and vascular inflammation, suggesting broader anti-atherogenic potential. As these agents progress toward clinical use, routine Lp(a) measurement and risk stratification will become increasingly essential for personalized cardiovascular prevention. This review summarizes the molecular biology of Lp(a), highlights the limitations of current therapies, and discusses emerging RNA-based and small-molecule approaches with the potential to redefine the management of residual cardiovascular risk."

We report a case of mitral valve replacement in a 76-year-old woman with a large caseous cavity, coronary artery disease, severe mitral valve stenosis and atrial fibrillation. Preoperative computed tomography showed a large caseous cavity (3 x 3.5 cm) in the posterior annulus extending into the atrioventricular groove. After unroofing and evacuation, the cavity was excluded with a pericardial patch. The lower edge of the patch was sutured to the ventricular side of the cavity; valve sutures passed through the residual posterior leaflet, the upper edge of the patch and the atrial edge of the cavity. The mitral prosthesis was then secured. The patient was weaned from cardiopulmonary bypass without complications. Intraoperative echocardiography demonstrated a well-seated mitral prosthesis with no valvular or paravalvular leaks. Postoperative imaging confirmed successful exclusion of the cavity in the atrioventricular groove. The postoperative echocardiogram revealed a mean gradient of 4 mmHg across the mitral prosthesis and no mitral regurgitation. Patch exclusion of the caseous cavity is a safe and feasible approach to support implanting a mitral prosthesis and obliterating a cavity."

With a focus on the prevalent psychological complications following the onset of this condition, this study aimed to explore the correlation between antenatal depression and Corona disease anxiety, personality traits, and postpartum depression during the COVID-19 pandemic.                                                           Materials and Methods:                     This cross-sectional descriptive-analytical study investigated women receiving care at health centers affiliated with Kerman University of Medical Sciences during the last month of their pregnancy and the postpartum period in 2022. Following the acquisition of informed consent, participants were assessed using various measures, including demographic and obstetric information, the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale, the Corona Disease Anxiety Scale (CDAS), and the NEO Personality Inventory-Revised during their third trimester of pregnancy. The same group of participants completed the Edinburgh Depression Scale and the Corona Disease Anxiety Scale (CDAS) 4-6 weeks after childbirth.                                                           Results and Discussion:                     There was a significant correlation between family income, unwanted pregnancy as perceived by both the mother and father, and antenatal depression. Additionally, marital satisfaction played a significant role in postpartum depression. Furthermore, antenatal depression was significantly associated with neuroticism, agreeableness, and physical symptoms related to Corona disease anxiety. Personality traits, with the exception of extroversion and conscientiousness, and various domains of Corona disease anxiety, excluding psychological symptoms, were also significantly associated with postpartum depression.                                                           Conclusion:                     During pandemics or epidemics, such as the COVID-19 outbreak, experiencing mental distress during pregnancy can contribute to mental health issues during the postpartum period. This risk is particularly true in individuals with unique personality traits, emphasizing the need for increased focus on mental health within prenatal care during these crises."

Results:                     The findings indicated that the most important risk factors for the severity of COVID-19 were heart diseases (OR=1.67,95%CI:1.20-2.30), increasing age (OR=2.23 for age&gt;54, 95%CI:1.70- 2.90), male gender (OR=1.47,95%CI:1.10-1.96), respiratory diseases other than asthma, and frequency of admission (OR=1.60,95%CI:1.20-2.15). All patients who underwent readmission experienced a shorter duration of hospitalization during their subsequent admission (OR=0.94,95%CI:0.91,0.96) and had a higher mortality rate (30% within 14 days, 26.6% between 14-90 days). Patients readmitted at intervals of 14-90 days and greater than 90 days exhibited lower disease severity compared to those readmitted within the 0-14 day period.                                                           Conclusion:                     Examining readmissions, the severity of COVID-19, and the length of hospital stay in affected patients are important factors for planning and allocating resources for COVID-19 management and treatment. These factors can help policymakers develop effective clinical guidelines for hospitalization or outpatient treatment of COVID-19 patients and contribute to reducing the burden of disease in the community."

Kinovea, as an accessible motion-analysis software, provides both visual and quantitative feedback. However, its application in supporting technique development among beginner athletes remains insufficiently explored. Aim: This study aims to describe the use of Kinovea in biomechanics training and examine its contribution to the awareness of kinematic characteristics and movement techniques among beginner athletes. Methods: A descriptive qualitative design involved 72 beginner athletes aged 18–25 years selected through purposive sampling. Data were collected over 16 weeks through interviews, field observations, and motion video recordings analyzed using Kinovea. Kinematic data focused on joint angles, stride behavior, and movement phases during walking, running, and the flight phase. Qualitative data were analyzed using content analysis with NVivo 12, while kinematic results were interpreted descriptively to identify performance patterns and areas for technical refinement. Result: Kinematic analysis showed coordinated joint-angle patterns across all phases. Walking analysis identified arm swing angles of 50.9°–58.8° and leg separation angles of 64.3°–67.2°, indicating a stable gait rhythm. The running analysis revealed knee angles of 68.8°–69.8° and elbow angles of 87.6°–89.1°, indicating efficient propulsive mechanics. The flight phase demonstrated knee angles of 81.2°–87.8° and elbow angles of 80.4°–88.3°, suggesting effective momentum use and postural stability. These measurements supported stride-efficiency assessment and technique evaluation. Qualitative findings revealed that Kinovea enabled athletes to interpret movement phases and identify technical inefficiencies through slow-motion and frame-by-frame visualization. Conclusion: Kinovea supports basic motion analysis by providing clear kinematic information and helping beginner athletes observe and refine their movement techniques. The findings also offer practical value for coaches by enabling more precise identification of inefficient patterns and guiding targeted corrections during early-stage training."

In particular, aortic stenosis (AS) is an independent risk factor for heart failure-related mortality in patients undergoing HD. Recently, the analysis of digitized heart sounds using artificial intelligence (AI) has promoted the automation of cardiac disease detection and technological advances in diagnostic algorithms. Methods: We retrospectively investigated the 203 consecutive patients receiving HD who had undergone visualized phonocardiography using a regulatory-approved medical device (Japan) between January and May 2025 to detect AS. The usefulness of this phonocardiogram device, which utilizes acoustic analysis and an AI-based automatic diagnostic algorithm named the “Super Stethoscope”, was evaluated for the screening of AS in patients undergoing HD based on comparisons with findings obtained from echocardiography. Results: The results showed a significant correlation between the severity of systolic murmurs determined by the AI-based approach and the peak aortic jet velocity measured in 19 patients diagnosed with AS using transthoracic echocardiography (r = 0.578, p &lt; 0.05). Additionally, for the AI-based diagnosis of AS based on systolic murmurs, the sensitivity and specificity in detecting moderate or severe AS were 0.90 and 0.70, respectively, among the patients undergoing HD. Conclusions: The AI-based diagnostic approach using the ECG-gated phonocardiogram “Super Stethoscope” could be a promising tool for AS screening. Transthoracic echocardiography is recommended in cases classified as grade B or higher by AI-based assessment."

We present a case where an apico-aortic conduit offered a safer alternative. Case presentation A 20-year-old woman with Type IIIc GD (homozygous D409H mutation) presented with New York Heart Association (NYHA) Class III dyspnoea, palpitations, and syncope. She had hypertension, hypothyroidism, and a sibling deceased from the same condition. On enzyme replacement therapy for 6 years, she was found to have severe calcification of the aortic valve, root, and ascending aorta, stenosis of arch vessels, grade II aortic regurgitation, mild mitral stenosis, and proximal left anterior descending artery stenosis. Intraoperatively, extensive calcification precluded root and arch reconstruction. A left ventricular apex–descending thoracic aorta conduit with a mechanical valve was constructed, combined with coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) to the left anterior descending artery and an innominate artery bypass. Recovery was uneventful, and follow-up at 13 months showed the patient in NYHA Class I with patent conduit and grafts. Conclusions An apico–aortic conduit can provide a safe and effective solution in GD with porcelain aorta, avoiding high-risk aortic manipulation. To our knowledge, this is the first reported use of a valved conduit in Gaucher-related calcification, broadening surgical options for this complex patient group."

However, in a significant portion of patients, resting findings do not fully reflect the hemodynamic severity of the condition, particularly in asymptomatic individuals with severe valvular disease or those with nonspecific symptoms. In this context, stress echocardiography emerges as a vital imaging modality, providing a dynamic assessment of valvular, ventricular, and pulmonary function under hemodynamic load (from physical exercise or pharmacological agents). Methods: We conducted a comprehensive synthesis and critical evaluation of the current landscape, recent advancements, and future directions regarding the application of stress echocardiography in valvular heart disease. Results: This comprehensive review explores the incremental role of stress echocardiography in valvular heart disease, analyzing the evolution of its clinical applications, from low-flow, low-gradient aortic stenosis to the evaluation of contractile reserve and exercise-induced pulmonary hypertension in mitral stenosis and regurgitation. We discuss standardized protocols, key parameters to monitor, and the diagnostic and prognostic outcomes from major clinical trials and current guidelines. Attention is given to stress echocardiography’s ability to unmask the true severity of the disease and to identify patients at high risk for adverse events, thereby guiding crucial clinical decisions, such as the optimal timing for surgical or transcatheter intervention. Conclusions: The review evaluates the limitations of modality and outlines future research directions, including its integration with new technologies like 3D echocardiography and speckle tracking techniques, to further optimize the role of stress echocardiography as a decision-making tool in the multidisciplinary management of valvular heart disease."

Ruhparwar; Alina Zubarevich; Alexander Weymann,10.3390/jcm15010354,2026-01-02,Journal of Clinical Medicine,"Background/Objectives: Transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) has become the leading treatment option for patients suffering from aortic valve stenosis aged over 70, except in cases of specific contraindications like bicuspid valves, inappropriate access routes, or endocarditis. Minimally invasive aortic valve replacement (MIAVR) has emerged as a potential way to combine the durability of surgery with reduced procedural trauma. This study aims to assess the safety and feasibility of MIAVR in elderly patients. Methods: A total of 990 patients were included in this retrospective cohort study. Among them, 261 (26%) were aged 70 years or older (elderly cohort), and 729 (74%) were younger than 70 years (younger cohort). All patients were followed for at least 30 days postoperatively, with survival data collected through May 2025. Multivariable logistic regression, linear regression, and Kaplan–Meier survival analyses were performed. Results: Elderly patients were more likely to be female (51% vs. 40%, p = 0.001) and carried a heavier burden of vascular and renal comorbidity: renal impairment 33% vs. 17% and extracardiac arteriopathy 45% vs. 30% (both p &lt; 0.001). Major bleeding occurred more frequently in the elderly cohort (7.7% vs. 4.1%; p = 0.02), as did new permanent pacemaker implantation (10% vs. 5.8%; p = 0.021) and sepsis (3.4% vs. 1.1%; p = 0.012). Rates of stroke, perioperative myocardial infarction, ECMO/right-heart failure, re-thoracotomy, and postoperative dialysis were low and comparable across age groups (all p &gt; 0.20). Overall, 30-day mortality was 2.4% (24/990), with crude mortality approximately threefold higher among patients aged ≥70 years (4.6% vs. 1.6%). Conclusions: Our findings indicate that MIAVR is a feasible and safe surgical option across age groups; Elevated morbidity in elderly patients is primarily due to bleeding, pacemaker implantation, and sepsis, while rates of stroke, renal failure, and myocardial infarction are low."
OpenAlex,aortic stenosis,Balloon dilation in sheath technique in transcatheter aortic valve replacement via narrow femoral artery: first-in-human early feasibility study,Xiaoqian Sun; X. Liu; Luyao An; Liangyi Qie; Lianyue Ma; Xiao Meng; Huixia Lu; Guihua Yao; Mei Dong; Guipeng An,10.3389/fmed.2025.1732507,2026-01-02,Frontiers in Medicine,"Background Severe aortic stenosis (AS) imposes sustained pressure overload on the left ventricle, leading to hypertrophy and myocardial fibrosis, which are key features of adverse cardiac remodeling. Timely transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) may reverse these processes. Transfemoral access remains the primary access method for TAVR, but the limited technique restricts early intervention in patients with narrow femoral arteries. This study aimed to evaluate the safety and feasibility of a novel balloon dilation in sheath (BinS) technique designed to facilitate transfemoral TAVR in such patients. Methods This multicenter, prospective, and first-in-human early feasibility study included patients with severe AS and challenging femoral anatomy who underwent TAVR using the BinS technique between February 2023 and August 2024. The primary endpoint was the 30-day rate of major adverse events. The secondary endpoint was the rate of major adverse events at 6 months. The clinical endpoints included major post-procedural complications. Results Fifteen patients (mean age 73.5 ± 7.3 years; 66.7% male) were treated successfully with the BinS technique via transfemoral access. There were no cases of all-cause mortality, stroke/transient ischemic attack, or severe major vascular access site complications defined by Valve Academic Research Consortium (VARC)-3 at both 30 days and 6 months. No myocardial infarction or paravalvular leakage was observed. 12 patients obtained VARC-3 technical success. Two patients experienced postprocedural arterial dissection, and two developed new-onset conduction abnormalities (left bundle branch block or permanent pacemaker implantation). At 30 days, left ventricular ejection fraction improved significantly from 50.8 ± 17.0% pre-procedure to 59.9 ± 14.6% post-procedure ( p &amp;lt; 0.001). Conclusion The BinS technique appears to be a safe and effective method for enlarging the narrow femoral lumens during TAVR. By broadening transfemoral TAVR eligibility, this approach may permit earlier hemodynamic unloading, thereby mitigating adverse cardiac remodeling and potentially improving long-term outcomes. Larger, longer-term studies are warranted to confirm these findings."

Leon; Tamim Nazif,10.1161/circinterventions.125.015441,2026-01-02,Circulation Cardiovascular Interventions,"BACKGROUND: Cardiac conduction disturbances remain the most frequent complication of transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR), but the clinical implications of new left bundle branch block (LBBB) after TAVR remain controversial. Here, we aim to assess the impact of new LBBB after TAVR on patient outcomes in a large, real-world registry. METHODS: The study population consisted of patients in the TVT registry (Society of Thoracic Surgery and American College of Cardiology Transcatheter Valve Therapy Registry) who underwent TAVR for aortic stenosis between 2016 and 2022 and were discharged alive from the index hospitalization. Key exclusion criteria included preexisting conduction defects and a permanent pacemaker before TAVR or during the index hospitalization. Clinical outcomes were compared between patients with and without new LBBB using Cox proportional hazards models adjusted for baseline demographic, clinical, and echocardiographic variables. RESULTS: Among 202 533 TAVR recipients, 32 933 (16.3%) developed new LBBB after TAVR. Over the study period, there was a significant decrease in the incidence of new LBBB from 19.9% in the first quarter of 2016 to 14.4% in the third quarter of 2022. Patients with new LBBB after TAVR, compared with those without LBBB, had significantly greater 1-year all-cause mortality (adjusted hazard ratio, 1.19 [95% CI, 1.13–1.25]; P &lt;0.001), hospital readmission (adjusted hazard ratio, 1.23 [95% CI, 1.19–1.28]; P &lt;0.001), and new pacemaker requirement (adjusted hazard ratio, 3.50 [95% CI, 3.26–3.76]; P &lt;0.001). Patients with new LBBB also had lower Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire Overall Summary scores (adjusted difference, −1.7 points [95% CI, −2.1 to −1.3]; P &lt;0.001) and left ventricular ejection fraction (adjusted difference, −2.8% [95% CI, −3.4% to −2.2%]; P &lt;0.001). CONCLUSIONS: New LBBB after TAVR is associated with worse 1-year outcomes, including death, rehospitalization, and permanent pacemaker, as well as worse health status and lower left ventricular ejection fraction. These findings suggest that continued efforts to limit the development of conduction disturbance after TAVR are warranted."
OpenAlex,aortic stenosis,Outcomes of Surgical versus Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement: A Clinical Review,"Stang, Grace",,2026-01-01,Digital Commons - Gardner-Webb University (Gardner–Webb University),"Introduction: Surgical aortic valve replacement (SAVR) has been the predominant treatment for aortic stenosis (AS) for decades. However, transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) is becoming increasingly popular. Originally, TAVRs were only performed on patients who were deemed high-risk for surgery and would have died without the valve replacement. The purpose of this paper is to determine if TAVR or SAVR has better health outcomes for all patients no matter their surgical risk. Methods: A search via PubMed database was done using the key words “aortic stenosis”, “surgical aortic valve replacement”, “transcatheter aortic valve replacement”, and “mortality.” Additional search filters were applied for randomized control trials, systematic reviews, and meta- analyses. Dates were restricted to the last 5 years, and restrictions were added for English language and free full text only. This yielded 67 results and 5 were selected. Results: Of the five reviewed articles, all were meta-analyses and one systematic review. There was a total of 52122 patients. Primary endpoints across all articles were that there is no significant difference between TAVR and SAVR in the outcomes studied. Discussion: This review of studies provided supportive evidence that both TAVR and SAVR are valid treatment options or AS. TAVR had better short-term outcomes while SAVR had better long-term outcomes."

Makaryus,10.3390/jcm15010316,2026-01-01,Journal of Clinical Medicine,"Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide, with ischemic and structural heart diseases being key contributors. While the 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) is a common low-cost diagnostic test, its interpretation is limited by human variability. Through machine learning with large diverse ECG data sets and artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms, ECG analysis can be automated for pattern recognition with higher accuracy. AI-augmented ECG algorithms have been demonstrated to be able to detect myocardial infarction with high accuracy and reduce door-to-balloon coronary intervention times. Similar models can be utilized to detect subtle ECG waveforms suggestive of current or future asymptomatic left ventricular dysfunction, aortic stenosis, and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. Despite these promising results, there is concern for generalizability and bias or errors in training data. As AI systems evolve to multimodal integration, AI-augmented ECG has the potential to redefine cardiovascular diagnostics and enable earlier detection, risk stratification, and precision-guided interventions."

Emphasis is placed on the involvement of specific coronary vessels and the occurrence of multivessel disease across different types of valvular lesions. Methodology: A total of 335 patients, aged between 18 and 60 years, who had undergone coronary angiography prior to valve surgery, were retrospectively analyzed. CAD was defined as ≥50% stenosis in at least one major coronary artery. The prevalence and distribution of CAD were assessed in relation to various valvular pathologies, including aortic stenosis (AS), aortic regurgitation (AR), mitral stenosis (MS), and mitral regurgitation (MR). Results: The highest prevalence of CAD was found in patients with MR (85.7%) and AS (56.3%), with the left anterior descending (LAD) artery being the most frequently involved vessel. In contrast, isolated left circumflex (LCx) artery involvement was exclusively observed in patients with AR (100%). Three-vessel CAD (3VCAD) was most common among MR patients (85.7%). Combined LAD + LCx involvement was seen in 33.3% of cases, while MS showed a comparatively lower CAD prevalence. Left main (LM) artery involvement, although rare, was most frequently found in MS patients (16.7%). Conclusion: This study highlights a substantial burden and distinct angiographic patterns of CAD among VHD patients undergoing preoperative evaluation. Given the high prevalence, particularly among those with AS and MR, routine coronary angiography should be considered essential in pre-surgical assessment. Further large-scale studies are warranted to strengthen diagnostic and management protocols in local populations."

OpenAlex,aortic stenosis,Utility of Fetal Echocardiography in First-Degree Relatives with Bicuspid Aortic Valve and Normal Obstetric Ultrasound.,Alaa Ismail; Jena Schmidt; Elijah H. Bolin; Benjamin Ittleman,,2025-12-31,PubMed,"This study aimed to evaluate the diagnostic yield of fetal echocardiography (f-Echo) in detecting significant congenital heart disease (CHD) in pregnancies with a first-degree relative with a history of bicuspid aortic valve (BAV) and a normal level II obstetric ultrasound.A retrospective review was conducted of all f-Echos performed between 2019 and 2023 for the sole indication of family history of BAV. Cases with additional indications or affected nonfirst-degree relative were excluded. Postnatal transthoracic echocardiography (t-Echo) data were reviewed when available. Significant CHD was defined as requiring catheter or surgical intervention in the first year of life.Sixty-five f-Echos were included (mean gestational age: 26.6 ± 3.7 weeks). No significant CHD was identified prenatally. Postnatal t-Echo was performed in 41 (63%) cases, with no significant CHD detected. Two (5%) infants were diagnosed postnatally with BAV, neither requiring intervention during the study interval. Minor findings included one case each of pulmonary valve stenosis and atrial septal defect.In pregnancies with a first-degree relative with BAV and a normal obstetric ultrasound, f-Echo showed no added diagnostic value for detecting significant CHD. Based on the state's birth rate (approximately 35,000/year), BAV prevalence (1-2%), and an average family size of 3.08, an estimated 733 to 1,466 pregnancies annually in Arkansas could qualify for f-Echo under current guidelines. At a cost of $1,000 to 5,000 per study, this translates to an annual healthcare expenditure ranging from $733,000 to 7.33 million. These findings support more targeted screening and the need for multicenter studies. · No significant CHD detected with f-Echo.. · Postnatal t-Echo remains definitive.. · Routine f-Echo may add limited value.. · Cost implications warrant reconsideration."

Literature focusing on pediatric population especially in Nepal is scarce. We aimed to describe echocardiographic characteristics and complications in children newly diagnosed with RHD and to assess associations with age and sex.Methods: We conducted a retrospective review of echocardiographic records at Shahid Gangalal National Heart Center from January to December 2018 in children aged ≤15 years with RHD. Data on valve involvement, lesion severity, and complications were extracted and analyzed.Results: Among 9,482 echocardiograms, 133 new pediatric RHD cases (1.4%) were identified. Age ranged from 5–15 years (mean 11.4 ± 2.5 years); 78.9% were aged ≥10 years. Mitral valve involvement occurred in 99.2% of cases; aortic valve was involved in nearly all those with mitral lesions. Combined mitral regurgitation (MR) and aortic regurgitation (AR) was the most common pattern (60.1%), followed by isolated MR (26.3%). Isolated MR (with or without mitral stenosis) was more frequent among females, while AR (with or without MR) occurred more often in males. Severe MR was the predominant severe lesion (57.9%), mainly in older children. Complications included severe pulmonary hypertension (11.3%), pericardial effusion (6%), and infective endocarditis (5.3%).Conclusion: Newly diagnosed pediatric RHD in Nepal nearly always involves the mitral valve, with combined MR and AR being most prevalent. Severity increases with age, and lesion patterns differ by sex. These findings underscore the importance of early detection and tailored management strategies."
OpenAlex,aortic stenosis,TAVI vs SAVR in severe aortic stenosis: A systematic review,Gökhan Ceyhun,10.63909/1453034,2025-12-31,Turkish Journal of Clinical Research,"Severe aortic stenosis (AS) represents a major burden among elderly patients, with high mortality once symptoms develop. Transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) has emerged as an alternative to surgical aortic valve replacement (SAVR), expanding from inoperable to low-risk populations. This systematic review compares short- and long-term outcomes between TAVI and SAVR in patients with severe AS. Following PRISMA 2020 guidelines, PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science were searched (2010–2025). Eligible randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and comparative cohorts reporting mortality, stroke, pacemaker, or valve durability were included. Twenty-one studies (16 RCTs, 5 registries; n≈23,000) were analyzed. Thirty-day mortality was similar (RR 0.94, 95% CI 0.82–1.07). TAVI reduced bleeding (RR 0.63) and acute kidney injury (RR 0.71) but increased pacemaker implantation (RR 2.46) and paravalvular leak (RR 3.32). Five-year results (PARTNER 3, NOTION) showed comparable survival and valve durability. TAVI provides equivalent survival and superior early recovery compared to SAVR, although conduction disturbances and leak remain limitations. SAVR remains preferred for younger or bicuspid patients pending longer durability data."

While her preoperative transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) did not reveal a discrete mass, it showed a mean mitral gradient of 7 mmHg; intraoperative transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) identified a 2 cm × 1.2 cm thrombus on the bioprosthetic MV. Given these findings, the surgical team decided to replace the mitral valve concurrently with LVAD implantation. Although this approach is not routine, the goal was to improve her quality of life and reduce postoperative complications. Post-procedure TEE showed an improved MV mean gradient of 3 mmHg with no evidence of paravalvular leak. The patient was subsequently discharged home in stable condition without any thromboembolic events. This case highlights the challenges of managing complex valvular pathology in patients undergoing LVAD placement."
OpenAlex,mitral regurgitation,NF1 with Multiple Cardiac Structural Abnormalities Leading to Cerebral Infarction,J. Ye; Yiyi Jiang; Hanmin Wang; Dan Wang,10.3390/diagnostics16010163,2026-01-04,Diagnostics,"Background/Objectives: Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is an autosomal dominant disorder driven by mutations in the NF1 gene, whose pathogenesis centers on the loss of neurofibromin function and subsequent hyperactivation of the RAS/MAPK pathway. Notably, to the best of our knowledge and following a systematic literature search conducted by our research team, no cases of NF1 complicated by severe cardiac structural abnormalities that ultimately lead to cerebral infarction have been reported to date. Thus, it is of paramount importance to avoid missed diagnosis by performing comprehensive cardiac-related examinations in patients with NF1. Case Presentation: A 20-year-old male patient diagnosed with NF1 presented with right-sided limb weakness and was initially identified with cerebral infarction. To clarify the underlying etiology, a comprehensive clinical evaluation was performed, including cardiac imaging assessments (to characterize cardiac structural changes) and whole-exome sequencing (to identify the presence of procoagulant gene mutations). Comprehensive evaluation revealed a spectrum of cardiac structural abnormalities in the patient: aortic valve prolapse with severe regurgitation, non-infective vegetations on the aortic valve leaflets, mild-to-moderate mitral regurgitation, left ventricular hypertrophy and dilation, and left atrial dilation. Whole-exome sequencing detected exclusively a pathogenic variant in the NF1 gene, with no other pathogenic/likely pathogenic variants or thrombophilia-associated polymorphisms being found. Laboratory investigations ruled out infectious etiologies, supporting the notion that NF1-mediated cardiac structural and developmental anomalies are the primary driver of cardiac vegetation formation, given the absence of other identified contributing factors; embolization of one such vegetation ultimately led to both splenic and cerebral infarction. Conclusions: This case emphasizes the necessity of implementing early and proactive cardiac evaluations in patients with NF1. Additionally, for NF1 individuals—particularly those presenting with suggestive vascular or cardiac symptoms—a comprehensive multifactorial assessment of thrombotic risk is critical. Collectively, maintaining clinical vigilance for cardiac abnormalities in NF1 patients and avoiding diagnostic oversight is essential to reduce life-threatening risks."

OpenAlex,mitral regurgitation,Coronary Steal Phenomenon: Adult ALCAPA with Surgical Insights and Sustainable Long-Term Outcomes,Hamayat Ullah; Rahmat Nawaz; Ikram Abdelaziz Salih Hassan; Saad Bader Zakai; Hammad Khan; Maria Khan,10.47144/phj.v58i4.3154,2026-01-01,Pakistan Heart Journal,"Background: Anomalous Left Coronary Artery from the Pulmonary Artery (ALCAPA), also known as Bland-White-Garland syndrome, is a rare congenital anomaly in which the left coronary artery arises from the pulmonary artery instead of the aorta. This leads to myocardial ischemia via a coronary steal phenomenon. While typically fatal in infancy, a small proportion of patients survive into adulthood due to the development of extensive collateral circulation from the right coronary artery (RCA). Prompt surgical correction is essential to prevent fatal outcomes. Case Presentation: We report the case of a 36-year-old male who presented with a one-year history of exertional angina (CCS Class II) and dyspnea (NYHA Class III). Investigations revealed ALCAPA with a dilated, super-dominant RCA, and associated partial anomalous pulmonary venous return (PAPVR) and moderate mitral regurgitation. Surgical correction was performed using the Takeuchi procedure with simultaneous mitral valve repair and PAPVR correction. The patient had an uneventful recovery. Results: The patient demonstrated marked postoperative improvement and was discharged in stable condition on postoperative day four. At two-year follow-up, cardiac CT confirmed a patent intrapulmonary baffle with no ischemic changes or mitral regurgitation. The patient remained asymptomatic and resumed normal daily activities, indicating excellent long-term functional recovery. Conclusion: This case highlights the importance of early recognition and individualized surgical planning in adult ALCAPA, particularly when associated with structural defects such as mitral regurgitation and PAPVR. The Takeuchi procedure, when appropriately applied, offers sustainable long-term outcomes and should be considered a viable option in anatomically challenging adult presentations."

Thrombocytosis may increase thromboembolic risk, and severe functional mitral regurgitation (MR) from left-ventricular dilation further worsens clinical status. A 38-year-old woman, three months postpartum, presented with worsening dyspnea, orthopnea, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, and leg edema. She had hypertension and dyslipidemia. Examination revealed fluid overload and elevated jugular venous pressure. ECG showed sinus tachycardia with ST-T changes, and chest X-ray demonstrated cardiomegaly with pulmonary congestion. Laboratory testing identified thrombocytosis (platelets 627,000/µL). Echocardiography revealed severe LV dilation (LVEDD 63 mm), markedly reduced ejection fraction (21%), grade 3 diastolic dysfunction, severe functional MR, and spontaneous echo contrast. This case illustrates the interaction of PPCM, reactive thrombocytosis, and severe MR, emphasizing the need for thorough cardiac–hematologic evaluation and multidisciplinary management to optimize outcomes."
OpenAlex,mitral regurgitation,O04 Oral antimicrobial therapy for infective endocarditis: real-world experience from a teaching hospital in Scotland,Nikolas Rae; Emma Duncan; Neil Stevenson,10.1093/jacamr/dlaf239.004,2026-01-01,JAC-Antimicrobial Resistance,"Abstract Background Treatment of infective endocarditis with oral antibiotics is not common in the UK despite an evidence base supporting this approach in appropriate patients. From late 2022 onwards the Infection Unit in Ninewells Hospital, Dundee, has adopted the use of oral antibiotic therapy in the treatment of selected patients with infective endocarditis. Objectives We aimed to review the clinical efficacy and outcomes in patients treated with oral antimicrobial therapy for infective endocarditis in our unit. Methods We retrospectively reviewed patients treated with oral antimicrobial therapy for infective endocarditis. Patient records were reviewed for basic demographics, endocarditis characteristics and treatment (both IV and oral). Adverse outcomes (defined as all-cause mortality, unplanned cardiac surgery, recurrence of bacteraemia or embolic events) were assessed for within 6 months of completion of therapy. Results In total 29 patients were identified, of which 21 (72%) were male. Mean age was 67 (range 36-94). Of the patients included, 20 were classed as ‘definite’ endocarditis by Duke-ISCVID 2023 criteria, with the remaining 9 meeting ‘possible’ Duke-ISCVID 2023 criteria. Structures involved included aortic valve (15 patients), mitral valve (11 patients), ICED (2 patients) and tricuspid valve (1 patient), with 9 of the 27 valve infections occurring in prosthetic valves. In total, 15 of 29 (52%) patients had moderate to severe valvular regurgitation, 5 (17%) patients had a vegetation of 10mm or greater and 4 patients underwent surgery during the course of their illness. With regards to microbiology, our cohort included 14 patients with Streptococcus spp., 12 patients with Staphylococcus aureus (all MSSA), 2 patients with Enterococcus faecalis and one patient with coagulase-negative Staphylococcus spp. Mean peak C-reactive protein was 163 mg/L (range 17–400) with mean C-reactive protein at transition to oral therapy of 21 mg/L (range 3–98). In total, 22 patients (76%) met the criteria used in the POET trial. Mean duration of IV therapy was 15 days (range 6–30). Mean duration of oral therapy was 26 days (range 14–42). Mean total duration of therapy was 41 days (range 28-56). The final oral antibiotic regimens used included linezolid in 19 patients (65%), amoxicillin in 5 patients (17%), co-trimoxazole in 3 patients (10%) and amoxicillin with rifampicin in 2 patients (7%). Change of oral agent due to adverse drug effects was required in 6 patients, all occurring in patients prescribed linezolid. Adverse outcomes occurred in three patients (embolic events in two patients and one death 4 months after treatment completion due to cardiac failure), with 5 patients yet to complete the full 6 month follow-up period. Conclusions Oral antimicrobial therapy can be used in appropriate patients with infective endocarditis, with good efficacy and relatively low rates of adverse effects despite significant complexity of illness. Alteration of oral regimen was frequently required when linezolid was used."

Methodology: A descriptive, observational study was conducted at the Pediatric Cardiology Department of Faisalabad Institute of Cardiology (FIC), Pakistan, from February to July 2023. Patients aged ≥10 years with unoperated VSD were enrolled, and the diagnosis was confirmed via transthoracic echocardiography. The clinical presentation, type of VSD, associated cardiac conditions, and complications were analyzed. Results: A total of 128 patients were included, with 60.9% aged 10–18 years and 39.1% aged over 18 years. Males accounted for 55.5% of the cohort. Most patients (89.1%) presented at the outpatient department. Perimembranous VSD was the most common type (58.6%), followed by sub-arterial (23.4%), inlet (7.8%), and muscular (7.8%) defects. Pulmonary hypertension (21.9%), aortic valve prolapse (12.5%), and mitral regurgitation (10.2%) were the most frequent associations. Eisenmenger syndrome (31.3%) was the most common complication. Older patients were significantly more likely to have pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) (p = 0.0006) and Eisenmenger syndrome (p = 0.0002). A significant association was found between VSD type and aortic valve prolapse (p &lt; 0.0001). A p-value &lt; 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Conclusion: Perimembranous VSD is the most prevalent defect in adolescents and adults. Many patients experience worsening functional status, with Eisenmenger syndrome emerging as a major complication. Early screening and timely intervention are crucial in preventing disease progression. Serial echocardiography should be incorporated into follow-up care for all unrepaired VSD patients. Establishing specialized adult congenital heart disease (ACHD) clinics in tertiary hospitals is essential for long-term management and improving patient outcomes."

Examination revealed a holosystolic murmur and right costovertebral angle tenderness. Investigations showed raised inflammatory markers and a positive rheumatoid factor, while repeated blood cultures were negative. Echocardiography showed severe mitral regurgitation without visiblevegetations, and computed tomography angiography confirmed right renal infarction. Using modified Duke criteria, the diagnosis was made and empiric intravenous vancomycin and ceftriaxone were started. Despite intensive care and aggressive therapy, she deteriorated and died from refractory heart failure due to severe valvular dysfunction. This case shows the disease can be insidious even in low-risk patients, stressing early suspicion, multidisciplinary care, and timely surgical evaluation when appropriate."

These patients are refractory to routine treatment, but the timely diagnosis of the underlying etiology and correction of calcium promptly restores myocardial function. The Case A 55-year-old non-alcoholic and non-smoker female, previously diagnosed as a case of dilated cardiomyopathy, presented with complaints of progressive dyspnoea on exertion from NYHA-II to NYHA-IV over a span of 1 week. At admission the patient was conscious, afebrile; having respiratory distress, peripheral oxygen saturation of 93% at room air, blood pressure of 92/56 mmHg equal in both arms, regular pulse rate of 100 beats per minute, audible left ventricular S3, mild peripheral edema, and bilateral basal crepitations. She was diagnosed to have decompensated heart failure. Chest X-Ray revealed cardiomegaly. Electrocardiogram showed sinus tachycardia (90 beats/minute), QRS axis of -20o, prolonged QTc of 574 milliseconds. Laboratory analysis at admission revealed minimally deranged liver and renal functions, and highly elevated BNP. Relevant biochemical parameters are shown in the given table. Transthoracic echocardiogram revealed dilated left chambers (left ventricle end-diastolic diameter: 61 mm, left ventricle end-systolic diameter: 52 mm), left ventricle (LV) severe global systolic dysfunction (LVEF=22%) due to diffuse hypokinesia, restrictive type of diastolic dysfunction with elevated filling pressure indexes (E/E’=19), mild functional mitral regurgitation, mild tricuspid regurgitation, moderate pulmonary hypertension (systolic pulmonary artery pressure of 50 mmHg). Normal coronary angiography ruled out underlying ischemia. Patient was initially started on furosemide as decongestive therapy. Subsequent investigations conducted due to prolonged QTc revealed severe hypocalcaemia (corrected calcium of 4.38 mg/dL), inappropriately normal PTH, and presence of basal ganglia calcification on CT head was highly suggestive of primary hypoparathyroidism. Parenteral treatment with Gluconic Calcium was started: 950 mg of calcium (1 ampoule) at 6 hours, followed by oral treatment- high dose of calcium (1g TDS) and alfacalcidol (0.25µg TDS) along with management of heart failure. The patient had progressive clinical improvement and was discharged in NYHA class II on Day 10. Patient’s serum calcium progressively improved during course of stay and was within normal limits at the time of discharge. Treatment at discharge included loop diuretic, ACE inhibitor, Calcium, alfacalcidol. Patient was followed up regularly; and NYHA class, renal functions, serum calcium level, and ECG were assessed. At follow up after 3 months, patients had significant improvement in LV function and normalised LV function after 6 months. Conclusion: Considering the rarity of hypocalcemia induced dilated cardiomyopathy in adults, this etiology must be suspected in a cardiac patient with ECG changes suggestive of hypocalcaemia (as in our case). Early calcium supplementation, usually along with vitamin D, reduces and even reverses ventricular hypertrophy and dilatation as well as conduction abnormalities, as it was in our case."

Ravi Kumar; Lachham Kataria; Ali Ammar; Jawaid Akbar Sial; Rizwan Aziz Memon,10.47144/phj.v58is3.2806,2025-12-30,Pakistan Heart Journal,"Objectives: This study aimed to evaluate early postoperative changes in right ventricular (RV) functional parameters and to determine their association with operative characteristics in patients undergoing mitral valve replacement (MVR) for rheumatic mitral valve disease. Methods: A prospective observational study was conducted among 50 patients undergoing MVR at a tertiary cardiac center. Preoperative and early postoperative (within 48 hours) echocardiographic parameters—including tricuspid annular plane systolic excursion (TAPSE), fractional area change (FAC), pulmonary artery systolic pressure (PASP), ejection fraction (EF), and tricuspid regurgitation (TR)—were compared. RV dysfunction (RVD) was defined as FAC &lt; 35%. Changes in RV function were correlated with operative variables, and predictors of postoperative RVD were identified using multivariable logistic regression. Results: The mean age of the cohort was 38.7 ± 12 years, with 60% female participants. Preoperatively, 36% (18/50) had RVD, of which 33.3% improved after surgery, while 66.7% exhibited persistent dysfunction. New-onset RVD occurred in 20% of patients. Significant postoperative reductions were observed in TAPSE (p = 0.013) and EF (p = 0.020), whereas PASP showed significant improvement (p = 0.005). No significant correlations were found between operative times and delta FAC. Preoperative RVD emerged as the only independent predictor of postoperative RVD (adjusted OR 4.06, 95% CI 1.16–14.21; p = 0.028). Conclusions: Early postoperative RV dysfunction is common following MVR, particularly among patients with pre-existing impairment. Operative times did not significantly influence postoperative RV performance, suggesting a multifactorial trajectory of RV recovery. Early identification and closer follow-up of high-risk patients may help improve postoperative outcomes."

Mitral valve cleft is often associated with complete atrioventricular canal defects. However, its association with partial defects is less common and presents unique technical challenges for surgical repair due to distorted annular geometry. The etiology of this lesion is unknown, and diagnosis of mild cases may be difficult at an early age. Although, the severity of regurgitation and valve thickening tend to show a progressive course over time. This case report presents the clinical presentation and a critical surgical challenge treatment of a 26-year-old female patient diagnosed with mitral cleft in conjunction with a partial atrioventricular canal defect, representing an advanced example of this rare association."
OpenAlex,mitral regurgitation,Percutaneous Balloon Mitral Valvuloplasty Using the Inoue Balloon in Children and Adolescents: A Prospective Interventional Before–After Study from a Low-Resource Setting,Raisa Bano; Hussain Bux; Sanam Khan; Veena Kumari; Abdul Sattar Shaikh; Ram Bahadur Chand; Muhammad Ayyaz; Asif Khan; Rumana Sangi,10.47144/phj.v58is3.3389,2025-12-30,Pakistan Heart Journal,"Objectives: This study aimed to evaluate the procedural success, safety profile, and immediate hemodynamic outcomes of percutaneous balloon mitral valvuloplasty (PBMV) using the Inoue balloon in children and adolescents with severe rheumatic mitral stenosis (RMS). Methodology: A prospective interventional before–after design was conducted at the pediatric cardiology department of a major tertiary cardiac center in Pakistan from March 2024 to September 2025. Forty-eight patients under 18 years with severe RMS (mitral valve area ≤1.0 cm²) were enrolled through consecutive sampling. All underwent PBMV using the Inoue balloon technique. Echocardiographic parameters—including mitral valve area (MVA), transmitral gradient, pulmonary artery pressure (PAP), and mitral regurgitation (MR)—were assessed before and immediately after the procedure. Statistical analysis was performed using paired tests, with p&lt;0.05 considered significant. Results: The median age was 15 years (IQR 14–16), and 56.3% were male. PBMV resulted in a significant increase in MVA from 0.7 cm² to 1.6 cm² (p&lt;0.001) and a substantial reduction in transmitral gradient (23 to 7.5 mmHg, p&lt;0.001) and PAP (52 to 35 mmHg, p&lt;0.001). Mild MR developed in 35.4% and moderate MR in 8.3% of patients, with no cases of severe MR. Procedural success was achieved in 83.3% of the cohort. No mortality, cardiac tamponade, or major complications occurred. Mean hospital stay was 2.2±0.5 days. Conclusion: PBMV using the Inoue balloon is a safe, effective, and practical therapeutic option for relieving severe RMS in children and adolescents. The technique provides rapid hemodynamic improvement, low complication rates, and short hospitalization, making it particularly valuable in low-resource regions where rheumatic heart disease remains highly prevalent."
