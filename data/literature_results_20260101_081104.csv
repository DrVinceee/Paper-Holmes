PubMed,aortic stenosis,Prognostic Implications of a Novel Right Ventricle-pulmonary Artery Coupling in Patients with Severe Aortic Stenosis after Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement.,Yuanqi Yang; Yiming Li; Xi Li; Wenxia Zhou; Yujia Liang; Bingjie Li; Zhengang Zhao; Yuan Feng; Xin Wei; Mao Chen,10.1016/j.echo.2025.12.009,2025-12-29,Journal of the American Society of Echocardiography : official publication of the American Society of Echocardiography,"Limited evidence exists concerning the novel right ventricular (RV) coupling to pulmonary artery (RV-PA coupling) in patients with severe aortic stenosis (AS) after transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR). We aimed to evaluate the prognostic value of this RV-PA coupling in patients after TAVR.
RV-PA coupling was defined as the ratio of RV free wall longitudinal strain (RVFWLS) to pulmonary artery systolic pressure (PASP), measured by echocardiography in AS patients undergoing TAVR between April 2012 and November 2022. The endpoints were all cause death, cardiovascular rehospitalization, stroke, and a composite of these.
At a median follow-up time of 3.4 years, 352 (28.8%) patients in 1221 patients had composite clinical events. Patients with higher RVFWLS/PASP ratio were predominantly male, had lower body mass index, more comorbidities, higher Society of Thoracic Surgeons score, more New York Heart Association IV and worse laboratory data, alongside worse cardiac function compared to those with lower RVFWLS/PASP ratio. The fully adjusted multivariable hazard ratios of RVFWLS/PASP ratio and the tertile 3 of RVFWLS/PASP ratio were 2.228 (95% CI, 1.441-3.446) and 2.571 (95% CI, 1.633-4.047). In addition, Kaplan-Meier analyses revealed robust graded association between the RV-PA coupling and clinical outcomes (P <0.001).
The RV-PA coupling (RVFWLS/PASP ratio) is independently and robustly associated with adverse clinical events in patients undergoing TAVR. These data suggest that the RVFWLS/PASP ratio can serve as a risk stratification tool for patient selection and prognostication following TAVR."

This study aimed to evaluate periprocedural and clinical outcomes in patients with large and extra-large annuli undergoing TAVR and to compare results between balloon-expandable (BEVs) and self-expanding valves (SEVs).
This study included patients with severe aortic stenosis (AS) and extra-large annuli who underwent TAVR with either BEVs or SEVs. The primary endpoints were periprocedural and clinical outcomes, including device success, rates of moderate or greater paravalvular leak (PVL), permanent pacemaker (PPM) implantation, new Left bundle branch block (LBBB), stroke, and in-hospital and 1-year mortality. Secondary endpoints included safety outcomes and subgroup analyses comparing outcomes between patients with large (annular perimeter >90 mm and an area >660 mm²) and extra-large annuli (perimeter >96 mm and an area >730 mm²).
A total of 237 patients underwent TAVR, including 160 with BEVs and 77 with SEVs. The mean annular area and perimeter were 737 ± 76 mm² and 96.1 ± 4.1 mm, respectively, with no significant differences between groups. Overall device success was high, though slightly lower in the SEV group (84% vs. 93%, p=0.034), a difference that was no longer statistically significant after multivariate analysis (p=0.234). Moderate or greater PVL occurred more frequently with SEVs (13% vs. 4%, p = 0.016), particularly in patients with extra-large annuli (26% vs. 4%, p = 0.012). One-year mortality was similar between groups (SEV 13% vs. BEV 12%, p = 0.807), and no significant differences were observed in PPM implantation, new LBBB, stroke, or major vascular and bleeding complications.
TAVR is feasible and safe in patients with large and extra-large annuli, with higher rates of moderate or greater paravalvular leak observed in SEV patients with extra-large annuli."

Cases with additional indications or affected nonfirst-degree relative were excluded. Postnatal transthoracic echocardiography (t-Echo) data were reviewed when available. Significant CHD was defined as requiring catheter or surgical intervention in the first year of life.Sixty-five f-Echos were included (mean gestational age: 26.6 ± 3.7 weeks). No significant CHD was identified prenatally. Postnatal t-Echo was performed in 41 (63%) cases, with no significant CHD detected. Two (5%) infants were diagnosed postnatally with BAV, neither requiring intervention during the study interval. Minor findings included one case each of pulmonary valve stenosis and atrial septal defect.In pregnancies with a first-degree relative with BAV and a normal obstetric ultrasound, f-Echo showed no added diagnostic value for detecting significant CHD. Based on the state's birth rate (approximately 35,000/year), BAV prevalence (1-2%), and an average family size of 3.08, an estimated 733 to 1,466 pregnancies annually in Arkansas could qualify for f-Echo under current guidelines. At a cost of $1,000 to 5,000 per study, this translates to an annual healthcare expenditure ranging from $733,000 to 7.33 million. These findings support more targeted screening and the need for multicenter studies. · No significant CHD detected with f-Echo.. · Postnatal t-Echo remains definitive.. · Routine f-Echo may add limited value.. · Cost implications warrant reconsideration."

Performing left atrial appendage closure (LAAC) during TAVI can reduce the risk of thromboembolism while avoiding the need for prolonged anticoagulation.
This single-center study included 5 consecutive patients with severe aortic stenosis and AF who underwent same-session TAVI and LAAC between October 2024 and March 2025. All had contraindications to OAC or high bleeding risk. Procedural details and early outcomes were recorded. Technical success was defined according to Valve Academic Research Consortium-3 (VARC-3) (TAVI) and Munich/The Society for Cardiovascular Angiography & Interventions (SCAI) and the Heart Rhythm Society criteria (LAAC). Continuous variables are presented as mean ± SD or median interquartile range (IQR), and categorical variables as n (%).
Mean age was 75.6 ± 8.4 years; 40% were male. The median Society of Thoracic Surgeons score was 6.0% [IQR 5.5-7.0], median CHA₂DS₂-VA was 4 [4-5], and median hypertension, abnormal renal/liver function, stroke, bleeding history or predisposition, labile INR, elderly, drugs/alcohol concomitantly was 3 [3-4]. All patients received a Meril valve; LAAC devices included Amulet (n = 3) and LAmbre (n = 2). Technical success was achieved in all cases. There were no intra-periprocedural complications, major bleeding (Bleeding Academic Research Consortium ≥3), stroke/transient ischemic attack, or vascular complications. But Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes stage 1 acute kidney injury was observed only in 1 (20%) patient. The median hospital stay was 4 [IQR 3-6] days.
In this study, same-session TAVI and LAAC in AF patients with high bleeding risk were technically feasible and showed an acceptable shortterm safety profile. Larger, prospective studies with longer follow-up are needed to confirm these results."

Cardiovascular interventions,"Heart failure (HF) remains a significant burden following transcatheter aortic valve replacement, adversely impacting survival and quality of life. Identification of patients who may benefit from closer monitoring or adjunctive medical therapy to reduce the risk of HF is an unmet need. The objective of this study was to develop and internally validate a clinical prediction model to determine the 1-year risk of HF hospitalization or death after transcatheter aortic valve replacement.
Using the Society of Thoracic Surgeons/American College of Cardiology Transcatheter Valve Therapy Registry, we analyzed patients who underwent successful transcatheter aortic valve replacement for aortic stenosis and survived to discharge between 2016 and 2019. Covariates were selected based on expert opinion and prior literature. A hierarchical cumulative odds regression model was used to predict a composite outcome of (1) all-cause death, (2) ≥2 HF readmissions, or (3) 1 HF readmission at 1 year.
Among 78 384 patients (median age, 82 years; 45.6% female), 17.4% experienced the composite outcome, including death (10.9%), ≥2 HF readmissions (1.6%), and 1 HF readmission (4.9%). The model demonstrated good discrimination (C statistic, 0.753 derivation and 0.747 validation) and excellent calibration. Among 1-year survivors, performance in predicting HF readmission as an isolated outcome was similar (C statistic, 0.753). A simplified model, including the top 12 variables from the full model, maintained comparable performance (C statistics, 0.74-0.75).
This prediction model effectively stratifies post-transcatheter aortic valve replacement patients by risk of death or HF readmission, supporting its use to guide clinical surveillance and clinical trial enrollment for adjunctive medical therapies aimed at mitigating this risk."

Cardiovascular imaging,"Accurate aortic stenosis (AS) phenotyping requires multimodality imaging which has limited availability. The digital aortic stenosis severity index (DASSi), an AI biomarker of AS-related remodeling on single-view 2-dimensional echocardiography, predicts AS progression independent of Doppler measurements. We sought to evaluate the ability of DASSi to define personalized AS progression profiles and to validate its performance as a scalable alternative to multimodality imaging features of functional, structural, and biological AS severity.
In the SALTIRE-2 trial (Study Investigating the Effect of Drugs Used to Treat Osteoporosis on the Progression of Calcific Aortic Stenosis 2) of participants with mild or moderate AS, we performed blinded DASSi measurements (probability of severe AS, 0-1) on baseline transthoracic echocardiograms. We evaluated the association between baseline DASSi and (1) disease severity by hemodynamic (peak aortic valve velocity), structural (computed tomography-derived aortic valve calcium score), and biological features ([18F]sodium fluoride uptake on positron emission tomography-computed tomography); (2) longitudinal disease progression (change in peak aortic valve velocity and aortic valve calcium score); and (3) incident aortic valve replacement. We used generalized linear mixed or Cox models adjusted for risk factors and aortic valve area.
We analyzed 134 participants (72 [IQR, 69-78] years; 27 [20.1%] women) with a mean baseline DASSi of 0.51 (SD, 0.19). DASSi was independently associated with cross-sectional disease severity: each SD increase was associated with higher peak aortic valve velocity (+0.21 [95% CI, 0.12-0.30] m/s), aortic valve calcium score (+284 [95% CI, 101-467] Agatston units), and [18F]sodium fluoride target-to-background ratiomax (+0.17 [95% CI, 0.04-0.31]). Higher DASSi was also associated with disease progression by Doppler (peak aortic valve velocity) and computed tomography (aortic valve calcium score) at 24 months (P interaction for DASSi × time<0.001), and future aortic valve replacement (75 events over 5.5 [IQR, 2.4-7.2] years, adjusted HR, 1.42 [95% CI, 1.11-1.84] per SD).
DASSi is associated with functional, structural and biological features of AS severity and predicts disease progression and adverse outcomes. DASSi-enhanced echocardiography may provide an accessible alternative to multimodality AS imaging and serve as a predictive enrichment biomarker in clinical trials.

PubMed,aortic stenosis,Simulation-guided design of leaflet height in bicuspidization of the aortic valve.,Alexander D Kaiser; Perry S Choi; Amit Sharir; Alison L Marsden; Michael R Ma,10.1016/j.xjon.2025.09.038,2025-12,JTCVS open,"Bicuspidization repair is typically applied to severe congenital aortic valve lesions. Increasingly, this repair is recognized as an effective and durable surgical approach. The consequences of postoperative leaflet geometry in this repair are relatively unstudied, especially compared with current understanding of optimal geometry for a trileaflet valve. In this work, a computational approach was systematically applied to study the effect of changes in leaflet geometric height in symmetric bicuspidization repair.
Eight model valves with 4 geometric heights spanning a range of typically observed values were constructed at 2 free-edge lengths. Heights varied when loaded in diastole from approximately one-half the annular diameter to just below the annular diameter. Fluid-structure interaction simulations were performed to study the coupled dynamics of the valve and blood. Models were evaluated for stenosis, regurgitation, hemodynamics, mechanics, and diastolic gross morphology.
Cases with loaded geometric height 0.64 to 0.79 times the annular diameter showed the overall best performance, with a coaptation reserve of 4 to 7 mm. Cases with geometric height approximately one-half the annular diameter showed severe regurgitation. Cases with geometric height 0.86 to 0.95 times the annular diameter showed less ""crisp"" coaptation alignment and the appearance of excessive leaflet material.
The intermediate range of geometric height appeared best, with insufficient height causing regurgitation. More geometric height was not always clearly better, as excessively tall leaflets showed less alignment in the coaptation regions."

We aimed to analyze how age, diagnosis, autograft support, and Konno-incision impact outcome.
Patients (0-18 years) undergoing primary/secondary Ross/Ross-Konno from August 1993 to November 2023 were included. Mortality, autograft replacement rate, and greater than mild autograft regurgitation were analyzed in the full cohort and subgroups (age, diagnosis, primary/secondary Ross, Ross/Ross-Konno, autograft support) using time-to-event methods. Propensity-score matching was performed to adjust for differences in baseline characteristics of patients undergoing supported/nonsupported Ross procedures.
In total, 196 patients underwent Ross/Ross-Konno procedures (N = 117/79; 60/40%) with median age/weight of 9.4 years [interquartile range, 3.4-14.1 years]/31.7 kg [12.9-57 kg] and median follow-up of 8.8 years [1.6-14.8 years]. Twenty-year freedom from death, autograft replacement rate, and rate of greater than mild autograft regurgitation was 88.7% (95% confidence interval, 79.8%-93.8%), 13.2% (7.1%-24.7%), and 17.7% (11.3%-27.8%), respectively. Lowest 20-year freedom from death was observed among neonates/infants 47.6% (7.5%-80.8%)/58.9% (34.5%-76.8%) compared with older patients (97.6%; 90.6%-99.4%, P < .001). In total, 83.3% of all deceased neonates/infants had associated mitral valve disease. Patients with isolated aortic valve stenosis and/or Konno-incision were at greater mortality risk (P = .02). 20-year autograft replacement rate was highest among adolescents (12-18 years): 30.7% (15.5-60.9), without statistical significance (P = .08), and greater in secondary Ross: 23.8% (11.4-49.7, P = .03). Matched pairs (supported vs nonsupported Ross, n = 30 each) did not show differences in primary outcomes.
The Ross procedure in pediatric patients demonstrated good long-term outcomes. Mortality risk is greater in neonates/infants and patients with isolated aortic stenosis. Adolescent patients/patients undergoing secondary Ross procedures were associated with greater autograft replacement rates."

The Osaka Prognostic Score (OPS), incorporating CRP, albumin, and lymphocyte count, may address this gap. We aimed to evaluate the prognostic value of OPS for predicting in-hospital and one-year all-cause mortality after TAVI. Materials and Methods: In this retrospective single-center cohort study, 244 patients who underwent transfemoral TAVI between December 2022 and January 2024 were analyzed. OPS was calculated at baseline (range: 0-3), and its prognostic value for in-hospital and one-year all-cause mortality was evaluated using multivariable Cox regression, ROC analysis, and restricted cubic spline (RCS) modeling. Results: In-hospital and one-year mortality rates were 11.5% and 21.7%, respectively. Higher OPS scores were significantly associated with mortality in both periods. OPS independently predicted in-hospital mortality (HR: 2.018; 95% CI: 1.632-2.521; p = 0.017) and one-year mortality (HR: 2.125; 95% CI: 1.300-3.473; p = 0.003). ROC analysis yielded AUC values of 0.776 and 0.859 for in-hospital and one-year mortality, respectively. Kaplan-Meier curves revealed significantly reduced survival in patients with higher OPS (log-rank p < 0.001), and RCS analysis demonstrated a significant nonlinear association between increasing OPS values and mortality risk (p < 0.001). Conclusions: OPS is a simple, cost-effective, and biologically relevant prognostic index that independently predicts both in-hospital and one-year mortality following TAVI. By integrating markers of inflammation, nutrition, and immune competence, OPS may offer additional value in risk stratification and support clinical decision-making in this high-risk population."

Conventional imaging modalities such as ultrasound and computed tomography angiography (CTA) have limited capacity to identify histopathological features of plaque instability, including fibrous cap rupture, lipid-rich necrotic core, and intraplaque hemorrhage. Artificial intelligence (AI) techniques-particularly deep learning (DL) and radiomics-have recently emerged as valuable adjuncts to standard imaging, achieving AUC values of 0.83-0.99 across modalities in identifying vulnerable plaques. This scoping review summarizes the available evidence on the application of AI in the detection and assessment of vulnerable carotid plaques. Methods: A systematic search of the English-language literature was conducted in MEDLINE, SCOPUS, and CENTRAL from 2000 to 30 June 2025, following the PRISMA-ScR framework. Eligible studies applied AI-based approaches (machine learning, deep learning, or radiomics) to evaluate carotid plaque vulnerability using ultrasound, CTA, or MRI. Extracted outcomes included diagnostic performance, correlation with histopathology or neurological events, and predictive modeling for stroke risk. Results: Of 201 records screened, 12 studies met inclusion criteria (ultrasound = 6; CTA = 4; high-resolution MRI = 2; publication years 2021-2025). All reported receiver operating characteristic area-under-the-curve (ROC-AUC) values for endpoints related to plaque vulnerability (symptomatic versus asymptomatic status, presence of intraplaque hemorrhage or lipid-rich necrotic core, fibrous-cap surrogates, and, less frequently, short-term cerebrovascular events). For ultrasound, contrast-enhanced videomics achieved an AUC of 0.87 (10 centers; n = 205), B-mode texture/radiomics reached 0.87 (n = 150), and segmentation-assisted models 0.827 (n = 202); other ultrasound models reported AUCs of 0.88-0.91. For CTA, a symptomatic-plaque machine-learning model yielded AUC 0.89 ( n = 106); a perivascular-adipose-tissue (PVAT) radiomics nomogram achieved AUC 0.836 on external validation; a histology-referenced pilot attained AUC 0.987; and one mild-stenosis TIA model reported ROC performance. For high-resolution MRI (HR-MRI), radiomics-based models showed AUC 0.835-0.864 in single-modality cohorts and up to 0.984 with multi-contrast inputs. Across modalities, AUC ranges were: ultrasound 0.827-0.91, CTA 0.836-0.987 (external 0.836), and HR-MRI 0.835-0.984. Only two out of twelve studies performed external validation; calibration and decision-curve analyses were rarely provided, and most cohorts were single-center, limiting generalizability. Conclusions: AI demonstrates strong potential as a complementary tool for evaluating carotid plaque vulnerability, with high diagnostic performance across imaging modalities. Reported AUCs ranged from 0.83 to 0.99 based primarily on internal or hold-out validation, representing the upper bound of theoretical rather than real-world performance. Nonetheless, large prospective multicenter studies with standardized protocols, histopathological correlation, and external validation are required before clinical integration into stroke prevention pathways."

This effect is exacerbated in the presence of coronary disease (CAD). Treatment with transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) may promote reversal of these pathophysiological conditions.
We performed multimodality assessment of cardiac physiology in patients with AS and concurrent CAD requiring percutaneous coronary intervention, prior to and 6 months after undergoing TAVI. Techniques include: coronary angiography and bolus thermodilution-derived indices of microvascular function (coronary flow reserve (CFR); index of microcirculatory resistance (IMR)); stress perfusion cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) imaging, which was used to measure changes in global myocardial blood flow (MBF) and left ventricular mass (LVM), and computed resting and hyperaemic vessel specific absolute coronary flow (aCBF) and microvascular resistance (MVR) using a computational model of coronary physiology.
Data were obtained for seven patients (10 vessels). CFR increased from 1.53 (1.2-1.7) to 2.35 (2.0-2.7) (p=0.037) 6 months post-TAVI. There was a 33% reduction in resting aCBF from 218 mL/min to 146 mL/min (p=0.004). On CMR, resting MBF fell 37% from 3.0±0.98 mL/min/g to 1.9±0.7 mL/min/g (p=0.033) and stress MBF fell 25% from 3.6±0.57 mL/min/g to 2.7±0.7 mL/min/g (p=0.004). Indexed LVM regressed from 79±14 g/m2 to 71±16 g/m2 (p=0.006). MVR remained unchanged.
CFR increased following TAVI. The mechanism for this was a significant reduction in resting coronary blood flow measured with CMR and modelled computationally. The unchanged MVR and IMR suggest that resting blood flow reduces due to reduced myocardial demand and myocardial remodelling, rather than changes in resistance."

Surgical aortic valve replacement remains the standard treatment but is often deferred due to perceived high surgical risk and frailty, leaving nearly one‑third of patients with severe AR untreated. Transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) offers a less invasive alternative, but off-label use of transcatheter valves designed for aortic stenosis has been limited by anchoring difficulties, valve embolization, and residual regurgitation. Dedicated devices have addressed these challenges with tailored anchoring mechanisms and demonstrated improved procedural success. This case-based review explores the evolving role of TAVR for AR through three patient vignettes that highlight practical considerations for device selection, anchoring strategies, and complication management. While outcomes with dedicated systems are encouraging, further research should establish TAVR in AR treatment. In parallel, device iterations are required to curtail procedure-induced conduction disturbances and broaden anatomical eligibility."

While substituting CT-derived LVOT area in aortic valve area calculations (AVA_CT) increases the calculated valve area, this does not improve its clinical utility. In fact, AVA_CT overestimates the AVA, requiring a higher threshold for defining severe aortic stenosis [AS] (<1.2 cm2). This phenomenon may be attributed to differences in fluid flow dynamics between circular (assumed by echocardiography) and elliptical conduits.
Demonstrate the differences between the calculated AVA before and after implementing a mathematical correction factor for flow in a non-circular conduit.
662 patients with severe AS who underwent aortic valve replacement between 06/2021 and 07/2023. AVA calculated using the continuity equation with both echocardiography and CT data. A correction factor (CF) for elliptical flow was applied per patient.
AVA_CT was significantly higher than AVA_Echo, showing a 23 % increase. After correcting for the elliptical shape of the LVOT, AVA_CT-corrected was lower and closer to AVA_Echo (mean absolute difference of 0.06 cm2) and had superior correlation with invasive measurement. Several patients were reclassified from severe to moderate AS when using AVA_CT; however, applying the correction factor significantly reduced the reclassification.
Incorporating a correction factor for the elliptical geometry of the LVOT improves the accuracy of AVA estimation. The corrected AVA demonstrates better agreement with echocardiographic measurements and reduces the overestimation inherent in CT-based calculations. This approach minimizes discrepancies in patientclassification across AS severity categories."

Secondary outcomes included myocardial infarction, pacemaker implantation, aortic valve reintervention, and structural bioprosthetic valve dysfunction.
Among 1392 transcatheter aortic valve replacement recipients, 423 (78 SEVs, 345 BEVs) met the small annulus criteria. SEVs were associated with lower transvalvular gradients and larger indexed effective orifice area at discharge and 1 year (P<0.001). Moderate-to-severe paravalvular leak was more frequent with SEVs at 30 days (7.7% versus 1.5%, P<0.001), as was permanent pacemaker implantation (17.9% versus 6.1%, P<0.001). At 5 years, the primary outcome did not differ significantly (hazard ratio, 1.21; 95% CI, 0.81-1.82; P<0.33). All-cause mortality, stroke, heart failure hospitalization, structural bioprosthetic valve dysfunction, and reintervention rates were similar between groups.
Although SEVs provide better hemodynamic performance in patients with severe aortic stenosis and small annuli, this advantage did not translate into improved survival or reduced cardiovascular events at 5 years."

The objective of this substudy was to compare echocardiographic findings in women with severe aortic stenosis following surgical aortic valve replacement or TAVI.
At 48 European centers, 443 women underwent randomization 1:1, and 420 were treated as randomized. Echocardiograms were available in 356 patients and were analyzed by a core laboratory.
Rates of or greater moderate paravalvular regurgitation was low (<1%) and similar between groups. At 30 days, TAVI was associated with higher mean transprosthetic gradient and smaller aortic valve area, but the rate of severe patient-prosthesis mismatch (3.0 versus 2.6%; P=1) was low and not different between groups. Valve hemodynamics were stable at 1 year. The rate of residual left ventricular hypertrophy (45.3 versus 28.6%; P=0.004) at 1 year was significantly higher with TAVI, whereas the rate of right ventricular systolic dysfunction (14.5 versus 40.7%; P<0.001) and evolution of cardiac damage stage (improved in 21.8 versus 18.1%; worsened in 16.8 versus 47.0%; P=0.001) were better with TAVI.
Among women with severe aortic stenosis, both TAVI and surgical aortic valve replacement achieve excellent valve hemodynamic results with low and similar rates of moderate or greater paravalvular regurgitation or severe patient-prosthesis mismatch. Surgical aortic valve replacement was associated with lower gradients and more pronounced regression of left ventricular hypertrophy, whereas TAVI was associated with better right ventricular systolic function and evolution of cardiac damage stage.

Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement (TAVR) offers a minimally invasive alternative to Surgical Aortic Valve Replacement (SAVR), particularly for high-risk patients. However, TAVR adoption and outcomes in Japan remain understudied due to limited national database analyses and differences in patient demographics compared to major international trials. We conducted a retrospective cohort study of aortic valve replacement (AVR) procedures from 2014 to 2021 using the National Healthcare Reimbursement database. In total, 103,076 cases were analyzed, with 33,881 undergoing TAVR and 31,337 undergoing SAVR for aortic stenosis. TAVR patients were older (median age 85 vs. 76 years, p < 0.0001) and more often female (66.7% vs. 51.4%, p < 0.0001). TAVR was associated with lower in-hospital mortality (0.88% vs. 2.4%, p < 0.0001), shorter hospital stays (14 vs. 24 days, p < 0.0001), but significantly higher medical costs (¥5,303,722 vs. ¥3,945,622, p < 0.0001). Among patients younger than 75 years, no significant difference in mortality was observed. In this nationwide administrative database, TAVR was associated with lower in-hospital mortality and shorter hospital stays compared to SAVR, though at a higher cost. While patient backgrounds and clinical risks could not be fully adjusted due to data limitations, the observed differences in in-hospital outcomes between TAVR and SAVR reflect real-world practice patterns. These findings should be interpreted as descriptive, not causal. The absence of a mortality difference in patients under 75 years highlights the need for further evaluation of TAVR's long-term effectiveness and cost-efficiency in younger populations."

The advent of transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) has revolutionized the treatment of patients previously considered ineligible for surgical aortic valve replacement (SAVR). TAVR provides a relatively safe intervention that leads to improvements in survival, symptoms, and functional status within months of implantation. A major complication following TAVR is the occurrence of paravalvular leaks (PVLs), which have been associated with increased mortality and higher rates of heart failure-related hospitalizations. PVLs refer to abnormal blood flow between the implanted valve and the aortic wall, which can compromise the functionality of the device. Careful pre-procedural planning enables the identification of patients at higher risk for PVL development. Although the incidence of PVLs has decreased with the introduction of newer-generation transcatheter valves, the condition remains clinically relevant. Due to the complex anatomy of the aortic valve apparatus and interference from the prosthetic frame, accurate evaluation of PVLs requires a multimodal diagnostic approach. Current evidence on PVL management is limited. In most cases, a conservative approach is adopted, while interventional strategies (such as pre- and post-dilatation, percutaneous PVL closure, and TAVR-in-TAVR) are reserved for selected patients. We performed a systematic literature review to summarize the incidence, predictors, diagnostic techniques, and management strategies of PVLs following TAVR."

Beyond simply elevating transvalvular gradient, PPM profoundly affects cardiac remodeling, coronary physiology, and ultimately patient survival. This comprehensive review synthesizes current evidence regarding PPM pathophysiology, clinical consequences, and therapeutic strategies. Methods: We conducted a narrative review of PPM in surgical (SAVR) and transcatheter (TAVR) aortic valve replacement. PubMed and Embase were systematically searched using terms related to AVR and PPM and reference lists of key studies and reviews were screened. Studies addressing PPM prevalence, hemodynamic impact, clinical outcomes, and mitigation strategies were included. Results: PPM, defined as an iEOA ≤ 0.85 cm2/m2 (moderate) or ≤0.65 cm2/m2 (severe), demonstrates variable prevalence across studies, typically ranging from 5 to 30% after SAVR and 2-35% after TAVR. It is associated with increased transvalvular gradients, reduced left ventricular mass regression, persistent coronary flow abnormalities, higher rates of heart failure, and both early and late mortality. Supra-annular self-expanding transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) devices and newer generation stentless or bovine pericardial surgical valves exhibit lower PPM rates than older stented or porcine valves. Valve-in-valve (ViV) TAVR and bioprosthetic valve fracture (BVF) can improve outcomes in failed surgical valves but are less effective in small annuli. TAVR-in-TAVR procedures are limited by anatomic and technical constraints, especially in maintaining coronary access and minimizing residual gradients. Conclusions: PPM remains a common and clinically consequential complication of AVR that compromises long-term outcomes. It is largely preventable through accurate preoperative imaging, valve sizing, and consideration of annular enlargement. Optimal outcomes require matching valve characteristics to individual patient anatomy and physiology. In an era of expanding TAVR use, preventing PPM during the index procedure is critical to optimizing survival and preserving future reintervention options."

This study compares the early outcomes of these 2 approaches to performing SM in patients with obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (oHCM).
We analyzed the outcomes of 200 consecutive patients undergoing transapical beating-heart myectomy and 200 patients receiving transaortic on-pump myectomy. The primary outcome was procedural success, defined as a peak left ventricular outflow tract (LVOT) gradient <30 mm Hg on predismissal echocardiography. Secondary outcomes included transfusion and postoperative atrial fibrillation rates and intensive care unit (ICU) length of stay.
Both techniques significantly reduced LVOT gradient (median reduction: transapical, 102 mm Hg to 15 mm Hg; transaortic, 88 mm Hg to 12 mm Hg; P < .001 for both). Transapical beating-heart myectomy was associated with a shorter ICU stay (median, 24.0 hours vs 26.0 hours; P < .001), a lower atrial fibrillation rate (9.5% vs 30.0%; P < .001), and fewer transfusions (8.0% vs 22.0%; P < .001) but resulted in a higher incidence of new-onset left bundle branch block (63.8% vs 37.0%; P < .001) and longer postoperative hospital stay (median, 11 days vs 5 days; P < .001), owing mainly to institutional protocols. Overall 30-day mortality was 0.5% (n = 1) in the transapical beating-heart myectomy group and 1.0% (n = 2) in the transaortic on-pump myectomy group (P = .562).
Transapical beating-heart SM provides comparable hemodynamic outcomes to transaortic on-pump myectomy with advantages in ICU recovery time, transfusion rates, and postoperative atrial fibrillation. It may be a viable, less invasive alternative for selected oHCM patients. Further studies, including randomized trials, are needed to assess long-term outcomes."

In this report, we describe a case of K. aerogenes IE in an elderly male patient who initially presented to urgent care with a UTI. He had been diagnosed and prescribed a course of oral antibiotics; however, the treatment failed due to antimicrobial resistance. This led to the development of bacteremia and sepsis requiring hospital admission. He later developed endocarditis as confirmed by echocardiography, which was complicated by mitral regurgitation, respiratory failure, and multiple embolic central nervous system (CNS) strokes. He was treated with intravenous (IV) antibiotics and assessed by cardiac surgery, though operative management was deferred until his overall condition improved. This case underscores the importance of early recognition and timely management of IE in patients with persistent Klebsiella bacteremia unresponsive to initial therapy, emphasizing a multidisciplinary approach to achieve optimal outcomes, especially when dealing with such rare causative organisms."

It is controversial that whether these patients with iASD persistence will progress to a bad prognostic state. So it's worthwhile to evaluate whether the procedure of TEER induced iASD leads to development of a relevant interatrial shunt. This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to identify predictors of iASD persistence in patients with mitral regurgitation (MR) undergoing TEER and assess its effect on in-hospital outcomes and mortality.
In this systematic review and meta-analysis, we conducted a literature search in various databases. Our investigation summarized data from contemporary studies on the incidence of iASD following TEER for MR and its association with clinical outcomes.
10 studies were analyzed, possible predictors of risk factors for the persistence of iASD after TEER seemed to be atrial fibrillation before surgery (OR 1.40; P = .04), residual MR > 2+(OR 2.36; P = .001), residual tricuspid regurgitation > mild(OR 1.52; P = .01), and prolonged fluoroscopic time(MD [in minutes] 5.36; P = .007). Patients with iASD persistence after TEER seemed to have a greater risk to suffer from right heart overload reflecting from the enlarged right ventricle end-diastolic dimension (RVEDD) (MD 3.27; P < .00001) and the enlarged diameter of the right atrium (MD 4.41; P < .00001). Patients with iASD persistence after TEER had a greater risk of heart failure rehospitalization (OR 2.71; P = .003).
This systematic review and meta-analysis identified several related predictors of iASD persistence, possibly leading to right heart volume overload and a higher risk of heart failure rehospitalization. In order to generalize our findings, larger clinical studies in independent patient cohorts are necessary. What's more, there is a need to perform a careful decision for interventional closure of an iASD after TEER."

Methods: This prospective single-center cohort study included 101 patients with chronic heart failure (mean age 62 ± 15.5 years; 70.3% male) with paroxysmal or persistent drug-refractory atrial fibrillation who underwent atrioventricular node ablation and CRT-D implantation. All patients received optimal medical therapy before and after undergoing the procedure. Predictors of 5-year mortality were assessed using exploratory machine-learning methods, including random forest and Shapley additive explanations. Results: During 5-year follow-up, 13 cardiovascular deaths were recorded. Five key predictors of mortality were identified: left ventricular ejection fraction, 6 min walk distance, mean pulmonary artery pressure, systolic relaxation coefficient, and degree of mitral regurgitation. The exploratory predictive model showed high accuracy (92%) in terms of classifying the outcomes. Conclusions: Atrioventricular node ablation (AVNA) combined with CRT-D was associated with the observed long-term clinical outcomes observed in patients with drug-refractory tachysystolic atrial fibrillation. The exploratory machine learning analysis identified key mortality-associated factors, which may support future efforts in personalized risk stratification and hypothesis generation. The combination of AVNA and CRT-D was associated with the observed long-term outcomes in this real-world cohort."

He was admitted with a complaint of exertional and persistent chest pain, accompanied by electrocardiographic changes suggestive of anterior ST-elevation myocardial infarction. Initial investigations, including coronary angiography and optical coherence tomography, revealed unobstructed coronary arteries and no evidence of plaque disruption. Transthoracic echocardiography demonstrated marked asymmetric septal hypertrophy with mild systolic anterior motion of the mitral valve and eccentric mitral regurgitation, in the absence of a resting or provoked left ventricular outflow tract gradient. Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging further confirmed a diagnosis of non-obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM), with late gadolinium enhancement indicating patchy mid-septal and basal fibrosis. In view of these findings, dual antiplatelet therapy was discontinued, and the patient was managed with beta-blockers. He was discharged with plans for outpatient cardiology follow-up, risk stratification for sudden cardiac death, and genetic evaluation. This case highlights the potential for HCM to mimic acute coronary syndromes, particularly in a patient with cardiovascular risk factors, ischaemic ECG changes and ongoing chest pain. It underscores the diagnostic value of advanced imaging modalities in differentiating true myocardial infarction from phenocopies, thereby guiding appropriate and timely management."

Awareness of this phenomenon and careful post-procedure monitoring are essential, especially in high-risk individuals. We report the case of a 76-year-old male with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (18%), severe mitral and tricuspid regurgitation, a dual-chamber implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD), prior percutaneous coronary intervention, left ventricular thrombus, hypertension, and a renal transplant, who presented with worsening dyspnoea. On admission, he was found to be in monomorphic ventricular tachycardia (VT) at 150 bpm with hypotension (80/46 mmHg). Synchronised cardioversion with 50 J successfully restored sinus rhythm. Fourteen hours later, he developed acute respiratory distress, and chest imaging demonstrated new bilateral perihilar opacities consistent with pulmonary oedema. He was treated with intravenous furosemide, a glyceryl trinitrate infusion, and non-invasive ventilation, resulting in rapid clinical improvement. ICD interrogation confirmed a prolonged VT episode with a therapy threshold set too high for detection, prompting reprogramming of the VT zone to 130 bpm. The patient was discharged in stable condition after six days. This case underscores that APO after cardioversion may present in a delayed fashion and may be overlooked without prolonged observation. It also highlights the relevance of cardioversion performed for VT, prolonged pre-existing arrhythmic burden, and multiple comorbidities in predisposing patients to post-cardioversion haemodynamic decompensation. Vigilant monitoring and early intervention are crucial to improving outcomes in high-risk patients."

We report a Japanese family with cardiac valvular dysplasia. The proband was diagnosed with multiple valve dysplasia at a primary school health checkup. He also exhibited skin hyperextensibility and joint hypermobility. His younger monozygotic twin brothers were diagnosed with multiple valve dysplasia during their 1-month pediatric checkups. One of them exhibited severe valvular disease and required aortic and mitral valve replacement at age 16 due to progressive regurgitation. All three patients showed no developmental delay or evidence of periventricular nodular heterotopia on brain MRI. We identified a novel hemizygous FLNA variant, NM_001456.4(FLNA):c.2023-6_2026delinsACGCT, in all three patients. Splicing analysis revealed an in-frame deletion of two amino acids, p.Val675_Lys676del. No significant difference was observed in overall expression levels of FLNA transcript between the patient and a healthy individual. In silico structural modeling revealed that this deletion disrupts an α-helix positioned between β-strands of domains 4 and 5, which would impair the structural stability of FLNA. This variant was not found in public genomic databases. In conclusion, we identified a novel likely pathogenic variant in FLNA, p.Val675_Lys676del, the smallest in-frame deletion reported to date in XCVD. Patients with this variant showed variable severity, and some presented with extracardiac features. Our findings expand both the genetic and phenotypic spectrum of XCVD."

It may present with systemic anomalies (Axenfeld-Rieger syndrome) or without (Axenfeld anomaly) and may sometimes be associated with multiple congenital malformations. The estimated prevalence ranges from 1 in 50,000 to 1 in 200,000 live births, with an approximate rate of 1 in 100,000, but no epidemiological studies have been conducted to date. A clinical diagnosis of Axenfeld-Rieger syndrome requires the presence of both Axenfeld and Rieger ocular anomalies, accompanied by extraocular systemic features. Ocular manifestations include iris abnormalities, posterior embryotoxon, juvenile-onset glaucoma (a common complication), and dysgenesis of the iridocorneal angle with iridocorneal adhesions. The most commonly observed systemic anomalies include: umbilical defects; craniofacial dysmorphism; dentofacial abnormalities, such as Class III malocclusion due to maxillary hypoplasia, oligodontia, dental malformations (taurodontism, root dysplasia), microdontia, hypodontia, and anodontia; hearing impairment (partial or complete sensorineural hearing loss); and cardiac anomalies, including non-congenital heart disease and mitral valve insufficiency. Additional anomalies may include hypospadias in males, anal stenosis, endocrine disorders (notably growth retardation) secondary to pituitary dysfunction, psychomotor delay, and various neurological malformations such as Dandy-Walker malformation, mega cisterna magna, posterior fossa cysts, cerebellar vermis hypoplasia, ventriculomegaly, aprosencephaly, cerebral atrophy, microcephaly, arteriovenous malformations (AVM), and digital anomalies such as camptodactyly. Diagnosis is typically made in infancy, based on iris anomalies such as corectopia (displacement of the pupil), polycoria (multiple pupils), and iris hypoplasia. Posterior embryotoxon is frequently observed upon slit-lamp examination. Given the clinical variability, a comprehensive pediatric assessment is essential to identify systemic anomalies and distinguish Axenfeld-Rieger syndrome from the isolated Axenfeld anomaly."

A contemporary review.,Ovidio A García-Villarreal,10.24875/GMM.25000018,2025,Gaceta medica de Mexico,"Functional mitral regurgitation (FMR) is the consequence of a series of geometric and functional alterations in the left ventricle, which precipitate structural changes in the mitral valve (MV). Left ventricular remodeling, whether global or localized, generates abnormal tension or tethering of the papillary muscles and chordae tendineae, thereby compromising proper MV closure. Given that FMR is often associated with coronary artery disease, the surgical indication for concomitant MV surgery with coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) is unequivocal. However, the surgical indication for isolated MV surgery in patients with FMR without the need for CABG or other concomitant surgical procedures is more contentious. Excluding the indications for non-surgical procedures, this article examines the context and current status of isolated MV surgery in FMR. Furthermore, a potential decision-making algorithm for surgical interventions in patients with FMR is presented, based on the current accumulated evidence."

Case reports,"Libman-Sacks endocarditis is a form of non-bacterial thrombotic endocarditis, associated with autoimmune conditions such as systemic lupus erythematosus and antiphospholipid syndrome (APLS). Vegetations are usually small and are managed with immunosuppression and anticoagulation.
A 50-year-old female presented to her hospital with left leg weakness, with imaging showing a right parietal stroke and an old occipital lobe stroke. Inpatient transthoracic echocardiography showed a large mitral valve (MV) vegetation with moderate-to-severe mitral regurgitation (MR). She self-discharged against medical advice before further workup could be completed and was lost to follow-up until persuaded to have an outpatient transoesophageal echocardiogram, which showed severe MR with a large (2 cm × 3 cm) mass attached to the posterior MV leaflet. Blood cultures were negative. Review of previous blood tests showed a triple-positive APLS panel, which was positive on repeat testing. She underwent successful mechanical MV replacement. Valve histology was consistent with Libman-Sacks endocarditis. Warfarin therapy was continued, complicated by subdural haematoma (successfully treated), but with no further thrombo-embolic events. Subsequent anti-nuclear antigen testing was positive, and hydroxychloroquine was commenced. Transoesophageal echocardiography 1 year later showed a well-functioning MV prosthesis.
The management of young individuals with ischaemic stroke should include attention to atypical causes. Libman-Sacks endocarditis is usually associated with small vegetations and high thrombotic risk, usually managed medically with anticoagulation and treatment of underlying conditions. Our case was atypical, with the presence of a large vegetation causing significant valvular dysfunction, but it demonstrates that replacement with mechanical prostheses can be a feasible management strategy."

We sought to: validate right ventricular (RV) stroke volumes (SV3DE) and tricuspid regurgitant volumes (RegVol3DE) measured by three-dimensional echocardiography (3DE). Then, we compared the quantitative metrics used to assess TR severity obtained by 3DE and both the conventional and the corrected PISA methods.
3DE RV and left ventricular (LV) SV were collected simultaneously with direct Fick measurements at right heart catheterization (RVSVRHC) in 45 patients (66±14 years, 76% women) with no or trivial TR, and in 57 consecutive patients (73±13 years, 61% women) with mild to torrential (14% mild, 37% moderate, 26% severe, 16% massive, and 7% torrential) TR, and mild or no mitral or aortic regurgitation. In the latter group, RHC and 3DE were combined to derive TR regurgitant volume (RegVol3DE-RHC=RVSV3DE-RVSVRHC) and compared to the 3DE volumetric RegVol (RegVol3DE =RVSV3DE-LVSV3DE). Effective regurgitant orifice area (EROA) and regurgitant fraction (RegFr) were calculated from RegVol3DE, as well as through conventional and corrected PISA methods.
The feasibility of RVSV3DE was 74%. Among patients with no or trivial TR, RVSV3DE and RVSVRHC showed a strong correlation (R2= 0.916, p<0.0001), with a minimal bias (3.7 mL) and reasonable precision (limits of agreement, LOA: -10 mL;18 mL). In those with mild to torrential TR, RegVol3DE correlated with RegVol3DE-RHC (R2=0.918, p<0.0001) and was accurate (bias= -1.3 mL, LOA:-17.9 mL;15.2 mL). EROA, RegVol and RegFr derived from conventional PISA (0.48±0.4 cm2, 38±20 mL, and 36±18%, respectively) were significantly smaller (p<0.05) than those obtained from corrected PISA (0.61±0.5 cm2, 48±24 mL, and 46±24 %, respectively), and volumetric 3DE (0.62±0.5 cm2, 46±25 mL, and 42±18%, respectively).
RVSV measured by 3DE is accurate (minimal bias, acceptable imprecision) when compared to direct Fick RVSVRHC."

Although left ventricular systolic function is usually preserved, subclinical myocardial dysfunction may be present. Global longitudinal strain (GLS) is a sensitive parameter for detecting early myocardial impairment.
This study aimed to evaluate subclinical myocardial dysfunction in children with ARF-related carditis using GLS and other strain parameters and to assess its progression over a one-year follow-up period according to the severity of mitral regurgitation (MR).
A total of 30 children with ARF-related carditis and preserved systolic function were prospectively enrolled. Patients were divided into two subgroups based on MR severity: moderate MR (Group 1, n = 12) and mild MR (Group 2, n = 18). Conventional echocardiographic parameters and speckle-tracking-derived strain measures were assessed at diagnosis, six months, and 12 months. GLS values were compared with those of age- and sex-matched healthy controls (n = 52).
At diagnosis, GLS was significantly lower in ARF patients than controls (-19.9 ± 2.86 vs. -22.6 ± 4.65; p = 0.02) and at six months (-20.4 ± 3.42 vs. -22.6 ± 4.65, p = 0.04). Although GLS improved in the mild MR subgroup (-21.9 ± 3.82 vs. -22.6 ± 4.65, p = 0.41), it remained significantly impaired in the moderate MR subgroup (-19.25 ± 3.32 vs. -22.6 ± 4.65, p < 0.01) at 12 months. In multivariable linear regression analysis, GLS was negatively correlated with the severity of valve regurgitation (r = -0.53, p = 0.02) and NT-proBNP (r = -0.62, p = 0.012).
GLS and NT-proBNP are sensitive indicators of subclinical myocardial dysfunction in children with ARF-related carditis, especially in those with moderate MR. Longitudinal strain imaging may enhance early detection and guide long-term monitoring."

PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, and Cochrane Library databases were searched from the date of establishment to November 22, 2024. Two investigators independently screened the literature, extracted data, and evaluated the quality of the included studies. Meta-analysis was performed using Stata18.0 software.
Finally, 23 studies were included, all of which scored ≥7 on the Newcastle-Ottawa scale. Meta-analysis results showed that, the left ventricular end-systolic volume index (P < 0.01), left ventricular end-diastolic volume index (P < 0.01), and left ventricular mass index (P < 0.01) of patients with MR were higher than those of healthy individuals. In contrast, the left ventricular ejection fraction (P < 0.01) and global radial strain (GRS) (P < 0.01) of patients with MR was lower than that of healthy individuals; the difference was significant. The E/A of both groups (P = 0.22), global circumferential strain (P = 0.43), global longitudinal strain (P = 0.10), left ventricular relative wall thickness (P = 0.20), and some indexes with significant heterogeneity were analyzed by subgroup according to the degree of MR. The combined results of most subgroup analysis were consistent with the overall results and the heterogeneity was reduced.
There is significant difference in the GRS between patients with MR and healthy individuals, which can provide reference for evaluating left ventricular function in patients with MR."

Case reports,"Infective endocarditis caused by Lactobacillus rhamnosus is extremely rare, particularly in immunocompetent patients without structural heart disease or recent invasive procedures.
A 42-year-old immunocompetent man with no structural heart disease or recent interventions presented with fever and dyspnoea. Blood cultures grew L. rhamnosus. Transoesophageal echocardiography revealed a large vegetation on the aortic valve causing severe regurgitation, along with severe mitral regurgitation due to anterior leaflet perforation. The only identifiable risk factor was regular probiotic consumption. The patient underwent successful double valve replacement and completed 6 weeks of antibiotic therapy with favourable outcome.
A literature review identified 22 published cases of L. rhamnosus endocarditis. Most were associated with underlying valvular disease, invasive procedures, or probiotic use. This case highlights the need to consider Lactobacillus spp. as a potential pathogen, not merely a contaminant, in the appropriate clinical context, and calls for careful patient selection and monitoring when prescribing probiotics."

Medical therapy alone is insufficient, and either TEER (transcatheter edge to edge) or surgery is recommended. Short- and long-term comparative outcomes remain unclear. We aim to address this gap using available data.
We performed a meta-analysis of studies examining the outcomes of surgery and/or transcatheter edge to edge. MEDLINE, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Library were assessed. The incidence rate of late severe MR was the primary outcome. A random model was performed. Leave-one-out, subgroup, and meta-regression analyses were conducted.
Thirty-two studies (1923 patients); 20 in surgery [1166] vs 12 in TEER [757]) were selected. TEER patients were, on average, 10 years older, with twice the rate of NYHA III/IV symptoms and more than double the STS score. At a weighted mean follow-up of 3.2 years, compared to isolated transcatheter, surgery was associated with decreased incidence of late severe mitral regurgitation (2.53 vs 6.66 events per 100 person-years, P-interaction = 0.03), late all-cause mortality (3.00 vs 8.84, P-interaction = 0.024), late heart failure hospitalization (4.44 vs 17.03, P-interaction < 0.01), and late NYHA III/IV (2.98 vs 22.47, P-interaction < 0.01). However, significantly better long-term outcomes associated with surgery showed high heterogeneity. There were no differences in early all-cause mortality, early cardiac-specific mortality, late cardiac-specific mortality, postprocedural morbidities nor atrial diameter. On meta-regression, preprocedural heart failure (Beta = 0.0224, P < 0.01) and coronary artery disease (Beta = 0.0294, P < 0.00001) were linked to increased late severe mitral regurgitation. Older age, hypertension, mitral valve replacement, and associated aortic valve surgery were linked to increased late all-cause mortality.
Surgery and isolated transcatheter edge-to-edge repair showed comparable short-term outcomes, with surgery appearing more effective long-term; however, due to study limitations and heterogeneity, these findings are hypothesis-generating and require validation through prospective studies."

Advances in endoscopic visualization and surgical instrumentation have enhanced precision while minimizing trauma, improving both functional and esthetic outcomes. This study presents a single-center experience with total endoscopic mitral valve repair (MVR) performed using two- or three-dimensional video-assisted technology.
Between October 2022 and September 2025, 239 patients underwent total endoscopic MVR at our institution. Demographic, operative, and postoperative data were collected and analyzed.
Median age was 63 years, with 64.4% male. Median logistic EuroSCORE and EuroSCORE II were 2.53 and 0.83, respectively. Most patients were NYHA class II (54.4%), and 47.7% had pulmonary hypertension. Mitral annuloplasty was performed in 99.2% of cases; 78.6% received Gore-Tex chordae, 6.3% underwent posterior leaflet resection, and 11.7% edge-to-edge repair. Conversion to sternotomy occurred in 0.4%. In-hospital mortality was 1.3%; stroke occurred in 0.4%. Postoperative atrial fibrillation developed in 26.8%, while major complications such as sepsis (2.1%) and renal failure requiring dialysis (1.3%) were infrequent. Median ventilation time was 5 h, ICU stay was 2 days, and hospital stay was 7 days. Pre-discharge echocardiography showed ≤mild regurgitation in 99.2%.
Total endoscopic MVR using two- or three-dimensional video assistance is safe, feasible, and yields excellent clinical, functional, and cosmetic results, with low morbidity and rapid recovery."

Understanding the mechanism of MR, whether primary, due to intrinsic valve abnormalities, or secondary, resulting from atrial or ventricular remodeling, is essential for optimal management. Echocardiography, particularly advanced modalities such as three-dimensional imaging and strain analysis, plays a central role in this process. It allows accurate quantification of MR severity, detailed characterization of valve and ventricular anatomy, and assessment of remodeling, all of which are critical for determining the optimal timing for intervention. Beyond diagnosis, echocardiography is indispensable in guiding therapy selection: it informs surgical planning by defining leaflet pathology for repair versus replacement strategies, and directs transcatheter interventions by guiding interatrial septal puncture, catheter orientation, and device deployment in real time. While surgery remains the gold standard for primary MR, transcatheter approaches including edge-to-edge repair and emerging mitral valve replacement are increasingly relevant, particularly in patients at high surgical risk or with complex anatomy. This review emphasizes the pivotal role of echocardiography in the pre-procedural assessment of MR, highlighting its ability to integrate anatomical, functional, and hemodynamic information to guide patient-tailored therapeutic strategies and optimize outcomes within a Heart Team framework."

MMVD is characterized by progressive mitral valve degeneration, volume overload, and eventual development of congestive heart failure (CHF). Given the strong hereditary component in CKCS, considerable research has focused on elucidating the genetic basis of MMVD in this breed. This review article summarizes the current state of knowledge on the phenotypic features, inheritance, and candidate loci potentially responsible for early onset and severe course of the disease. The pathogenesis of the disease, its classification, and the effects of breeding programs aimed at reducing the occurrence of MMVD have been described. Key findings include associations between MMVD severity and polymorphisms in genes such as NEBL, ACE, CDK6, HEPACAM2, COL5A1, and FAH, as well as evidence implicating dysregulated TGF-β signaling, serotonin signaling, and extracellular matrix remodeling pathways. The current state of knowledge on the role of miRNA in the pathogenesis of MMVD was also summarized. Despite these findings, no specific high-penetrating mutation has been identified. MMVD is a complex, polygenic condition shaped by regulatory variants and breed-specific genetic bottlenecks. Comparative studies underscore the translational relevance of canine MMVD to human mitral valve disease, while genomic insights may be basis for the future selective breeding strategies and therapeutic approaches. Further large-scale, integrative studies combining genomics, transcriptomics, and functional validation are needed to clarify disease mechanisms and support targeted treatment in CKCS as well as the development of new breeding strategies and programs."

International normalized ratio (INR) goals for mechanical AVRs can change throughout treatment as risk factors change. Appropriate INR goal selection is crucial as goals that stray from evidence-based recommendations can lead to increased risk of bleeding, thrombosis or unnecessary monitoring.
The purpose of this study was to evaluate the appropriateness of INR goals in patients with mechanical AVRs and identify opportunities for pharmacist-led intervention.
A cross-sectional quality improvement study was conducted at a safety net academic medical center's outpatient anticoagulation clinic. This quality improvement project was not formally supervised by the Institutional Review Board per their policies. Adult patients with isolated mechanical AVR actively managed on warfarin were included. Pharmacists determined whether INR goals were justified by clinical context and American and European valvular heart disease guidelines. When goals lacked clear justification, pharmacists contacted referring providers to recommend INR goal adjustment.
Of 100 identified patients, 81 met eligibility criteria including 24 (29.6%) with On-X valves and 57 (70.4%) with alternative mechanical AVRs. Nearly one-third of patients (23, 29.3%) had INR goals inconsistent with current guidelines. Pharmacist-led outreach resulted in 20 accepted recommendations (87.0%), representing 24.7% of the study population. On-X valve recommendations primarily involved reducing INR targets to 1.5 to 2.0 for patients at least 3 months postsurgery without other risk factors that would constitute a higher INR goal. The most common alternative mechanical valve interventions included increasing INR goals to 2.5 to 3.5 in those with thromboembolic risk factors and decreasing INR goals to 2.0 to 3.0 due to absence of thromboembolic risk factors.
This stewardship initiative highlights the need for periodic INR goal review, as risk factors in patients with mechanical AVRs can change over time."

The objectives of this study were to improve the early diagnosis of TS and to predict the risk of severe cardiovascular diseases in patients with TS by analyzing the main features of cardiovascular diseases in these patients.
This study included 107 patients with TS who underwent echocardiography and were admitted to the Shanghai Children's Medical Center between November 2019 and November 2024. In this study, the height, weight, age, karyotype, cardiac imaging data, and electrocardiograms of the patients were collected. The main features of the cardiovascular diseases in patients with TS were assessed, and the correlations between the height, body mass index (BMI), karyotype, and cardiovascular diseases were analyzed.
Overall, 107 patients with TS were included, with an average age of 9.68 ± 4.23 years at diagnosis. Bicuspid aortic valve (BAV), aortic coarctation (CoA), and persistent left superior vena cava (PLSVC) were the most prevalent cardiovascular diseases, with prevalence rates of 11.2% (12/107), 8.4% (9/107), and 9.3% (10/107), respectively. The partial anomalous pulmonary venous return (PAPVC) was of the 'supra cardiac type' in all cases. Patients with CoA had lower BMI-for-age Z-score (BMIAZ) (-0.81 ± 1.17 vs. 0.61 ± 0.99; P = 0.003) than those without CoA. The best cutoff for predicting CoA was calculated using a sensitivity of 0.857 and specificity of 0.697 with a BMIAZ of 0.115 and an area under the curve of 0.825 (P = 0.004). Moreover, CoA (63.3%, 7/11) was the leading cause for surgical and interventional procedures in children and adolescents with TS. The 45,X karyotype was found to be associated with congenital heart disease (CHD) (47.4% vs. 24.6%; P = 0.016).
Girls with BAV or CoA should undergo karyotyping to facilitate the early diagnosis of TS. CoA is the leading cause for surgical and interventional procedures in children and adolescents with TS. The BMIAZ is a reliable predictor of CoA. Cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) or computed tomography (CT) should be performed at the time of diagnosis for girls with TS, especially those with a 45,X karyotype, BMIAZ < 0.115, or CHD detected by echocardiography."

Appropriate diagnostic workup and management in the inpatient setting can be challenging in this patient population due to the spectrum of disease complexity and the dynamic nature of the field. Therefore, the Paediatric Acute Care Cardiology Collaborative has undertaken the creation of this clinical practice guideline.
A panel of paediatric cardiologists, infectious disease specialists, intensivists, advanced practice practitioners, pharmacists, cardiothoracic surgeons, and a dentist was convened. The literature was systematically reviewed for relevant articles on the management of infective endocarditis in patients with CHD. Using the modified Delphi technique, recommendations were generated and put through iterative Delphi rounds to achieve consensus for inclusion.
Based on 127 articles that met the inclusion criteria, 82 recommendations were generated, 50 of which achieved consensus for inclusion and are included in this guideline. They address risk factors specific to CHD lesion type and prior interventions including implanted material, diagnostic considerations, management strategies, and recommendations on counselling other healthcare providers, patients, and families. Of the 50 consensus recommendations, 36 are strong recommendations, though 20 have low or very low quality of evidence.
A central theme in this guideline is that an individual's specific CHD lesion and prior interventions must be carefully considered for risk stratification, diagnostic approach, and management. While most are strong recommendations, many are supported by low quality of evidence, emphasising the need for further research in this subject."

WNT and JAK/STAT have been highlighted as emerging biomarkers in cardiovascular disease pathogenesis. This study assessed the Wnt/JAK-STAT signaling pathway in relation to SFRP5 and genetic polymorphisms in cardiac patients. This prospective case-control study included 100 patients with various cardiac diseases (IHD, valvular heart disease, HF, cardiomyopathy, and arrhythmia) and 50 matched healthy controls. Clinical and echocardiographic assessments were performed. Plasma SFRP5, Wnt5a, and JAK levels were measured using ELISA; STAT5A expression by flow cytometry; and SFRP5 (rs780369540) gene polymorphism by TaqMan real-time PCR were also performed in all participants. Cardiac patients showed significantly higher median BMI (33 vs. 28.5 kg/m2, p = 0.001) and markedly increased median value of each Wnt5a (16.85 vs. 5.6 pg/mL, p < 0.001), median JAK (9.45 vs. 2.4 pg/mL, p < 0.001), and STAT5A expression (87.55% vs. 33%, p < 0.001), with lower SFRP5 levels (4 vs. 6.7 ng/L, p < 0.001) compared to control. The SFRP5 (rs780369540) T allele was more frequent in patients (51.5% vs. 32%, p = 0.001), and dominant TT + TC genotypes were higher (66% vs. 42%, p = 0.005) compared to the control group. TT carriers showed higher median Wnt5a, lower median SFRP5, and reduced ejection fraction compared to other genotypes (TC, CC) carriers. Multivariate analysis identified elevated Wnt5a, JAK, and decreased SFRP5 as independent predictors of cardiovascular disease (p < 0.05). Cardiac patients showed altered WNT5a, JAK, and SFRP5 levels.

This study aimed to identify patients with SICD, characterise their clinical and paraclinical features, analyse the different patterns of cardiac dysfunction, and determine prognostic implications. Methods: Patients admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) for sepsis or septic shock who underwent echocardiography on admission were identified retrospectively. Exclusion criteria included acute myocardial infarction, preexisting severe left heart valve disease or systolic dysfunction. Clinical, paraclinical, and echocardiography data were documented. The primary outcome was a composite of in-hospital mortality, prolonged hospital stay, and prolonged ICU stay. Results: A total of 128 septic patients were included, with a median age of 72.5 years and a 55% male proportion. Alcohol abuse, vasopressor therapy and orotracheal intubation on admission were risk factors for developing SICD. More than a third developed SICD (37%). We identified four different types of cardiac dysfunction based on echocardiography. An NT-proBNP level of over 9000 pg/mL was a predictor of SICD, composite outcome and mortality. A total of 56 patients (44%) experienced in-hospital mortality. Even though the occurrence of SICD did not predict mortality, it was a significant predictor of the composite outcome. Conclusions: This study describes the incidence and spectrum of SICD in a group of septic patients admitted to a tertiary care hospital. The occurrence of any type of cardiac dysfunction associated with sepsis and high NT-proBNP levels had strong prognostic implications."

A Systematic Review.,Andra Denis Marinescu; Stefan Andrei Oprea; Victor Sebastian Costache,10.3390/jcm14248660,2025-12-06,Journal of clinical medicine,"Background/Objectives: Minimally invasive valve surgery (MIVS) is increasingly employed as an alternative to conventional median sternotomy (MS) in the treatment of valvular heart disease. However, its impact on postoperative quality of life (QoL) remains incompletely understood. This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to compare QoL outcomes between MIVS and MS, focusing on physical, psychological, and social dimensions, both in the short- and long-term postoperative periods. Methods: A comprehensive search was conducted in PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, and Wiley Online Library databases for studies published between January 2020 and September 2025. Eligible studies included adult patients undergoing MIVS or MS and assessed QoL using validated instruments (SF-36, EQ-5D, MLHFQ, KCCQ). Random-effects models were used for meta-analysis, and standardized mean differences (SMDs) were calculated to estimate pooled effects. Results: Fifty-six studies with a combined sample of over 10,000 patients were included. MIVS was associated with significantly better short-term QoL outcomes across physical (SMD = 0.88; 95% CI: 0.74-1.02) and psychological domains (SMD = 0.47; 95% CI: 0.35-0.59). Patients also experienced earlier social reintegration and improved body image perception. Although these benefits diminished beyond 12 months, MIVS maintained a modest but persistent advantage in long-term QoL (≥5 years). Structured psychological support and cardiac rehabilitation programmes further enhanced physical and emotional recovery. Conclusions: MIVS confers meaningful benefits in postoperative QoL, particularly during the early recovery phase. Sustained improvements depend on comprehensive postoperative care, including rehabilitation and psychosocial support. Further long-term, standardized research is required to strengthen evidence and guide patient-centred surgical decision-making."

They are defined by a left ventricular wall thickness ≥15 mm in the absence of other causes such as loading conditions, ischemia, or valvular disease. Although they mimic similar clinical and morphological features, their etiologies are distinct and include genetic, metabolic, and infiltrative mechanisms. Therefore, accurate classification and differential diagnosis are crucial for effective management and treatment. Sarcomeric HCM is the most frequent form, accounting for up to 60% of cases. However, numerous non-sarcomeric phenocopies exist, including amyloidosis, Fabry disease, glycogen storage disorders, RASopathies, and mitochondrial diseases. Clinical and imaging findings are essential to distinguish these entities from sarcomeric HCM. Electrocardiography, echocardiography, advanced modalities such as cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR), and specific laboratory tests all play a central role in guiding diagnosis. Genetic testing provides key insights into mutations and inheritance patterns, further supporting definitive diagnosis. Correct identification of an HCM phenocopy carries important therapeutic implications, as disease-specific treatments can significantly improve prognosis. For example, targeted therapies exist for amyloidosis, Fabry disease, and certain metabolic or mitochondrial disorders, underlining the clinical relevance of an accurate diagnosis. This review aims to provide an overview of HCM phenocopies and assist clinicians in diagnostic reasoning.

However, the causality and cross-ancestry generalizability of these associations remain uncertain.
Collecting summary-level data from genome-wide association studies for systolic (SBP) and diastolic (DBP) blood pressure, hypertension, type 2 diabetes, fasting glucose, glycated hemoglobin, body mass index (BMI), waist circumference (WC), alcohol consumption, smoking initiation, HCM, and DCM (sample size ranging from 38,288 to 1,812,017), we performed comprehensive two-sample univariable Mendelian randomization (MR) to evaluate the causal effect of each trait on HCM and DCM in both European and East Asian populations. We performed multivariable MR to investigate the independent effects of interrelated traits (SBP vs. DBP; BMI vs. WC).
MR analyses identified reliable evidence of a causal effect of SBP on HCM (Europeans: odds ratio (OR) = 1.03, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.02-1.04; East Asians: OR = 1.06, 95% CI = 1.03-1.08). For DCM, reliable evidence of causal effects was identified for DBP (Europeans: OR = 1.04, 95% CI = 1.03-1.04; East Asians: OR = 1.07, 95% CI = 1.04-1.11), WC (Europeans: OR = 1.73, 95% CI = 1.58-1.89; East Asians: OR = 3.32, 95% CI = 1.22-9.03), and alcohol consumption (Europeans: OR = 1.50, 95% CI = 1.20-1.86; East Asians: OR = 1.32, 95% CI = 1.11-1.56). In Europeans, genetically predicted higher WC (OR = 1.75, 95% CI = 1.53-2.01) and smoking initiation (OR = 1.34, 95% CI = 1.16-1.56) specifically increased the risk of HCM and DCM, respectively, while genetically predicted higher alcohol consumption (OR = 1.68, 95% CI = 1.36-2.07) specifically increased the risk of HCM in East Asians.
This study provided reliable cross-ancestry genetic evidence supporting higher SBP as a causal risk factor for HCM and higher DBP, WC, and alcohol consumption as causal risk factors for DCM. These findings underscore the potential of precision prevention strategies targeting modifiable cardiovascular risk factors to reduce cardiomyopathy burden across populations."

A 54-year-old man developed recurrent embolic strokes seven and eight years post-Bentall procedure with mechanical aortic valve. Blood cultures grew Gram-positive bacilli, initially misidentified as Corynebacterium spp., later confirmed as Actinotignum schaalii. Cardiac CT revealed a 12 mm × 15 mm × 20 mm perivalvular abscess fistulizing into the sinus of Valsalva and prosthetic graft. 18 F-FDG PET/CT confirmed intense hypermetabolism around the prosthesis. Despite targeted amoxicillin therapy, intraoperative exploration revealed complete Bentall conduit dehiscence from extensive aorto-mitral trigone destruction. Reconstruction was deemed unfeasible, and the patient died following multidisciplinary decision to limit interventions. No urological source was identified.
Actinotignum schaalii can cause indolent prosthetic valve endocarditis with devastating perivalvular complications. Prolonged blood culture incubation is crucial for early diagnosis in patients with prosthetic material and unexplained embolic events.

We aimed to map the multisystem comorbidity network of CAS and clarify underlying genetic mechanisms.
In 467 484 participants from the UK Biobank, observational and polygenic phenome-wide association studies evaluated associations between CAS and 1571 phenotypes, integrating disease-trajectory analyses to visualise temporal patterns. Associations replicated across observational and polygenic analyses were tested using two-sample Mendelian randomisation (MR) based on 22 CAS-related variants from FinnGen. Polygenic risk score (PRS) analyses excluding specific genes assessed their contributions, particularly LPA and plasma lipoprotein(a) (Lp(a)) levels.
CAS was associated with higher risks of 42 cardiovascular and non-cardiovascular conditions, most prominently metabolic, endocrine, haematological and respiratory disorders. Temporal analyses showed that circulatory and metabolic diseases typically precede other comorbidities in CAS trajectories. MR findings were consistent with causal effects of CAS on multiple cardiovascular diseases, iron-deficiency anaemia, mental disorders and pleural effusion. When LPA variants were removed from the CAS PRS or plasma Lp(a) concentration was adjusted for, most associations lost significance, indicating a shared LPA/Lp(a)-mediated genetic pathway.
CAS is embedded within a broad multisystem comorbidity network, driven largely by genetic variation at LPA and elevated Lp(a). These findings highlight pleiotropic mechanisms linking valvular calcification with systemic disease and support LPA-targeted therapies as a promising avenue for reducing the multisystem burden of CAS."

We aim to understand which areas are the ones with the highest and least consensus. An online questionnaire including 30 questions was administered through a REDCap link. Invitations were sent out through the Fetal Heart Society and personal emails to the heads of fetal cardiology programs. Results were analyzed in a descriptive manner and compared among the regions with most responses (North America and Europe). A total of 72 specialists in fetal and pediatric cardiology responded, most from North-America (n = 31) and Europe (n = 29). Antenatal counselling was mainly based on the tricuspid valve z-score (43.7%), although among European responders, multivariable models were preferred (44.8%). There was a wide regional variation in the nomograms used for prenatal assessment of the tricuspid valve. More than half did not consider prenatal valvuloplasty (54.3%), and those who did diverged in selection criteria. Postnatally, in mild-moderately hypoplastic right ventricle, most opted to first assess the tricuspid valve z-score (60%) whereas others would always attempt a biventricular pathway (30.8%). The majority opted to perform cardiac catheterization in all cases to assess ventriculo-coronary connections (60.6%). If right ventricle-dependent coronary circulation was confirmed, 66.7% would opt for single ventricle palliation, whereas 15.9% would directly list for transplant. There is great heterogeneity in the management of pulmonary atresia-critical stenosis with intact ventricular septum, particularly in prenatal assessment and consideration for prenatal intervention."

Breeding drought-tolerant tea cultivars is one of the effective ways to cope with this challenge. However, traditional breeding approaches are still limited by prolonged cycles, low efficiency, and subjective evaluation. To overcome these limitations, the development of rapid and objective germplasm evaluation methods has become critical‌.
In this study, hyperspectral images of leaves from 12 widely cultivated 'Lucha series' tea cultivars in Shandong Province during different drought periods were collected, and the drought-related physiological indicators were measured simultaneously. Then, a tea drought tolerance index (TDTI) with enhanced accuracy was established by integrating the rate of change of indicators with temporal weights and indicator weights. Subsequently, we developed a novel lightweight Transformer-based hybrid integrated architecture to establish prediction models for the physiological indicators and TDTI. The Transformer-based models synergistically combined a Transformer encoder with XGBoost and LightGBM within a lightweight framework that leverages ensemble learning, data augmentation, and regularization to ensure robustness on limited datasets. Finally, we compared the performance of Transformer-based models against traditional machine learning models.​ The optimal models for MRP, MDA, Pro, SS, ChlT and TDTI were identified as 1D-CARS-TF, 2D-UVE-SVM, 2D-UVE-BRR, 2D-CARS-SVM, 1D-UVE-TF-CNN, and 2D-UVE-TF, respectively, achieving determination coefficient (R²) of 0.8992, 0.8307, 0.8929, 0.8373, 0.7894, and 0.7614, on an independent test set.​ The results demonstrated that the lightweight Transformer-based models equipped with multi-head self-attention mechanism exhibited outstanding capabilities in processing indicators requiring multi-band correlation mining. ​​Simultaneously, feature selection algorithms and overfitting-mitigation optimization strategies played a critical role in enhancing both the accuracy and stability of the Transformer-based models.​.
This study established a robust technical foundation for rapid, accurate, and non-destructive comprehensive evaluation of drought tolerance for tea plant germplasm resources. However, it should be noted that they were based on a specific set of greenhouse-cultivated samples, and further validation under field conditions with expanded germplasm resources would strengthen generalizability. Anyway, the demonstrated potential of the Transformer-based model in our study advances phenomics of tea plants toward greater intelligence and efficiency."

Our models demonstrated high performance, achieving area under the curve (AUC) values of 0.850 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.840-0.861), 0.856 (95% CI 0.850-0.861), and 0.848 (95% CI 0.843-0.853) for the 1-year, 3-year, and 5-year survival predictions, respectively. We then examined the impact of 33 clinical factors on these predictions and found that age, radiation therapy for the SPM, and sex were the most influential factors. Age and metastatic status of the SPM emerged as the most critical predictors. Finally, using one-hot encoding, we evaluated the effects of various SPMs on survival outcomes in patients with CRC and provided clinical interpretations of these findings. Our analysis indicated that patients with second primary prostate cancer and CRC generally have better survival prospects than that of those with other SPMs. Patients with second primary pancreatic and gastric cancers have poor survival outcomes. These findings provide valuable insights into the intricate interactions among CRC, SPM, and various clinical factors, thereby improving the treatment and evaluation of patients with CRC and SPM."

It enables segmentation of pancreatic tumors and five critical vessels: celiac artery (CA), common hepatic artery (CHA), superior mesenteric artery (SMA), superior mesenteric vein (SMV), and portal vein (PV), quantifying vascular involvement through 3D encasement angles. PAN-VIQ was trained and internally validated on 2130 cases, and subsequently prospectively tested in 202 patients. External validation showed accuracies exceeding 90%. In prospective evaluation, the model outperformed junior radiologists and matched senior radiologists in accuracy and recall. These results underscore potential of PAN-VIQ to standardize vascular invasion assessment and reduce interobserver variability."

By harnessing the synergies between physical-mathematical insights and deep learning, we have constructed a neural network model imbued with a priori knowledge of physics and mathematics, thereby facilitating an efficient resolution of the Poisson's equation. The model is evaluated in two distinct scenarios: simulating electromagnetic pulses generated by laser-target interactions and calculating the electric field for field-circuit coupling integration. The empirical results indicate that the PINN-based solution methodology not only achieves a remarkable acceleration in computation speed but also maintains commendable accuracy, and the relative error is less than 1.4%, while bolstering adaptability to variations in current density.

We propose Bat-T-GNN, which injects domain knowledge at both the input and objective levels. First, Cycle-Aware Patching segments the time series by actual charge-discharge cycles, giving the model coherent, physically meaningful inputs. Second, a Physics-Informed Consistency Loss (PINN-RUL) regularizes training by requiring the final RUL prediction to be consistent with a physically plausible degradation curve learned from the data. This method experimented on public benchmarks show that proposed method significantly outperforms prior methods, including T-PATCHGNN.

While several commercial automated karyotyping tools partially solve these issues, open-source software that effectively combines robust chromosome segmentation with comprehensive colocalization analysis capabilities remains necessary. To address this unmet need, we developed MetaChrome, an open-source software platform built around a graphical user interface and explicitly designed for automated metaphase chromosome analysis. MetaChrome leverages fine-tuned deep learning models to automate metaphase chromosome segmentation, together with colocalization analysis of chromosome-specific FISH probes and immunofluorescent-labeled proteins. Importantly, MetaChrome achieves enhanced segmentation accuracy compared to traditional image processing methods by adopting a Cellpose segmentation model fine-tuned with manually annotated metaphase chromosome datasets. The fine-tuned model ensures the precise assignment of DNA FISH spots to individual chromosomes in an automated manner. This facilitates rapid identification of chromosomal abnormalities, reduces human error, and advances high-throughput chromosome analysis workflows, addressing a key bottleneck in chromosome biology research."

To address these issues, we propose a simple yet effective framework for multi-class classification, termed Compositional Feature Augmentation (CFA). By transforming each original feature into a class-wise posterior composition, CFA captures discriminative information in a model-independent and marginal learning manner. To enhance robustness, we introduce a voting mechanism that aggregates predictions from multiple augmented feature sets generated via random subsampling. This ensemble approach stabilizes results and mitigates noise in marginal learning. CFA is compatible with standard classifiers, including logistic regression, SVM, neural networks, and others. Extensive experiments on both structured and deep-embedded datasets show that CFA improves accuracy, especially when original features are unrefined, while maintaining competitive performance when strong embeddings are already available."

However, existing MTL models often fall short of optimal performance in both tasks, as they struggle to simultaneously capture the local contextual information essential for segmentation and the global one needed for classification. In this paper, we propose a simple yet effective UNet-based MTL model, where features extracted by the encoder are used to predict classification labels, while the decoder produces the segmentation mask. The model leverages an advanced encoder incorporating a novel ResFormer block that integrates local context from convolutional feature extraction with long-range dependencies modeled by the Transformer. This design captures broader contextual relationships and fine-grained details, improving classification and segmentation accuracy. To enhance classification performance, multi-scale features from different encoder levels are combined to leverage the hierarchical representation of the input image. For segmentation, the features passed to the decoder via skip connections are refined using a novel dilated feature enhancement (DFE) module, which captures information at different scales through three parallel convolution branches with varying dilation rates. This allows the decoder to detect lesions of varying sizes with greater accuracy. Experimental results across multiple medical datasets confirm the superior performance of our model in both segmentation and classification tasks, compared to state-of-the-art single-task and multi-task learning methods. These findings highlight the potential of our approach to advance disease diagnosis and treatment through improved medical image analysis.

However, limitations stemming from operator dependence and artifacts have been noted. To address these issues, deep learning (DL) is increasingly being introduced. In oncology and cardiology, DL-equipped devices are transitioning to clinical use following approval. Nevertheless, DL faces challenges such as generalization, safety, and operational burden, making strategic implementation essential to maximize patient benefit. Existing reviews often list individual technologies but lack evaluation frameworks tailored to clinical implementation. Therefore, this review (i) organizes and formalizes limitations specific to ultrasound diagnosis, (ii) explains the latest DL methods addressing these limitations in terms of principles, implementation, and evaluation metrics, and (iii) examines recent clinical applications, including approved devices, supported by evidence, demonstrating that DL possesses substantial utility beyond the research stage for improving clinical workflows. It also critically evaluates remaining challenges, presents evaluation criteria to aid implementation, and identifies future research challenges."
PubMed,deep learning,The Evolving Landscape of Urology in the Era of Artificial Intelligence: An Update of Clinical Applications and Emerging Innovations.,M F H Siddique; M I Ali; P P Chowdhury; N Alam; M M Rahman; M H Tanim,,2026-01,Mymensingh medical journal : MMJ,"Artificial intelligence (AI) has revolutionized urology, offering transformative advancements in diagnostics, treatment planning and patient care. This update highlights AI applications in diagnostic imaging, benign urological conditions, uro-oncology, urologic surgeries and patient monitoring. AI algorithms including machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) enhance non-oncological applications include predicting ureteral stone passage (accuracy: 85%) and optimizing benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) management. In uro-oncology, AI predicts biochemical recurrence post-prostatectomy (accuracy: 95%) and stratifies renal cell carcinoma aggressiveness and prostate cancer detection via MRI analysis (AUC: 0.95-0.99) and improve bladder cancer diagnosis through cystoscopic image classification (sensitivity: 89.7%). Robotic surgery benefits from AI-driven precision in procedures like robot-assisted radical prostatectomy (RARP). AI enables early detection of minimal residual disease and recurrence through analysis of urinary 'liquid biopsies', while AI-based 'computational biopsy' predicts genomic markers and clinical risk scores directly from H&E-stained slides, reducing costs and turnaround time. Ethical challenges including algorithmic bias and data privacy necessitate robust governance frameworks. Future innovations, such as artificial general intelligence (AGI), federated learning, promise personalized care and autonomously diagnoses and prescribes treatments of urologic illnesses but require interdisciplinary collaborations. This review underscores AI's potential to improve outcomes while addressing limitations in data diversity and clinical integration."
PubMed,deep learning,DualMask: Federated optimization of privacy-utility-efficiency trilemma via orthogonal gradient perturbation and RL-optimized PSO.,Weibai Zhou; Changlong Li; Rong Li; Dan Huang,10.1371/journal.pone.0338822,2025,PloS one,"Federated learning faces a fundamental privacy-utility-communication trilemma, and existing static defense mechanisms suffer from rigid adaptation and poor multidimensional coordination, leaving a critical gap in dynamic trade-off balancing. To address this, we propose DualMask, a cooperative optimization framework that integrates a client-side Adaptive Orthogonal Noise Canceler (AONC) with server-side Distributed Dueling Double Deep Q-Network (D3QN) scheduling and Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO)-based aggregation. The AONC module implements a triple-defense mechanism via orthogonal subspace projection: (1) layer-wise adaptive EMA-quantile clipping to mitigate threshold imbalance, (2) progress-aware noise decay that balances early-stage privacy with late-stage efficiency, and (3) directional tuning that dynamically adjusts parallel-to-orthogonal gradient ratios. On the server side, D3QN enables dynamic resource allocation across heterogeneous devices, while PSO fusion corrects non-IID aggregation bias through particle-swarm-based weight optimization. Experiments on CIFAR-10/100 and Shakespeare datasets demonstrate that DualMask achieves 5.2% higher accuracy (84.1% vs 79.4% in non-IID settings) and 34.4% faster convergence (210 vs 320 rounds) compared to FedAvg. Additionally, DualMask reduces the privacy budget [Formula: see text] from 4.5 to 2.8 and communication cost by 37.2% (45 MB vs 65 MB). This constitutes a significant Pareto improvement, substantially expanding the trilemma frontier. The code and data are available at https://github.com/zhou-weib/DualMask.git."

Following the acquisition of informed consent, participants were assessed using various measures, including demographic and obstetric information, the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale, the Corona Disease Anxiety Scale (CDAS), and the NEO Personality Inventory-Revised during their third trimester of pregnancy. The same group of participants completed the Edinburgh Depression Scale and the Corona Disease Anxiety Scale (CDAS) 4-6 weeks after childbirth.                                                           Results and Discussion:                     There was a significant correlation between family income, unwanted pregnancy as perceived by both the mother and father, and antenatal depression. Additionally, marital satisfaction played a significant role in postpartum depression. Furthermore, antenatal depression was significantly associated with neuroticism, agreeableness, and physical symptoms related to Corona disease anxiety. Personality traits, with the exception of extroversion and conscientiousness, and various domains of Corona disease anxiety, excluding psychological symptoms, were also significantly associated with postpartum depression.                                                           Conclusion:                     During pandemics or epidemics, such as the COVID-19 outbreak, experiencing mental distress during pregnancy can contribute to mental health issues during the postpartum period. This risk is particularly true in individuals with unique personality traits, emphasizing the need for increased focus on mental health within prenatal care during these crises."
Crossref,valvular heart disease,The Severity of Disease and Hospital Length of Stay for the First and Second Admission of COVID-19 Patients: An Observational Study from Southeastern Iran,Milad Ahmadi Gohari; Mohammad Hossein Mehrolhassani; Shoboo Rahmati; Elham Sharifpoor; Hossein Mirzaei; Yunes Jahani,10.2174/0126667975341163241129050027,2026-10,Coronaviruses,"Background:                     This study aimed to investigate the severity of disease and length of hospital stay for COVID-19 patients admitted to a hospital in southeastern Iran.                                                           Method:                     This cross-sectional study was conducted in Kerman, Iran. Data were collected from patients who visited Afzalipour Hospital in Kerman more than twice during the COVID-19 epidemic from the end of February 2020 to March 21, 2021. We conducted two key analyses: 1. Mixed effect logistic regression was used to check the relationship between the variables and COVID-19 severity. 2. Mixed effect linear regression was used to check the relationship between the variables and the length of stay in the hospital.                                                           Results:                     The findings indicated that the most important risk factors for the severity of COVID-19 were heart diseases (OR=1.67,95%CI:1.20-2.30), increasing age (OR=2.23 for age&gt;54, 95%CI:1.70- 2.90), male gender (OR=1.47,95%CI:1.10-1.96), respiratory diseases other than asthma, and frequency of admission (OR=1.60,95%CI:1.20-2.15). All patients who underwent readmission experienced a shorter duration of hospitalization during their subsequent admission (OR=0.94,95%CI:0.91,0.96) and had a higher mortality rate (30% within 14 days, 26.6% between 14-90 days). Patients readmitted at intervals of 14-90 days and greater than 90 days exhibited lower disease severity compared to those readmitted within the 0-14 day period.                                                           Conclusion:                     Examining readmissions, the severity of COVID-19, and the length of hospital stay in affected patients are important factors for planning and allocating resources for COVID-19 management and treatment. These factors can help policymakers develop effective clinical guidelines for hospitalization or outpatient treatment of COVID-19 patients and contribute to reducing the burden of disease in the community."

Kinovea, as an accessible motion-analysis software, provides both visual and quantitative feedback. However, its application in supporting technique development among beginner athletes remains insufficiently explored. Aim: This study aims to describe the use of Kinovea in biomechanics training and examine its contribution to the awareness of kinematic characteristics and movement techniques among beginner athletes. Methods: A descriptive qualitative design involved 72 beginner athletes aged 18–25 years selected through purposive sampling. Data were collected over 16 weeks through interviews, field observations, and motion video recordings analyzed using Kinovea. Kinematic data focused on joint angles, stride behavior, and movement phases during walking, running, and the flight phase. Qualitative data were analyzed using content analysis with NVivo 12, while kinematic results were interpreted descriptively to identify performance patterns and areas for technical refinement. Result: Kinematic analysis showed coordinated joint-angle patterns across all phases. Walking analysis identified arm swing angles of 50.9°–58.8° and leg separation angles of 64.3°–67.2°, indicating a stable gait rhythm. The running analysis revealed knee angles of 68.8°–69.8° and elbow angles of 87.6°–89.1°, indicating efficient propulsive mechanics. The flight phase demonstrated knee angles of 81.2°–87.8° and elbow angles of 80.4°–88.3°, suggesting effective momentum use and postural stability. These measurements supported stride-efficiency assessment and technique evaluation. Qualitative findings revealed that Kinovea enabled athletes to interpret movement phases and identify technical inefficiencies through slow-motion and frame-by-frame visualization. Conclusion: Kinovea supports basic motion analysis by providing clear kinematic information and helping beginner athletes observe and refine their movement techniques. The findings also offer practical value for coaches by enabling more precise identification of inefficient patterns and guiding targeted corrections during early-stage training."

OpenAlex,aortic stenosis,Outcomes of Surgical versus Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement: A Clinical Review,"Stang, Grace",,2026-01-01,Digital Commons - Gardner-Webb University (Gardner–Webb University),"Introduction: Surgical aortic valve replacement (SAVR) has been the predominant treatment for aortic stenosis (AS) for decades. However, transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) is becoming increasingly popular. Originally, TAVRs were only performed on patients who were deemed high-risk for surgery and would have died without the valve replacement. The purpose of this paper is to determine if TAVR or SAVR has better health outcomes for all patients no matter their surgical risk. Methods: A search via PubMed database was done using the key words “aortic stenosis”, “surgical aortic valve replacement”, “transcatheter aortic valve replacement”, and “mortality.” Additional search filters were applied for randomized control trials, systematic reviews, and meta- analyses. Dates were restricted to the last 5 years, and restrictions were added for English language and free full text only. This yielded 67 results and 5 were selected. Results: Of the five reviewed articles, all were meta-analyses and one systematic review. There was a total of 52122 patients. Primary endpoints across all articles were that there is no significant difference between TAVR and SAVR in the outcomes studied. Discussion: This review of studies provided supportive evidence that both TAVR and SAVR are valid treatment options or AS. TAVR had better short-term outcomes while SAVR had better long-term outcomes."

Transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) has emerged as an alternative to surgical aortic valve replacement (SAVR), expanding from inoperable to low-risk populations. This systematic review compares short- and long-term outcomes between TAVI and SAVR in patients with severe AS. Following PRISMA 2020 guidelines, PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science were searched (2010–2025). Eligible randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and comparative cohorts reporting mortality, stroke, pacemaker, or valve durability were included. Twenty-one studies (16 RCTs, 5 registries; n≈23,000) were analyzed. Thirty-day mortality was similar (RR 0.94, 95% CI 0.82–1.07). TAVI reduced bleeding (RR 0.63) and acute kidney injury (RR 0.71) but increased pacemaker implantation (RR 2.46) and paravalvular leak (RR 3.32). Five-year results (PARTNER 3, NOTION) showed comparable survival and valve durability. TAVI provides equivalent survival and superior early recovery compared to SAVR, although conduction disturbances and leak remain limitations. SAVR remains preferred for younger or bicuspid patients pending longer durability data."

This review summarizes the current evidence on Lp(a) and AVS pathophysiology, the diagnostic and prognostic role of Lp(a), and the therapeutic potential of Lp(a)-lowering agents. Emerging Lp(a)-targeted therapies, including antisense oligonucleotides and siRNA-based agents, could reshape AVS management by providing the first pharmacological option to slow disease progression in selected high-risk patients."

Assessment of severity assumes the greatest importance when aortic valve replacement is under consideration. In addition to a number of well-known technical frustrations in the Doppler diagnosis, a puzzling and persistent discrepancy between aortic valve gradients obtained by Doppler and those measured at catheterization emerged, further clouding the issue. This discordance led several investigators to the discovery of pressure recovery (PR) of varying degrees in the ascending aorta in AS patients distal to the stenotic valve. PR is often a significant factor in assessing the physiologic burden of AS. The impact of PR must be considered in the comprehensive assessment of AS severity."

METHODS Propensity score matching was used to compare patients undergoing SAVR or transfemoral (TF) TAVR with similar baseline characteristics. The primary end-points were all-cause mortality and major adverse cardiac and cerebrovascular events (MACCE) at 10 years. Prespecified secondary end-points included cerebrovascular accidents, repeat aortic intervention, repeat hospitalization due to cardiac reasons and heart failure. All outcomes were adjudicated through a linkage with administrative databases. RESULTS From the entire cohort (n = 5707 SAVR and n = 1911 TAVR treated between December 2010 and June 2012), 650 matched pairs of patients were considered. At 10 years, TF-TAVR was associated with a higher risk of all-cause mortality [Hazard ratio (HR) 1.39, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.22–1.59; p &amp;lt; 0.001] and MACCE (HR 1.33, 95% CI 1.18–1.51; p &amp;lt; 0.001) compared to SAVR. Secondary end-points did not differ for rehospitalization for heart failure (p = 0.443) or cardiac reasons (p = 0.552), and for cerebrovascular events (p = 0.573), but TAVR had a significantly lower risk of repeat aortic intervention [Sub-distributional HR (SHR), 0.33; 95% CI, 0.12–0.91; p = 0.024] at 10 years. CONCLUSIONS At 10 years, early generation TAVR had significantly higher risk of all-cause mortality and MACCE, but lower risk of repeat aortic intervention in clinical practice."

Zoidov,10.17816/pavlovj630485,2025-12-28,I P Pavlov Russian Medical Biological Herald,"INTRODUCTION: Currently, X-ray endovascular technologies in the amount of endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR) are widely used not only in the treatment of scheduled patients with abdominal aortic aneurysm, but also in emergency situations, such as acute symptomatic aneurysm or its rupture, as an alternative to an open surgery. Endovascular treatment is characterized by minimal trauma, low mortality and a short hospital stay. However, for some patients, EVAR poses significant challenges and risks. One such group is patients with chronic kidney disease due to atherosclerotic lesions of the renal arteries. The article discusses a clinical case of a 67-year-old patient with an acute symptomatic abdominal aortic aneurysm, 5 cm in diameter, with a prominent concomitant cardiac pathology and stage IV chronic kidney disease (glomerular filtration rate 25 ml/min/1.73 m2) with the underlying critical stenosis of both renal arteries (subocclusion on the left and 85% stenosis on the right). The patient underwent emergency surgery in the amount of infrarenal aortic grafting and stenting of both renal arteries using gadodiamide. A reduction in the volume of contrast agent administered was achieved by stenting the renal arteries before EVAR. As a result, the stents, due to their radiopaque properties, were used as a guide for localizing the renal arteries during endograft placement. The postoperative period was uneventful, except for an early postoperative increase in blood creatinine up to 344 µmol/l and stabilization at this level. The patient was transferred to the vascular surgery department for symptomatic treatment. With infusion therapy, the blood creatinine level decreased to 270 µmol/l. On day 5, the patient was discharged for outpatient follow-up at the place of residence. CONCLUSION: This clinical case demonstrates a possibility of performing endovascular intervention in patients with stage IIIb–IV chronic kidney disease, due to, on the one hand, improvement of endovascular technologies, and, on the other, reduction of the volume of contrast agent used during surgery."

Renal infarction is rare but may be the first clue. A previously healthy 32-yearold woman had intermittent fever for six weeks and sudden right-sided flank pain for two days. Examination revealed a holosystolic murmur and right costovertebral angle tenderness. Investigations showed raised inflammatory markers and a positive rheumatoid factor, while repeated blood cultures were negative. Echocardiography showed severe mitral regurgitation without visiblevegetations, and computed tomography angiography confirmed right renal infarction. Using modified Duke criteria, the diagnosis was made and empiric intravenous vancomycin and ceftriaxone were started.

The reported incidence is 6–10 per 1 000 live births. Comorbid connective tissue dysplasia (CTD) significantly influences the clinical course of CHD, contributing to structural weakness of cardiac and vascular tissues, elevated risk of postoperative complications, and poorer long-term outcomes. Objective. To synthesise current evidence regarding the clinical features, complications, and management of congenital heart disease in children with concomitant connective tissue dysplasia; to identify key pathophysiological mechanisms and highlight promising diagnostic and therapeutic strategies. Materials and methods. This review analyses global trends in the association between CHD and CTD in the paediatric population. Scientific literature indexed in PubMed, ScienceDirect, and Google Scholar from 2017 to 2024 was systematically evaluated. Results. Current research indicates that molecular alterations in connective tissue components—particularly fibrillin, collagen, and transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) receptors—impair myocardial and vascular remodelling, thereby increasing susceptibility of valves and arterial walls to haemodynamic stress. Children with CTD frequently exhibit valve prolapse with regurgitation, aortic dilatation, aneurysm formation, vascular dissection, and heightened risk of perioperative haemorrhage and infection. These patients are more likely to require repeat surgical procedures and demonstrate delayed wound healing. Well-characterised syndromes—including Marfan, Loeys–Dietz, and Ehlers–Danlos—demonstrate unequivocal cardiovascular involvement. Optimal management mandates a multidisciplinary strategy encompassing early recognition of phenotypic features, comprehensive imaging (echocardiography, cardiac magnetic resonance imaging, angiography), and targeted genetic testing. Regular surveillance of aortic dimensions and valvular function, judicious timing of interventions, and appropriate pharmacological prophylaxis are critical to mitigating severe complications. Conclusions. Connective tissue dysplasia constitutes a significant comorbidity that exacerbates the natural history of congenital heart disease, increases surgical risk, and necessitates individualised therapeutic planning. Phenotypic signs of CTD must be actively sought and integrated into preoperative assessment and surgical decision-making. A coordinated, multidisciplinary approach—supported by advanced imaging, genetic counselling, and longitudinal follow-up—is essential for risk reduction and improved long-term prognosis. Further research into the molecular genetics and pathogenesis of CTD holds promise for early risk stratification and personalised management in children with CHD."

Traditional surgical repair remains the gold standard, but high-risk patients often require less invasive alternatives. Aim: To review catheter-based interventions for MR, focusing on nursing care, anatomical considerations, procedural techniques, and clinical outcomes. Methods: This narrative review synthesizes evidence from pivotal trials (EVEREST I &amp; II, COAPT) and current guidelines (ACC/AHA, ESC/EACTS), emphasizing anatomical prerequisites, device selection, procedural workflow, and complication management. Results: Transcatheter edge-to-edge repair (TEER), modeled on the Alfieri stitch, has emerged as the most validated percutaneous approach. Favorable anatomy includes adequate leaflet length, central jet location, and mitral valve area &gt;4 cm². Technological advances (MitraClip G4, PASCAL Precision) enable treatment of complex anatomies such as flail segments and commissural jets. TEER demonstrates significant symptomatic improvement and reduced hospitalization in high-risk cohorts, with low rates of major complications (SLDA 1.5–5%, leaflet injury ≤2%, device embolization ≤0.7%). Nursing roles encompass preprocedural preparation, intraoperative monitoring, anticoagulation management, and postprocedural surveillance for complications such as tamponade, vascular injury, and residual MR. Conclusion: TEER represents a transformative option for patients unsuitable for surgery, offering durable MR reduction and improved quality of life when applied with rigorous anatomical assessment and multidisciplinary collaboration."

Left-sided involvement is rare and usually attributed to intracardiac shunting or pulmonary sources of serotonin. This case report highlights a rare presentation of CHD involving left- and right-sided valves in the absence of an anatomic shunt or bronchopulmonary NET. Case Presentation A 67-year-old woman with a longstanding, functional, small bowel Grade 1 NET and metastatic liver and peritoneal disease presented with worsening dyspnea and peripheral edema. She had a 10-year disease history, previously managed with debulking surgery, somatostatin analogs, peptide receptor radionuclide therapy (PRRT), and everolimus. Echocardiography and cardiac MRI demonstrated extensive left- and right-sided valvular involvement with severe mitral regurgitation, moderate aortic and pulmonic regurgitation, and mild tricuspid regurgitation, yet without intracardiac shunt. An elevated Qp/Qs ratio of 2.6 was attributed to severe left-sided valvular regurgitation. The patient improved on diuretic therapy and was referred for surgical evaluation of valve replacement prior to additional systemic treatment. Discussion This case illustrates an atypical presentation of bilateral carcinoid valvulopathy in the absence of intracardiac shunting, likely due to overwhelming systemic serotonin from tumor burden. Although serotonin is typically inactivated in the lungs, extensive exposure may surpass this protective mechanism. The potential role of SSRIs remains inconclusive. Multidisciplinary coordination is essential for optimizing cardiac and oncologic outcomes, especially when systemic therapy such as PRRT is considered. Conclusion Left- and right-sided CHD may develop in patients with small bowel NETs even without anatomic shunting. High tumor burden and systemic serotonin exposure may override pulmonary inactivation, leading to left-sided involvement. Early recognition and multidisciplinary care are critical for effective management."
OpenAlex,valvular heart disease,Left Atrial Reservoir Strain in Cardiovascular and Systemic Disease: Advances and Clinical Applications From Physiology to Practice,Andrea null Sonaglioni; Gian Luigi null Nicolosi,10.31083/rcm46198,2025-12-25,Reviews in Cardiovascular Medicine,"Traditional parameters, such as left atrial size or volume, typically reflect chronic pressure and volume overload; however, these abnormalities only become evident at advanced stages, often missing early signs of dysfunction. In contrast, left atrial reservoir strain (LASr), measured by speckle-tracking echocardiography, offers a sensitive and dynamic assessment of atrial mechanics, integrating atrial compliance with left ventricular diastolic interaction. Moreover, impaired LASr reflects atrial stiffness and fibrosis, and correlates with elevated filling pressures, making the LASr parameter a comprehensive biomarker of left-sided cardiac function. Indeed, LASr has demonstrated diagnostic and prognostic value across a wide spectrum of conditions. In heart failure with preserved ejection fraction, LASr refines the assessment of diastolic dysfunction and predicts hospitalization and mortality. In atrial fibrillation, reduced strain correlates with atrial fibrosis and left atrial appendage dysfunction, identifying patients at increased risk of arrhythmia recurrence and thromboembolism. In valvular disease, LASr uncovers subclinical remodeling and stratifies risk even in patients with apparently moderate aortic stenosis. Meanwhile, in addition to cardiovascular disease, LASr can detect early atrial impairment in systemic disorders such as hypertension, diabetes, obesity, and amyloidosis, often before structural enlargement becomes evident. Our group has shown that LASr predicts persistent hypertension after gestational hypertensive disorders, reveals subclinical diastolic dysfunction in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, non-invasively predicts left atrial appendage thrombus in atrial fibrillation, stratifies outcomes in moderate aortic stenosis, and provides prognostic information in acute ischemic stroke. This narrative review outlines the physiological basis, technical considerations, and clinical applications of LASr, discusses its limitations and future perspectives—including multimodality imaging and artificial intelligence—and underscores its transition from a research metric to a dynamic biomarker ready for clinical practice."

Early detection of abnormal cardiac structure may facilitate timely intervention and improve clinical outcomes. Methods: This cross-sectional descriptive study analyzed echocardiographic data from 66 ESRD patients in a hemodialysis unit between March 15th, 2020, and December 31th, 2021. A total of 66 patients were included. Two-dimensional echocardiographic parameters were assessed to evaluate cardiac structure and function. Results: The mean age of the patients was 63.5 years (57.3–72). Among the 66 patients, 36 (54.5%) were male, and 30 (45.5%) were female. Hypertension was present in 83.3% of patients, while 43.9% had diabetes. Left ventricular (LV) dilation was diagnosed in 7.6% of patients, LV systolic dysfunction in 16.7%, and LV hypertrophy (LVH) in 54.5%. Diastolic dysfunction was detected in 44 patients (66.7%) and valvular heart disease was observed in 20 patients (30.3%). Conclusions: Echocardiography plays a crucial role in identifying cardiac abnormalities in patients with ESRD. The high prevalence of LVH and diastolic dysfunction underscores the need for routine cardiac evaluation in this population. Future research should focus on long-term follow-up to better understand the progression of cardiac dysfunction and its impact on patient outcomes."

However, long-term durability remains limited by structural valve degeneration (SVD). Case report A 70-year-old male presented with severe heart failure 4 years after bioprosthetic mitral and aortic valve replacement. Imaging confirmed SVD affecting both valves, necessitating high-risk redo surgery. Postoperatively, the patient developed profound systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) to cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB), refractory to vasopressors and steroids, and died within 24 hours. Discussion Further investigations revealed elevated isolated anti-cardiolipin IgM antibodies, raising suspicion of autoimmune-mediated valve thrombosis as a contributor to this case of early SVD. Conclusion This case highlights the importance of thorough diagnostic evaluation in cases of early SVD, the need to individualise anticoagulation strategies in at-risk patients, and serves as a critical reminder of the serious inflammatory complications that can occur post-surgery."

Wright; Fátima Coronado,10.1177/15409996251403974,2025-12-23,Journal of Women s Health,"Background: Cardiovascular diseases are among the leading causes of maternal morbidity and mortality in the United States. During 2010–2020, 1 in 10 severe maternal morbidities (SMMs) during delivery hospitalization was heart disease (HD)-related. This report synthesizes science, including methodologies, challenges, and opportunities, and summarizes national estimates on HD during pregnancy, focusing on congenital heart disease (CHD), cardiomyopathies (CM), valvular heart disease (VHD), arrhythmias (ARR), and heart failure (HF). Methods and Results: We analyzed large nationwide databases, including the National Inpatient Sample and the Nationwide Readmissions Database. The prevalence of HD complicating deliveries ranges from approximately 20–40 cases per 10,000 deliveries. Increasing trends were observed in CHD, ARR, and HF. HF, particularly peripartum CM, is a leading cause of adverse maternal outcomes, including in-hospital mortality and SMM. VHD prevalence has declined, whereas ARR has become the most prevalent HD during pregnancy hospitalizations. Significant gaps exist due to inconsistent definitions and methodologies, limiting comparability and clinical utility. Proposed solutions include adopting standardized definitions, developing a core outcome set, improving data quality through structured documentation and standardized data models, and using validated algorithms and indices. Collaboration among multidisciplinary teams is essential to enhance research quality. Conclusion: The efforts aligning definitions of HD, outcomes, and indices with public health measures and initiatives present an opportunity to create a unifying framework that connects patient-level data to system-wide improvements. This integration helps ensure that advances in methodology translate into better care delivery, billing accuracy, research quality, and public health surveillance, and ultimately enhance outcomes for pregnant women with HD."

In Indonesia, the most prevalent form of VHD is rheumatic heart disease, which is associated with a hospital mortality rate of 6.5% following valve surgery. Previous studies have shown that, post-surgery, morbidity rates remain high: 30.8% of patients experience prolonged intensive care unit stays (&gt;96 hours), 30.67% require extended mechanical ventilation (&gt;24 hours), and 52% need prolonged use of inotropic agents (≥14 days). Right ventricular (RV) dysfunction is closely associated with these three morbidity parameters, as well as with 30-day postoperative mortality. However, limited research in Indonesia has explored the most effective parameters for evaluating RV function as a predictor of postoperative morbidity and mortality following heart valve surgery. This prospective cohort study was conducted at the Department of Cardiology and Vascular Medicine, Universitas Indonesia, and the National Cardiovascular Center Harapan Kita (NCCHK) from October 2023 to July 2024. During this period, 174 patients with VHD who underwent surgical valve replacement were enrolled. After applying exclusion criteria, 26 patients were excluded, resulting in a final study population of 148 patients. All participants underwent preoperative echocardiographic assessment of RV function, performed by two operators within 1 week prior to surgery. Among the 148 subjects, females comprised the majority (60.1%). Atrial fibrillation (AF) was the most common comorbidity, affecting 62.8% of the cohort. The most frequent morbidity outcome was prolonged mechanical ventilation, observed in 27.7% of cases. Of the total mortality events, 70% were cardiac-related, while the remaining 30% were due to non-cardiac causes. Multivariate analysis revealed that a preoperative S′&lt;10 cm/s was significantly associated with cardiac-related mortality [odds ratio (OR) 3.46; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.01-11.87; p=0.049]. Additionally, a preoperative S′&lt;11 cm/s was significantly associated with overall clinical outcomes, including both morbidity and all-cause mortality (OR 3.08; 95% CI 1.43-6.65; p=0.004). In conclusion, S′, an echocardiographic parameter reflecting RV function, demonstrates potential as a predictive marker for postoperative morbidity and mortality in patients undergoing heart valve surgery."
OpenAlex,valvular heart disease,Progressive and concordant alterations in transcriptional and gut microbiota across aortic valve calcification severity,Jue Wang; Ruihang Qu; Weicheng Huang; Yue Chen; Yun Li; Qi Lin; Ziji Wu; Hangfei Yan; Tingting Yu; Chiyin Wang; Xinlei Ren; Xi Wang; Jinyu Wu,10.1128/spectrum.02137-25,2025-12-22,Microbiology Spectrum,"ABSTRACT Calcific aortic valve disease (CAVD) is a common disorder associated with substantial morbidity and mortality. Although the gut microbiome has complex associations with cardiovascular disease, its variation across the calcification spectrum in CAVD remains poorly defined. We profiled aortic-valve transcriptomes from 31 patients spanning graded calcification and paired these with matched stool microbiome profiles. We identified subtle yet widespread transcriptional changes in mild CAVD (m-CAVD), consistent with a progressive relationship between calcification burden and gene-expression remodeling. At the community level, the gut microbiome in m-CAVD exhibited an intermediate configuration between non- and higher-calcification profiles, suggesting an early shift in the gut ecosystem along the disease continuum. At the genus level, we identified 11 taxa associated with stage; notably, Anaerococcus increased with calcification burden, whereas Rheinheimera declined across stages. These results refine the pathophysiology landscape of CAVD by connecting stage-dependent valvular transcriptional changes with coordinated shifts in the gut microbiome and indicate that early, microbiome-targeted interventions may be promising. IMPORTANCE Calcific aortic valve disease is a common valvular heart disease. Due to the difficulty in sampling arterial calcified tissues, research on the interaction between their gene expression and the gut has been limited. In this study, by analyzing the transcriptional profiles of calcified aortic valve tissues from patients with different levels of calcification and the characteristics of their corresponding gut microbiota, we identified consistent features between lesion gene expression and gut microbiota variation. This provides important evidence for the association between the gut microbiota and disease development stages, offering a new perspective for understanding disease progression and early intervention."

However, information regarding the factors influencing cardiovascular events in neonates and mothers within 6 months postpartum is limited. This study aimed to identify predictors of adverse maternal and neonatal outcomes in pregnancies of women with pre-existing heart disease. Methods: The study conducted a retrospective cross-sectional analysis of all pregnancies with a history of heart disease from January 2017 to January 2024, using secondary data from medical records at Dr M. Djamil Padang Hospital, Indonesia. We analysed the data using the χ2/Fisher’s exact test and logistic regression. Results: A total of 110 pregnant women with heart diseases were hospitalised during the study period, with an average age of 30.52 ± 6.00 years. The most common types of heart disease were valvular heart disease (28%), chronic hypertension (24%) and congenital heart disease (23%). In 27.2% of cases, adverse maternal outcomes included mortality (10%), heart failure (8.2%), arrhythmia (4.5%), rehospitalisation (3.6%) and thromboembolic event (0.9%). Meanwhile, 57.3% of cases had neonatal adverse outcomes, including mortality (5.4%), low Apgar score (16.4%), prematurity (28.2%), low birthweight (6.4%) and congenital heart disease (0.9%). The multivariate analysis discovered that moderate-to-severe left heart obstruction (OR 14.184; 95% CI [2.725–73.836]; p=0.002) and reduced ejection fraction &lt;40% (OR 16.211; 95% CI [1.712–153.507]; p=0.015) were the main factors that led to adverse maternal outcomes.

Xenogeneic tissues are widely used in cardiac surgery, both in biological prosthetic heart valves, and as vascular and intracardiac patches. Modern chemical methods of xenogenic tissue treatment aimed at elimination of its immunogenicity but they do not, however, completely remove xenoantigens from the tissues. The residual carbohydrate antigens are thought to be a trigger of immune response against the animal xenotissues. At the same time, the role of immune response to xenogeneic antigens for induction of inflammation, valve dysfunction, and calcification are under discussion. The aim of this review was to summarize the research data on immune response to xenogeneic tissue implanted into the heart, and to find tools of preventing this immune conflict. Modification of pericardium of large animals by various methods does not entirely remove carbohydrate epitopes from extracellular matrix and cell membranes, which are recognized by pre-existing antibodies of M and G classes. The highly dynamic functioning of xenogeneic biological prostheses increases their antigenicity by reducing the primary cross-linking of extracellular matrix and activating the alternative complement pathway associated with adsorption iC3b complement component on xenogeneic tissue, serving as an opsonin for micro- and macrophages. The inflammatory endotypes of individual patients may be genetically determined by increased synthesis of certain cytokines. In particular, rheumatic heart disease, as a basis for the disorders of mitral heart valves, is characterized by an increase in TNFα, IFNγ and IL-6. Any of these cytokines may be targets for biological therapies aimed at limiting the constitutional inflammatory endotype. The OMICs technologies applied to various studies of biological degradation of xenogeneic heart valve prostheses, their implantation, and wide clinical examination of patients, may help us to find novel variants of immune-inflammatory endotypes leading to dysfunction of bioprostheses, and to identify target molecules for potential inhibition of antixenogeneic immune response."
OpenAlex,valvular heart disease,ACEF score as a predictor of new-onset atrial fibrillation in patients with ST-elevation myocardial infarction: A retrospective cohort study,Evliya Akdeniz; Burak Hünük; Cennet Yıldız; Süleyman Deniz Abdullahoğlu; Merve Ortakaya; Dilay Karabulut; Fatma Nihan Turhan Çağlar; Ömer Kozan,10.1371/journal.pone.0339483,2025-12-19,PLoS ONE,"Background New-onset atrial fibrillation (NOAF) during acute ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) is common and linked to adverse outcomes. This study aimed to assess the predictive value of the age–creatinine–ejection fraction (ACEF) score for NOAF in STEMI patients. Methods We retrospectively analyzed 951 STEMI patients who underwent primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) at out tertiary center between 2020 and 2023. Patients with prior atrial fibrillation (AF), AF on admission, cardiogenic shock, heart failure, significant valvular disease, or failed PCI were excluded. Clinical, laboratory, and echocardiographic data were collected, and ACEF scores were calculated. NOAF was defined as any AF episode during hospitalization in patients without prior AF. The optimal ACEF cutoff was determined using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis (Youden’s index), and multivariate logistic regression identified independent predictors of NOAF. Results NOAF occurred in 63 patients (6.6%). These patients were older, more often female, and had lower systolic blood pressure, lower left ventricular ejection fraction, and higher C-reactive protein and creatinine levels (all p &lt; 0.05). In-hospital major adverse cardiac events (MACE) and mortality were significantly higher in the NOAF group than patients in without NOAF group (22.2% vs. 6.2%, and 15.9% vs. 4.3%, respectively; p &lt; 0.001). The ACEF score was significantly higher in patients with NOAF (1.73 ± 0.74 vs. 1.42 ± 0.64, p &lt; 0.001). ROC analysis showed an area under curve (AUC) of 0.643 (95% CI: 0.571–0.715; p &lt; 0.001). An ACEF score ≥1.32 predicted NOAF with 73% sensitivity and 55.6% specificity. In multivariate analysis, ACEF remained an independent predictor of NOAF (OR ~1.5, p = 0.02), but among its components, only age was independently associated with NOAF (OR ~1.03 per year, p = 0.01). Conclusions The ACEF score modestly predicts NOAF in STEMI patients, but its predictive power only incremental to age alone. Further studies are warranted for this field."
