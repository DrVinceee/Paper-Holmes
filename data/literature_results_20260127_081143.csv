Data on the clinical burden associated with elevated lipoprotein(a) levels in patients at high and very high cardiovascular risk remain limited. We evaluated the prevalence of ASCVD and LDL-C target achievement in subjects with high and very high elevated Lp(a) levels referred to a lipid unit.
In this retrospective study, 1755 subjects were evaluated; 265 with Lp(a) ≥240nmol/L were included. The population was divided into two groups: high Lp(a) (240-429nmol/L, n=216) and very high Lp(a) (≥430nmol/L, n=49). ASCVD prevalence was 58% in the very high group and 48% in the high group (p=0.23). Age and statin intensity were higher in the very high Lp(a) group. LDL-C target achievement was low in both groups: 20.0% and 25.4% of very high-risk patients reached <55mg/dL as well as 18.2% and 17.2% of high-risk patients reached <70mg/dL in very high and high Lp(a) groups, respectively.
Subjects with elevated Lp(a) levels showed a high prevalence of ASCVD and low LDL-C target attainment despite high-intensity statin therapy. These findings support the need for Lp(a) screening and additional lipid-lowering strategies in high-risk patients."

This study evaluated the prognostic impact of PPM following TAVI in relation to baseline right-sided cardio-pulmonary remodelling.
Consecutive patients who underwent transfemoral TAVI for severe symptomatic AS between 2015 and 2022 were identified (n=1,118). PPM was defined at discharge according to Valve Academic Research Consortium-3 criteria. Baseline right-sided cardio-pulmonary remodelling was defined as either right ventricular dysfunction (RVD: tricuspid annular plane systolic excursion [TAPSE] <17mm) or pulmonary hypertension (PH: pulmonary arterial systolic pressure [PASP] ≥60mmHg). Multivariable Cox regression identified independent predictors of all-cause mortality.
Moderate and severe PPM were observed in 235 (21.0%) and 72 (6.4%) patients, respectively, and RVD and PH in 95 (8.5%) and 286 (26.0%) patients, respectively. Moderate (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR] 1.42 [95% CI 1.15-1.76], p<0.001) and severe (aHR 5.94 [95% CI 4.45-7.94], p<0.001) PPM were independently associated with all-cause mortality. In patients with moderate and severe PPM, PH (aHR 1.48 [95% CI 1.08-2.03], p=0.014) and RVD (aHR 2.14 [95% CI 1.07-4.29], p=0.033) were significant and independent predictors of all-cause mortality. In patients with baseline RVD/PH, severe PPM (aHR 4.75 [95% CI 3.20-7.04], p<0.001) remained significantly and independently associated with all-cause mortality.
PPM is associated with increased risk of mortality following TAVI, particularly in patients with pre-existing right-sided cardio-pulmonary remodelling. These results support the need for improved detection and prevention of PPM after TAVI, especially in vulnerable subgroups of AS patients with RVD/PH."

Advances,"Reduced LV ejection fraction (LVEF) in aortic stenosis may result from afterload mismatch or reduced contractility. Limited data exist on post-transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) LVEF changes and factors linked to persistent low LVEF.
The aim of this substudy was to identify variables associated with persistent low LVEF after TAVI.
The COMPARE-TAVI 1 trial is an all-comer study in which patients scheduled for transfemoral TAVI were randomized 1:1 to receive either the Sapien 3/Sapien 3 Ultra or Myval/Myval Octacor transcatheter heart valve. Patients were categorized into 2 groups based on their baseline LVEF: low LVEF (≤40%) or normal LVEF (>40%). Serial LVEF were analyzed alongside 12-month mortality.
Of 1,029 patients, men comprised 60%. The mean LVEF was 55% ± 14%. Among patients with low baseline LVEF (n = 151, 15%), the mean LVEF improved from 31% ± 6% to 45% ± 15% at 1 month, and 52% ± 14% at 12 months (P < 0.001). However, 20% of these patients had persistent LVEF ≤40% at 1 year, while 5% of patients with normal baseline LVEF declined to ≤40%. Chronic heart failure, pacemaker pre-TAVI, baseline LVEF, left ventricular end-diastolic diameter, aortic mean gradient, and stroke volume index were associated with persistent low LVEF at 1 year. No significant differences in 1-year mortality were observed between groups.
TAVI improves LVEF in the majority of patients with low baseline LVEF. However, a subset of patients experiences persistent left ventricular impairment, with chronic heart failure, pacemaker, and baseline LVEF as key predictors."

Transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) is effective in MAVD patients with mortality rates comparable to pure aortic stenosis (PAS). While most TAVR complications also occur at similar rates between the MAVD and PAS populations, recent studies have shown conflicting results.
A systematic literature review was conducted on PubMed and Embase for studies on the outcomes of TAVR in MAVD from inception until May 2024. Primary outcomes were short- and long-term mortality. Secondary outcomes were paravalvular regurgitation (PVR), vascular and bleeding complications, pacemaker implantation, and cerebrovascular complications. A random-effects model was used to pool risk ratios (RR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI).
Eleven observational studies, including 133,558 patients, were included in the analysis. There were no significant differences in primary endpoints (p>0.05). MAVD was associated with a higher risk of paravalvular regurgitation (RR: 1.29, 95% CI: 1.07-1.55) and higher risk of vascular complications (RR: 1.20, 95% CI: 1.01-1.44). No significant differences were noted in other secondary outcomes (p>0.05), although there was a nonsignificant trend towards a decreased risk of cerebrovascular complications associated with TAVR in MAVD patients.
TAVR is an intervention with similar mortality and complication risk in MAVD and PAS patients. Future research is needed to further clarify the outcomes of TAVR in patients with MAVD, especially regarding cerebrovascular complications, long-term mortality, and the association of paravalvular regurgitation with mortality."

Advances,"Homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (HoFH) is a rare genetic disorder characterized by extreme elevations in low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels and premature cardiovascular disease.
The objective of this study was to assess the prevalence, clinical presentation, and current therapeutic approaches for aortic stenosis in Canadian patients with HoFH.
Demographic data, lipid profiles, and genetic testing results for patients with HoFH were collected prospectively since 2008. Reports from echocardiography, cardiac catheterization, and surgical or transcatheter interventions involving the aortic valve and/or ascending aorta were retrieved from medical records.
Data were available for 63 patients with either a clinical diagnosis (n = 14, 22.2%) or genetic confirmation (n = 49, 77.8%) of HoFH. The median age at diagnosis was 14.0 years (Q1-Q3: 6.0 to 31.0), the median highest recorded low-density lipoprotein cholesterol level was 13.0 mmol/L (Q1-Q3: 10.6-16.3), and 17 patients (27.0%) developed moderate-to-severe aortic stenosis. Extensive calcification of the aortic valve and ascending aorta, combined with severe valvular and/or supravalvular stenosis and coronary ostial stenosis, necessitated complex and often consecutive surgical procedures. Six transcatheter aortic valve replacements were performed in 4 patients, 4 of which failed. Thirteen patients (20.6%) underwent at least 1 surgical aortic valve procedure. Patients developed aortic stenosis at a young age despite intensive treatment, including lipoprotein apheresis started at an early age.
Moderate-to-severe aortic stenosis was observed in 27.0% of patients in the Canadian HoFH Registry, with 20.6% requiring invasive intervention. The severe aortic phenotype associated with HoFH requires complex, multidisciplinary surgical management in specialized centers with appropriate expertise."

Comparative outcome data for balloon-expandable valves (BEV) and self-expanding valves (SEV) in this population remain scarce.
This retrospective single-center study evaluated 246 consecutive subjects with left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) < 50% who underwent transfemoral TAVR between January 2015 and June 2025. Clinical, echocardiographic, and procedural characteristics were compared between BEV (n = 96) and SEV (n = 150) recipients. Long-term all-cause mortality served as the primary endpoint.
Individuals treated with BEV were older (78.8 +- 7.9 vs. 75.7 +- 9.8 years; P = 0.019) and demonstrated higher EuroSCORE II (European System for Cardiac Operative Risk Evaluation II) values (24.9 +- 6.2% vs. 22.2 +- 15.8%; P = 0.01). Periprocedural and in-hospital clinical outcomes, including mortality, vascular complications, and pacemaker requirement, were comparable between groups. SEV implantation yielded lower post-procedural transvalvular gradients (mean 7.8 +- 4.0 mmHg vs. 9.6 +- 4.1 mmHg; P = 0.001). Although crude mortality was observed more frequently among BEV patients (50.0% vs. 36.0%; P = 0.041), Kaplan-Meier survival curves showed no survival difference (log-rank P = 0.92). In multivariable Cox regression, predictors of long-term mortality included older age (hazard ratio [HR] 1.05; P = 0.007), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) (HR: 2.64; P < 0.001), coronary artery disease (HR: 2.08; P = 0.018), lower serum albumin (HR: 0.63; P = 0.011), and lower hemoglobin (HR: 0.84; P = 0.023); valve type was not predictive.
In patients with LVSD undergoing TAVR, BEV and SEV provided comparable procedural and long-term outcomes. Although SEV yielded lower postoperative gradients, valve type did not affect survival. Future studies with larger samples and higher use of new-generation devices are warranted to refine valve selection in this high-risk group."

We aimed to determine the incidence and risk factors for CVE at 30 days and 1 year after TAVI in a large, real-world patient cohort and evaluate the association of these events with all-cause mortality at 1 year.
All consecutive patients undergoing TAVI at a single centre between April 2008 and February 2024 were included in the analysis. CVE were defined as a composite of stroke and transient ischaemic attack.
One thousand and three patients (mean age 81.8 ± 7.0 years, 52.6% male, median EuroSCORE II 6% [Q1 = 3.51%; Q3 = 10.9%]) underwent TAVI with a self-expandable valve (SEV) (n = 275; 27.4%) or balloon-expandable valve (BEV) (n = 728; 72.6%). The cumulative incidence of CVE was 3.6% (95% confidence interval (95% CI) = [2.6%; 4.9%], n = 36) at 30 days (77.8% within 48 h) and 6.2% (95% CI = [4.8%; 7.8%], n = 62) at 1 year. Risk factors associated with a lower risk of CVE at 30 days included BEV vs. SEV (OR 0.32 [0.16-0.63], p = 0.0009) and larger baseline aortic valve area (AVA) (ORUnit = 0.1 cm2 0.74 [0.61-0.91], p = 0.0035), while the risk was higher in the case of new-onset atrial fibrillation (AF) (OR 3.19 [1.18-8.59], p = 0.0218), diabetes (OR 2.00 [1.01-3.97], p = 0.0484), and conversion to sternotomy (OR 16.57 [4.62-59.48], p < 0.0001). Analysis at 1-year follow-up identified the same associations. Finally, the occurrence of CVE significantly increased 1-year all-cause mortality (OR 2.44 [1.32-4.50], p = 0.0045).
CVE after TAVI were associated with double the odds of 1-year all-cause mortality. Risk factors associated with CVE include the use of a SEV, new-onset AF, diabetes, conversion to sternotomy, and a smaller AVA."

This shift raises important questions about valve durability, reintervention strategies, and long-term outcomes compared with surgical aortic valve replacement. Younger patients often present with unique anatomical challenges, including bicuspid aortic valves, and are expected to outlive their first valve prosthesis, making lifetime management a central concern. While new valve technologies show promise, long-term data remain limited. Careful patient selection, shared decision-making, and ongoing prospective studies are essential to guide the role of TAVR in this population."

Digital health,"There is a lack of studies investigating the pathophysiologic and phenotypic distinctiveness of aortic stenosis (AS). This heterogeneity has important implications for identifying optimal intervention timing and potential medical management. This study seeks to identify phenogroups of AS using unsupervised machine learning to improve risk stratification.
A total of 349 patients with asymptomatic AS from the PROGRESSA study were included in this analysis. Echocardiographic, clinical and blood sample data were used in the unsupervised clustering process. Longitudinal echocardiographic data were used to evaluate AS progression. Five clusters of patients were revealed using 18 variables selected by an unsupervised machine learning algorithm. Amongst them, aortic valvular phenotype, mean gradient, peak jet velocity (Vpeak), and left ventricle stroke volume were selected as discriminatory variables. Following the clustering process, characteristics differed between clusters, including age, body mass index, and sex ratio (all P < 0.001). Of note, cluster 1 showed higher AS severity at baseline with significantly higher initial Vpeak (344 [314; 376] cm/s) and calcium score (1257 [806; 1837] UA) (P < 0.001). Patients from cluster 1 had a faster AS progression (progression of Vpeak = 22 [9; 39] cm/s/year), and calcium score (213 [111; 307] UA/year) (P < 0.001). Cluster 1 was also associated with a higher composite risk of mortality and aortic valve replacement when adjusted for age, sex, and baseline AS severity (P < 0.001).
Artificial intelligence-guided phenotypic classification revealed 5 distinct groups and enhanced risk stratification of patients with AS. This approach may be useful to optimize and individualize medical and interventional management of AS."

While Impella-supported high-risk PCI (HRPCI) has demonstrated improved outcomes, its safety in patients with AS remains inadequately established.
We evaluated the effectiveness and safety of Impella support in patients with AS undergoing HRPCI.
Patients from the PROTECT III study (NCT04136392), a single-arm, FDA-audited, multicenter investigation of Impella-supported HRPCI, were assessed. AS severity was classified as none/trivial, mild, moderate, or severe. The primary outcome was 90-day major adverse cardiac and cerebrovascular events [MACCE, defined as the composite of all-cause mortality, MI, stroke/transient ischemic attack (TIA), and revascularization]. Secondary outcomes included in-hospital complications, stroke/TIA, and vascular complications requiring surgery.
Of the 594 patients with available echocardiographic data, 490 had none/trivial AS, while 34, 24, and 46 had mild, moderate, or severe AS, respectively. Patients with AS were older, had fewer incidences of diabetes, were more likely to have left main disease, and had higher left ventricular ejection fraction. Severely calcified lesions and atherectomy were more frequent among patients with moderate or severe AS. No significant differences were observed in PCI-related complications, stroke/TIA, and 30-day or 90-day MACCE across AS severity groups. However, transfusion rates were higher in patients with AS.
In patients undergoing Impella-supported HRPCI, 90-day MACCE and PCI-related complications were similar across all levels of AS severity. These findings suggest that the procedure is safe in this complex, high-risk population.

We aimed to evaluate the impact of a CVC in managing the treatment pathway of patients undergoing TAVI across Europe before and after implementing 8 Benchmark best practices.
The BENCHMARK registry (ClinicalTrials NCT04579445) was a multicenter international study of patients with severe symptomatic aortic stenosis undergoing TAVI with balloon-expandable valves across 28 European centers. Primary outcomes were hospital and intensive care length of stay (LoS). The secondary outcome was 30-day patient safety.
Of 2323 patients, 1262 were treated at centers without a pre-existing CVC and 1061 at centers with a pre-existing CVC; propensity matching resulted in 891 matched pairs. The total procedural time was significantly reduced in both groups (p < 0.001) after implementing Benchmark best practices. Hospital LoS was lower before Benchmark when a CVC was present and was significantly shorter in both groups following implementation (p < 0.001), as was the critical care LoS (p < 0.001). The presence of a CVC did not affect safety outcomes but was associated with a reduced risk of major vascular bleeding when combined with Benchmark best practices. Patient satisfaction was higher in centers with a pre-existing CVC (p < 0.001).
The addition of a CVC to the multidisciplinary team and their sustained contributions to processes of care align with the implementation of Benchmark practices, significantly decrease the health service requirements of TAVI patients, and are associated with improved patient-reported experiences."

However, the decision to continue anticoagulation therapy during the TAVR perioperative period and the optimal regimen for postoperative anticoagulation therapy remain debatable.
We searched the PubMed, EMBASE, MEDLINE, and Cochrane Library databases from their date of establishment to September 2024. We evaluated the choice of anticoagulation regimen in the TAVR perioperative and postoperative period. The primary outcomes were stroke, major bleeding, all-cause death, and net adverse clinical events (NACEs). The secondary outcomes were any bleeding, life-threatening bleeding, thrombotic events, and cardiovascular death. We conducted a meta-analysis with a RR and 95% CI. We performed subgroup analyses based on the follow-up duration, study design, and whether oral antiplatelet drugs (OAP) were used.
We compared four studies with peri-procedural continuation or discontinuation of oral anticoagulants (OACs). We did not observe a difference between the two groups with major bleeding, stroke, all-cause death, and NACEs (P > 0.05). Seventeen studies compared the effects of direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) and vitamin K antagonists (VKAs) after TAVR. The risk of NACEs (RR: 0.84, 95% CI :0.71-0.99, P = 0.04) and cardiovascular death (RR: 0.78, 95% CI: 0.69-0.87, P < 0.0001) was significantly lower in the DOACs than in the VKAs, but there were no statistically significant differences between the two groups with other outcomes. In the subgroup analysis, the beneficial effects of DOACs on NACEs were observed in the early postoperative (P < 0.05). During the long-term follow-up time after TAVR, DOACs had a lower risk of all-cause mortality and cardiovascular death compared to VKAs (P < 0.05), but an increased risk of any bleeding (P < 0.05). In RCTs, the risk of any bleeding owing to DOACs was higher (P < 0.05). In cohort studies, DOACs led to lower NACEs and cardiovascular death (P < 0.05). When administered in combination with OAP drugs, DOACs posed a lower risk for cardiovascular death and all-cause death than VKAs (P < 0.05). If not administered in combination with OAP drugs, DOACs posed a lower risk for all-cause death (P < 0.05).
In patients undergoing TAVR with established indications for OACs, periprocedural continuation of OACs may offer comparable clinical outcomes to temporary discontinuation. Furthermore, DOACs after TAVR appear to be associated with more favorable clinical outcomes than VKAs, although this benefit must be weighed against a potentially increased risk of bleeding. Further large-scale RCTs are warranted to validate these findings."

Despite advances, stroke remains a serious complication, impacting morbidity, mortality, and long-term cognitive function, thus the need for effective prevention strategies.
Based on a targeted review of the PubMed literature, this review addresses mechanisms and risk factors for stroke after TAVR and evaluates current preventive approaches. Cerebral embolic protection devices (CEPDs), particularly the Sentinel system, are discussed alongside other devices. Antithrombotic strategies before, during, and after TAVR are also reviewed, emphasizing the balance between thromboembolic protection and bleeding risk in an elderly population.
While some studies suggest CEPDs may reduce stroke, randomized trials have not confirmed broad and robust benefit, and high cost limits routine adoption. Future work should focus on high-risk subgroups, device refinement, and large-scale trials. For now, individualized antithrombotic therapy and selective CEPD use remain central to stroke prevention in TAVR."

Uncertainty and the need for reliable information regarding symptoms and progress was a significant problem.While some expressed unease at a major intervention for an asymptomatic condition, there were no outright objections to the idea.Those who declined participation in the RCT did so for personal reasons, for example, their home circumstances did not permit the required period of recovery or they felt too old to risk intervention.Reasons for accepting early intervention included the belief that the condition was serious and likely to deteriorate, and so better to have the intervention before such deterioration, as well as avoiding long waiting lists. Trusting clinicians' judgement played a part in some decisions. Patients also wanted choice in the type of intervention received.The longitudinal interviews (n=32) showed satisfaction in the early intervention group despite some problems in the the early recovery phase, especially for those undergoing surgical AVR.
Where evidence supports major intervention for an asymptomatic condition, patients are likely to accept the offer, although personal circumstances play an important role in decision-making. Where a condition is not well known to the public, such as AS, patients rely on clinicians and other resources to help decide. Liaison with patient groups in developing shared decision-making resources may help with complex decisions.

It demonstrates that not all aortic diseases are amenable to endovascular treatment and that open surgical treatment remains highly important, especially in younger patients with hereditary aortic diseases."

Cardiovascular Imaging,"Assessing cardiac function is critical for managing cardiovascular disease, guiding treatment, monitoring progression, and risk stratification. While left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) is firmly established, it has limitations. Myocardial contraction fraction (MCF) - the ratio of stroke volume to myocardial volume, is simple to compute without additional analysis and offers a promising alternative to LVEF.
MCF was assessed across four datasets spanning healthy controls and chronic structural cardiac disease, with direct comparison to LVEF. Association between age, sex and MCF were investigated in 3,541 healthy subjects from the UK Biobank and sex-specific reference ranges derived. Several cohorts were recruited to investigate the discriminative power of MCF and LVEF between health and physiological adaption (n=278 veteran athletes), pathological hypertrophy (hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, amyloid, Fabry, severe aortic stenosis, and hypertension; n=633) and dilatation (n=103 dilated cardiomyopathy). Ability to track disease severity was assessed by looking at 41,558 subjects from the UK Biobank. Finally, prognostication was assessed on 1,277 consecutive patients from an independent external dataset. All images were analysed using the same validated AI algorithm.
MCF varied with sex (mean MCF: 0.94 male; 1.1 female) but not age. Sex-specific reference ranges were established: [0.68-1.20] for male, [0.82-1.38] for female. MCF decreased in pathological disease (e.g. mean MCF: 0.72 HCM; 0.69 severe AS; 0.5 amyloid; 0.9 hypertension) but there was no significant decrease in LVEF other than in amyloid (mean EF: 76% HCM; 64% severe AS; amyloid 56%; 65% hypertension). Both MCF and EF decreased in DCM (EF 34%; MCF 0.58). MCF decreased with worsening hypertension, whereas LVEF increased (P<0.05). MCF had superior prognostic ability to LVEF (MCF vs LVEF: HR=0.772 vs HR=0.816; χ²=198 vs χ²=151; p<0.001).
We established MCF reference ranges, showing superior performance for detecting early disease and tracking progression compared to LVEF. MCF offers enhanced prognostic utility, complementing established metrics of LV function."

This study sought to investigate 5-year clinical outcomes in patients with severe aortic stenosis with a small annulus compared with those with a large annulus following transcatheter aortic valve replacement with newer-generation balloon-expandable valves.
A total of 3182 patients with aortic stenosis treated with balloon-expandable valves were divided into small-annulus (≤430 mm2) and large-annulus (>430 mm2) groups. A 1:1 propensity-matched analysis was performed to adjust baseline differences. The primary end point was all-cause death at 5-year follow-up. Secondary end points included heart failure hospitalization, bioprosthetic valve failure, and aortic valve reintervention.
Among 533 matched pairs, compared with the large-annulus group, the small-annulus group had higher rates of aortic valve mean gradients ≥20 mm Hg (14.1% versus 2.9%; P<0.001) and severe prosthesis-patient mismatch (9.8% versus 5.2%; P=0.019). At 5 years, there were no significant differences in all-cause death (hazard ratio, 0.75 [95% CI, 0.52-1.09]; P=0.13). The incidence of heart failure rehospitalization, bioprosthetic valve failure, and aortic valve reintervention were similar between groups. Both groups achieved similar sustained improvements in New York Heart Association functional class and Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire-Overall Summary scores.
Despite higher transvalvular gradients and a greater rate of severe prosthesis-patient mismatch, 5-year clinical outcomes in patients with a small annulus were comparable to those with a large annulus following transcatheter aortic valve replacement using newer-generation balloon-expandable valves."

With a focus on the prevalent psychological complications following the onset of this condition, this study aimed to explore the correlation between antenatal depression and Corona disease anxiety, personality traits, and postpartum depression during the COVID-19 pandemic.                                                           Materials and Methods:                     This cross-sectional descriptive-analytical study investigated women receiving care at health centers affiliated with Kerman University of Medical Sciences during the last month of their pregnancy and the postpartum period in 2022. Following the acquisition of informed consent, participants were assessed using various measures, including demographic and obstetric information, the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale, the Corona Disease Anxiety Scale (CDAS), and the NEO Personality Inventory-Revised during their third trimester of pregnancy. The same group of participants completed the Edinburgh Depression Scale and the Corona Disease Anxiety Scale (CDAS) 4-6 weeks after childbirth.                                                           Results and Discussion:                     There was a significant correlation between family income, unwanted pregnancy as perceived by both the mother and father, and antenatal depression. Additionally, marital satisfaction played a significant role in postpartum depression. Furthermore, antenatal depression was significantly associated with neuroticism, agreeableness, and physical symptoms related to Corona disease anxiety. Personality traits, with the exception of extroversion and conscientiousness, and various domains of Corona disease anxiety, excluding psychological symptoms, were also significantly associated with postpartum depression.                                                           Conclusion:                     During pandemics or epidemics, such as the COVID-19 outbreak, experiencing mental distress during pregnancy can contribute to mental health issues during the postpartum period. This risk is particularly true in individuals with unique personality traits, emphasizing the need for increased focus on mental health within prenatal care during these crises."

Method:                     This cross-sectional study was conducted in Kerman, Iran. Data were collected from patients who visited Afzalipour Hospital in Kerman more than twice during the COVID-19 epidemic from the end of February 2020 to March 21, 2021. We conducted two key analyses: 1. Mixed effect logistic regression was used to check the relationship between the variables and COVID-19 severity. 2. Mixed effect linear regression was used to check the relationship between the variables and the length of stay in the hospital.                                                           Results:                     The findings indicated that the most important risk factors for the severity of COVID-19 were heart diseases (OR=1.67,95%CI:1.20-2.30), increasing age (OR=2.23 for age&gt;54, 95%CI:1.70- 2.90), male gender (OR=1.47,95%CI:1.10-1.96), respiratory diseases other than asthma, and frequency of admission (OR=1.60,95%CI:1.20-2.15). All patients who underwent readmission experienced a shorter duration of hospitalization during their subsequent admission (OR=0.94,95%CI:0.91,0.96) and had a higher mortality rate (30% within 14 days, 26.6% between 14-90 days). Patients readmitted at intervals of 14-90 days and greater than 90 days exhibited lower disease severity compared to those readmitted within the 0-14 day period.                                                           Conclusion:                     Examining readmissions, the severity of COVID-19, and the length of hospital stay in affected patients are important factors for planning and allocating resources for COVID-19 management and treatment. These factors can help policymakers develop effective clinical guidelines for hospitalization or outpatient treatment of COVID-19 patients and contribute to reducing the burden of disease in the community."

Kinovea, as an accessible motion-analysis software, provides both visual and quantitative feedback. However, its application in supporting technique development among beginner athletes remains insufficiently explored. Aim: This study aims to describe the use of Kinovea in biomechanics training and examine its contribution to the awareness of kinematic characteristics and movement techniques among beginner athletes. Methods: A descriptive qualitative design involved 72 beginner athletes aged 18–25 years selected through purposive sampling. Data were collected over 16 weeks through interviews, field observations, and motion video recordings analyzed using Kinovea. Kinematic data focused on joint angles, stride behavior, and movement phases during walking, running, and the flight phase. Qualitative data were analyzed using content analysis with NVivo 12, while kinematic results were interpreted descriptively to identify performance patterns and areas for technical refinement. Result: Kinematic analysis showed coordinated joint-angle patterns across all phases. Walking analysis identified arm swing angles of 50.9°–58.8° and leg separation angles of 64.3°–67.2°, indicating a stable gait rhythm. The running analysis revealed knee angles of 68.8°–69.8° and elbow angles of 87.6°–89.1°, indicating efficient propulsive mechanics. The flight phase demonstrated knee angles of 81.2°–87.8° and elbow angles of 80.4°–88.3°, suggesting effective momentum use and postural stability. These measurements supported stride-efficiency assessment and technique evaluation. Qualitative findings revealed that Kinovea enabled athletes to interpret movement phases and identify technical inefficiencies through slow-motion and frame-by-frame visualization. Conclusion: Kinovea supports basic motion analysis by providing clear kinematic information and helping beginner athletes observe and refine their movement techniques. The findings also offer practical value for coaches by enabling more precise identification of inefficient patterns and guiding targeted corrections during early-stage training."

Optimal management requires integrated risk stratification, multimodality imaging, tailored revascularization timing, and post-procedural care. This review synthesizes evidence on preoperative assessment (invasive angiography vs CT-angiography), decision-making for percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), staged vs concomitant approaches, and long-term antithrombotic and surveillance strategies to optimize outcomes. Introduction Severe aortic stenosis (AS) and CAD frequently coexist due to shared risk factors and pathophysiology. While TAVI has transformed AS treatment, untreated significant CAD may impair periprocedural hemodynamics and long-term prognosis. Preoperative Evaluation Coronary computed tomography angiography (CCTA) is increasingly preferred for its high negative predictive value and ability to assess anatomy for TAVI planning. Invasive coronary angiography remains the gold standard when revascularization is anticipated. Functional assessment (fractional flow reserve [FFR] or instantaneous wave-free ratio [iFR]) is recommended for intermediate lesions (50–70%) to guide intervention. Revascularization Strategies Staged PCI (prior to TAVI) is favored in most guidelines for complex or high-risk anatomy, minimizing contrast load and procedural time during valve deployment. Concomitant PCI during the same session may be considered in straightforward single-vessel disease or unstable presentations, though it carries higher acute kidney injury risk. Post-TAVI PCI is emerging as a viable option in select cases with favorable valve positioning. Multidisciplinary Heart Team Integration The Heart Team should weigh SYNTAX score, frailty, bleeding risk, and life expectancy. Hybrid approaches (e.g., PCI of proximal lesions pre-TAVI, distal optimization post-TAVI) are gaining traction. Antithrombotic Management and Follow-up Post-PCI/TAVI regimens typically involve dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) for 1–6 months, transitioning to single antiplatelet therapy (SAPT) or anticoagulation if indicated. Long-term surveillance includes echocardiography, stress testing, and symptom monitoring. Conclusion A structured, multidisciplinary strategy incorporating advanced imaging, physiology-guided PCI, and individualized timing improves safety and durability in TAVI recipients with coexistent CAD."

METHODS: We analyzed 2 multicenter registries that consecutively enrolled patients with severe aortic stenosis before and after the introduction of transcatheter AVR in Japan (CURRENT AS [CURRENT AS, Contemporary Outcomes After Surgery and Medical Treatment in Patients With Severe Aortic Stenosis] Registry-1: 2003–2011; Registry-2: 2018–2020). Data were derived from hospital electronic health records. The primary outcome was 1-year all-cause mortality. Secondary outcomes included hospitalization for heart failure, cardiovascular death, and noncardiovascular death. we Multivariable Cox proportional hazards models were adjusted for age, sex, body mass index, hypertension, current smoking, diabetes on insulin therapy, prior myocardial infarction, prior symptomatic stroke, atrial fibrillation or flutter, aortic or peripheral vascular disease, creatinine level, hemodialysis, anemia, liver cirrhosis (child B or C), malignancy currently under treatment, chronic lung disease (moderate or severe), coronary artery disease, peak aortic jet velocity, any combined moderate or severe valvular disease, and tricuspid regurgitation pressure gradient. RESULTS: A total of 6645 patients (Registry-1: 3448 patients, and Registry-2: 3197 patients) were included. Patients in Registry-2 were older than those in Registry-1 (81.7 versus 77.8 years), and an initial AVR strategy was more frequently selected (49.9% versus 31.3%). The cumulative 1-year incidence and adjusted risk of 1-year all-cause mortality were lower in Registry-2 than in Registry-1 (10.2% versus 16.0%, P &lt;0.001, hazard ratio, 0.55 [95% CI, 0.47–0.63]). In contrast, the incidence and adjusted risk of hospitalization for heart failure did not differ between Registry-2 and Registry-1 (8.5% versus 9.0%, P =0.66, hazard ratio, 0.88 [95% CI, 0.75–1.04]). CONCLUSIONS: The overall 1-year mortality outcome of patients with severe aortic stenosis improved in the posttranscatheter AVR era compared with the pretranscatheter AVR era, with no noticeable improvement in hospitalization for heart failure."

OpenAlex,aortic stenosis,Preoperative transcutaneous vagus nerve stimulation as a novel strategy to prevent postoperative atrial fibrillation in calcific aortic valve disease: mechanistic insights and translational perspectives,Justine Bergeon; Fanette Chassagne; Marie Fanget; Angèle N. Merlet; Stéphane Avril; Léonard Féasson; F. Hoffmann-La Roche; M. Bäck; David Hupin,10.3389/fcvm.2025.1625436,2026-01-23,Frontiers in Cardiovascular Medicine,"Postoperative atrial fibrillation (POAF) affects 38%–63% of patients undergoing surgical replacement for calcific aortic valve stenosis (CAVS), increasing morbidity, stroke risk, and hospital stay. POAF results from an interplay between pre-existing arrhythmogenic substrates, acute surgical triggers, unresolved inflammation, and autonomic nervous system (ANS) imbalance. Specialized pro-resolving mediators (SPMs) orchestrate inflammation resolution and tissue homeostasis; their deficiency may sustain valvular inflammation and promote arrhythmogenesis. Transcutaneous vagus nerve stimulation (tVNS) is a non-invasive approach that enhances parasympathetic tone, restores sympathovagal balance, and modulates inflammatory pathways. While tVNS has been applied postoperatively, its preoperative, preventive use in POAF has not been explored, representing a novel therapeutic strategy. In patients with CAVS, preoperative tVNS could reduce POAF by regulating ANS activity and limiting perioperative inflammation. Mechanistic insights may be gained through perioperative sampling, analysis of excised valvular and atrial tissue, and biomechanical assessments comparing stimulated and control groups. Preoperative tVNS thus offers a promising strategy to prevent POAF while addressing valvular inflammation, bridging translational physiology with clinical cardiology and potentially opening new avenues for the management of CAVS."

Diagnostics revealed a non-ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI), acute heart failure, acute-on-chronic renal failure, LFLG AS (aortic valve area of 0.7 cm²), and a left ventricular ejection fraction of 10%. Coronary angiography showed severe coronary artery disease requiring revascularization. Due to excessive surgical risk, we planned a staged interventional treatment by Heart Team consensus. First, high-risk PCI with mechanical circulatory support was performed, followed by transfemoral TAVR using a self-expandable 29-mm bioprosthesis via a femoral Y-graft conduit. The patient reported immediate relief of symptoms. Follow-up echocardiography at discharge and at three months showed improvement of the aortic valve function and an increase of the ejection fraction to 35%. The patient remained asymptomatic and resumed his daily activities. Discussion This case demonstrates that Impella®-supported PCI prior to transfemoral TAVR is feasible and safe, even in the presence of a femoral Y-graft, in a patient with LFLG AS and severely reduced ejection fraction."

OpenAlex,aortic stenosis,Prognostic value of liver shear wave elastography after transcatheter aortic valve implantation in severe aortic stenosis,Yutaro Sato; Akihiko Sato; Kazuya Sakamoto; Yuuki Muto; Yu Sato; Tetsuro Yokokawa; Takeshi Shimizu; Tomofumi Misaka; Takashi Kaneshiro; Masayoshi Oikawa; Atsushi Kobayashi; Akiomi Yoshihisa; Yasuchika Takeishi,10.1016/j.ijcha.2025.101864,2026-01-22,IJC Heart & Vasculature,"Background: Shear wave elastography (SWE) is a noninvasive ultrasound technique that quantifies liver stiffness. Previous studies have suggested that liver SWE can serve as an indirect marker of hepatic congestion. However, it remains unclear whether liver SWE measured after transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) is associated with clinical outcomes. Methods: A total of 127 consecutive patients with severe aortic stenosis who underwent TAVI and had liver SWE measured using abdominal ultrasonography at discharge were enrolled. Liver SWE was obtained from the right hepatic lobe via an intercostal approach. Patients were stratified by the median liver SWE value (1.36 m/s): low-SWE group (< 1.36 m/s; n = 59) and high-SWE group (≥ 1.36 m/s; n = 68). The primary endpoint was a composite of all-cause death and heart failure (HF) rehospitalization. Results: All 127 patients were followed for 24 months, during which 21 (16.5 %) experienced the primary endpoint. Kaplan–Meier analysis showed a higher cumulative incidence of the primary endpoint in the high-SWE group than in the low-SWE group (log-rank P = 0.019). In Cox proportional hazards models adjusted using inverse probability of treatment weighting, high liver SWE was independently associated with an increased risk of the primary endpoint (hazard ratio 3.66; 95 % confidence interval 1.30–10.32; P = 0.014). Conclusion: High liver SWE after TAVI was independently associated with an increased 24-month risk of all-cause death and HF rehospitalization."
OpenAlex,aortic stenosis,Planimetry of Aortic Valve Area Using CTA: Cutoff Derivation for Stenotic Bicuspid and Tricuspid Valves,Silvia Voegele; Jan Minners; Nikolaus G Jander; Sebastian Grundmann; Philipp Ruile; Klaus Kaier; Christopher L. Schlett; Martin Soschynski; Christian Weber; Timo Heidt; Constantin von zur Mühlen; D Westermann; Manuel Hein,10.1161/circimaging.125.018677,2026-01-22,Circulation Cardiovascular Imaging,"BACKGROUND: Computed tomography based planimetric assessment of the anatomic aortic valve area (aAVA CTA ) in aortic stenosis is routinely performed. Unlike transthoracic echocardiography-based effective AVA by transthoracic echocardiography, it lacks clearly defined severity cutoff values, limiting clinical utility. METHODS: In this retrospective single-center analysis with computed tomography angiography data from 2013 to 2025, cutoffs were determined from 1294 transthoracic echocardiography-based conclusive severe or nonsevere patients by congruence of maximum velocity, mean pressure gradient, and effective AVA by transthoracic echocardiography. In separate receiver operator curves analyses for tricuspid and bicuspid valves, the severe stenosis likely cutoff was defined by Youden index and the unlikely cutoff by a negative likelihood ratio &lt;0.1. Cutoffs were internally validated in 480 patients, compared with the Agatston score by net reclassification index, and tested in 190 separate normal flow-low gradient-aortic stenosis cases. RESULTS: Correlation between aAVA CTA and effective AVA by transthoracic echocardiography was moderate and strong in tricuspid and bicuspid valves, respectively (Pearson r 0.67 and 0.78; P &lt;0.001). Severe stenosis was likely in tricuspid valves at aAVA CTA ≤0.95 cm² (sensitivity 87%, specificity 78.9%) and unlikely at ≥1.10 cm² (negative likelihood ratio, 0.092). In bicuspid valves severe stenosis was likely at aAVA CTA ≤1.08 cm² (sensitivity 88.3%, specificity 77.3%) and unlikely at ≥1.20cm 2 (negative likelihood ratio, 0.091). Validation showed comparable results. Net reclassification index compared with the Agatston score was 0.16 for likely and 0.17 for unlikely cutoffs ( P &lt;0.001). Cutoffs were applied to 190 suspected severe low-gradient cases. Adding aAVA CTA as an additional severity marker led to reclassification to nonsevere in 5.8% of cases. CONCLUSIONS: Direct planimetry of AVA is feasible and shows utility in low gradient-aortic stenosis. However, as the hemodynamic effect is impacted by valve shape, cutoff values should differentiate between tricuspid and bicuspid valves."
OpenAlex,aortic stenosis,Non-invasive pressure-volume analysis: a novel method for evaluating ventricular function in patients with aortic stenosis,Darijan Ribic; Espen W. Remme; Otto A. Smiseth; Richard Massey; Christian Eek; Joakim Alfredsson; L. Gullestad; Kaspar Broch; Kristoffer Russell,10.3389/fcvm.2025.1740710,2026-01-22,Frontiers in Cardiovascular Medicine,"Background and aims Conventional echocardiographic measurements like ejection fraction (EF) and global longitudinal strain (GLS) evaluate left ventricular (LV) function without considering concurrent loading conditions. A more comprehensive characterization of cardiac function and energetics can be achieved through pressure-volume analysis, but its clinical application is limited by the requirement for invasive measurements. We aimed to develop a clinically accessible, non-invasive method for pressure-volume loop analysis. Methods We obtained simultaneous 3-dimensional echocardiograms and invasive LV pressures with micromanometer-tipped catheters during transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) for severe aortic stenosis. Volume-time traces from the echocardiograms were combined with invasive LV pressures and non-invasive pressure estimates to construct pressure-volume loops. We used echocardiograms before and after TAVR to evaluate changes in myocardial function via non-invasive pressure-volume studies. Results In same-beat comparisons, stroke work calculated using non-invasive LV pressure estimations correlated well with stroke work calculated using invasive LV pressures ( r = 0.95, ICC = 0.95, p &amp;lt; 0.0001, y = 0.90X + 1,836, mean bias −549 mmHg*mL, standard deviation 774 mmHg*mL; 95% limits of agreement: −2,006 to +967 mmHg*mL). After TAVR, stroke work fell substantially, ventricular efficiency increased, ventriculo-arterial coupling improved, and both total and resting energy consumption decreased. On the other hand, LV biplane EF and GLS remained unchanged. Conclusions This study confirms the validity and clinical accessibility of non-invasive pressure-volume loop analysis in patients with aortic stenosis. The method identified and characterized changes in myocardial energetics, function, and ventriculo-arterial interaction, that are not typically detected by conventional echocardiography. These findings highlight the potential of non-invasive pressure-volume analysis in clinical and research practice."
OpenAlex,aortic stenosis,Outcomes of aortic valvuloplasty with pericardium patch for congenital aortic stenosis and regurgitation in pediatric patients,Pinyan Huang; Junjie Zong; Weicong Ye; Song Wang; Ran Li; Han Zhang; Zilong Luo; Jiahong Xia; Jizhang Yu; Jian Wu; Cheng Zhou,10.3389/fcvm.2025.1724329,2026-01-21,Frontiers in Cardiovascular Medicine,"Background Surgical strategies for congenital aortic stenosis and regurgitation in children, particularly in infants (&amp;lt;1 year), remain controversial. Aortic valvuloplasty (AVP) with pericardial patch has gained increasing attention, but its durability and clinical benefits remain uncertain. Methods We retrospectively analyzed pediatric patients (≤12 years) undergoing AVP with pericardial patch in our center between July 2017 and July 2025. Infants (&amp;lt;1 year) were analyzed separately as subgroups. Primary outcome was the change in aortic valve hemodynamics, including median peak gradient, median peak velocity, and degree of aortic regurgitation. Secondary outcomes included major complications, overall survival, and freedom from reoperation. Results A total of 35 patients were included, with a median age of 2 years. Among them, 17 were infants, with a median age of 2 months. The median peak aortic valve gradient decreased from 67.0 mmHg to 33.0 mmHg ( p &amp;lt; 0.001), and the median peak velocity decreased from 4.1 m/s to 2.9 m/s ( p &amp;lt; 0.001), postoperatively. No new moderate or severe aortic regurgitation was observed early postoperatively, and preexisting lesions of this severity were resolved. There were no in-hospital deaths or severe complications. At four years, survival was 96% and freedom from reoperation 75.4% in the overall cohort; in infants, survival was 100% with 66.7% freedom from reoperation. Conclusions AVP with pericardium patch is a safe and effective procedure for congenital aortic stenosis and regurgitation in pediatric patients. It represents a promising surgical option for pediatric patients, including infants."

Transcatheter aortic valve replacement has become a revolutionary treatment practice, utilizing various access options, including transfemoral, transaortic, transapical, and other alternatives. The choice of access significantly impacts the safety and outcomes of the procedure. Objective: The study was aimed to analyze the immediate and long- term outcomes on adoption of transapical and transaortic accesses in aortic valve replacement using the domestic MedLab-KT prosthesis. Methods: From June 2018 to September 2025, 66 transcatheter aortic valve replacement surgeries were performed via transapical and transaortic approaches using the “MedLab-KT” prosthesis, including 4 repeat procedures for dysfunction of the biological aortic valve prosthesis by the valve-in-valve technique. A retrospective analysis of the results was conducted, assessing preoperative, intraoperative, and early and late postoperative data. Criteria for technical success, device success, and early safety were assessed. Patients were divided into groups according to time intervals, namely 2018–2021 and 2022–2025, to evaluate the impact of accumulated experience on immediate and long-term surgical outcomes. Results: Intraoperative mortality was recorded in a single case (1.6 %). The rate of 30-day mortality was 9 % (6 patients). The aortic valve implantation procedure was technically successful in 62 cases (93.9 %). Device success was recorded in 56 patients (84.9 %). The early safety rate was 83.3 %. The average follow-up period was 3.5 years. With the accumulation of experience, the early safety rate increased by 15 % but no significant difference was revealed. The rate of 5-year freedom from reoperations was 100 %; 5-year survival rate was 87.9 %. Moreover, 5-year freedom from valve dysfunction was 97.5 % (95 % CI 0.92; 1). Conclusion: The results of this study demonstrate the efficacy and safety of the transapical and transaortic approaches in transcatheter aortic valve replacement using the domestic prosthesis “MedLab-KT”, which demonstrates satisfactory hemodynamic characteristics for the mid-late postoperative period. Analysis of the immediate and long- term results allows us to recommend the transaortic and transapical approaches as alternatives when the transfemoral approach is not possible."
