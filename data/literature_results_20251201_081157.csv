A retrospective review of endovascular aortic arch repairs using custom made endografts integrating exclusively retrograde inner branches (Cook Medical, Brisbane, Australia) was conducted across seven tertiary centres (June 2022 and December 2024). Primary endpoints included technical success and peri-operative morbidity and mortality. All consecutive patients were included. Results are presented as numbers or median (interquartile range [IQR]).
Twenty one patients (nine women; median age, 72 years; IQR 66, 77 years; 13 with chronic dissection) were treated using 19 endografts with three branches and two endografts with two branches, totalling 61 retrograde inner branches. All target vessels were successfully bridged, mostly from femoral access (n = 18) but three from axillary (n = 2) or carotid (n = 1) accesses. Technical success was achieved in 18 patients; one patient experienced irreversible cardiac arrest, and two others had small residual type Ia endoleaks. Two patients required an iliac endoconduit for vessel rupture. These two patients were the only ones who developed post-operative ischaemic stroke. One of them recovered fully in hospital, whereas the other patient died due to extensive renovisceral embolisation. No other peri-operative deaths were observed (two of 21 patients). Three patients presented with evidence of aortic graft stenosis in the arch that was corrected either during surgery or during the early follow up. The latter, after new onset congestive heart failure, was reversed by correction of the aortic graft stenosis. During a median follow up of 10 months (IQR 4, 13 months), one patient required false lumen embolisation due to type Ic endoleak, and two patients died due to distal aneurysm rupture and respiratory failure.
Endovascular aortic arch repair with exclusively retrograde inner branches is feasible with acceptable technical success and no branch related re-intervention. Aortic graft stenosis at the arch is a concern with this design that requires further investigation. This design can potentially overcome the need for large bore upper extremity or carotid access, but larger series with longer follow up are needed to demonstrate safety, efficacy, and durability."

However, it is unclear how MR severity affects prognosis. This meta-analysis evaluated the associations among baseline MR severity, cardiovascular outcomes, and mortality after TAVR. Eligible studies included adult patients undergoing TAVR with stratified MR severity (MR ≥ 2 or MR ≥ 3) and reported the post-TAVR clinical outcomes. Sensitivity analyses stratified by follow-up duration, leave-one-out sensitivity, and meta-regression were also conducted. Forty-two studies (n = 67,257 patients) were included. MR ≥ 2 was associated with increased all-cause mortality during follow-up (> 30 days) (hazard ratio [HR]: 1.40; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.26, 1.55) and cardiovascular mortality (risk ratio [RR]: 1.80; 95% CI: 1.05, 3.08), but not with stroke, transient ischemic attack, myocardial infarction (MI), or heart failure hospitalization. MR ≥ 3 conferred an even higher risk of all-cause mortality during follow-up (RR: 1.55; 95% CI: 1.24, 1.94) and rehospitalization (RR: 1.40; 95% CI: 1.17, 1.67), but not for stroke and MI. MR improvement occurred in 41% of patients within < 1-year post-TAVR, declined to 15% at > 1-year post-TAVR. Baseline moderate-to-severe MR (MR ≥ 2) predicts all-cause mortality during follow-up and cardiovascular mortality after TAVR, particularly severe MR (MR ≥ 3). While no consistent associations were found with nonfatal outcomes such as stroke, TIA, MI, or heart failure hospitalization, the prognostic impact of MR appears to be predominantly mortality-centered."

Both conditions are strongly age-dependent, and their association is increasingly recognized as more than coincidental. Transthyretin deposits have been identified within stenotic aortic valves, supporting the hypothesis that mechanical stress and shear forces may promote protein misfolding and amyloid deposition. The reported prevalence of ATTR-CM among patients with severe AS ranges from 4 % to 29 %, particularly in those undergoing transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR). Diagnosis remains challenging and a multimodality imaging strategy integrating ECG-echocardiographic discordance, cardiac magnetic resonance with extracellular volume (ECV) quantification, and bone scintigraphy is essential to achieve final confirmation of disease. Newer tools such as the RAISE and GRAM scores and CT-derived myocardial extracellular volume (ECV) quantification enhance screening accuracy in this population. Clinically, even moderate AS may worsen restrictive hemodynamics in ATTR-CM, emphasizing the need for early recognition and individualized management. Contemporary studies suggest that carefully selected patients with dual pathology benefit from TAVR, achieving outcomes comparable to those with isolated AS, especially when patients are initiated on disease-modifying therapies. Future research should clarify the mechanistic link between valve and myocardial amyloid deposition, refine risk stratification, and integrate artificial intelligence to improve early detection and guide combined interventional and pharmacologic strategies."

The prognostic implications of post-TAVR FR remain unclear, particularly in non-Western populations. We investigated the prognostic relevance of FR after TAVR in a Japanese population.
We retrospectively analyzed 499 consecutive patients with severe aortic stenosis (AS) who underwent TAVR between 2014 and 2022. Patients were classified into three groups based on pre- and post-TAVR FR measured with transthoracic echocardiography: Normal FR (pre-FR ≥ 200 mL/s, N = 253), Recovered FR (pre-FR < 200 and post-FR ≥ 200, N = 112), and Persistently low FR (pre-FR < 200 and post-FR < 200, N = 134) group. All cause death- and heart failure (HF) readmission-free survival rate after TAVR were compared among the groups.
The mean age and BSA of participants were 84.1 ± 5.0 years and 1.45 ± 0.17 m2, and 64% were female. Thirty-eight all-cause deaths and 35 HF readmissions occurred within 2 years after TAVR. Patients in the Persistently low FR group had significantly more HF readmission than those in the Normal FR or Recovered FR groups (Log rank P < 0.001), whereas the all-cause death-free survival rate was similar among the three groups. Cox-Hazard multivariate analysis demonstrated that atrial fibrillation, chronic kidney disease, anemia, and persistently low FR were independent predictors of future HF readmission after TAVR (hazard ratio of persistently low FR = 2.38, P = 0.047).
AS patients with persistently low FR even after TAVR had a higher rate of HF hospital-readmissions in a Japanese cohort."

Lp(a) is composed of apoB-100 and apo(a). Lifestyle changes and statin therapy lower LDL-cholesterol and apoB, but do not reduce Lp(a), whereas PCSK9 inhibitors exert a modest effect. There are currently no approved Lp(a)-lowering drugs, although several are at various phases of clinical development.
We discuss the role of Lp(a) as a therapeutic target, describe the development, pharmacodynamics, pharmacokinetics, and metabolism of zerlasiran, a small interfering RNA (siRNA) targeting Lp(a), and report the findings of recent clinical trials.
The GalNAc-conjugated siRNA zerlasiran reduces Lp(a) by targeting hepatic apo(a) synthesis and subsequent assembly of Lp(a), with comparable efficacy to other Lp(a)-lowering therapies in phase II development. Its long half-life, infrequent dosing, and potentially lower cost, together with its favorable safety and tolerability profile, make zerlasiran a promising candidate. However, long-term studies are needed to assess its impact on major adverse cardiovascular events and safety in diverse patient populations, and across different clinical settings. The phase III cardiovascular outcome study is eagerly anticipated."

Severe aortic stenosis (AS) patients are at risk for heart failure and frequently on LDT. We assessed cardiac structure and function, organ congestion, filling pressures, and long-term outcomes of severe AS patients on LDT undergoing aortic valve replacement (AVR).
Consecutive patients with severe AS with [n = 157; median (interquartile range) daily torasemide dose: 10 (5-15) mg] or without (n = 346) LDT undergoing a detailed assessment of congestion (B-type natriuretic peptide, liver enzymes, systematic chest X-ray analysis) and cardiac catheterization before AVR with a post-AVR follow-up of several years were studied.
Despite similar AS severity (indexed aortic valve area 0.41 ± 0.12 vs. 0.43 ± 0.12 cm2/m2) patients with LDT had more advanced biventricular remodeling and dysfunction, higher B-type natriuretic peptide [446 (245-991) vs. 150 (62-317) ng/L; p < 0.001], higher liver enzymes, higher chest x-ray congestion score [2 (1-4.5) vs. 1 (0-2) score points; p < 0.001], and higher mean right atrial pressure (8 ± 4 vs. 6 ± 3 mmHg) and mean pulmonary artery wedge pressure (21 ± 8 vs. 14 ± 6 mmHg; p < 0.001 for both) than those without. After a median post-AVR follow-up of 15 months functional capacity was worse, and estimated systolic pulmonary pressure was higher (37 ± 11 vs. 32 ± 8 mmHg; p < 0.001), and after a median follow-up of 44 months mortality was higher [hazard ratio 2.01 (95% confidence interval 1.17-3.77); p = 0.01] in LDT compared to non-LDT patients.
LDT identifies AS patients with more advanced cardiac remodeling, more severe congestion, unfavorable hemodynamics, impaired post-AVR status, and increased post-AVR long-term mortality."

However, there is no consensus on the optimal vasculoprotective cardioplegia. We aim to assess endothelial integrity using coronary sinus blood samples in patients who have received various types of cardioplegia.
Aortic valve replacement for aortic stenosis and isolated coronary artery bypass grafting patients were included. del Nido and blood cardioplegias were subjected to assessment. Blood samples from the coronary sinus were collected before and after aortic cross-clamping. Endothelial and redox biomarkers were assessed utilizing immunochemical and colorimetric techniques.
In coronary artery bypass grafting patients, E-selectin levels were found significantly lower after cross-clamping compared to pre-clamp values, regardless of cardioplegia type (p = 0.015). ROC analysis revealed that Endocan, E-selectin, and TNF-α levels are reliable biomarkers of endothelial injury after cardiopulmonary bypass (p values: 0.004, 0.007, and < 0.001 for each parameter, respectively). Total oxidant status emerged as a significant redox biomarker, with 87% ROC sensitivity (p = 0.037).
This study uniquely assesses localized endothelial responses via coronary sinus sampling with a multiplex biomarker panel, providing evidence of del Nido cardioplegia's protection. Our findings indicate that del Nido cardioplegia exhibits significant vasculoprotection, as evidenced by modulation of coronary sinus Endocan, E-selectin, and TNF-α. These biomarker changes, together with the absence of adverse differences in major postoperative outcomes, suggest that del Nido cardioplegia provides efficient myocardial and vascular protection in both aortic valve replacement and coronary artery bypass procedures, supporting its safe use in adult elective cardiac surgery."

A 58-year-old woman with history of Hodgkin lymphoma s/p mediastinal radiation therapy and recent coronary artery bypass grafting presented with recurrent congestive heart failure. Echocardiography revealed moderate-severe aortic insufficiency, severe mitral regurgitation/mild mitral stenosis, and severe tricuspid regurgitation. After receiving transcatheter aortic valve replacement requiring extracorporeal membrane oxygenation support, she remained balloon pump dependent. Given her mild mitral stenosis, transcatheter edge-to-edge repair was not feasible, and she was treated with transcatheter mitral valve replacement on an emergency use basis. She was ultimately discharged home.
Multivalvular disease in survivors of childhood cancer present anatomical challenges and transcatheter valve therapies will play an increasing role in these patients.
Survivors of childhood cancer can develop severe coronary artery and complex valvular disease. Some of these patients, particularly those with history of chest radiation, will have a hostile mediastinum with elevated surgical risk; transcatheter interventions could be an alternative therapy. For patients with mixed mitral valve disease, Transcatheter mitral valve replacement is feasible but is limited to research devices until one or more technologies are commercially available."

Severe AS is a life-threatening condition which affects 1.48% of individuals aged 55 and older, with a four-year mortality rate of 44.9% if left untreated. Minimally invasive treatment for AS involves the implantation of a bioprosthetic valve with porcine or bovine pericardium leaflets, which frequently succumb to failure due to regurgitation or stenosis caused in part by calcification and structural damage. The relationship between these two durability-limiting processes is debated, and the influence of device crimping on both factors is not comprehensively understood. This study aims to explore the relationship between calcification and structural damage and determine if device crimping affects these processes. First, porcine pericardium (PP) tissue was exposed to either in vitro calcification in unloaded conditions (calcification) or cyclic bulge loading in saline, without calcification (structural damage). Subsequently, PP was simultaneously calcified and cyclically loaded for 30 million cycles. Simultaneous calcification and loading led to dramatically increased calcification and structural damage, including tissue rupture. Device crimping was not found to have a significant impact on calcification or structural damage. However, fibre architecture was found to affect rupture location, and dramatically affect the rate of rupture of PP. This finding has implications for future bioprosthetic valve leaflet anti-calcification strategies, where tissue mechanics influenced by the underlying tissue fibre architecture should be considered to minimise both structural damage and calcification. STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCE: Porcine pericardium (PP) is a commonly used biomaterial, most frequently in the leaflets of bioprosthetic valves. These devices frequently succumb to failure due to regurgitation or stenosis caused in part by calcification and structural damage of their leaflets. This work shows that calcification and structural damage work together to accelerate failure of PP, with dramatically increased calcification and structural damage of PP, including rupture, when the tissue is exposed to both simultaneously. Fibre architecture of PP was found to affect rupture location, and dramatically affect rate of rupture. This finding has implications for bioprosthetic leaflet durability, where tissue mechanics influenced by the underlying tissue fibre architecture should be considered to minimise both structural damage and calcification and maximise valve durability."

This systematic review and meta-analysis evaluated ECG parameters to identify features distinguishing pediatric HCM from physiological adaptations in young athletes. Literature searches in PubMed, ScienceDirect, and Google Scholar yielded 25 eligible studies. Data were synthesized using a random-effects meta-analysis to account for clinical and methodological heterogeneity across studies. Odds ratios with 95% confidence intervals were generated using the Mantel-Haenszel method for two-arm studies and were pooled using Review Manager 5.4, while single-arm proportions of ECG abnormalities in pediatric HCM patients were pooled using a random-effects single-arm meta-analysis in OpenMeta[Analyst]. Heterogeneity was quantified using the I2 statistic, and sensitivity analyses were conducted by excluding studies with a high risk of bias. Significant differences were found in QTc prolongation, T-wave and ST segment abnormalities, and pathological Q waves, which were more prevalent in HCM. Supplementing with one-arm studies and comparing to normative athlete data highlighted additional differences in axis deviation, atrial enlargement, and bundle branch blocks. Conclusion: Based on current data available, ECG can help in distinguishing athlete's heart and HCM in the pediatric and adolescent population, particularly regarding QTc prolongation, T wave abnormalities, ST segment abnormalities, and pathological Q waves. ECG abnormalities detected during ECG should prompt further diagnostic evaluation for confirmation. What is known? • Differentiating athlete's heart from hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is difficult in children due to similar ECG patterns. • Current ECG criteria for athletes were developed for adults and may not fit pediatric patients well. What is new? • QTc prolongation, ST-T changes, and pathological Q waves are key ECG markers for differentiating pediatric HCM from athlete's heart. • Provides pediatric-specific ECG parameters to address the evidence gap in diagnosing youth athletes."

This study evaluated the late-term diastolic function of Ross patients compared to patients who underwent other types of index surgical repairs for congenital heart lesions. Patients who underwent catheterization for transcatheter pulmonary valve implantation (TPVi) at a single center between 2010 and 2022 were retrospectively reviewed. Patients who had undergone a Ross procedure were compared to those who had undergone Tetralogy of Fallot (TOF) repair and other index congenital heart operations. The primary outcome was left ventricular end diastolic pressure (LVEDP). Ross patients, TOF patients, and all others were compared in both univariate and multivariable analyses. Of 250 patients, 33 (13%) had prior Ross and 143 (57%) had prior TOF repair. Compared to other patients, Ross patients were larger at the time of catheterization (p < 0.01), more likely referred for pulmonary stenosis (vs. insufficiency or mixed) (p = 0.03), had fewer previous surgeries (p < 0.0001), and were older at their index cardiac surgery (p < 0.0001). Ross patients had significantly higher LVEDP than both TOF and other patients (p = 0.03). In multivariable analysis, higher LVEDP in Ross patients remained significant (p < 0.01) when controlling for age and RVEDP at the time of catheterization and reason for TPVi referral. Despite fewer prior surgical interventions and older age at time of index surgery, Ross patients have worse LV diastolic function compared to patients with other index congenital heart operations."

It affects 1 in 500 individuals, with an autosomal dominant inheritance pattern involving MYH7 and MYBPC3, the most commonly affected genes. Diagnosis relies on echocardiography, with cardiac magnetic resonance providing additional insights, including late gadolinium enhancement, aneurysms, and microvascular dysfunction linked to adverse outcomes. Risk stratification for sudden cardiac death includes the HCM Risk-SCD (adults) and HCM Risk-Kids (pediatrics) models, guiding implantable cardioverter defibrillator therapy. Management depends on phenotype: 1. Obstructive HCM: First-line therapy includes beta-blockers or non-dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers. Myosin inhibitors offer new options for symptom control. In refractory cases, surgical myectomy or alcohol septal ablation is recommended. 2. Non-Obstructive HCM: Treatment focuses on diastolic dysfunction and arrhythmia management, with emerging pharmacologic options under investigation. 3. Atrial fibrillation: Common in HCM, requiring anticoagulation, rate control, or ablation.

Although traditionally regarded as rare, contemporary evidence indicates a greater prevalence, particularly among elderly females. While multi-vessel involvement is considered classical, symptomatic single-vessel disease is increasingly recognized in the setting of inadequate collateral circulation. Diagnostic evaluation relies on a combination of imaging modalities including duplex ultrasonography, computed tomography angiography, magnetic resonance angiography and selective use of conventional angiography or functional studies in equivocal cases. Revascularization remains the cornerstone of definitive management. A paradigm shift toward endovascular-first strategies has occurred, driven by superior peri-operative safety, minimal invasiveness and shorter hospitalization. Endovascular therapy is indicated in most anatomically accessible lesions, especially ostial or short-segment stenoses of the celiac or superior mesenteric arteries. Covered stents are preferred in these settings due to enhanced patency. However, limitations include restenosis risk, technical failure in long-segment occlusions and contra-indications in extrinsic compression syndromes such as median arcuate ligament syndrome. Open surgical revascularization remains critical in patients with associated complex aortoiliac disease, long occlusions or failed endovascular attempts. Retrograde bypass from the iliac or infra-renal aorta is favored in high-risk patients for technical ease, while antegrade bypass from the supraceliac aorta may offer greater durability. Hybrid approaches such as retrograde open mesenteric stenting (ROMS), indicated in cases where aortic clamping is not feasible and in acute-on-chronic mesenteric ischemia with bowel gangrene, offer high technical success and favorable mid-term outcomes. Early diagnosis and tailored revascularization strategies remain central to improving long-term clinical outcomes in CMI. Continued refinement of endovascular techniques and hybrid interventions holds promise for optimizing outcomes in anatomically and physiologically diverse patient populations."

However, the durability of transcatheter heart valves (THV) and the risk of leaflet thrombosis preclude the extension of TAVI in young people. This study sought to formulate a proof-of-concept solution for non-invasive, continuous monitoring of THV function using photoplethysmography (PPG) sensors and machine learning models. An in vitro mock circulatory loop was developed using a compliant aortic phantom and an implanted self-expanding Evolut FX device. Two PPG sensors were attached to the phantom surface to record flow signals during various hemodynamic scenarios generated by Latin Hypercube Sampling. Endoscopic imaging measurements of the geometric orifice area (GOA) were used to assess valve performance. PPG-derived metrics and flow variables were used to train regression and classification models that predicted healthy versus decreased leaflet motion. The regression model showed an R2 of 0.83, RMSE of 7.18 mm2, and MAE of 5.58 mm2. The classifier correctly identified reduced leaflet motion (95% accuracy, 0.89 precision, and 0.91 recall). This study demonstrates the efficacy of PPG sensors and machine learning for non-invasive THV monitoring. The approach offers a promising tool for early detection of leaflet dysfunction, thereby improving the management of TAVI patients."

This retrospective single-center observational study included 509 consecutive patients undergoing transfemoral TAVI between January 2021 and December 2024. Primary end-point was device success according to VARC-3 criteria. Secondary end-points included technical success, early safety at 30 days, procedural time, fluoroscopy time, contrast volume, paravalvular regurgitation (PVR) and permanent pacemaker implantation (PPI). Multivariable logistic and linear regression models were used to assess the association between aortic angulation (in degrees) and clinical outcomes. ROC and spline regression analyses were used to evaluate potential threshold effects.
Device success at discharge was achieved in 89.4% (455/509) of patients, technical success in 96.3% (490/509), and early safety at 30 days in 75.6% (385/509). Aortic angulation did not significantly influence device success (aOR: 0.974, 95% CI: 0.938-1.012, p = 0.175), technical success (aOR 1.034; 95% CI 0.980-1.091; P = 0.22), or early safety (aOR: 0.994, 95% CI: 0.968-1.020, p = 0.633). Similarly, no association was observed between aortic angulation and PPI (aOR 1.016; 95% CI 0.984-1.050; P = 0.34) and PVR. However, aortic angulation significantly correlated with increased fluoroscopy times (coefficient: 0.073, SE: 0.026; P = 0.006) and greater contrast usage (coefficient: 0.406, SE: 0.194; P = 0.037).
While higher aortic angulation increased procedural imaging demand, it did not adversely affect device performance or clinical safety outcomes after TAVI. Importantly, outcomes remained consistent across prosthesis types."

We propose a hyperspectral imaging (HSI)-based diagnostic framework using a lightweight Spectral-MLP network for label-free tumor classification. Seventy-nine liver specimens were analyzed after spectral calibration, noise-band removal, and normalization within 450-900 nm. Spectral analysis revealed distinct differences in hemoglobin-related bands (540-580 nm) and lipid/water absorption regions (760-850 nm), corresponding to vascular and stromal variations between ICC and HCC. The proposed Spectral-MLP achieved 93.6% accuracy, 93.1% sensitivity, 94.0% specificity, and an AUC of 0.965, comparable to deeper models but with higher efficiency. These findings demonstrate that hyperspectral data combined with a simple neural network can effectively distinguish ICC from HCC and suggest that the lightweight Spectral-MLP framework has the potential to provide interpretable, real-time, and clinically deployable decision support for optical pathological diagnosis."

In Phase 1, the performance of the AI model was evaluated on 3016 MSK pediatric radiographs from 4 imaging centers in the US. Ground truth was established by consensus of pediatric radiologists. Phase 2 was a retrospective multi-reader, multi-center (MRMC) study using 189 cases. Twenty readers participated in two separate reading sessions evaluating for fracture, with and without AI assistance, with a one-month washout period.
The AI model achieved a high standalone performance with accuracy (0.94), sensitivity (0.96), and specificity (0.86). Subgroup analysis revealed that the model maintained high performance across study types and confounders, including age (Se>0.94), gender (Se>0.96), anatomical region (Se>0.93), and fracture types (Se>0.93). With AI assistance, reader accuracy increased significantly from 0.93 to 0.96 (p < 0.05), sensitivity significantly improved from 0.86 to 0.93 (p < 0.05), and specificity improved from 0.94 to 0.95. The average reading time per exam was shortened by 26.1% with AI assistance.
The AI model's high accuracy in detecting pediatric fractures underscores its significant clinical utility. The integration of this tool enhanced overall radiologist performance and boosted the diagnostic confidence among non-specialist readers."

Traditional methods relying on postmortem changes (e.g., livor mortis, rigor mortis) are subjective and limited, especially for late PMI. Recent advances in artificial intelligence (AI) and computational pathology, particularly whole-slide imaging (WSI), enable data-driven PMI estimation by analyzing digital pathology images with high precision and reproducibility. Building on previous successes in using AI to estimate PMI in uninfected conditions, this study extends the method to bacterially infected mouse cadavers (Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa) under varying temperatures (25 °C, 37 °C, and 4 °C). The results demonstrate the model's robustness in diverse scenarios, achieving micro- and macro-area under the curve values (AUCs) of at least 0.873 (patch-level) and 0.717 (WSI-level) in training and testing sets, and no less than 0.948 (patch-level) in external validation. By leveraging easily prepared pathological sections and AI algorithms, this approach offers a practical, objective, and scalable solution for PMI estimation, enhancing forensic workflows. The integration of computational pathology with forensic science establishes a new technical benchmark for PMI estimation in both infected and uninfected cases."

This study explores deep learning for automated fired bullet marking classification. To address inconsistent results from examiners' subjective same-source judgment, we automate classification to boost forensic firearm examination accuracy and reduce subjectivity. We collected a dataset of 6000 fired bullets from six types of standard-issue firearms commonly used by Chinese law enforcement agencies. Panoramic images of the lateral surfaces of the bullets were captured using the BalScan system. To create diverse and informative inputs for our deep learning model, we employed three distinct image preprocessing strategies: panoramic imaging, land engraved area (LEA) segmentation (the area with striations and grooves created by the gun barrel's rifling), and line segmentation. Then, we fine-tuned the advanced pre-trained ResNet50 network on this dataset, specifically designed for image classification tasks. Our experiments demonstrated the effectiveness of our approach, achieving high classification accuracy across different firearm types. Notably, the LEA segmentation strategy outperformed the other methods, highlighting the importance of focusing on specific regions of interest for accurate classification. To specify, our algorithm with the LEA segmentation strategy achieves a classification accuracy of 97.2% for six types of firearms with highly similar bullet rifling marks, while attaining 100.0% accuracy for firearms exhibiting significant differences in rifling characteristics, demonstrating a clear superiority over other algorithms. This study paves the way for further research and development in the field of forensic firearm examination through AI-driven solutions, aiming to improve the efficiency and accuracy of firearm identification and investigation processes."

PubMed,deep learning,Viral traits from deep mutational scanning and socio-demographic context predict SARS-CoV-2 lineage fitness across diverse countries.,Zhaojun Ding; Hsiang-Yu Yuan,10.1016/j.ijid.2025.108260,2025-11-28,International journal of infectious diseases : IJID : official publication of the International Society for Infectious Diseases,"To assess the joint effects of SARS-CoV-2 viral traits (ACE2 binding, immune escape, and cell entry) and socio-demographic context on viral lineage fitness across countries and to develop predictive models of lineage fitness using these factors.
5,092,686 SARS-CoV-2 spike protein sequences from nine representative countries, spanning the least developed, developing, and advanced economies, were collected. Viral traits for individual sequences were calculated using deep mutational scanning (DMS) data. Lineage-specific growth rates (i.e., viral fitness) were estimated with multinomial logistic regression (MLR). To examine the link between the Socio-demographic Index (SDI) and viral fitness changes, we first evaluated the effects of viral traits on lineage growth rates using a Gamma regression model. Then we assessed the linear relationship between SDI and these effects. Machine learning models combining viral traits and SDI were trained to predict viral fitness, with performance assessed by regression and classification metrics.
Immune escape exhibited the strongest association with viral fitness changes in the least developed countries (rate ratio (RR) = 1.90, 95% CI: 1.72-2.09), with this effect declining as economic development increased (developing countries: RR = 1.50, 95% CI: 1.42-1.58 and advance countries: RR=1.20, 95% CI: 1.14-1.26). After model comparison, XGBoost showed the best predictive performance using viral traits, when SDI was included (RMSE = 16.27, R² = 0.786, Accuracy = 0.923).
Viral traits and socio-economic context jointly shaped SARS-CoV-2 variant fitness. Immune escape was more influential for lineage growth in low-resource settings, emphasizing the need for equitable vaccine access and targeted interventions against the spread of immune-escape variants."

Their abnormal accumulation is closely linked to neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer's. Accurate prediction of amyloidogenic proteins is thus essential for understanding disease mechanisms and guiding therapeutic development. However, current methods for amyloid protein prediction still face several challenges, such as insufficient feature extraction and the reliance on relatively outdated traditional machine learning techniques. In this study, we present FA-Amy, a novel amyloid protein prediction model based on the ESM C protein language model and an attention fusion mechanism. To overcome the limitations of previous methods that relied on handcrafted features and insufficient utilization of sequence information, we employ the ESM C model to generate deep, comprehensive representations of protein sequences. Additionally, we design a fusion mechanism that integrates global and local attention, enhancing the model's ability to identify crucial regions associated with amyloid aggregation. Results from five-fold cross-validation confirm the complementarity and effectiveness of our multi- attention fusion strategy. FA-Amy demonstrates excellent stability and robustness, and is particularly effective in handling highly imbalanced classification tasks. Notably, the attention mechanism successfully focuses on sequence segments likely to contribute to β-sheet stacking. On an independent test set, FA-Amy consistently outperforms the current state-of-the-art model, achieving an 8.1 % improvement in Matthews Correlation Coefficient. To enhance accessibility, we have built a user-friendly online server for the model, which can be accessed at: http://www.bioai-lab.com/FA-Amy."

Of 20 questions and statements on PJI in orthopaedic oncology, none achieved unanimous consensus, 18 achieved strong consensus, one achieved moderate consensus, and one achieved weak consensus. The statements that reached consensus with notable agreement were on the prophylaxis of infection, management of leaking wounds, and surgical strategies for the treatment of PJI. Short-duration antibiotic prophylaxis was deemed as effective as longer courses for lower-risk reconstructions, and aggressive management was recommended for wounds draining beyond five to seven days to prevent deep infection. Furthermore, single-stage, two-stage, and 1.5-stage revision were recognized as valid strategies, with two-stage revision remaining the most reliable. The statements that did not achieve consensus were on the role of debridement, antibiotics, and implant retention and prolonged antibiotic use post-revision.
The BOOM meeting achieved consensus for important topics on periprosthetic infection in orthopaedic oncology, but highlighted the low quality of the underlying evidence. This study has provided recommendations for the treatment of leaky wounds, duration of postoperative antibiotic prophylaxis, and choice of revision strategy."
PubMed,deep learning,Ark+: Supervised training a single high-performance AI foundation model from many differently labeled datasets-no label consolidation required.,DongAo Ma; Jiaxuan Pang; Shivasakthi Senthil Velan; Michael B Gotway; Jianming Liang,10.1016/j.media.2025.103828,2025-10-29,Medical image analysis,"This article presents a methodological breakthrough in supervised learning for training a single, robust, and high-performance artificial intelligence (AI) model using a multitude of datasets labeled differently-yet requiring no manual label harmonization and imposing no restriction on application domains. Deep learning offers expert-level and sometimes even super-expert-level performance, but achieving such performance demands massive labeled data for training. For example, Google's proprietary CXR Foundation Model (CXR-FM) was trained on 821,544 labeled and mostly private chest radiographs (CXRs). Numerous datasets are publicly released in medical imaging. They are individually small and heterogeneous in expert labels, but collectively large. Therefore, we envision a powerful and robust AI foundation model trained in a supervised manner by aggregating numerous public, labeled datasets. Realizing this vision requires overcoming a long-standing barrier: label heterogeneity across the datasets to be used for the supervised training of a single outstanding model. To this end, we have developed Ark+, a framework that accrues and reuses knowledge from heterogeneous expert annotations associated with various datasets. To demonstrate the capability of Ark+, we pretrained a family of Ark+ models, including Ark+5 and Ark+6 on 335,484 and 704,363 CXRs, respectively, by merging multiple public datasets including MIMIC-CXR, CheXpert, ChestX-ray14, RSNA Pneumonia, VinDr-CXR, and Shenzhen-CXR. We evaluated the two Ark+ models on a wide range of imaging tasks covering classification, segmentation, and localization via fine-tuning, linear-probing, and sex-bias analysis, and demonstrated Ark+'s superior and robust performance over the state-of-the-art fully/self-supervised baselines and Google's proprietary CXR-FM. Ark+ has several distinctive and advantageous properties by design. To unveil its inner workings, we performed a series of ablation studies to show the contribution from each of its components and its superiority over alternative strategies. To demonstrate its capabilities of incorporating privacy-preserving data and addressing heterogeneous annotations across private clients in federated learning, we simulated Ark+ in various distributed training environments. To highlight its independence of architecture and scalability in image resolution, we developed two Ark+6 models with different architectures in different resolutions. To assess its neutrality in imaging modality and extensibility to different modalities, we pretrained a new Ark+ model on fundus photography. The enhanced performance of Ark+ is attributable to our simple yet powerful insight: aggregating various datasets diversifies patient populations and accrues knowledge from many experts, yielding unprecedented performance while simultaneously reducing annotation costs. Given the ubiquity of heterogeneous data and labels across disciplines including biology, chemistry, physics, medicine, and the social sciences, the concept underlying Ark+ is poised to have far-reaching implications beyond imaging. With all codes and pretrained models released at https://github.com/JLiangLab/Ark, we anticipate that Ark+ will exert an important impact on open science, as it demonstrates that accruing and reusing knowledge from expert annotations in even only public datasets can surpass the performance of proprietary models trained on unusually large data. We hope that Ark+ will inspire more researchers worldwide to share codes and datasets to build open, superior, and robust foundation models, accelerate open science, and democratize AI."

Although deep learning has shown great performance with fully supervised learning, it requires voxel-level dense annotations that are time-consuming and costly to obtain, especially for multiple organs. In this work, we propose a novel framework PL-Seg, for multi-organ segmentation in abdominal CT scans using partially labeled data, where only a subset of the target organ classes are annotated in each volume. First, we introduce a novel Hardness-Aware Decoupled Foreground Loss (HADFL), which focuses exclusively on annotated organs and dynamically adjusts class weights based on historical segmentation difficulty. Then, we employ a Classwise Orthogonal Contrastive Loss (COCL) to reduce inter-class ambiguity, which serves as a regularization for unlabeled regions. In addition, a Progressive Self-Distillation (PSD) that distills knowledge from deep high-resolution layers to shallower low-resolution levels is proposed to improve the feature learning ability under partial class annotations. Experiments conducted on a dataset with varying class-wise annotation ratios and a real clinical partially labeled dataset demonstrate that: 1) PL-Seg achieves significant performance improvements by leveraging unlabeled categories, 2) Compared with six state-of-the-art methods, PL-Seg achieves superior results with a simpler pipeline and greater computational efficiency, and 3) Under the same annotation cost, PL-Seg outperforms existing semi-supervised methods. Furthermore, we release a partially labeled medical image segmentation codebase and benchmark to boost research on this topic: https://github.com/HiLab-git/PLS4MIS."

Here, we present a streamlined multiplex MHs detection system based on pyrosequencing (PSQ), incorporating several key innovations: (1) selection of highly polymorphic short-fragment MHs from the 1000 Genomes Project (1KGP); (2) algorithmic optimization of nucleotide dispensation orders for accurate haplotyping; (3) utilization of peak-height simulation to augment the dataset, overcoming the limitation of scarce empirical data for machine learning; and (4) CLPSQ-Net, a deep contrastive learning framework for deconvoluting multiplex PSQ signals. In this feasibility study, the system demonstrated simultaneous genotyping of four MH loci (6-7 haplotypes per locus) and an input sensitivity of 100 pg of DNA in a preliminary evaluation. Simulated and experimental signals showed high concordance (cosine similarity >0.98 for uniplex, >0.99 for multiplex). CLPSQ-Net achieved 89.7 % classification accuracy and an F1-score of 88.4 % on experimental data, outperforming traditional regression methods (which exhibited accuracies below 38 % on the PSQ-8 dataset) by a substantial margin.

PubMed,deep learning,Long-term projections of global groundwater storage under future climate change scenarios using deep learning.,Sumriti Ranjan Patra; Hone-Jay Chu; Tatas,10.1016/j.scitotenv.2025.181043,2025-11-29,The Science of the total environment,"As climate change accelerates, understanding its impact on groundwater dynamics is essential for sustainable water management. This study employs a climate-induced AI model to project global variations in GRACE-derived groundwater storage (GWS) under future scenarios e.g. CMIP6 SSPs until 2100. The model demonstrates robust predictive performance, yielding NRMSE below 0.1 and IOA exceeding 0.9 across most regions worldwide. A feature sensitivity analysis revealed maximum temperature (Tmax) as the dominant driver: an increase in Tmax led to the largest absolute GWS changes, followed by precipitation and minimum temperature. Spatial map of projections at global scale under the high-emission SSP585 scenario indicate that tropical and temperate regions may face the most pronounced GWS declines, particularly when Tmax exceeds 3 °C. Arid zones are projected to experience moderately high losses in comparison, while colder regions may see slight gains. Temperature extremes are projected to increase evaporative and crop water demand, as well as domestic and irrigation dependence, thereby intensifying groundwater stress, particularly in densely populated and agriculture-dependent regions. By 2100, over half of the world's population is expected to inhabit regions facing a decline in GWS, while major aquifers are projected to experience GWS declines, with the Ogallala Aquifer potentially losing up to 40 % under severe warming conditions. These findings underscore the importance of integrating climate-induced groundwater changes into future water resource planning at a global scale."
PubMed,deep learning,Machine learning for modelling the health impacts of extreme heat: A comprehensive literature review.,Jérémie Boudreault; Félix Lamothe; Céline Campagna; Fateh Chebana,10.1016/j.envint.2025.109965,2025-11-25,Environment international,"Extreme heat ranks among the deadliest weather events globally. The number of heat-related deaths is expected to rise sharply as population ages and climate changes. In recent years, machine learning (ML) approaches have been increasingly used across a range of environmental and health fields, including heat-health studies. In this paper, we conducted a comprehensive literature review of the current ML applications for modelling the human health impacts of extreme heat. We searched for relevant scientific articles published in English in PubMed, Scopus and Web of Science databases from their inception to the search date of December 20, 2024. After screening titles, abstracts and full-texts, 25 papers were included in this review. We found that most of the studies were conducted in high-income countries such as Japan, Canada, South Korea or the United States. The studies primarily modelled a single health outcome, including all-cause mortality or heat-related illness, in the general population. The main predictors were maximum and mean air temperature, followed by relative humidity, and various temporal and socio-demographic variables. The most commonly used approach was Random Forest. Results were mixed regarding the optimal algorithm and the most important predictors. This review highlighted the strengths and limitations of current ML applications in heat-health studies. We propose recommendations to help guide the future development of these approaches to reduce the heat-related health burden globally. Future research should 1) study multiple health endpoints at the individual level in vulnerable populations, 2) leverage deep learning with spatiotemporal representations of environmental predictors, and 3) use data from multiple locations at a high spatial resolution to provide insights in data-scarce regions."
PubMed,deep learning,Towards the theory for mitigating gradient issues and dead neurons in deep learning through a modified Gaussian activation function.,Linu Pinto; Savitha K N; Tinu John; Judy M V,10.1016/j.neunet.2025.108353,2025-11-24,Neural networks : the official journal of the International Neural Network Society,"Activation functions are essential in deep learning optimization for introducing non-linearity, shaping gradient dynamics, and influencing weight initialization. This paper presents a modified Gaussian function called R-Gaussian, an activation function that dynamically adapts to pre-activation values, ensuring stable gradient propagation. Unlike trainable activation functions, R-Gaussian derives its modulation parameter C directly from the input distribution, enabling efficient convergence without additional computational overhead. Theoretical and experimental analyses demonstrate that R-Gaussian is characterized by a maximum slope of 1Ce-1/2 where C modulates the slope and controls the activation's adaptability. The study indicates that when C falls within the range [e-1/21.1,4e-1/2] R-Gaussian achieves an optimal balance, maintaining both gradient stability and learning efficiency. Specifically, for C ≈ 0.5515, R-Gaussian matches the slope of the Swish activation, while for C ≈ 2.43, it behaves like Sigmoid, effectively preventing both vanishing and exploding gradients. Analysis also shows, when C=e-1/2, the R-Gaussian activation function maintains a slope of 1. This property facilitates consistent and efficient gradient flow, even in deep neural network layers. The proposed R-Gaussian activation function exhibits strong robustness under both full-batch gradient descent and mini-batch stochastic gradient descent optimization. It ensures smooth and stable gradient propagation without causing instability or neuron inactivity, particularly in complex datasets such as CIFAR. Empirical results show that R-Gaussian outperforms conventional batch normalization techniques, achieving approximately 1.5 % improvement in accuracy on the CIFAR dataset with a convergence time of approximately 100 s over 89 epochs. Moreover, it effectively mitigates gradient overflow and vanishing gradient issues, especially at a learning rate of 0.1. Although performance on the Dry Bean dataset is not superior to that of the sigmoid function, R-Gaussian maintains sufficiently healthy gradient norms to support effective learning. In Vanilla Recurrent Neural Network experiments on the UCI HAR dataset, the proposed R-Gaussian activation achieved an accuracy of 54.24 % compared to tanh's 53.92 % with stable gradient norms in the range 0.19-1.06 versus tanh's 0.10-0.60. This suggests strong depth compatibility and leaves applicability for future performance improvements, as gradients remain consistently active and do not vanish."
PubMed,deep learning,Multi-view subspace tensorization with attentive clustering embedding.,Yanghang Zheng; Haonan Huang; Yihao Luo; Yuning Qiu; Andong Wang; Guoxu Zhou; Qibin Zhao,10.1016/j.neunet.2025.108344,2025-11-22,Neural networks : the official journal of the International Neural Network Society,"Deep learning-based multi-view clustering (DMVC) has garnered significant attention and achieved remarkable success, primarily due to its powerful nonlinear representation capabilities. However, most existing DMVC methods fall short in effectively modeling the inherent high-order correlations among different views. In contrast, traditional MVC techniques have long recognized the effectiveness of tensor-based approaches in capturing such complex interactions. To bridge this gap, we propose STANCE (multi-view Subspace Tensorization with Attentive Clustering Embedding), a novel DMVC framework that integrates tensor modeling into a deep learning paradigm. Specifically, STANCE first employs view-specific auto-encoders to project raw data into latent feature spaces, enabling robust subspace representations. These representations are then stacked to construct a third-order tensor, upon which a Tensor-based low-rank constraint is imposed to explicitly capture high-order inter-view dependencies. To further enhance consistency across views, STANCE incorporates an attention-based adaptive fusion module that dynamically assigns weights to view-specific representations at the sample level, thereby extracting consistent information from features that are both similar and confident. Comprehensive experiments, encompassing parameter analysis, ablation studies, and visual comparisons, are conducted to thoroughly evaluate the effectiveness of STANCE. The results demonstrate that STANCE significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods on various benchmark datasets."

This retrospective and prospective study encompassed 1,647 patients. Clinical, pathological information, and axillary ultrasound (AUS) findings, collected. Radiomic features of breast cancer lesions were extracted from the ultrasound images. We developed predictive models based on clinical factors alone (C model), clinical factors coupled with AUS (CA model), and clinical factors integrated with both AUS and radiomic features (CAR model). The predictive performance of each model was evaluated via the area under the curve (AUC), decision curve analysis (DCA), and calibration curve analysis.
The AUC values for the C model, CA model and CAR model in the test cohort were 0.812, 0.850, and 0.994, respectively. Notably, the CAR model exhibited significantly superior predictive capability compared to both the C model and CA model. In subgroups analyses, the CAR model also achieved the optimal predictive performance. The DCA curve confirmed that the CAR model possessed significant clinical implications.
The CAR model had the capability to predict NSLN metastases in early-stage breast cancer with 1-2 positive SLN metastases."
PubMed,deep learning,SMF-DETR: An Efficient Lightweight Detection Transformer for Real-Time Bearing Surface Defect Detection.,Min Gao; Xiaoping Kang; Kun Zhou; Teng Xie,10.1111/nyas.70156,2025-11-30,Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences,"Bearing surface defect detection is critical for industrial equipment reliability, but existing deep learning methods suffer from low accuracy for small targets, high computational complexity, and limited edge device deployment. This paper proposes an efficient defect detection algorithm based on the StarNet-MEIS-FDConv-detection transformer (SMF-DETR). The algorithm employs element-level multiplication operations in the backbone network to achieve high-dimensional feature mapping, effectively reducing computational complexity while improving feature extraction capability. The multiscale edge information selection mechanism processes features at different resolutions simultaneously to improve small defect detection. Frequency domain dynamic convolution adapts to different frequency components for optimal feature extraction while maintaining computational efficiency. Experiments on custom bearing defect datasets show that SMF-DETR achieves 96.2% mean average precision@50 (mAP@50) and 98.1% accuracy, improving baseline performance by 3.1% and 2.9%, respectively. The model also reduces computational cost by 57.7% and model size by 37.1%. Processing speeds reach 97.3 frames per second (FPS) on desktop systems and 58.1 FPS on embedded RK3588 platforms, meeting industrial real-time detection requirements. Finally, experimental validation was conducted on the publicly available bearing defect-detection dataset and the PASCAL visual object classes dataset, demonstrating the algorithm's versatility and generalization capabilities."

By leveraging the non-invasive nature of PAM, we could collect long-term, high-resolution audio data of animal vocalizations, which are essential for understanding social interactions. Applying deep learning algorithms to these data has significantly enhanced our ability to identify, classify, and extract subtle patterns within vocalizations, revealing social subgroups and communication networks that were once undetectable. Furthermore, this technological advancement enables the efficient processing of vast amounts of data and the integration of multi-layered information, such as movement and environmental data, to create a comprehensive view of animal social networks. The framework proposed in this review also facilitates the comparison of social networks across different species and ecological contexts, contributing to a deeper understanding of the principles governing social behavior. As technology continues to evolve, the potential of this framework to transform our capacity to study and protect animal societies is immense, offering a promising future for behavioral ecology and conservation biology."

While enhancer-promoter interactions have been extensively studied, EEIs remain comparatively underexplored. We developed ETNet (Enhancer-enhancer Interaction Explainable Transformer Network), a deep learning architecture integrating convolutional neural networks with Transformer modules to predict EEIs from DNA sequences. Evaluation across three cell lines (GM12878, K562, MCF-7) demonstrated superior performance compared to existing methods including EnContact, with statistical significance confirmed through DeLong tests across six cell lines. Rigorous validation through cross-validation and enhancer-level data partitioning confirmed robust generalization. ETNet exhibited effective cross-cell type transfer learning and showed transferability to enhancer-promoter interaction tasks, providing exploratory evidence for shared chromatin interaction principles. Feature attribution analysis recovered cell-type-specific regulatory motifs consistent with known transcription factors and revealed computational evidence for super-additive cooperative mechanisms, with cooperativity negatively correlating with sequence similarity-patterns representing hypothesis-generating observations requiring experimental validation. Proof-of-concept analysis demonstrated how single-nucleotide polymorphisms in JAK-STAT pathway genes may influence predicted interactions through motif alterations. ETNet advances computational approaches for studying enhancer interactions and provides a framework combining predictive capability with exploratory interpretability."

Kinovea, as an accessible motion-analysis software, provides both visual and quantitative feedback. However, its application in supporting technique development among beginner athletes remains insufficiently explored. Aim: This study aims to describe the use of Kinovea in biomechanics training and examine its contribution to the awareness of kinematic characteristics and movement techniques among beginner athletes. Methods: A descriptive qualitative design involved 72 beginner athletes aged 18–25 years selected through purposive sampling. Data were collected over 16 weeks through interviews, field observations, and motion video recordings analyzed using Kinovea. Kinematic data focused on joint angles, stride behavior, and movement phases during walking, running, and the flight phase. Qualitative data were analyzed using content analysis with NVivo 12, while kinematic results were interpreted descriptively to identify performance patterns and areas for technical refinement. Result: Kinematic analysis showed coordinated joint-angle patterns across all phases. Walking analysis identified arm swing angles of 50.9°–58.8° and leg separation angles of 64.3°–67.2°, indicating a stable gait rhythm. The running analysis revealed knee angles of 68.8°–69.8° and elbow angles of 87.6°–89.1°, indicating efficient propulsive mechanics. The flight phase demonstrated knee angles of 81.2°–87.8° and elbow angles of 80.4°–88.3°, suggesting effective momentum use and postural stability. These measurements supported stride-efficiency assessment and technique evaluation. Qualitative findings revealed that Kinovea enabled athletes to interpret movement phases and identify technical inefficiencies through slow-motion and frame-by-frame visualization. Conclusion: Kinovea supports basic motion analysis by providing clear kinematic information and helping beginner athletes observe and refine their movement techniques. The findings also offer practical value for coaches by enabling more precise identification of inefficient patterns and guiding targeted corrections during early-stage training."

CASE SUMMARY We describe a case of an 80-year-old female patient with a history of severe aortic stenosis and hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy that underwent aortic valve replacement and myectomy. The patient presented with acute pulmonary edema and low blood pressure due to LVOTO and SAM post cardiac surgery in the intensive care unit. She was paced with an epicardial dual-chamber pacing system due to complete atrioventricular block and treated initially with norepinephrine, furosemide, and esmolol infusion and continuous positive pressure ventilation. The patient remained hypoxemic and kept deteriorating hemodynamically despite titrating up norepinephrine. The addition of vasopressin infusion and tapering of norepinephrine finally stabilized the patient with significant reduction of LVOTO, confirmed by transthoracic echocardiography assessment, improved oxygenation and increased urine output. CONCLUSION Vasopressin seems to be the preferred vasopressor for managing LVOTO and SAM post-cardiac surgery, because of its absence of inotropic effects. Echocardiography is crucial for early diagnosis and therapeutic management."

We report a 12-day-old male neonate presenting with respiratory distress, edema, and oliguria. Physical examination revealed a grade 2/6 systolic murmur at the left sternal border. Echocardiography identified PFAA with coarctation, IAA, PDA, and an atrial septal defect (ASD), confirmed by cardiac CT. Surgical intervention included aortic arch repair, fifth arch excision, and ASD closure. The postoperative recovery was smooth, and the patient remained clinically well with normal cardiac function during the 1-year follow-up period. This case underscores the critical role of echocardiography in early diagnosis and surgical planning for complex congenital heart disease."

Medium- and large-vessel vasculitides represent a diagnostic challenge. The case described here highlights the importance of an accurate differential diagnosis, as non-inflammatory vascular diseases can mimic vasculitic patterns, with significant therapeutic implications. Materials and Methods. A 42-year-old man presented to the emergency department with subacute onset of temporal headache, low-grade fever, left flank pain, and hypertension (BP 170/100 mmHg). Rheumatologic history was unremarkable and physical examination was normal. Abdominal CT, performed for suspected ureterolithiasis, showed a hypodense area in the mid and upper third of the left kidney compatible with parenchymal ischemia, and a sleeve-like thickening with filiform stenosis of the ipsilateral renal artery, initially suggestive of vasculitis (renal arteritis). The patient was admitted to the Rheumatology Unit. Laboratory tests revealed inflammatory activity (CRP 3.7 mg/dL, ESR 51 mm/h). Intravenous methylprednisolone pulses (250 mg for 3 days) were started, followed by oral prednisone (1 mg/kg) and antihypertensive therapy. Given the suspicion of vasculitis, PET imaging was performed, showing no evidence of vascular inflammation, as well as duplex ultrasound of the four limbs and supra-aortic trunks, which revealed no stenotic or occlusive lesions. Considering the abrupt onset of symptoms, negative autoimmunity, negative PET findings, and absence of additional clinical or instrumental abnormalities, a renal arteriography was performed. It revealed a dissection of the left renal artery with thrombosis of the false lumen and parenchymal ischemia, allowing a final diagnosis of spontaneous left renal artery dissection complicated by renal infarction and renovascular hypertension. Results. The case was discussed with the Radiologist and Vascular Surgeon. Given the complete thrombosis of the false lumen, endovascular revascularization was excluded, and a conservative approach was adopted with antihypertensive and antiplatelet therapy, along with progressive steroid tapering, with no clinical relapse. A follow-up contrast-enhanced CT after 15 days confirmed stability of the renal ischemic lesion and improved parenchymal perfusion (Figure 1). Conclusions. Spontaneous renal artery dissection is a rare clinical entity with elusive etiology, accounting for only 1–2% of all arterial dissections. To date, approximately 200 cases have been reported in the medical literature. Our case emphasizes the importance of considering non-inflammatory vascular conditions, such as spontaneous dissection, in all instances where first-line imaging raises a generic suspicion of medium- or large-vessel vasculitis, particularly in cases of isolated vascular involvement and absence of systemic symptoms. A high index of suspicion is required in clinical practice, especially in atypical or subtle presentations, to promptly achieve the correct diagnosis."

Zeiher; Silvia Mas-Peiro; Stefanie Dimmeler; Andreas M. Zeiher,10.1161/jaha.125.044406,2025-11-26,Journal of the American Heart Association,"Clonal hematopoiesis of indeterminate potential (CHIP), defined as the presence of somatic mutations in subjects without other hematologic abnormalities has been recently associated with several cardiovascular diseases. Degenerative aortic valve stenosis (AVS), a prototypical cardiovascular age‐related disorder resulting from calcification and inflammation processes for which no medical treatment is currently available, has become the subject of scientific research in this field. In this review we describe the clinical relevance of CHIP in patients with AVS, as well as its effects on left ventricular dysfunction and heart failure, particularly about compensatory hypertrophy and diastolic dysfunction assessed by echocardiographic parameters. CHIP‐driver mutations DNMT3A and TET2 have been found in a third of all patients with severe AVS undergoing transcatheter aortic valve replacement in most studies; and several short‐term and long‐term studies have reported an increased mortality rate associated with the presence of CHIP in these patients. Additionally, we discuss potential mechanistic insights involving inflammatory pathways both from a clinical and from an experimental approach. These include primarily fluorescence‐activated cell sorting (FACS) analyses or single‐cell RNA sequencing (sc‐RNA‐seq) analyses from circulating leukocytes of patients with AVS, showing an increase in proinflammatory interleukines, and analyses on valve tissue exhibiting higher transcript levels of immunoglobulins, as well as murine models mimicking the consequences of AVS that could shed some light on potential causal link between CHIP and AVS. Lastly, we summarize prospects for novel therapeutic strategies, with efforts focusing on developing both general and more specific inflammatory therapies targeting inflammatory pathways. Future research will need to assess the incidence and progression of milder stages of aortic stenosis and evaluate potential interactions with different types of acquired mutations."

This study aimed to assess whether plasma from patients with AS induces oxidative stress and contributes to valvular endothelial cells (VECs) dysfunction. Methods Human plasma samples were obtained from patients with severe AS (AS+, n=110), patients with cardiovascular risk factors without AS (n=30), and healthy individuals (n=15). Plasma levels of proinflammatory cytokines (IL [interleukin]‐1β, IL‐6, TNF [tumor necrosis factor]‐α, and factor Xa [FXa]) were measured. Porcine aortic VECs were then incubated with plasma (10%, 24 hours). Oxidative stress levels were assessed using dihydroethidium staining, NO formation with 4‐amino‐5‐methylamino‐2′,7′‐difluororescein diacetate, mRNA expression by quantitative reverse transcription‐polymerase chain reaction, and protein expression levels by Western blot analyses. Platelets and monocytes adhesion as well as thrombin generation were determined. Different pharmacological inhibitors were used to explore the underlying pathways. Results Plasma from patients with AS+ exhibited elevated levels of IL‐1β, IL‐6, TNF‐α, and FXa activity. Incubation of VECs with AS+ plasma induced a pro‐oxidant response mediated by proinflammatory cytokines, the angiotensin system‐SGLT2 (sodium‐glucose transport protein 2) pathway, and FXa. AS+ plasma also triggered VEC dysfunction, inflammation, monocytes and platelets adhesion, and thrombin generation. These detrimental effects were mitigated by empagliflozin, losartan, neutralizing antibodies targeting proinflammatory cytokines, and dabigatran and rivaroxaban. Conclusions Patients with AS displayed subclinical systemic inflammation and increased FXa activity.

Malaysia; Mogaraj Sellapan",10.17576/jsa.2025.1502.04,2025-11-26,Journal of Surgical Academia,"Prostatic artery embolisation (PAE) is a well-established minimally invasive procedure for the management of lower urinary tract symptoms secondary to benign prostatic hyperplasia. In patients with advanced prostate cancer, its primary role has been palliative, particularly for controlling refractory haematuria. However, emerging evidence suggests that PAE may offer additional cytoreductive benefits. We presented the case of an 85-year-old male with advanced prostate cancer and multiple comorbidities, including severe aortic stenosis and stage 4 chronic kidney disease, who developed refractory gross haematuria unresponsive to conservative management. Due to high surgical risk, bilateral PAE was performed via a single right femoral artery access. The procedure resulted in complete resolution of haematuria, allowing early catheter removal. Remarkably, his prostate-specific antigen (PSA) declined from 5.28 ng/mL to 0.45 ng/mL over seven months, in the absence of systemic therapy. The patient remained haematuria-free with improved voiding symptoms. This case highlights the effectiveness of PAE for haemostatic control in advanced prostate cancer and suggests potential cytoreductive effects, evidenced by sustained PSA normalisation. PAE may serve a dual role in symptom control and disease modulation in patients unsuitable for surgery or systemic therapy. Further studies are warranted to explore its oncologic impact."

Mochel; Jessica Ward; Joshua Stern,10.20944/preprints202511.2236.v1,2025-11-28,Preprints.org,"Myxomatous mitral valve disease (MMVD) is the most common acquired cardiac disease in dogs and a leading cause of congestive heart failure. Over the past three decades, clinical trials and translational studies have generated a substantial evidence base supporting specific medical therapies, particularly drugs that modulate hemodynamics or target the renin–angiotensin–aldosterone system (RAAS). At the same time, gaps remain in our knowledge, and areas of clinical practice are guided more by expert consensus or extrapolation from human medicine than by robust veterinary data. This review summarizes current evidence for pharmacologic interventions in MMVD, including established therapies such as ACE inhibitors, mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists, diuretics, and inodilators, as well as emerging drug classes such as angiotensin receptor–neprilysin inhibitors and SGLT-2 inhibitors. For each, we highlight the existing data, discuss limitations of prior studies, and note areas where additional research is needed to guide optimal clinical use."

Khalique,10.1007/s11886-025-02311-x,2025-11-27,Current Cardiology Reports,"MR encompasses a spectrum of pathologies, ranging from degenerative leaflet prolapse to functional regurgitation caused by left ventricular remodeling. Accurate assessment of regurgitation is challenging and requires a multiparametric, comprehensive approach. TTE remains the primary imaging modality used to evaluate mitral valve structure, determine the severity of regurgitation, and related hemodynamic effects. TEE provides higher-resolution imaging for more detailed anatomical assessment, particularly valuable in surgical planning and transcatheter mitral procedures. The introduction of 3D echocardiography has further improved mitral valve imaging, allowing accurate preprocedural assessment and real-time guidance during structural interventions. Both TTE and TEE play essential and complementary roles in the thorough evaluation of MR. A multiparametric approach ensures accurate characterization of the regurgitation severity."

Intimal sarcoma, a subtype of undifferentiated sarcoma, is characterized by high metastatic potential and poor prognosis. Case Summary: A 23-year-old woman with no prior medical history presented to the emergency department with a 20-day history of progressive palpitations and dyspnea. Initial evaluation revealed tachycardia, hypotension, and a systolic mitral murmur. Laboratory tests demonstrated elevated D-dimer and high-sensitivity troponin I levels. Pulmonary thromboembolism was initially suspected; however, chest CT angiography revealed a left atrial mass, subsequently confirmed by transthoracic echocardiography as a heterogeneous mass causing dynamic mitral obstruction and moderate eccentric mitral regurgitation, with associated right ventricular dysfunction. The patient underwent emergency surgical resection, including removal of the left atrial appendage and partial atrial roof, followed by reconstruction of the interatrial septum. Histopathology confirmed high-grade intimal sarcoma with MDM2 overexpression. Postoperative management included adjuvant chemotherapy (Doxorubicin and Ifosfamide) and planned radiotherapy. Despite early intervention, follow-up MRI five months later revealed cerebral metastases, necessitating neurosurgical resection. Discussion and Conclusion: This case highlights the rapid progression and aggressive nature of cardiac intimal sarcoma, even in young patients with timely diagnosis and multidisciplinary care. Early recognition, prompt surgical intervention, and coordinated postoperative management remain critical to optimizing outcomes in this rare and high-risk disease."
OpenAlex,mitral regurgitation,Comparing porcine versus bovine mitral valve replacement in terms of structural valve deterioration: a systematic review,Sten Kajitani; Wesley Chorney; Ahmad Albakri; Karolina Kmieciak; Mpho Mthethwa; Martin Ho; Anthony Goodings; Hiroki Harada; David Rabkin; Michio Kajitani; Sten Kajitani; Wesley Chorney; Ahmad Albakri; Karolina Kmieciak; Mpho Mthethwa; Martin Ho; Anthony Goodings; Hiroki Harada; David Rabkin; Michio Kajitani,10.1186/s13019-025-03686-2,2025-11-26,Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery,"Abstract Background Bioprosthetic mitral valve replacements (MVR) commonly utilize either bovine or porcine valves; however, in terms of structural valve deterioration (SVD), clinical superiority between these valve types remains controversial. The primary objective of this study was to directly compare structural valve deterioration between porcine and bovine bioprosthetic valves used in mitral valve replacement. Methods A systematic review was conducted following PRISMA guidelines. Studies directly comparing porcine and bovine bioprosthetic valves in MVR were identified through comprehensive searches of Embase, MEDLINE, and Web of Science databases from inception through March 5, 2025. Eligible studies were cohort studies that directly compared bovine and porcine bioprosthetic valves implanted in the mitral position and reported SVD outcomes. The primary exposure was valve type, and the primary outcomes were reports of SVD. Data extraction included patient demographics, valve characteristics, SVD definitions, and modes of SVD. The Newcastle-Ottawa Scale was used for risk-of-bias assessment. Principal analyses involved narrative synthesis. Results Nine studies comprising 6,945 patients (range per study: 240–1,695) with follow-up periods ranging from 3.5 to 15 years were included. Three studies favored porcine valves, two favored bovine valves, and four showed no significant difference in terms of SVD. Porcine valves frequently demonstrated leaflet tearing resulting in acute regurgitation, while bovine valves predominantly exhibited calcification leading to stenosis. Younger patients (&lt; 65 years) generally showed better results with porcine valves. Despite variability across studies, cumulative evidence suggested a trend toward superior long-term durability of porcine bioprostheses. Conclusions Valve selection should be tailored to patient-specific factors, including age, anticipated longevity, clinical risk profile, and religious preference. Future studies should employ standardized definitions and longitudinal follow-up to clarify these findings."

This study aimed to evaluate the influence of PH severity on in-hospital mortality and early outcomes after valve surgery in patients with RHD. Methods In this prospective observational study, 152 patients with RHD undergoing valve surgery were categorized into three groups based on estimated systolic pulmonary artery pressure on echocardiography: no or mild PH (&lt;45 mmHg), moderate PH (45–59 mmHg), and severe PH (≥60 mmHg). The primary endpoint was in-hospital all-cause mortality and major morbidity; the secondary endpoint was 30-day readmission. Results In-hospital all-cause mortality was 3.3% ( n = 5), with no statistically significant difference among severe (4.8%), moderate (3.2%), and no/mild PH (0%) groups ( p = 0.518). ICU stay was significantly longer in patients with severe PH ( p = 0.042). There was no significant difference in mortality based on predominant valve lesion (mitral stenosis or regurgitation) across PH groups ( p = 0.625, p = 0.172). The 30-day readmission rate was 12.5%, with no significant variation across PH categories ( p = 0.194). Conclusion The severity of PH did not significantly impact early postoperative outcomes or in-hospital mortality following valve surgery for RHD. These findings support the feasibility and safety of surgical intervention even in patients with severe PH and provide a critical foundation for future studies in Yemen."
OpenAlex,mitral regurgitation,Mitral annular remodelling after STEMI is associated with new-onset dilatation of the left cardiac chambers and impaired left atrial function,Andreas Egeli Valeur; Victorien Emile Prot; Hans Martin Dahl Aguilera; Robert Matongo Persson; Kjell Vikenes; Rune Haaverstad; Dana Cramariuc; Stig Urheim,10.1093/ehjimp/qyaf150,2025-11-26,European Heart Journal - Imaging Methods and Practice,"Abstract Aims Functional mitral regurgitation is strongly associated with dilatation of the mitral annulus. We aimed to investigate how remodelling of the left ventricle and left atrium impacts the mitral annulus size and function in patients with transmural myocardial infarction. Methods In this prospective observational study, patients with ST-elevation myocardial infarction were examined with 3D echocardiography at admission and at 1-year follow-up (n=87). Size and function of the left cardiac chambers and the mitral annulus was analysed. The cohort was divided into groups with (n=16) or without (n=71) mitral annular remodelling, defined as an area increase of 15% or more, from baseline to follow-up. Results During follow-up, the group without mitral annular remodelling had stable volumes and improved function for both the left ventricle and the left atrium. Although the group with mitral annular remodelling also exhibited improved left ventricular function, both left ventricular volume and left atrial volume increased, and no improvement was seen in left atrial emptying fraction or left atrial reservoir or contractile strain. In linear regression analysis, increased mitral annular area at follow-up was associated with change in both left atrial (β=0.025 (0.007, 0.043), p=0.006) and left ventricular volume (β=0.014 (0.003, 0.025), p=0.012). Conclusion Mitral annular remodelling after transmural myocardial infarction is associated with increased volumes of the left ventricle and the left atrium, and absence of atrial functional improvement. Both increasing left atrial and left ventricular volume are associated with mitral annular dilatation, but left atrial volume is the strongest factor."
OpenAlex,mitral regurgitation,Cardiotoxicity is not always the only explanation - a case report,Andreea-Madalina Varvara; Irina Serban; Ruxandra Jurcuţ,10.2478/rjc-2025-0033,2025-11-26,Romanian Journal of Cardiology,"Abstract Cisplatin is a platinum-based chemotherapeutic agent; in fact, it is known as a vasculotoxic agent, but there are some case reports describing mild myocardial dysfunction related to cisplatin-based chemotherapy. Truncating variants in the titin (TTN) gene are rare in cardiomyopathy genes, but they are known to occur more frequently among cancer patients with cancer therapy-induced cardiomyopathy. We present the case of a 54-year-old female who was brought to the emergency room with shortness of breath at mild exertion. Biologically, we noted elevated N-terminal prohormone of brain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) at 5453 pg/mL. Her medical history includes six series of cisplatin-based chemotherapy for invasive cervical carcinoma at 47 years old with subsequent remission. The electrocardiography (ECG) noted sinus rhythm and T-wave inversion in inferior and lateral leads. The transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) revealed a dilated left ventricle with severe diffuse hypokinesia of the walls, an estimated ejection fraction of 15%, systolic dysfunction of the right ventricle, and severe mitral functional regurgitation. Her family history includes her mother being diagnosed with cardiomyopathy and sudden cardiac death (SCD) at 54 years old and a brother with SCD at 34 years old. Furthermore, the systolic dysfunction seems to be caused by more than just the cardiotoxic effects of platinum-based chemotherapy. This, corroborated with the family history, rather advocates for a possible genetic etiology, so we performed genetic testing, which detected a likely pathogenic mutation in the TTN gene (c.64915C&gt;T, p (Arg21639Ter). Additionally, a unicameral implantable cardioverter-defibrillator was considered for primary prevention of SCD. The present case illustrates the importance of baseline cardiac evaluation of the patients receiving cardiotoxic chemotherapy. The identification of genetic risk factors helps us to identify patients at high risk for developing cardiomyopathies secondary to chemotherapy and associated adverse outcomes."

VT ablation was considered but not performed since cardiac CT scan revealed M-TEER associated thrombus on the ventricular surface of the posterior mitral leaflet. Despite being on amiodarone, the patient returned few days later with VT storm. After multidisciplinary assessment and patient-centric discussions, the decision was made to proceed with emergent, rescue VT ablation using cerebral embolic protection device (CEP) and mechanical support as needed. VT ablation was safe and successfully performed. Patient had no recurrence of VT during 2.5 month follow up. To our knowledge, this is the first reported case of VT ablation using CEP for LV thrombus in North America.

OpenAlex,mitral regurgitation,Predictors of functional mitral regurgitation progression after isolated surgical correction of chronic aortic insufficiency,A.A. Bulynin; E.R. Charchyan; S. O. Popov,10.17116/hirurgia20251026,2025-11-25,Pirogov Russian Journal of Surgery,"Objective. To identify the predictors of progression of naive functional mitral regurgitation (MR) in patients with severe left ventricular dilation in addition to chronic aortic insufficiency (AI) after isolated surgical correction of the aortic valve disease. Material and methods. The study included 80 patients with end-diastolic volume (EDV) of the left ventricle (LV) ≥250 ml in presence of chronic AI with functional MR. AI was the only primary factor of LV remodeling in all patients. Surgical treatment of AI was performed according to the David and Bentall-DeBono methods, as well as AV replacement and isolated plasty of AV leaflets were done on the basis of several centers. The dynamics of functional MR severity was evaluated by transthoracic echocardiography. Evaluation of MR severity and analysis of possible predictors were performed 1—10 days before surgery, 7—10 days after surgery and at least 6 months after surgical treatment. Results. Mitral annulus diameter (MAD) ≥45 mm at the preoperative stage of observation serves as an independent predictor of MR progression from the post-operative level to long-term one at EDV ≥250 ml in all groups (OR 1.560; 95% confidence interval — CI 1.033—2.358; p=0.035). The MAD/end-diastolic dimension ratio ≥0.539 before surgery is a statistically significant gross predictor of MR aggravation from the post-operative stage to long-term period (AUC=0.734; 95% CI 0.562—0.905; p=0.011). The MAD/end-systolic dimension ratio ≥0.833 before surgery serves as a statistically significant predictor of MR aggravation from the post-operative stage to long-term period (AUC=0.698; 95% CI 0.522—0.875; p=0.031). Conclusion. Functional MR that occurred in presence of chronic AI may progress after correction of the aortic valve disease in severe mitral annular dilatation outpacing the LV dilation."
