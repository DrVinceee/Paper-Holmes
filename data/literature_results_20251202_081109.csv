PubMed,aortic stenosis,Transcatheter Aortic Valve Implantation with Anomalous Left Main Origin From Right Coronary Cusp: A Case Report.,Raghad Mohammed Altayyar; Faisal Omar Al-Nasser; Mohamed Ajaz Ghani,10.12659/AJCR.948995,2025-12-01,The American journal of case reports,"BACKGROUND Transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) is a less invasive option for severe aortic stenosis in patients unfit for surgery. Its use has substantially expanded due to its safety profile and clinical efficacy in appropriately selected patients. This report highlights the procedural challenges of managing aortic stenosis in the presence of a rare coronary anomaly. The anomalous origin of the left main coronary artery from the right coronary cusp is uncommon but clinically important because of the potential for adverse outcomes during intervention. This anomaly may increase the risk of coronary obstruction or compromise during valve deployment. Accurate identification and risk mitigation strategies are essential to prevent complications in such cases. CASE REPORT A 70-year-old woman with aortic stenosis was evaluated for progressive exertional dyspnea. Diagnostic echocardiography confirmed severe aortic stenosis. Further assessment with cardiac computed tomography and cardiac catheterization revealed an anomalous origin of the left main coronary artery from the right coronary cusp; no obstructive lesions were identified. The patient successfully underwent TAVI, guided by detailed imaging that informed valve selection and procedural planning to address challenges posed by her unique coronary anatomy. Postprocedural recovery was uneventful, and the patient demonstrated substantial symptomatic improvement at follow-up. CONCLUSIONS This case demonstrates the feasibility and safety of performing TAVI in patients with coronary anomalies. It underscores the importance of precise imaging, coronary protection strategies, and individualized procedural planning to achieve optimal clinical outcomes. Further studies are warranted to develop standardized approaches for managing anatomically complex cases."
PubMed,aortic stenosis,Sutureless aortic valve replacement with annular plication technique in an oversized annulus.,Shota Inoue; Chikara Ueki; Minoru Tabata,10.1093/icvts/ivaf287,2025-12-01,Interdisciplinary cardiovascular and thoracic surgery,"We present the case of a 72-year-old man with symptomatic severe aortic regurgitation and moderate aortic stenosis, and an annular diameter of 30 mm, exceeding the recommended range for sutureless Perceval valve implantation. To reduce the annular size to allow implantation of the Perceval XL valve, an annular plication technique was employed, involving three horizontal mattress sutures placed at the interleaflet triangles. A totally endoscopic approach via right mini-thoracotomy was utilized. Postoperative echocardiography confirmed excellent valve positioning and no paravalvular leak. The patient recovered uneventfully and remained asymptomatic with good prosthesis function at the 3-year follow-up. This case demonstrated that annular plication enables the safe use of the Perceval valve in patients with a mildly oversized annulus and may expand its applicability in minimally invasive settings."

Transesophageal echocardiography (TOE) allows direct aortic valve area (AVA) planimetry (AVATOE), while computed tomography angiography (CTA) offers a non-invasive alternative (AVACTA). This study aimed to evaluate the correlation between AVA measurements across modalities and to determine a diagnostic AVACTA threshold for severe AS.
This retrospective study included a single-center derivation cohort of 176 patients (mean age 80.0 ± 7.7 years, 52.8% male) with moderate to severe AS who underwent full-cycle CTA, TTE, and TOE. AVACTA was measured by two independent raters. Correlation with AVATOE and other parameters was assessed. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis was used to define an optimal AVACTA threshold for severe AS, which was validated in a multi-center cohort of 407 patients (mean age 80.9 ± 6.7 years, 52.8% male) with comparable characteristics.
Mean AVACTA was 0.96 ± 0.28 cm² with a high interrater reliability (IRR = 0.84), compared to a mean AVATOE of 0.88 ± 0.26 cm² (Pearson's r = 0.73). ROC analysis identified 0.96 cm² as the optimal AVACTA threshold for diagnosing severe AS (AUC = 0.846; sensitivity = 71.7%; specificity = 89.8%) compared to TOE grading. This threshold yielded good diagnostic performance in the validation cohort (AUC = 0.817; sensitivity = 78.2%; specificity = 72.6%).
AVACTA demonstrated high reliability, showing a strong correlation with AVATOE. The 0.96 cm² threshold, defined in the derivation cohort, performed well in the validation cohort for assessing aortic stenosis severity."

The valve-to-annulus area ratio (VTAAR) may improve AS severity assessment. This study evaluates AVA CT ≤ 1.2 cm² and VTAAR thresholds in severe AS patients. We retrospectively analyzed consecutive patients who underwent transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) for severe symptomatic AS at a tertiary center. AVA CT was measured via mid-systolic planimetry, and VTAAR was calculated as AVA CT divided by annular area. Severe AS was determined by Structural Heart Team consensus based on transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) and supplementary imaging. Among 343 patients (mean age 79.7 ± 8.4 years, 55.4% male), AVA CT was ≤ 1.2 cm² in 241 (70.3%) and > 1.2 cm² in 102 (29.7%). Applying a VTAAR cutoff of ≤ 0.3 improved CT sensitivity, identifying severe AS in 307 patients (89.5%) meeting either AVA CT ≤ 1.2 cm² or VTAAR ≤ 0.3. This approach reclassified 62 of 102 patients (61%) with AVA CT > 1.2 cm², with greater sensitivity in those with left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) < 50%, mean aortic valve pressure gradient < 40 mmHg, and patients with body surface area (BSA) > 1.95 m2. AVA CT ≤ 1.2 cm² alone is not a sensitive marker for severe AS. Adding VTAAR ≤ 0.3 enhances CT's sensitivity, particularly in low gradient AS and large BSA patients. If validated prospectively, these CT metrics could aid AS severity assessment when TTE is inconclusive."

It explores the efficacy, safety, and practical considerations of mavacamten use, while highlighting evolving indications and future directions.
Randomized trials have shown that mavacamten significantly reduces left ventricular outflow tract gradients, improves symptoms and exercise capacity, and induces structural reverse remodeling with a favorable safety profile. Real-world data confirm these benefits in broader patient populations. Pharmacogenetic variability, titration protocols, and cost-effectiveness analyses have further refined its clinical use. Mavacamten represents a paradigm shift in oHCM treatment by targeting disease at its sarcomeric origin. Its integration into routine care is expanding, supported by real-world evidence. Ongoing studies will clarify its role in non-obstructive HCM, heart failure with preserved ejection fraction, pediatric populations, and early-stage disease."

Despite the lack of randomized data, these patients are often treated with TAVR.
We queried the Nationwide Readmissions Database (2016-2021) to identify patients aged 50-64 years hospitalized for isolated aortic valve replacement (AVR). The contemporary use of TAVR and SAVR in patients aged 50-64 years was evaluated. In-hospital outcomes of TAVR vs SAVR were compared using propensity score matching. Readmissions were compared using the Cox proportional hazards regression model.
Of 75,413 weighted hospitalizations for isolated AVR in patients aged 50-64 years, 22,695 (30.1%) included TAVR, and 52,718 (69.9%) included SAVR. From 2016Q1 to 2021Q4, the proportion of AVR performed using TAVR increased from 12.6% to 41.4% in patients aged 50-64 years (ptrend < .001). TAVR, compared with SAVR, was associated with lower in-hospital mortality (1.0% vs 2.0%; P < .001), stroke (1.4% vs 2.8%; P < .001), acute kidney injury (9.8% vs 17.4%; P < .001), and major bleeding (1.0% vs 1.4%, P = .04) and with higher permanent pacemaker placement (4.7% vs 3.4%; P < .001), vascular complications (3.5% vs 1.6%; P < .001), and 180-day all-cause readmissions (14.4% vs 9.0%; P < .001). Length of stay was shorter (2 vs 6 days; P < .001) and nonhome discharges were lower (17.1% vs 54.6%; P < .001) with TAVR than those with SAVR.
This nationwide observational analysis found that TAVR is increasingly performed among patients aged 50-64 years with lower in-hospital mortality and resource utilization but higher readmissions than SAVR."

Heart & vasculature,"Although prior studies have linked frailty and accelerated biological aging to aortic stenosis, comprehensive evidence across the spectrum of degenerative valvular diseases (VHD) and related clinical events remains unclear in middle-aged adults.
We analyzed 408,783 UK Biobank participants free of baseline valvular disease. Biological age accelerations (BAA) measures were derived from clinical traits using Phenotypic Age (PhenoAge) algorithm and the Klemera-Doubal method Biological Age (KDM-BA). Outcomes included incident aortic stenosis (AS), aortic regurgitation (AR), mitral regurgitation (MR), and related interventions or mortality.
Over a median follow-up of 13.9 years, 10,364 incident degenerative VHD events (2.5 %) were documented, comprising 4602 AS, 1678 AS-related events, 1639 AR, and 4903 MR cases. Elevated BAA was significantly associated with higher AS risk. For PhenoAge, adjusted AS incidence rates (per 10,000 person-years; 95 % confidence interval) across quartiles (Q1-Q4) were 3.73 (3.37-4.12), 4.44 (4.05-4.88), 5.11 (4.67-5.59), and 7.79 (7.18-8.46), yielding an adjusted hazard ratio (HR) of 2.15 (1.96-2.35) for Q4. Comparable trends were observed for KDM-BA, with an adjusted HR of 1.98 (1.83-2.15) for Q4 vs Q1. AS-related events followed a similar pattern, with HRs of 1.80 (1.55-2.09) for PhenoAge Q4 and 2.22 (1.94-2.54) for KDM-BA Q4. Significant associations were also found for AR, AR-related events, and MR, but not for MR-related events.
Among middle-aged adults, both BAA metrics were associated with increased risks of degenerative VHD and related adverse events, except for MR-related events. These findings highlight BAA as a potential tool for early risk stratification and targeted prevention."

However, their reliability is hindered by the lack of patient-specific boundary conditions, particularly measured flow rates. This study addresses this knowledge gap by introducing a method for estimating flow division in aortic branches. The geometry of the lesional aorta was first repaired to obtain a near-healthy reference geometry. An iterative CFD simulation was then employed to estimate the flow division in the branches of the diseased aorta. Specifically, empirical boundary conditions from healthy individuals were used to predict the outlet pressures of reference geometry, which were subsequently converted into resistance models. These resistance models were then assigned to the outlets of the diseased aorta to predict the inlet pressure. The discrepancy between the predicted and target inlet pressures was iteratively minimized by adjusting the inlet pressure of the reference model until convergence was achieved. The final flow division in the branches of the diseased aorta was then obtained. The performance of the proposed method was investigated in three patients with aortic dissection or aneurysm. The proposed method predicted lower flow rates in branches with severe stenosis, which was more consistent with physiological expectations. Furthermore, the predicted blood pressure differed significantly from that obtained using the traditional method and was closer to the target values. The proposed method provides a practical solution for specifying boundary conditions in hemodynamic studies when clinically measured flow rates are unavailable."

However, a detailed methodological description that includes the surgical approach and imaging planes is lacking. The aim of this study was to standardize SE performed via a subxiphoid surgical approach and to provide reference values for future research.
SE was performed in 19 female German Landrace pigs under general anesthesia using a defined imaging protocol. After the induction of general anesthesia, a small subxiphoid incision was made to optimize the image quality for SE. The echocardiographic imaging protocol was adapted from human 2D-transthoracic echocardiography and included apical 2-, 3-, and 5-chamber views and Doppler measurements of blood flow and tissue velocities. Furthermore, speckle tracking was used to assess left ventricular (LV) and right ventricular (RV) myocardial deformation.
During SE, the animals were under stable anesthesia with a heart rate of 65 ± 12 beats per minute, and a mean arterial pressure of 88 ± 12 mmHg. Blood gas values were within physiological ranges. High-quality images of both ventricles were consistently achieved using the established imaging protocol. One animal showed a severe aortic stenosis and was excluded from the analysis. The biplane LV stroke volume was 45 ± 13 ml and the LV ejection fraction was 67% ± 11%. LV-global longitudinal strain (GLS) was -22.4% ± 3.3%, and RV free wall longitudinal strain was -23.7% ± 5%. The Vmax of the aortic valve was 1.6 ± 0.3 m/s.
SE offers a standardized and reproducible imaging technique for the assessment of high-quality apical views in swine models. This study provides procedural guidance and reference values for translational research applications."

Accurate valve positioning is critical for successful TAVI, and highly accurate real-time visualization-with minimal use of contrast-is especially important for patients with chronic kidney disease. Under fluoroscopic conditions, which often suffer from low contrast, high noise and artifacts, automatic segmentation of anatomical structures using convolutional neural networks (CNNs) can significantly improve the accuracy of valve positioning. This paper presents a comparative analysis of various CNN architectures for automatic aortic root segmentation on angiographic images, with the aim of optimizing the TAVI process. The experimental evaluation included models such as FPN, U-Net++, DeepLabV3+, LinkNet, MA-Net, and PSPNet, all trained and tested with optimally tuned hyperparameters. During training dynamics, DeepLabV3+ and U-Net++ showed stable convergence with median Dice scores around 0.88. However, when evaluated at the patient level, MA-Net and PSPNet outperformed all other models, achieving Dice coefficients of 0.942 and 0.936, and an average symmetric surface distance of 4.1 mm. The findings underscore the potential of incorporating automatic segmentation methods into decision-support systems for cardiac surgery-reducing contrast agent use, minimizing surgical risks, and improving valve positioning accuracy. Future work will focus on expanding the dataset, exploring additional architectures, and adapting the models for real-time application."

""edgeR"" was used to calculate differentially expressed genes (DEGs) for bulk-RNAseq. GO, KEGG, and GSEA analyses were performed on the DEGs. Aortic valves from 8 AS patients and 8 non-AS patients were collected for proteomic sequencing. After DEG analysis, five algorithms were used to identify hub genes. ROC curves were constructed for the hub genes. Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNAseq) was applied to systematically elaborate the mechanism in AS pathogenesis.
Transcriptome data showed that AS was accompanied by high expression of genes such as MMP9, CXCL8, and SPP1, with significant activation of hypoxia, inflammatory response, and fibrosis. Proteomic sequencing of calcified AS revealed significantly enhanced hypoxic response, TNF-α signaling, and extracellular matrix (ECM) formation. Sixteen hub genes, including ITGB3, ITGAV, and MMP9, were identified by five algorithms, all with high diagnostic efficacy (AUC > 0.75). PCR experiments confirmed that MMP9 and PLAU were highly expressed in calcified aortic valves (P < 0.05). scRNAseq revealed that in highly calcified regions, MMP9 and PLAU were mainly distributed in endothelial cells, monocytes, and macrophages, participating in the differentiation of monocytes and macrophages and relating to lipid metabolism and proinflammatory responses.
The 16 hub genes can assist in the diagnosis of aortic stenosis, and MMP9 and PLAU may participate in AS development by regulating the proinflammatory effects of monocytes and macrophages."

However, there is currently no consensus in clinical guidelines regarding the optimal treatment approach for LVAD-associated AR.
We report a case of a female patient who developed AR following LVAD implantation. This patient exhibited an open-like configuration of left ventricular outflow tract (LVOT), with no calcified stenosis in the supravalvular region and a lack of anchoring anatomical structures at the junction of the LVOT and sinus-tubular junction. This anatomical configuration posed a high risk of prosthetic valve displacement during conventional transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR). Therefore, we employed a novel TAVR system (Taurus Trio) equipped with a locator, which effectively prevented downward migration of the prosthetic valve after implantation.
This case indicates the potential advantages and efficacy of the Taurus Trio valve in TAVR for AR Post-LVAD. We plan to conduct long-term follow-up to further explore and optimize the treatment protocol."

Spinal magnetic resonance imaging revealed anterior signal abnormality T8 down to conus medullaris, terminating at L1 compatible with SCI. T9-T10 moderate spinal stenosis, along with degenerative changes L5-S1, was seen. Abdominal CT angiography revealed no signs of aortic dissection and no evidence of intestinal ischemia. He was treated with gabapentin for neuropathic abdominal pain and aspirin.
This case represents an uncommon presentation of exertion-induced SCI. In patients with acute neurologic symptoms with absence of trauma, SCI should remain high on the differential."

This investigator-initiated, randomized, multicenter, open-label pilot study assessed left atrial appendage occlusion (LAAO) in patients with AF undergoing TAVI.
Patients were randomly assigned to LAAO (TAVI + LAAO) or standard medical therapy (SMT) (TAVI + SMT). The primary endpoint was a composite of cerebrovascular events, peripheral embolism, life-threatening/disabling/major bleeding, or cardiovascular mortality at 1 year. A sensitivity analysis was performed in the per-protocol population.
Eighty-one patients (Society of Thoracic Surgeons score: 9.0% ± 5.4%) were enrolled. The primary endpoint occurred in 13 patients (33%) in the TAVI + LAAO group and in 15 patients (37%) in the TAVI + SMT group (adjusted odds ratio [OR], 0.87; 95% CI: 0.32-2.29, p = 0.77). Bleeding rates were comparable between TAVI + LAAO (13%) and TAVI + SMT (17%), with absent nonprocedural bleeding in the TAVI + LAAO group and 5 gastrointestinal bleedings in TAVI + SMT, and cerebrovascular events did not significantly differ between groups (10% in TAVI + LAAO vs. 2.4% in TAVI + SMT). In the per-protocol analysis, occurrence of the primary endpoint was comparable between groups (adjusted OR, 0.55; 95% CI: 0.18-1.56, p = 0.27) with cerebrovascular events in 5.6% and 2.4%, and bleeding events in 8.3% and 17% for TAVI + LAAO and TAVI + SMT, respectively.
This pilot study suggests that among high-risk patients with AF undergoing TAVI, a strategy of a combined procedure with LAAO and early cessation of oral anticoagulation overall showed similar rates of the primary end point as compared to a single TAVI procedure (NCT03088098)."

However, in patients with hostile aortic anatomies, the procedure may carry increased risks of vascular or cerebrovascular complications. The objective of this article is, therefore, to evaluate the safety and efficacy of using the extended-length DrySeal Flex introducer sheath (Gore, USA) for TF-TAVR in high-risk patients with challenging aortic anatomies.
We conducted a retrospective, single-center cohort study including all consecutive patients who underwent TF-TAVR with the 65-cm DrySeal sheath between 2021 and 2025. We analyzed the indications for sheath use and the following clinical outcomes: all-cause mortality, stroke, and major vascular complications as defined by Valve Academic Research Consortium-3 criteria.
The 65-cm DrySeal sheath was used in 200 patients (median age 80 years; median Society of Thoracic Surgeons score 5.4%) out of 2430 (8.2%) TF-TAVR procedures performed. This approach was selected to address challenges posed by aortic arch calcification (28%), heavily atheromatous or shaggy aorta (20%), acute aortic angulation (26%), tortuosity (36%), and aortic coarctation (8%). In this high-risk cohort, all-cause mortality was 0.5%, stroke occurred in 1.5% (including 0.5% with disabling stroke), and major vascular complications were observed in 1.0%. These outcomes were comparable to those seen in lower-risk patients undergoing TF-TAVR using conventional approaches.
In patients with hostile aortic anatomies, the extended-length DrySeal Flex introducer sheath facilitated safe and effective TAV delivery and was associated with a low rate of periprocedural complications, including cerebrovascular events. Its use may help mitigate the risks traditionally associated with hostile aortic anatomies."

Although plaque characteristics have attracted attention as risk factors, only a few studies have focused on access routes. This study aimed to identify ischemic factors following CAS, including access routes and plaque instability, using computed tomography angiography (CTA).
We retrospectively collected the clinical data of consecutive patients who underwent CAS and preoperative CTA. The access route was evaluated as having aortic plaques and a stenosis at proximal segment lesions beyond carotid plaques (brachiocephalic/common carotid artery). Aortic plaques were further classified based on the presence or absence of calcifications. The outcome was the presence of hyperintense lesions (ipsilateral/non-ipsilateral/bilateral) on postoperative diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI). Multivariate analysis was conducted using two models: aortic plaques (Model 1) and calcified aortic plaques (Model 2).
Among the 115 patients who underwent CAS, the mean age was 74.7 years, and 16 (13.9%) were female. Aortic arch plaques were detected in 33 (28.7%) cases, and calcified plaques in 10 (8.7%). Plaques at proximal segment lesions were detected in 27 (23.5%) cases. DWI lesions were detected in 49 (42.6%) cases; 41 (35.7%) on the ipsilateral side, 19 (16.5%) on the non-ipsilateral side, and 11 (9.6%) bilaterally.

The aim of the study was to assess the prevalence of MR and tricuspid regurgitation (TR), valvular thickening, and prolapse in a group of apparently healthy Chihuahua dogs.
Ninety-seven privately owned Chihuahua dogs, recruited via the Swedish Chihuahua Club, were included in the study. A prospective observational study was conducted where clinical examinations, electrocardiograms, and echocardiographic and Doppler examinations were performed in all dogs.
Mitral regurgitation was found in 37 (38%) dogs and was considered mild in 31 dogs, moderate in four dogs, and severe in two dogs. A systolic murmur over the mitral valve area was heard in 21 (22%) dogs. Mitral valve thickening was observed in 36 (37%) and mitral valve prolapse in 12 (12%) dogs. Tricuspid valve regurgitation was present in 14 (14%) of all dogs and in 30% of dogs with MR. Dogs with MR were significantly older (median: 7.6 years) than dogs without MR (median: 3 years); P < 0.0001.
Whether or not the presence of MR reflects early stages of myxomatous mitral valve disease cannot be ascertained without the use of histological examination of the mitral valves.
Mitral regurgitation was common in this group of apparently healthy Chihuahua dogs, and at the age of 6.4 years, there is a 50% chance that a dog has developed MR. In the age group 9-10 years, MR was found in 80% of the dogs."

Examination revealed tachycardia and a loud murmur with thrills over the pulmonary area, along with features of pulmonary oedema. Nasopharyngeal polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test confirmed COVID-19 infection. Transthoracic echocardiography demonstrated turbulent left-to-right shunting at the great artery level, mild functional mitral and tricuspid regurgitation, and elevated pulmonary artery systolic pressure. Computed tomography pulmonary angiography identified a ruptured SoVa with a fistulous connection to the pulmonary artery, associated right upper lobe pulmonary embolism, and pulmonary congestion. Initial management included corticosteroids and antivirals for COVID-19, broad-spectrum antibiotics for suspected infective endocarditis, and diuretics. Progressive cardiac dysfunction necessitated percutaneous closure of the fistula using an 8-mm occluder device, achieving prompt haemodynamic stabilisation. Subsequently, the patient developed severe aortic regurgitation, aortic root dilatation, and right ventricular dysfunction, requiring urgent aortic root replacement with a tissue prosthesis and right ventricular repair. Persistent postoperative pyrexia and elevated inflammatory markers despite sterile blood cultures prompted histopathological evaluation, which revealed necrotising granulomatous inflammation with multinucleated giant cells, which couldn't rule out giant-cell aortitis. A rheumatological review uncovered recurrent oral and genital ulceration, confirming Behçet's disease as the underlying aetiology. Immunosuppressive therapy with corticosteroids, infliximab, and azathioprine, together with treatment for latent tuberculosis (TB), resulted in full clinical remission. At one-year follow-up, ventricular function and prosthetic valve performance remained preserved with no evidence of recurrent aneurysmal change or inflammatory activity. This case highlights the complex interplay between structural cardiac pathology, infection, and systemic vasculitis, underscoring the importance of multidisciplinary evaluation and targeted immunosuppressive therapy."

Although most MR involves central A2P2 jets, a subset present with noncentral jets, which may introduce procedural complexity and influence outcomes. The objective of the study was to evaluate the impact of main MR jet location (central [A2P2] versus noncentral [A1/P1 or A3/P3]) on procedural success and clinical outcomes following M-TEER.
This analysis used the EXPANDed data set, which included patients undergoing M-TEER with MitraClip G3/G4 systems and echocardiographic core laboratory-assessed main MR jet location. One-year clinical, echocardiographic, and functional outcomes were assessed.
A total of 1785 patients had main jets at A2P2 and 81 at A1P1 or A3P3 (non-A2P2). Non-A2P2 patients more frequently had degenerative MR, prior mitral valve procedures, and better left ventricular function. Procedural success was high and comparable (A2P2: 95.9%, non-A2P2: 92.5%; p = 0.15), with low 30-day major adverse event rates in both (A2P2: 4.2%, non-A2P2: 7.4%; p = 0.16). MR ≤ 1+ was achieved in both groups at 1 year (A2P2: 91%, non-A2P2: 84%, p = 0.11). New York Heart Association class ≤ II improved through 1 year in both groups (A2P2: 81%, non-A2P2: 88%). Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire overall summary improved significantly with no difference between groups at 1 year (A2P2: Δ13 points, non-A2P2: Δ20 points). One-year all-cause mortality was similar (10.7 vs. 13.7%; p = 0.47).
In this largest analysis to date of patients with severe MR, main MR jet location did not affect the safety or effectiveness of the MitraClip system. These findings support the use of M-TEER across a range of anatomical presentations, including non-A2P2 MR jets."

Infections with Haemophilus, Aggregatibacter, Cardiobacterium, Eikenella, Kingella (HACEK) organisms are a well-known but rare cause of infective endocarditis (IE), which may be difficult to detect. Bacterial infections are more common in patients with cirrhosis, which may complicate the interpretation of clinical findings.
The patient is a 44-year-old male with alcoholic cirrhosis who presented with hematuria, proteinuria, and acute kidney injury (AKI), with negative blood cultures. Kidney biopsy revealed ICM-MPGN, with no underlying etiology identified. His clinical course was complicated by recurrent fluid overload with AKI requiring dialysis. Following corticosteroid therapy for ICM-MPGN, he developed Aggregatibacter bacteremia associated with worsening mitral regurgitation but without vegetations. After antibiotic therapy, the mitral valve was replaced and showed healed endocarditis. Following prolonged antibiotic therapy and successful surgical intervention, his kidney function improved and he remains dialysis independent.
This case highlights the role of HACEK organisms causing subclinical and difficult to diagnose IE, the increased risk of infection in patients with cirrhosis, and the need for a thorough evaluation for infectious etiologies in patients with ICM-MPGN prior to immunosuppressive therapy."

We retrospectively reviewed 24 patients who underwent MVR with mechanical prostheses before the age of 3 years between 1996 and 2019. Underlying diagnoses included isolated congenital mitral regurgitation (n=4), congenital mitral stenosis (n=4), and various congenital heart defects (n=16). The median follow-up duration was 9.8 years (interquartile range [IQR], 7.3-13.2 years).
The median age and weight at MVR were 16.6 months (IQR, 5.3-24.7 months) and 7.6 kg (IRQ, 4.9-9.5 kg), respectively. The median prosthesis size was 19 mm (range, 16-29 mm). Supra-annular implantation was performed in 12 patients (50%), who were significantly younger and smaller at the time of surgery and received smaller prostheses than those receiving annular implants. Early mortality occurred in 2 patients (8.3%), and 2 late deaths were recorded. The overall survival rate was 83.3% at 15 years. Redo MVR was performed in 9 patients during follow-up. The median increase in valve size was 4 mm. The interval from initial to redo MVR was positively correlated with the increase in valve size (Spearman ρ=0.64, p=0.07). Freedom from redo MVR was 86.3% at 5 years and 75.8% at 10 years.
MVR with mechanical prostheses in children under 3 years of age can yield acceptable long-term survival, although redo MVR is often required. Mechanical MVR remains a viable salvage option in small children when valve repair is not feasible."

We investigated whether the disproportion between LV size and prosthetic annulus dimension predicts long-term MR recurrence and adverse LV remodelling after restrictive annuloplasty.
This retrospective study included 445 patients with asDMR (stages C2-D) who underwent MV repair with either the Medtronic CG Future or Edwards Physio II annuloplasty prosthesis between 2005 and 2019. The ratio of LV end-systolic diameter (LVESD) to prosthetic orifice area (POA) quantified LV-annulus mismatch. Recurrent MR (≥grade 2) was the primary endpoint, with death treated as a competing risk. The optimal LVESD/POA threshold was derived using maximally selected rank statistics. Propensity-score matching (1:1) adjusted for baseline differences and longitudinal LV changes was analysed by generalised least-squares modelling.
During a median follow-up of 6.0 years, 15.5% of patients developed recurrent MR and 10.6% died. LVESD/POA was independently associated with recurrence (adjusted subdistribution HR 1.95, 95% CI 1.65 to 2.30; p<0.001). A threshold of 12.25 mm/cm² identified a 'mismatch' cohort with higher 5-year cumulative MR recurrence (30% vs 14%, p=0.02) and faster postoperative LV re-enlargement compared with the non-mismatch group. These findings were consistent after propensity matching. Mortality did not differ between groups.
In patients with asDMR, a larger LVESD-to-POA ratio identifies those at elevated risk of recurrent regurgitation and progressive LV remodelling after repair. Preoperative echocardiographic assessment of LV-annulus proportionality may help optimise prosthesis sizing and improve long-term durability of MV repair. Prospective multicentre validation is warranted.

However, it is unclear how MR severity affects prognosis. This meta-analysis evaluated the associations among baseline MR severity, cardiovascular outcomes, and mortality after TAVR. Eligible studies included adult patients undergoing TAVR with stratified MR severity (MR ≥ 2 or MR ≥ 3) and reported the post-TAVR clinical outcomes. Sensitivity analyses stratified by follow-up duration, leave-one-out sensitivity, and meta-regression were also conducted. Forty-two studies (n = 67,257 patients) were included. MR ≥ 2 was associated with increased all-cause mortality during follow-up (> 30 days) (hazard ratio [HR]: 1.40; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.26, 1.55) and cardiovascular mortality (risk ratio [RR]: 1.80; 95% CI: 1.05, 3.08), but not with stroke, transient ischemic attack, myocardial infarction (MI), or heart failure hospitalization. MR ≥ 3 conferred an even higher risk of all-cause mortality during follow-up (RR: 1.55; 95% CI: 1.24, 1.94) and rehospitalization (RR: 1.40; 95% CI: 1.17, 1.67), but not for stroke and MI. MR improvement occurred in 41% of patients within < 1-year post-TAVR, declined to 15% at > 1-year post-TAVR. Baseline moderate-to-severe MR (MR ≥ 2) predicts all-cause mortality during follow-up and cardiovascular mortality after TAVR, particularly severe MR (MR ≥ 3). While no consistent associations were found with nonfatal outcomes such as stroke, TIA, MI, or heart failure hospitalization, the prognostic impact of MR appears to be predominantly mortality-centered."

Due to the urgent need for medical and surgical intervention and high mortality, chronic presentation of mitral regurgitation from papillary muscle rupture is unusual and, to our knowledge, with no reported incidence.
A 70-year-old female presented with several months of increased fatigability and dyspnea on exertion. Examination and diagnostic echocardiographic studies confirmed severe mitral regurgitation with posterior mitral leaflet prolapse of P2 with suspected papillary muscle attached. Cardiac catheterization showed 80% ostial and 90% proximal stenosis of a diagonal artery branch. Bioprosthetic mitral valve replacement was performed with coronary bypass. Patient had an uneventful postoperative course and symptom-free recovery.
We report a rare case of chronic presentation of severe mitral regurgitation from ruptured papillary muscle, presenting as progressive worsening symptoms. Careful echocardiographic examination and high index of suspicion are keys to diagnosis. Surgical mitral valve replacement is the most common operation done for mitral valve regurgitation secondary to ruptured papillary muscle, with alternatives as surgical mitral valve repair, or percutaneous mitral valve interventions in selected population."

Patients were classified into two groups: those with moderate or severe MR (msMR) and those with no or mild MR (nmMR). The primary endpoint was a composite of death, disabling stroke, serious bleeding or cardiac arrest. The secondary endpoints included all-cause mortality and the composite of all-cause mortality and heart failure hospitalisation.

It is commonly encountered at older ages and in people with chronic kidney disease. MAC is an important prognostic marker of adverse cardiovascular events and atrial fibrillation, as well as cardiovascular and non-cardiovascular death. When severe it can cause valvular dysfunction including mitral stenosis and/or regurgitation. Aside from effects on mitral valve function, MAC is associated with abnormal compliance of both the left atrium and left ventricle. It is also associated with disruption of normal left ventricular vortex formation and increased energy losses. In combination, these factors may help explain the symptoms of dyspnea and exercise intolerance frequently seen in MAC patients."

A rheumatological panel indicated SLE and APS, which resulted in a diagnosis of Libman-Sacks endocarditis. The patient received treatment with Coumadin and hydroxychloroquine, and a surgical resection of the vegetation was scheduled if the valvular lesions did not resolve within 1 month. However, a follow-up TTE demonstrated near-complete resolution of the masses.
A stroke in a young individual should raise suspicion for Libman-Sacks endocarditis. Due to limited evidence regarding surgical versus conservative management, a multidisciplinary approach is recommended. This case illustrates the successful conservative management of two large vegetations."

Aging disrupts mitochondrial function through impaired oxidative phosphorylation, excessive reactive oxygen species generation, mitochondrial DNA mutations, endoplasmic reticulum stress, mitochondrial enzyme dysregulation, and impaired calcium homeostasis. These alterations drive endothelial dysfunction, arterial stiffening, cardiac remodeling, and ultimately exacerbate age-related cardiovascular decline. Despite extensive research, the precise mechanisms by which mitochondrial aging impairs the function of endothelial cells, vascular smooth muscle cells, and cardiomyocytes remain poorly understood. Therefore, this review synthesizes current evidence on how aging-associated mitochondrial dysfunction contributes to endothelial dysfunction, arterial stiffening and remodeling, and cardiac dysfunction. It also outlines emerging pathophysiological mechanisms linking mitochondrial dysfunction to age-related CVDs, offering insights into potential therapeutic targets to promote cardiovascular health in aging populations. This review highlights key biomarkers of declining mitochondrial function to facilitate early diagnosis of CVD-related mitochondrial dysfunction. We show that aging disrupts key regulators of mitochondrial dynamics and quality control in the vasculature and heart across human studies and preclinical models of aging. Recent evidence indicates that impaired mitochondrial function in aging cardiomyocytes results in valvular degeneration, left ventricular hypertrophy, diastolic dysfunction, atrial fibrillation, and diminished exercise capacity. Therefore, understanding the pathophysiological mechanisms linking mitochondrial dysfunction to cardiovascular aging may guide the development of new therapeutic strategies for mitigating age-related cardiovascular decline in older adults."

We recently extended the indications for HMPs to preoperative patients with tetralogy of Fallot (ToF). Thus, our purpose was to evaluate the current practice of home monitoring for preoperative patients with ToF, emphasizing the early detection of hypoxic spell events and the prevention of preoperative attrition. Furthermore, we sought to identify the risk factors for unplanned urgent operations during the home monitoring period and to evaluate the effects of these unplanned operations on long-term outcomes after repair.
Among 126 consecutive patients born with ToF between January 2020 and December 2021, 100 (59 boys) were enrolled in the preoperative HMP group. The risk factors for unplanned urgent operations during HMP were assessed using Cox regression.
The parents of 1 patient chose to undergo surgery at another hospital. Elective operations were performed in 79 patients (group 1, repair n = 74, systemic-to-pulmonary shunt n = 5) at a median age of 4 months (interquartile range [IQR], 3.5-4.9 months). In contrast, unplanned urgent operations were performed on 20 patients (group 2, repair n = 10, systemic-to-pulmonary shunt n = 10) at a median age of 1.2 months (IQR, 1.1-2.0 months). Risk factors for decreased time to unplanned urgent operations included a smaller pulmonary valve annulus (PVA) Z-score on follow-up echocardiography before surgery (P = .013; hazard ratio, 1.90 per 1 decrease) and lower daily minimum peripheral oxygen saturation (SpO2) (P < .001; hazard ratio, 1.16 per 1% decrease). There were no deaths. Complete repair was eventually performed on all patients (n = 99) at a median age of 4.1 months (IQR, 3.4-5.4 months), with PVA preservation in 95 patients (96%). Freedom from significant pulmonary stenosis or regurgitation at 24 months postrepair was similar between the 2 groups (P = .93).
Patients with preoperative ToF frequently require urgent unplanned operations, especially those with lower daily minimum SpO2 and insufficient postnatal PVA growth."

While previous research has shown that optimal patient selection is crucial for treatment outcomes, recent studies have identified a multitude of factors that independently influence mortality. Although these findings can significantly support clinical decision-making, the large number of available studies renders an overview of this topic challenging. In this review, we provide a comprehensive overview of the currently identified factors associated with increased mortality after TEER. We also summarize the current evidence on published risk scores that stratify mortality risk after M-TEER and T-TEER. We aimed to provide clinical decision-making support for optimal patient selection and referral to TEER and to identify remaining gaps in evidence."

Cardiovascular complications, including arterial wall stiffness, and valvular dysfunction, are major causes of morbidity and mortality. Conventional cardiovascular risk tools are unreliable in MPS, and the role of vascular imaging remains underdefined.
This systematic review evaluated vascular complications in paediatric and adult MPS patients, focusing on carotid intimal-media thickness (CIMT) and functional vascular parameters (e.g. carotid cross-sectional compliance (cCSC), carotid incremental elastic modulus (cIEM), carotid cross-sectional distensibility (cCSD)), to assess their utility for cardiovascular risk stratification.
A systematic search of MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Cochrane Library was conducted (inception-July 2025). Eligible studies reported vascular outcomes in MPS types I, II, III, IV, VI, or VII using imaging or functional measures. Risk of bias was assessed using ROBINS-I for observational studies and RoB 2.0 for the single randomised trial.
Eight studies comprising 224 patients were included. CIMT was consistently increased across subtypes, with adult values frequently observed in childhood, indicating accelerated vascular pathology. Patients demonstrated reduced arterial compliance, increased arterial stiffness, and a high prevalence of mitral and aortic valvular disease. Enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) and haematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) showed partial attenuation of vascular pathology.
CIMT and vascular stiffness are sensitive markers of subclinical vasculopathy in MPS where conventional cardiovascular risk tools may remain unreliable. Standardised vascular imaging and biomarker development are needed to improve risk stratification and long-term outcomes (particularly in adults)."

Advances,"Valvular heart disease (VHD) is a growing contributor to global cardiovascular morbidity, especially in aging populations. As transcatheter therapies expand, assessing enrollment trends and demographic representation is essential for equitable, generalizable evidence.
The purpose of this study was to evaluate temporal trends in trial characteristics and demographic representation, particularly age and sex, in VHD interventional trials from 2000 to 2024.
We conducted a systematic review on VHD intervention trials indexed in PubMed between 2000 and 2024. Trials involving percutaneous or surgical interventions across aortic, mitral, tricuspid, and pulmonic valves were included. Descriptive and nonparametric statistics were used to assess trends in enrollment size, participant demographics, valve type, intervention modality, and trial scope.
A total of 487 trials with 87,412 participants were included; 44.9% were women. Median trial size (z = 4.98; P < 0.01) and participant age (z = 10.08; P < 0.01) increased over time. Trials involving percutaneous (11% to 45%), bioprosthetic (22% to 53%), aortic valve (27% to 62%), and multinational (2% to 16%) interventions increased. Female enrollment did not improve significantly (z = -0.48; P = 0.63) but was higher in mitral (58.9%) and tricuspid (59%) trials, and more common in percutaneous (52%) than surgical (41.7%) studies. A positive correlation was observed between participant age and female representation (ρ = 0.196; P < 0.01).
VHD trials have expanded in scale and scope with increased trial-level mean age. However, persistent sex disparities and demographic variability highlight the need for more inclusive trial designs to guide equitable valve therapy."

Both conditions are strongly age-dependent, and their association is increasingly recognized as more than coincidental. Transthyretin deposits have been identified within stenotic aortic valves, supporting the hypothesis that mechanical stress and shear forces may promote protein misfolding and amyloid deposition. The reported prevalence of ATTR-CM among patients with severe AS ranges from 4 % to 29 %, particularly in those undergoing transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR). Diagnosis remains challenging and a multimodality imaging strategy integrating ECG-echocardiographic discordance, cardiac magnetic resonance with extracellular volume (ECV) quantification, and bone scintigraphy is essential to achieve final confirmation of disease. Newer tools such as the RAISE and GRAM scores and CT-derived myocardial extracellular volume (ECV) quantification enhance screening accuracy in this population. Clinically, even moderate AS may worsen restrictive hemodynamics in ATTR-CM, emphasizing the need for early recognition and individualized management. Contemporary studies suggest that carefully selected patients with dual pathology benefit from TAVR, achieving outcomes comparable to those with isolated AS, especially when patients are initiated on disease-modifying therapies. Future research should clarify the mechanistic link between valve and myocardial amyloid deposition, refine risk stratification, and integrate artificial intelligence to improve early detection and guide combined interventional and pharmacologic strategies."

Severe aortic stenosis (AS) patients are at risk for heart failure and frequently on LDT. We assessed cardiac structure and function, organ congestion, filling pressures, and long-term outcomes of severe AS patients on LDT undergoing aortic valve replacement (AVR).
Consecutive patients with severe AS with [n = 157; median (interquartile range) daily torasemide dose: 10 (5-15) mg] or without (n = 346) LDT undergoing a detailed assessment of congestion (B-type natriuretic peptide, liver enzymes, systematic chest X-ray analysis) and cardiac catheterization before AVR with a post-AVR follow-up of several years were studied.
Despite similar AS severity (indexed aortic valve area 0.41 ± 0.12 vs. 0.43 ± 0.12 cm2/m2) patients with LDT had more advanced biventricular remodeling and dysfunction, higher B-type natriuretic peptide [446 (245-991) vs. 150 (62-317) ng/L; p < 0.001], higher liver enzymes, higher chest x-ray congestion score [2 (1-4.5) vs. 1 (0-2) score points; p < 0.001], and higher mean right atrial pressure (8 ± 4 vs. 6 ± 3 mmHg) and mean pulmonary artery wedge pressure (21 ± 8 vs. 14 ± 6 mmHg; p < 0.001 for both) than those without. After a median post-AVR follow-up of 15 months functional capacity was worse, and estimated systolic pulmonary pressure was higher (37 ± 11 vs. 32 ± 8 mmHg; p < 0.001), and after a median follow-up of 44 months mortality was higher [hazard ratio 2.01 (95% confidence interval 1.17-3.77); p = 0.01] in LDT compared to non-LDT patients.
LDT identifies AS patients with more advanced cardiac remodeling, more severe congestion, unfavorable hemodynamics, impaired post-AVR status, and increased post-AVR long-term mortality."

This study included 240 patients who were diagnosed with cervical spondyosis at our hospital from 2020-2024. Their X-ray images were collected and classified into three categories: normal cervical curvature, straightened cervical curvature, and reversed cervical curvature. The original image data were processed using the YOLO-V3 model for object detection, followed by data augmentation to generate an experimental dataset. On the basis of the ResNet-34 architecture, this study introduces a learnable weight matrix integrated with convolutional operations within the residual blocks to enhance the model's nonlinear representation capability, thereby leading to the construction of the proposed S-ResNet-34 model.
Validation based on the test set indicated that the S-ResNet-34model achieved an accuracy (ACC) of 90.94%, an F1 score of 85.27%, and a recall rate of 85.36%.

This study integrates habitat analysis and 2.5-dimension (2.5D) deep learning (DL) to create an interpretable model using dual-energy computed tomography (DECT) images to enhance the preoperative assessment of muscle invasion status in BCa.
This study retrospectively recruited 200 BCa patients who underwent DECT urography and divided them into a training cohort (n = 140) and a test cohort (n = 60). Quantitative parameters from DECT images were measured, and independent predictors of muscle invasion were identified through stepwise regression analysis to develop a DECT model. Radiomics and 2.5D DL models were constructed using iodine-based material decomposition (IMD) images. Tumors were classified into distinct sub-regions using K-means clustering. Through feature extraction and selection, a traditional radiomics model, a habitat model, four 2.5D DL models, and the integrated model combining above models were developed. The predictive performance of the models was assessed using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis and calibration curve analysis. The SHAP method was utilized to interpret the optimal model and visualize its decision-making process.
The effective atomic number (Zeff) was recognized as an independent predictor of muscle invasion in BCa. The integrated model, combining Zeff, habitat features, and ResNet 101-based DL features (DECT-DLH), represented the optimal model for predicting muscle invasion in BCa. The area under the curve (AUC) using the optima model was 0.981 (95% CI: 0.963-0.998) in the training cohort and 0.874 (95% CI: 0.785-0.964) in the test cohort. Calibration curves validated the model's reliability for clinical applications. Additionally, SHAP elucidated the decision-making processes associated with the model's predicted outcomes.
The integrated model, combining DECT quantitative parameters, habitat features, and 2.5D DL features, enhances the accuracy of preoperative predictions for muscle invasion status in BCa. The SHAP methodology improves the interpretability of decision-making within the model and provides valuable support for clinicians in developing personalized treatment strategies."

Following PRISMA guidelines, a comprehensive electronic search across five databases (PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, Embase, and Scopus Secondary) retrieved 52 articles. After removing duplicates and screening titles/abstracts, 7 full texts were assessed, of which 4 met the inclusion criteria. Studies were eligible if they applied AI algorithms for MB2 detection in CBCT images and reported diagnostic performance outcomes. Data extraction included study design, dataset size, AI model architecture, and diagnostic metrics. Pooled estimates of sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, positive predictive value (PPV), and negative predictive value (NPV) were calculated using a random-effects model. Heterogeneity was assessed with the I² statistic, and publication bias was evaluated with Egger's test.
Four studies were included. AI models achieved a pooled sensitivity of 0.82 and specificity of 0.74. Deep learning models outperformed traditional machine learning, with higher sensitivity (0.87 vs. 0.80), specificity (0.90 vs. 0.68), and accuracy (0.84 vs. 0.75).

This study, which uses four machine learning models (1D Convolutional Neural Network (1D-CNN), Self-Supervised Learning (SSL), Vision Transformer (ViT), and Conformer), elucidates the effects of four preprocessing techniques on the performance of chlorophyll content prediction: Original Reflectance (OR), Continuum Removal (CR), De-trending (DT), and Standard Normal Variate (SNV). Reflectance data were collected from tea leaves (Camellia sinensis) and were analysed using ten-fold cross-validation. Correlation analysis revealed that SNV and DT enhanced the spectral sensitivity to chlorophyll content, particularly around the chlorophyll absorption regions (450-500 nm and 650-700 nm), whereas CR emphasized negative correlation in the visible spectrum. Prediction results demonstrated that the SSL model combined with SNV preprocessing achieved the highest accuracy (R² = 0.82, RPD = 2.37), outperforming other model-preprocessing combinations. The 1D-CNN model performed best with DT, leveraging local spectral features, whereas ViT and Conformer models benefited most from CR, which emphasizes absorption depth and spectral shape. These results highlight that the optimal preprocessing method depends on the model architecture, and that proper pairing between preprocessing and modelling approaches is crucially important for maximizing prediction performance.

This narrative review synthesizes applications reported in the 2022-2025 literature across human, microbial, and viral systems, drawing on peer-reviewed studies as our data source. Representative examples include modeling of SARS-CoV-2 spike and nucleocapsid proteins in virology, assisting cryo-EM interpretation of bacterial ribosomal and membrane-protein complexes in microbiology, and refining conformational hypotheses for human GPCRs in biomedicine. Across these cases, AlphaFold predictions have complemented experimental workflows by accelerating hypothesis generation, improving model fitting within ambiguous density regions (poorly resolved areas of cryo-EM maps), and guiding mutagenesis strategies to probe dynamic conformational states. We also summarize recent method extensions: AlphaFold-Multimer improves multi-chain complex assembly prediction, while molecular dynamics (MD) simulations augment AlphaFold's static models by sampling conformational flexibility and testing stability. Despite these advances, important limitations remain-particularly for intrinsically disordered regions, protein-ligand and protein-cofactor interactions, and very large or transient assemblies-and current community benchmarks indicate that approximately one-third of residues may lack atomistic precision, underscoring uncertainty in flexible or modified segments.

Integrated with an advanced U-Net +  + model and Attention Gates (AG), our method significantly improves lung segmentation accuracy. For lung pathology classification, we integrated DWT in the DenseNet-201 model to differentiate normal lung images from images with tuberculosis, pneumonia, and coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). To address the challenges of limited and variable data, we employed the technique progressive growing generative adversarial network (PGGAN) data augmentation to generate realistic, high-resolution chest X-ray (CXR) synthetic images. This approach not only enriches the training dataset but also provides a nuanced representation of lung pathologies, enhancing the robustness and comprehensiveness of our diagnostic system. Our robust approach demonstrated strong and consistent performance in both segmentation and classification tasks within lung X-ray imaging diagnostics. In segmentation, it achieved on the Japanese Society of Radiological Technology (JSRT) dataset, with metrics such as 99.1% accuracy and 97.2% Dice coefficient, outperforming established methods like U-Net and U-Net +  + . For the classification, it demonstrated notable improvements over DenseNet-201, especially in precision with an increase of 2.4% when data augmentation techniques were employed.

Deep learning (DL) models offer promising potential for automated HFrEF detection, but their effectiveness is often limited in small and imbalanced clinical datasets. In this study, we propose a novel approach to enhance HFrEF detection from echocardiographic videos. We adapt the TimeSformer architecture-a Transformer-based model optimized for spatiotemporal feature extraction in video data-and apply it for the first time in echocardiography. In addition, we introduce a domain-informed left ventricle (LV) masking method using image segmentation to guide model attention toward diagnostically critical regions, boosting overall performance. Our methodology is evaluated both directly on a large-scale benchmark dataset and on a smaller, specialized clinical dataset from our cardiology department after fine-tuning. Experimental results show that the proposed framework yields substantial performance gains: on the benchmark dataset, we observe a 3% improvement in both model accuracy and area under the curve (AUC), while on the specialized dataset, improvements reach 7% in accuracy and 30% in AUC values. Moreover, TimeSformer consistently outperforms conventional approaches after the implementation of fine-tuning and LV masking. These findings highlight a practical and generalizable strategy for improving automated HFrEF diagnosis, with strong implications for clinical decision support in data-scarce healthcare settings."

We aimed to construct a three-dimensional (3D) deep learning (DL) model for the automated segmentation and classification of GBM and SBM based on multiparametric MRI. A total of 314 patients from one medical center and two public datasets were recruited. Tumor segmentation was performed using No-new-UNet (nnU-Net), followed by the development and comparison of 3D DL, 2D DL, and radiomics models for classification. Additionally, three radiologists with varying experience levels conducted a two-round classification analysis, with and without a 3D DL model as a reference. The nnU-Net segmentation of GBM and SBM achieved a Dice score of 0.917 and 0.915 on the training and testing sets. The performance of the 3D DL model, with an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.842, was superior to that of the 2D DL model, radiomics model, trainee radiologist, and experienced radiologist (AUC, 0.687, 0.720, 0.527, and 0.709, respectively) and was comparable to that of expert radiologist (AUC, 0.862). The performance of trainee, experienced, and expert radiologists improved significantly with the 3D DL model than without it as a reference (AUC, 0.724 vs. 0.527, 0.845 vs. 0.709, and 0.911 vs. 0.862, respectively). The MRI-based 3D DL model shows promising performance in automatically segmenting and classifying GBM and SBM. Reading with the 3D DL model improves the diagnostic accuracy of radiologists. Given its promising performance, it has potential for clinical translation as a decision-support tool."

This study was conducted in two parts, using a multitasking learning approach. We developed a cross-sectional vertebral fracture (VF) detection model using abdominal CT scans of 2553 patients aged 50-80 years. Then, we leveraged this detection model within a multitask learning framework to develop a longitudinal VF prediction model over a 5-year follow-up period. External testing was performed on 1506 patients from two independent hospitals. The performance was compared between the single-task and multitask models, bone-only and bone+muscle images, and image-only and clinical models.
For the cross-sectional fracture detection model, the mean age of the patients was 76.2 years, and 66.7% were female. In the classification task for detection of VF, the model using both bone and muscle showed an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) of 0.82 in the development set and 0.80 in the external test sets. Using multitask learning, the bone + muscle image model showed a c-index of 0.68 and had superior performance than the bone-only model in the external test set for 2-year, 3-year, and 5-year AUROCs (0.79 vs. 0.75, 0.71 vs. 0.68, and 0.71 vs. 0.68, respectively, all p < 0.01). Also, the multitask model significantly outperformed the Fracture Risk Assessment Tool (FRAX) (c-index: 0.68 vs. 0.66, p < 0.01).
The CT-based multitask learning model integrating both bone and muscle data showed superior predictive performance for VFs compared with models using bone images only and traditional clinical models.
Question Vertebral fracture risk remains underestimated in many individuals undergoing CT scans for other reasons, highlighting the need for improved opportunistic prediction tools. Findings A multitask deep learning model integrating both bone and muscle features from CT scans demonstrated superior performance compared to bone-only and traditional clinical models, including FRAX. Clinical relevance The proposed model enables accurate vertebral fracture risk prediction using routinely acquired CT scans, facilitating early identification and intervention without the need for additional tests."

However, the inherent flexibility of nucleic acids limits the availability of experimentally determined structures of PDI complexes, posing a significant challenge for training reliable scoring functions (SFs). To address this, we developed PDIScore, a novel deep learning-based SF for PDI prediction. PDIScore utilizes a comprehensive graph representation to capture nucleotide flexibility, employs a scalable GraphGPS architecture with BigBird linear global attention to handle large interaction interfaces, and leverages Mixture Density Networks (MDNs) to model residue-nucleotide distance distributions. PDIScore was trained on a self-collected dataset of ~7000 protein-nucleic acid complex structures and validated on three rigorous test sets for evaluating its screening, docking, and ranking capabilities. The results illustrated that PDIScore significantly outperformed existing methods: it achieved the best screening power on the screening set (e.g., EF1% = 14.13, AUROC = 0.82 using AlphaFold3 structures), the highest docking success rate on the docking set (48.94% top1), and superior ranking capability on the ranking set (PCC = 0.50). Case studies demonstrated PDIScore's ability to elucidate biological mechanisms (e.g., adenovirus transcription, SOCS1 regulation) and its interpretability at the nucleotide level for identifying key interaction sites. PDIScore represents a robust, generalizable tool with significant potential for advancing PDI-related research and therapeutic design."

Therefore, accurate credit risk control is crucial for financial institutions' lending decisions and overall risk management. In this paper, we propose a hybrid machine learning framework (Neural network-Ensemble learning-Reinforcement learning Hybrid Framework, NERHF) for efficient credit risk control. The framework utilizes neural network algorithms to extract features from credit data, enhancing the accuracy and robustness of credit risk prediction. Further, based on the extracted features, ensemble learning algorithms are employed for credit risk prediction. Finally, the improved deep reinforcement learning algorithm Pre-DDQN is applied to generate optimal credit risk control strategies for different combinations of key credit indicators, aiming to mitigate default risks. Experimental results show that NERHF demonstrates significant advantages in credit risk prediction, especially when using recurrent neural networks for feature extraction in conjunction with lightweight gradient boosting machine algorithms.

This review highlights the transformative impact of AI on traditional ECG analysis, detailing how deep learning algorithms are overcoming the limitations of human interpretation and conventional diagnostic criteria. Historically, ECG interpretation has relied on well-established, physiologically-based criteria. The advancement of AI-ECG is marked by its capacity to process complex high-dimensional data directly from raw signals, revealing patterns often missed by conventional methods. Notably, AI models have identified signs of asymptomatic low ejection fraction and paroxysmal atrial fibrillation during normal sinus rhythm, enabling earlier clinical intervention. In addition to improved diagnostic utility, AI-ECG offers promising applications in risk stratification and community screening. Several randomized controlled trials (RCTs) have shown that integrating AI into clinical workflows not only reduces critical intervention times but also identifies patients at elevated risk of adverse outcomes. Future directions involve integrating additional clinical data sources, improving model interpretability through explainable AI, and developing unified platforms to manage outputs from multiple models."

PubMed,deep learning,Detecting mangrove seedlings from UAV imagery using deep learning for restoration monitoring.,Yuri Shendryk; Maria P Vilas,10.1038/s41598-025-30387-6,2025-12-01,Scientific reports,"Mangrove ecosystems are the focus of extensive conservation and restoration efforts due to their critical roles in coastal protection, carbon sequestration, and climate change mitigation. Detecting mangrove seedlings in remotely sensed imagery is essential for evaluating restoration success and prioritizing conservation areas. While seedling detection research has predominantly been conducted in agricultural settings, studies in natural environments remain limited, and no dedicated methods have been proposed for mangrove ecosystems. To address this gap, this study develops a model for detecting mangrove seedlings in ultra-high-resolution UAV imagery (0.85 cm) across 22 seeding sites in the Emirate of Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates. Building on the success of deep learning in crowd counting tasks, the seedling detection model was developed through a two-stage process. In the first stage, Gaussian blurring was applied to seedling locations to generate a density map, which was then predicted from UAV images using an encoder-decoder MaxViT-UNet architecture. In the second stage, the predicted density map was further thresholded using a Difference of Gaussians method to accurately localize individual seedlings. The model achieved variable performance, with a peak F1-score of 0.70 on the validation dataset (precision: 0.65, recall: 0.76). The developed model was also benchmarked against ResNet-DETR, a state-of-the-art object detection framework, and achieved 9% improvement in F1-score. While the developed model shows promising performance in identifying mangrove seedlings, challenges remain, such as labelling inaccuracies, potential inconsistencies in UAV imagery over time, and inherent limitations associated with deep learning methods. Nevertheless, this study highlights the potential of UAV-based deep learning models for accurately detecting mangrove seedlings at scale, providing a powerful tool to support restoration monitoring and inform more effective conservation strategies in mangrove ecosystems."

However, existing studies remain insufficient in terms of system integrity and quantitative operability. Guided by the CIPP evaluation model (Context-Input-Process-Product), this study follows the logical progression of ""context-input-process-output."" Through a combination of literature review, expert interviews, and the Delphi method, an initial set of indicators was developed. The Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) was then employed to determine indicator weights, and a fuzzy comprehensive evaluation approach was integrated to construct the quantitative model. The results indicate that the established system effectively balances process monitoring and outcome orientation, emphasizing university-industry collaboration, authentic learning contexts, and ability transferability, while demonstrating strong interpretability and diagnostic value. The final framework includes 4 primary indicators, 11 secondary indicators, and 68 tertiary indicators. The expert authority coefficients for the two Delphi rounds were 0.840 and 0.845, respectively, with Kendall's coordination coefficients of 0.182 and 0.244. The AHP consistency test yielded CR < 0.1, confirming reliability. Using a sample of 132 students from the 2019 cohort of the Mechanical Engineering program at a ""Double First-Class"" university, model application results showed that 79.6% of students achieved an overall competency level of ""good"" or above. Among the first-level dimensions, the expected values of process evaluation and input evaluation outperformed those of context evaluation and output evaluation, suggesting the need to further strengthen institutional reputation building and graduate quality feedback mechanisms. The findings demonstrate that the proposed indicator system and evaluation model can effectively mitigate ambiguity and subjectivity in competency assessment. It possesses high applicability and promotional value in supporting teaching quality diagnostics, talent training program optimization, and deep university-industry collaboration."

Temporal convolutional network (TCN) decodes spatial correlations in voltage-temperature parameters. Bidirectional gated recurrent units (BiGRU) models performance degradation dynamics. Attention mechanism makes the model focus on the part that contributes the most to the predicted outcome. The improved golden jackal optimization (IGJO) algorithm proposed in this work is employed to optimize the learning rate, L2 regularization parameters, number of BiGRU neurons, and key-value pairs of the attention mechanism in the TCN-BiGRU-Attention hybrid model. Subsequently, the optimized hybrid model is utilized to predict the life of PEMFC. Superior convergence speed and optimization accuracy of the proposed IGJO algorithm are validated through comparative simulations with five intelligent algorithms. Further validation under static and dynamic operating conditions with varying training durations exhibits significantly enhanced prediction accuracy of the IGJO-TCN-BiGRU-Attention algorithm. Under static operating conditions at 577 hours, a 67.78% reduction in root mean square error (RMSE) is achieved compared to TCN. Similarly, under dynamic conditions at 510 hours, a 22.5% RMSE reduction is observed versus TCN."

Kinovea, as an accessible motion-analysis software, provides both visual and quantitative feedback. However, its application in supporting technique development among beginner athletes remains insufficiently explored. Aim: This study aims to describe the use of Kinovea in biomechanics training and examine its contribution to the awareness of kinematic characteristics and movement techniques among beginner athletes. Methods: A descriptive qualitative design involved 72 beginner athletes aged 18–25 years selected through purposive sampling. Data were collected over 16 weeks through interviews, field observations, and motion video recordings analyzed using Kinovea. Kinematic data focused on joint angles, stride behavior, and movement phases during walking, running, and the flight phase. Qualitative data were analyzed using content analysis with NVivo 12, while kinematic results were interpreted descriptively to identify performance patterns and areas for technical refinement. Result: Kinematic analysis showed coordinated joint-angle patterns across all phases. Walking analysis identified arm swing angles of 50.9°–58.8° and leg separation angles of 64.3°–67.2°, indicating a stable gait rhythm. The running analysis revealed knee angles of 68.8°–69.8° and elbow angles of 87.6°–89.1°, indicating efficient propulsive mechanics. The flight phase demonstrated knee angles of 81.2°–87.8° and elbow angles of 80.4°–88.3°, suggesting effective momentum use and postural stability. These measurements supported stride-efficiency assessment and technique evaluation. Qualitative findings revealed that Kinovea enabled athletes to interpret movement phases and identify technical inefficiencies through slow-motion and frame-by-frame visualization. Conclusion: Kinovea supports basic motion analysis by providing clear kinematic information and helping beginner athletes observe and refine their movement techniques. The findings also offer practical value for coaches by enabling more precise identification of inefficient patterns and guiding targeted corrections during early-stage training."

Early detection and risk stratification remain a major clinical challenge. Identifying specific biomarkers could significantly improve risk prediction and disease management. Objective: This study aims to (1) identify novel plasma protein biomarkers for incident AS, (2) establish causal relationships using genetic approaches, and (3) prioritize biomarkers specific to the aortic valve tissue. Methods: We assessed the association between 2,923 unique plasma proteins measured using the Olink Explore assay and AS incidence in 52,632 UK Biobank participants with 487 incident AS cases over a median follow-up of 13 years. Multivariable Cox proportional hazards models were used to evaluate associations adjusted for cardiovascular risk factors. A stratified analysis was performed to investigate the association in men and women separately. For causal inference, we used protein quantitative trait loci (pQTL) Mendelian Randomization (MR). We then verified the aortic valve specificity of the proteins using our transcriptomic dataset of 500 human aortic valves. Using expression QTL (eQTL)-based MR, we evaluated the causal role of gene expression in AS and performed colocalization analyses. Results: Our fully adjusted model identified 55 proteins significantly associated with AS incidence, with GDF15 showing the strongest association (HR=1.93 per SD, 95% CI: 1.67-2.23, P value = 3.3E-19). In sex-stratified analyses, 10 proteins showed a significant association with AS incidence in women, including 5 more strongly associated in women (CD38, CD80, IGFBPL1, NFASC, SERPINA9, P interaction &lt;0.05), whereas 16 proteins were identified in men including 1 protein (REG1A) with a significantly stronger association in men. pQTL-MR suggested a potential causal role for 4 proteins (PCSK9, CHI3L1, NFASC, PRSS8). Transcriptomic integration confirmed high aortic valve expression for 11 candidates, with three genes demonstrating significant associations in aortic valve eQTL MR analyses, including LTBP2, for which the pQTL and eQTL colocalized. Conclusion: The integration of proteomics and genomics allowed the identification of potential biomarkers and drug targets for AS, showing evidence of causality and tissue-specific expression."

CASE SUMMARY We describe a case of an 80-year-old female patient with a history of severe aortic stenosis and hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy that underwent aortic valve replacement and myectomy. The patient presented with acute pulmonary edema and low blood pressure due to LVOTO and SAM post cardiac surgery in the intensive care unit. She was paced with an epicardial dual-chamber pacing system due to complete atrioventricular block and treated initially with norepinephrine, furosemide, and esmolol infusion and continuous positive pressure ventilation. The patient remained hypoxemic and kept deteriorating hemodynamically despite titrating up norepinephrine. The addition of vasopressin infusion and tapering of norepinephrine finally stabilized the patient with significant reduction of LVOTO, confirmed by transthoracic echocardiography assessment, improved oxygenation and increased urine output. CONCLUSION Vasopressin seems to be the preferred vasopressor for managing LVOTO and SAM post-cardiac surgery, because of its absence of inotropic effects. Echocardiography is crucial for early diagnosis and therapeutic management."

We report a 12-day-old male neonate presenting with respiratory distress, edema, and oliguria. Physical examination revealed a grade 2/6 systolic murmur at the left sternal border. Echocardiography identified PFAA with coarctation, IAA, PDA, and an atrial septal defect (ASD), confirmed by cardiac CT. Surgical intervention included aortic arch repair, fifth arch excision, and ASD closure. The postoperative recovery was smooth, and the patient remained clinically well with normal cardiac function during the 1-year follow-up period. This case underscores the critical role of echocardiography in early diagnosis and surgical planning for complex congenital heart disease."

However, the durability of transcatheter heart valves (THV) and the risk of leaflet thrombosis preclude the extension of TAVI in young people. This study sought to formulate a proof‐of‐concept solution for non‐invasive, continuous monitoring of THV function using photoplethysmography (PPG) sensors and machine learning models. An in vitro mock circulatory loop was developed using a compliant aortic phantom and an implanted self‐expanding Evolut FX device. Two PPG sensors were attached to the phantom surface to record flow signals during various hemodynamic scenarios generated by Latin Hypercube Sampling. Endoscopic imaging measurements of the geometric orifice area (GOA) were used to assess valve performance. PPG‐derived metrics and flow variables were used to train regression and classification models that predicted healthy versus decreased leaflet motion. The regression model showed an R 2 of 0.83, RMSE of 7.18 mm 2 , and MAE of 5.58 mm 2 . The classifier correctly identified reduced leaflet motion (95% accuracy, 0.89 precision, and 0.91 recall). This study demonstrates the efficacy of PPG sensors and machine learning for non‐invasive THV monitoring. The approach offers a promising tool for early detection of leaflet dysfunction, thereby improving the management of TAVI patients."

OpenAlex,aortic stenosis,PO:37:256 | Spontaneous renal artery dissection: a subtle presentation of a “vasculitis-mimicker”,,10.4081/reumatismo.2025.2218,2025-11-26,Reumatismo,"Background. Medium- and large-vessel vasculitides represent a diagnostic challenge. The case described here highlights the importance of an accurate differential diagnosis, as non-inflammatory vascular diseases can mimic vasculitic patterns, with significant therapeutic implications. Materials and Methods. A 42-year-old man presented to the emergency department with subacute onset of temporal headache, low-grade fever, left flank pain, and hypertension (BP 170/100 mmHg). Rheumatologic history was unremarkable and physical examination was normal. Abdominal CT, performed for suspected ureterolithiasis, showed a hypodense area in the mid and upper third of the left kidney compatible with parenchymal ischemia, and a sleeve-like thickening with filiform stenosis of the ipsilateral renal artery, initially suggestive of vasculitis (renal arteritis). The patient was admitted to the Rheumatology Unit. Laboratory tests revealed inflammatory activity (CRP 3.7 mg/dL, ESR 51 mm/h). Intravenous methylprednisolone pulses (250 mg for 3 days) were started, followed by oral prednisone (1 mg/kg) and antihypertensive therapy. Given the suspicion of vasculitis, PET imaging was performed, showing no evidence of vascular inflammation, as well as duplex ultrasound of the four limbs and supra-aortic trunks, which revealed no stenotic or occlusive lesions. Considering the abrupt onset of symptoms, negative autoimmunity, negative PET findings, and absence of additional clinical or instrumental abnormalities, a renal arteriography was performed. It revealed a dissection of the left renal artery with thrombosis of the false lumen and parenchymal ischemia, allowing a final diagnosis of spontaneous left renal artery dissection complicated by renal infarction and renovascular hypertension. Results. The case was discussed with the Radiologist and Vascular Surgeon. Given the complete thrombosis of the false lumen, endovascular revascularization was excluded, and a conservative approach was adopted with antihypertensive and antiplatelet therapy, along with progressive steroid tapering, with no clinical relapse. A follow-up contrast-enhanced CT after 15 days confirmed stability of the renal ischemic lesion and improved parenchymal perfusion (Figure 1). Conclusions. Spontaneous renal artery dissection is a rare clinical entity with elusive etiology, accounting for only 1–2% of all arterial dissections. To date, approximately 200 cases have been reported in the medical literature. Our case emphasizes the importance of considering non-inflammatory vascular conditions, such as spontaneous dissection, in all instances where first-line imaging raises a generic suspicion of medium- or large-vessel vasculitis, particularly in cases of isolated vascular involvement and absence of systemic symptoms. A high index of suspicion is required in clinical practice, especially in atypical or subtle presentations, to promptly achieve the correct diagnosis."

Zeiher; Silvia Mas-Peiro; Stefanie Dimmeler; Andreas M. Zeiher,10.1161/jaha.125.044406,2025-11-26,Journal of the American Heart Association,"Clonal hematopoiesis of indeterminate potential (CHIP), defined as the presence of somatic mutations in subjects without other hematologic abnormalities has been recently associated with several cardiovascular diseases. Degenerative aortic valve stenosis (AVS), a prototypical cardiovascular age‐related disorder resulting from calcification and inflammation processes for which no medical treatment is currently available, has become the subject of scientific research in this field. In this review we describe the clinical relevance of CHIP in patients with AVS, as well as its effects on left ventricular dysfunction and heart failure, particularly about compensatory hypertrophy and diastolic dysfunction assessed by echocardiographic parameters. CHIP‐driver mutations DNMT3A and TET2 have been found in a third of all patients with severe AVS undergoing transcatheter aortic valve replacement in most studies; and several short‐term and long‐term studies have reported an increased mortality rate associated with the presence of CHIP in these patients. Additionally, we discuss potential mechanistic insights involving inflammatory pathways both from a clinical and from an experimental approach. These include primarily fluorescence‐activated cell sorting (FACS) analyses or single‐cell RNA sequencing (sc‐RNA‐seq) analyses from circulating leukocytes of patients with AVS, showing an increase in proinflammatory interleukines, and analyses on valve tissue exhibiting higher transcript levels of immunoglobulins, as well as murine models mimicking the consequences of AVS that could shed some light on potential causal link between CHIP and AVS. Lastly, we summarize prospects for novel therapeutic strategies, with efforts focusing on developing both general and more specific inflammatory therapies targeting inflammatory pathways. Future research will need to assess the incidence and progression of milder stages of aortic stenosis and evaluate potential interactions with different types of acquired mutations."

This study aimed to assess whether plasma from patients with AS induces oxidative stress and contributes to valvular endothelial cells (VECs) dysfunction. Methods Human plasma samples were obtained from patients with severe AS (AS+, n=110), patients with cardiovascular risk factors without AS (n=30), and healthy individuals (n=15). Plasma levels of proinflammatory cytokines (IL [interleukin]‐1β, IL‐6, TNF [tumor necrosis factor]‐α, and factor Xa [FXa]) were measured. Porcine aortic VECs were then incubated with plasma (10%, 24 hours). Oxidative stress levels were assessed using dihydroethidium staining, NO formation with 4‐amino‐5‐methylamino‐2′,7′‐difluororescein diacetate, mRNA expression by quantitative reverse transcription‐polymerase chain reaction, and protein expression levels by Western blot analyses. Platelets and monocytes adhesion as well as thrombin generation were determined. Different pharmacological inhibitors were used to explore the underlying pathways. Results Plasma from patients with AS+ exhibited elevated levels of IL‐1β, IL‐6, TNF‐α, and FXa activity. Incubation of VECs with AS+ plasma induced a pro‐oxidant response mediated by proinflammatory cytokines, the angiotensin system‐SGLT2 (sodium‐glucose transport protein 2) pathway, and FXa. AS+ plasma also triggered VEC dysfunction, inflammation, monocytes and platelets adhesion, and thrombin generation. These detrimental effects were mitigated by empagliflozin, losartan, neutralizing antibodies targeting proinflammatory cytokines, and dabigatran and rivaroxaban. Conclusions Patients with AS displayed subclinical systemic inflammation and increased FXa activity. These processes contributed to aortic VEC dysfunction, inflammation, monocytes and platelets adhesion, and thrombin generation upon exposure to AS+ plasma."

Malaysia; Mogaraj Sellapan",10.17576/jsa.2025.1502.04,2025-11-26,Journal of Surgical Academia,"Prostatic artery embolisation (PAE) is a well-established minimally invasive procedure for the management of lower urinary tract symptoms secondary to benign prostatic hyperplasia. In patients with advanced prostate cancer, its primary role has been palliative, particularly for controlling refractory haematuria. However, emerging evidence suggests that PAE may offer additional cytoreductive benefits. We presented the case of an 85-year-old male with advanced prostate cancer and multiple comorbidities, including severe aortic stenosis and stage 4 chronic kidney disease, who developed refractory gross haematuria unresponsive to conservative management. Due to high surgical risk, bilateral PAE was performed via a single right femoral artery access. The procedure resulted in complete resolution of haematuria, allowing early catheter removal. Remarkably, his prostate-specific antigen (PSA) declined from 5.28 ng/mL to 0.45 ng/mL over seven months, in the absence of systemic therapy. The patient remained haematuria-free with improved voiding symptoms. This case highlights the effectiveness of PAE for haemostatic control in advanced prostate cancer and suggests potential cytoreductive effects, evidenced by sustained PSA normalisation. PAE may serve a dual role in symptom control and disease modulation in patients unsuitable for surgery or systemic therapy. Further studies are warranted to explore its oncologic impact."

Pressman,,2025-11-28,PubMed,"Mitral annular calcification (MAC) is an inflammatory process that shares characteristics with atherosclerosis and results in calcium deposition in the fibrous ring supporting the mitral valve. It is commonly encountered at older ages and in people with chronic kidney disease. MAC is an important prognostic marker of adverse cardiovascular events and atrial fibrillation, as well as cardiovascular and non-cardiovascular death. When severe it can cause valvular dysfunction including mitral stenosis and/or regurgitation. Aside from effects on mitral valve function, MAC is associated with abnormal compliance of both the left atrium and left ventricle. It is also associated with disruption of normal left ventricular vortex formation and increased energy losses. In combination, these factors may help explain the symptoms of dyspnea and exercise intolerance frequently seen in MAC patients."

Mochel; Jessica Ward; Joshua Stern,10.20944/preprints202511.2236.v1,2025-11-28,Preprints.org,"Myxomatous mitral valve disease (MMVD) is the most common acquired cardiac disease in dogs and a leading cause of congestive heart failure. Over the past three decades, clinical trials and translational studies have generated a substantial evidence base supporting specific medical therapies, particularly drugs that modulate hemodynamics or target the renin–angiotensin–aldosterone system (RAAS). At the same time, gaps remain in our knowledge, and areas of clinical practice are guided more by expert consensus or extrapolation from human medicine than by robust veterinary data. This review summarizes current evidence for pharmacologic interventions in MMVD, including established therapies such as ACE inhibitors, mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists, diuretics, and inodilators, as well as emerging drug classes such as angiotensin receptor–neprilysin inhibitors and SGLT-2 inhibitors. For each, we highlight the existing data, discuss limitations of prior studies, and note areas where additional research is needed to guide optimal clinical use."

Accurate assessment of regurgitation is challenging and requires a multiparametric, comprehensive approach. TTE remains the primary imaging modality used to evaluate mitral valve structure, determine the severity of regurgitation, and related hemodynamic effects. TEE provides higher-resolution imaging for more detailed anatomical assessment, particularly valuable in surgical planning and transcatheter mitral procedures. The introduction of 3D echocardiography has further improved mitral valve imaging, allowing accurate preprocedural assessment and real-time guidance during structural interventions. Both TTE and TEE play essential and complementary roles in the thorough evaluation of MR. A multiparametric approach ensures accurate characterization of the regurgitation severity."

Intimal sarcoma, a subtype of undifferentiated sarcoma, is characterized by high metastatic potential and poor prognosis. Case Summary: A 23-year-old woman with no prior medical history presented to the emergency department with a 20-day history of progressive palpitations and dyspnea. Initial evaluation revealed tachycardia, hypotension, and a systolic mitral murmur. Laboratory tests demonstrated elevated D-dimer and high-sensitivity troponin I levels. Pulmonary thromboembolism was initially suspected; however, chest CT angiography revealed a left atrial mass, subsequently confirmed by transthoracic echocardiography as a heterogeneous mass causing dynamic mitral obstruction and moderate eccentric mitral regurgitation, with associated right ventricular dysfunction. The patient underwent emergency surgical resection, including removal of the left atrial appendage and partial atrial roof, followed by reconstruction of the interatrial septum. Histopathology confirmed high-grade intimal sarcoma with MDM2 overexpression. Postoperative management included adjuvant chemotherapy (Doxorubicin and Ifosfamide) and planned radiotherapy. Despite early intervention, follow-up MRI five months later revealed cerebral metastases, necessitating neurosurgical resection. Discussion and Conclusion: This case highlights the rapid progression and aggressive nature of cardiac intimal sarcoma, even in young patients with timely diagnosis and multidisciplinary care. Early recognition, prompt surgical intervention, and coordinated postoperative management remain critical to optimizing outcomes in this rare and high-risk disease."

The primary objective of this study was to directly compare structural valve deterioration between porcine and bovine bioprosthetic valves used in mitral valve replacement. Methods A systematic review was conducted following PRISMA guidelines. Studies directly comparing porcine and bovine bioprosthetic valves in MVR were identified through comprehensive searches of Embase, MEDLINE, and Web of Science databases from inception through March 5, 2025. Eligible studies were cohort studies that directly compared bovine and porcine bioprosthetic valves implanted in the mitral position and reported SVD outcomes. The primary exposure was valve type, and the primary outcomes were reports of SVD. Data extraction included patient demographics, valve characteristics, SVD definitions, and modes of SVD. The Newcastle-Ottawa Scale was used for risk-of-bias assessment. Principal analyses involved narrative synthesis. Results Nine studies comprising 6,945 patients (range per study: 240–1,695) with follow-up periods ranging from 3.5 to 15 years were included. Three studies favored porcine valves, two favored bovine valves, and four showed no significant difference in terms of SVD. Porcine valves frequently demonstrated leaflet tearing resulting in acute regurgitation, while bovine valves predominantly exhibited calcification leading to stenosis. Younger patients (&lt; 65 years) generally showed better results with porcine valves. Despite variability across studies, cumulative evidence suggested a trend toward superior long-term durability of porcine bioprostheses. Conclusions Valve selection should be tailored to patient-specific factors, including age, anticipated longevity, clinical risk profile, and religious preference. Future studies should employ standardized definitions and longitudinal follow-up to clarify these findings."

This study aimed to evaluate the influence of PH severity on in-hospital mortality and early outcomes after valve surgery in patients with RHD. Methods In this prospective observational study, 152 patients with RHD undergoing valve surgery were categorized into three groups based on estimated systolic pulmonary artery pressure on echocardiography: no or mild PH (&lt;45 mmHg), moderate PH (45–59 mmHg), and severe PH (≥60 mmHg). The primary endpoint was in-hospital all-cause mortality and major morbidity; the secondary endpoint was 30-day readmission. Results In-hospital all-cause mortality was 3.3% ( n = 5), with no statistically significant difference among severe (4.8%), moderate (3.2%), and no/mild PH (0%) groups ( p = 0.518). ICU stay was significantly longer in patients with severe PH ( p = 0.042). There was no significant difference in mortality based on predominant valve lesion (mitral stenosis or regurgitation) across PH groups ( p = 0.625, p = 0.172). The 30-day readmission rate was 12.5%, with no significant variation across PH categories ( p = 0.194). Conclusion The severity of PH did not significantly impact early postoperative outcomes or in-hospital mortality following valve surgery for RHD. These findings support the feasibility and safety of surgical intervention even in patients with severe PH and provide a critical foundation for future studies in Yemen."

We aimed to investigate how remodelling of the left ventricle and left atrium impacts the mitral annulus size and function in patients with transmural myocardial infarction. Methods In this prospective observational study, patients with ST-elevation myocardial infarction were examined with 3D echocardiography at admission and at 1-year follow-up (n=87). Size and function of the left cardiac chambers and the mitral annulus was analysed. The cohort was divided into groups with (n=16) or without (n=71) mitral annular remodelling, defined as an area increase of 15% or more, from baseline to follow-up. Results During follow-up, the group without mitral annular remodelling had stable volumes and improved function for both the left ventricle and the left atrium. Although the group with mitral annular remodelling also exhibited improved left ventricular function, both left ventricular volume and left atrial volume increased, and no improvement was seen in left atrial emptying fraction or left atrial reservoir or contractile strain. In linear regression analysis, increased mitral annular area at follow-up was associated with change in both left atrial (β=0.025 (0.007, 0.043), p=0.006) and left ventricular volume (β=0.014 (0.003, 0.025), p=0.012). Conclusion Mitral annular remodelling after transmural myocardial infarction is associated with increased volumes of the left ventricle and the left atrium, and absence of atrial functional improvement. Both increasing left atrial and left ventricular volume are associated with mitral annular dilatation, but left atrial volume is the strongest factor."
OpenAlex,mitral regurgitation,Cardiotoxicity is not always the only explanation - a case report,Andreea-Madalina Varvara; Irina Serban; Ruxandra Jurcuţ,10.2478/rjc-2025-0033,2025-11-26,Romanian Journal of Cardiology,"Abstract Cisplatin is a platinum-based chemotherapeutic agent; in fact, it is known as a vasculotoxic agent, but there are some case reports describing mild myocardial dysfunction related to cisplatin-based chemotherapy. Truncating variants in the titin (TTN) gene are rare in cardiomyopathy genes, but they are known to occur more frequently among cancer patients with cancer therapy-induced cardiomyopathy. We present the case of a 54-year-old female who was brought to the emergency room with shortness of breath at mild exertion. Biologically, we noted elevated N-terminal prohormone of brain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) at 5453 pg/mL. Her medical history includes six series of cisplatin-based chemotherapy for invasive cervical carcinoma at 47 years old with subsequent remission. The electrocardiography (ECG) noted sinus rhythm and T-wave inversion in inferior and lateral leads. The transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) revealed a dilated left ventricle with severe diffuse hypokinesia of the walls, an estimated ejection fraction of 15%, systolic dysfunction of the right ventricle, and severe mitral functional regurgitation. Her family history includes her mother being diagnosed with cardiomyopathy and sudden cardiac death (SCD) at 54 years old and a brother with SCD at 34 years old. Furthermore, the systolic dysfunction seems to be caused by more than just the cardiotoxic effects of platinum-based chemotherapy. This, corroborated with the family history, rather advocates for a possible genetic etiology, so we performed genetic testing, which detected a likely pathogenic mutation in the TTN gene (c.64915C&gt;T, p (Arg21639Ter). Additionally, a unicameral implantable cardioverter-defibrillator was considered for primary prevention of SCD. The present case illustrates the importance of baseline cardiac evaluation of the patients receiving cardiotoxic chemotherapy. The identification of genetic risk factors helps us to identify patients at high risk for developing cardiomyopathies secondary to chemotherapy and associated adverse outcomes."
