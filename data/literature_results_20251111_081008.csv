PubMed,aortic stenosis,Conversion to Cardiac Surgery During Elective and Urgent Transcatheter Aortic Valve Implantation: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.,Nikolaos Ktenopoulos; Anastasios Apostolos; Dimitrios-David Chlorogiannis; Ioannis Kachrimanidis; Panayotis Vlachakis; Marios Sagris; Theoni Theodoropoulou; Maria Drakopoulou; Andreas Synetos; George Latsios; Constantina Aggeli; Konstantinos Tsioufis; Konstantinos Toutouzas,10.1002/ccd.70309,2025-11-10,Catheterization and cardiovascular interventions : official journal of the Society for Cardiac Angiography & Interventions,"Transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) has become an established treatment for severe aortic stenosis. However, the need for unplanned conversion to cardiac surgery (CS) during TAVI remains an infrequent but critical event. It is unclear whether this risk is higher in patients undergoing urgent procedures. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to compare the incidence of unplanned conversion to CS between patients undergoing urgent versus elective TAVI. A systematic search of PubMed, SCOPUS, and Cochrane databases was performed to identify eligible studies. The primary outcome was the rate of unplanned conversion to CS. Secondary outcomes included mortality, device success, vascular complications, device embolization, acute kidney injury (AKI), stroke, permanent pacemaker implantation (PPI), moderate-or-severe paravalvular regurgitation (PVL), need for second valve implantation, bleeding, and duration of hospitalization. Seven studies comprising 71,909 patients were analyzed; 5108 underwent urgent TAVI and 66,801 underwent elective TAVI. No significant difference in conversion to CS was observed between the groups (RR: 0.89; 95% CI: 0.65-1.22). Device success rates were similar (RR: 0.99; 95% CI: 0.97-1.00). Urgent TAVI was associated with prolonged hospitalization (mean difference: 7.75 days; 95% CI: 4.06-11.45) and increased AKI risk (RR: 2.20; 95% CI: 1.53-3.16). Vascular complications, device embolization, stroke, PPI, PVL, second valve implantation, and major bleeding rates were comparable between the groups. Urgent TAVI is not associated with an increased risk of unplanned conversion to surgery. The observed higher AKI rates and longer hospital stay suggest that patient-related factors beyond procedural urgency may contribute to adverse outcomes."

To develop and evaluate an artificial intelligence (AI)-augmented clinical program for ATTR-CM detection.
This nonrandomized clinical trial involved constructing an AI model, ATTRACTnet, using electrocardiogram waveforms, echocardiographic measurements, demographics, and diagnosis codes for orthopedic manifestations of amyloidosis. A single-system, multisite, single-arm, open-label trial was conducted to evaluate its real-world performance. The model was trained and validated at a large academic referral site for ATTR-CM with external validation at an academic site. The trial was conducted as a single-system, multisite trial. Patients with left ventricular (LV) wall thickness 12 mm or more and an ATTRACTnet score 0.5 or higher were eligible. Exclusions included prior ATTR-CM testing, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, expected life span less than 1 year, nursing home residence, advanced dementia, or LV wall thickness less than 14 mm explained by uncontrolled hypertension or moderate/severe aortic stenosis.
Eligible patients were notified and offered nuclear scintigraphy testing, monoclonal protein testing, and follow-up care on agreement from the treating physician.
The primary outcome was a diagnosis of ATTR-CM by consensus criteria. ATTR-CM testing positivity was compared with historical and contemporary controls.
ATTRACTnet was developed in an internal test set of 799 patients (mean [SD] age, 75.1 [11.1] years; 516 [64.7%] male and 283 [35.3%] female) using 5-fold cross-validation with an additional external test set of 422 patients. It had good discrimination for ATTR-CM detection with an area under the receiver operator characteristic curve of 0.85 (5-fold cross-validation, 0.77-0.85) in the internal set and 0.82 (95% CI, .81-0.83) in the external test set with similar performance in Hispanic, non-Hispanic Black, and non-Hispanic White patients. A total of 1471 patients were identified with positive AI model scores 0.5 or more during the study period, with 256 eligible patients who met study criteria. Of these patients, 50 underwent amyloidosis testing after physician and patient approval; 24 (48%) were diagnosed with ATTR-CM, and 21 (88%) initiated treatment within 3 months. The positivity rate was more than 2.8 times higher than historical controls (15.3%; 95% CI, 13.1%-17.9%; P < .001), with an 18% relative increase in new diagnoses vs the prior year.
AI-augmented screening may improve ATTR-CM detection and identify patients who are missed by usual care. Prospective randomized trials are needed to determine if outcomes are improved.

A retrospective analysis was performed on 16 cases diagnosed with 1q21.1 deletions and 13 cases with 1q21.1 duplications, employing single nucleotide polymorphism arrays (SNP arrays). This study encompassed an examination of ultrasound abnormalities, parental verification, pregnancy outcomes, and postnatal follow-up data.
The deletions fragment sizes of the 16 deletion cases ranged from 1.30 Mb to 2.18 Mb, with the overlapping region located at 146.5 Mb to 147.5 Mb. The fragment sizes of the 13 duplication cases ranged from 0.87 Mb to 3.87 Mb, with the overlapping region located at 146.5 Mb to 147.0 Mb.  Among the 16 fetuses with deletions, eight exhibited ultrasound-detected abnormalities. Specifically, three fetuses had urinary tract malformations, four were diagnosed with fetal growth retardation, three displayed lateral ventricle enlargement, and one had aortic stenosis. Notably, Case 12 demonstrated a unique presentation of complex multi-organ malformations, including fetal growth retardation, absence of the right kidney, micrognathia, and lateral ventricle enlargement. Of the 13 fetuses with duplication, six were found to have ultrasound abnormalities, including four fetuses with cardiovascular malformations, one fetus with fetal growth retardation, one fetus with widened posterior fossa, and one fetus with widened lateral ventricle. Case 22 is particularly special, as the fetus has complex cardiac malformations, including pulmonary stenosis, aorta displacement, and ventricular septal defect.
This study suggests that fetuses with prenatal 1q21.1 deletions may be associated with malformations of the urinary system, whereas those with 1q21.1 duplications are likely associated with cardiac malformations. Nonetheless, both genetic conditions demonstrate a lack of phenotypic specificity. For fetuses diagnosed with 1q21.1 deletions or duplications who present with a normal phenotype prenatally, it is essential to conduct close monitoring of their neurodevelopmental trajectory postnatally."

Case reports,"Coronary ostial stenosis (COS) is a rare but potentially fatal complication following the Bentall-De Bono procedure.
A 59-year-old man with prior Bentall-De Bono surgery along with venous graft reconstruction presented 8 years later with heart failure. Coronary computed tomography angiography demonstrated venous graft ostial stenosis, and cardiac magnetic resonance confirmed a transmural infarction with impaired ventricular function. Given the complex coronary anatomy and limitations to percutaneous treatment, the Heart Team opted for urgent surgical revascularization.
COS after aortic root replacement results from multifactorial mechanisms, including surgical trauma, excessive tension, kinking, or fibrosis related to adhesives, whereas venous graft stenosis adds further complexity. Diagnosis is often challenging because coronary angiography may underestimate the disease while coronary computed tomography angiography and cardiac magnetic resonance offer superior anatomical and functional assessments, enabling accurate detection and guiding timely revascularization.
COS represents an uncommon yet life-threatening complication of aortic root replacement. Advanced multimodal imaging is pivotal to precise diagnosis and therapeutic guidance. Prompt, tailored revascularization strategies are essential to improving clinical outcomes."
PubMed,aortic stenosis,Your CT scans are hiding crucial TAVI survival data: Are you looking?,Marek Kantor; Otakar Jiravsky; Matej Pekar,10.1016/j.ahjo.2025.100649,2025-12,American heart journal plus : cardiology research and practice,"Transcatheter Aortic Valve Implantation (TAVI) has revolutionized treatment for severe aortic stenosis, but optimal patient selection remains challenging. This commentary highlights findings from our recent systematic review of 14 studies comprising 9692 TAVI patients, which revealed that CT-derived adipose tissue parameters provide valuable prognostic information often overlooked during procedural planning. We found that higher subcutaneous adipose tissue consistently associated with better survival, while adipose tissue quality, measured by CT attenuation, proved equally important. The relationship between adiposity and outcomes appears U-shaped rather than linear, with both extremely low and high adiposity quartiles correlating with worse outcomes, while moderate subcutaneous adiposity provides optimal outcomes by offering metabolic reserves without pathological complications. Notably, fat distribution patterns (VAT:SAT ratio < 1) were associated with better cardiovascular outcomes, underscoring that where fat is stored matters more than total quantity. The obesity-dependent effects of visceral adipose tissue reflect fundamental differences in metabolic physiology: in non-obese patients, modest VAT represents protective energy reserves, while in obese patients, lower VAT indicates relatively better metabolic health within the context of existing obesity. These adipose tissue characteristics are readily available in pre-procedural CT scans already used for anatomical assessment, requiring minimal additional resources while potentially enhancing risk stratification. We present a novel decision algorithm with sex-specific thresholds that enables immediate clinical implementation of these measurements for patient risk stratification. As TAVI indications expand to include both increasingly frail elderly patients and those at intermediate surgical risk, integrating these overlooked adipose tissue parameters into clinical decision-making could improve patient selection and outcomes."
PubMed,aortic stenosis,Unilateral pulmonary edema after minimally-invasive redo-double valve replacement procedure-case report.,Dan Wang; Jia Yang; Haibo Ren,10.3389/fcvm.2025.1662660,2025,Frontiers in cardiovascular medicine,"This case report describes a patient with a history of mechanical aortic and mitral valve replacements who developed prosthetic valve stenosis years later and underwent a minimally invasive, thoracoscopic-assisted double valve re-replacement. Postoperatively, the patient developed a rare but life-threatening re-expansion pulmonary edema (RPE), which led to severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), with rapid deterioration into refractory hypoxemia. Despite comprehensive conventional supportive management-including lung-protective ventilation, diuresis, anti-inflammatory therapy, and other measures-adequate oxygenation could not be maintained. Venovenous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (VV-ECMO) was emergently initiated. With ECMO support, the patient's lungs were able to rest and recover. After 10 days of support, ECMO was successfully discontinued, and the patient eventually recovered and was discharged. This case aims to explore the pathophysiological mechanisms of RPE, management strategies for complications following minimally invasive cardiac surgery, and to emphasize the critical role of VV-ECMO in treating refractory respiratory failure, as well as the importance of multidisciplinary team (MDT) collaboration."
PubMed,aortic stenosis,A Case of Severe Aortic Stenosis Mimicking Acute Coronary Syndrome: Diagnostic Challenges and Surgical Management.,Waleed Abdelraheim; Mohamed Ghonem; Atef Ghoneim; Mohamed Abdelaal,10.7759/cureus.94040,2025-10,Cureus,"Chest pain with elevated troponin and ECG changes often prompts a diagnosis of acute coronary syndrome (ACS). However, this presentation can mask other critical pathologies. We report a case of a 52-year-old male who presented with exertional chest discomfort and progressive dyspnea. Initial workup, including troponin elevation and lateral ST-segment depression, led to a presumptive diagnosis of ACS. However, further imaging revealed severe aortic stenosis (AS) secondary to a bicuspid aortic valve (BAV), with a significantly dilated ascending aorta. Intraoperatively, an annular abscess was discovered beneath the right coronary cusp, confirming a missed diagnosis of infective endocarditis (IE). The patient underwent a successful Bentall procedure with aortic root and valve replacement. This case illustrates the diagnostic challenge posed by overlapping cardiovascular pathologies and emphasizes the importance of thorough evaluation in patients with atypical ACS presentations, particularly when structural heart disease is suspected."
PubMed,aortic stenosis,Profound Hypokalaemia and Functional Weakness Secondary to Gastric Outlet Obstruction: A Rare Case.,Abimbola Aduroja; Kwerinuchi T Kejeh,10.7759/cureus.94015,2025-10,Cureus,"We present the case of a 44-year-old male patient with a known history of pyloric stricture secondary to peptic ulcer disease who was admitted with quadriparesis, vomiting, and chest pain. He had a background of multiple endoscopic dilatations for gastric outlet obstruction and was severely malnourished at presentation. Clinical findings included markedly low serum potassium, phosphate, and magnesium, elevated creatine kinase, and ECG changes suggestive of myocardial strain. High-sensitivity troponin was also elevated, prompting evaluation for acute coronary syndrome and aortic dissection. Imaging ruled out structural cardiovascular pathology, and a diagnosis of type 2 myocardial infarction was made, likely secondary to electrolyte imbalance and volume depletion. Despite correction of electrolyte abnormalities, the patient's neuromuscular weakness persisted, prompting neurologic evaluation and spinal imaging to exclude Guillain-Barré Syndrome and compressive pathology. MRI spine was unremarkable. Over the course of his intensive care admission, the patient received central electrolyte replacement, cautious nutritional rehabilitation, and multidisciplinary input from neurology, cardiology, gastroenterology, and dietetics. As electrolyte levels improved, so did his neurological function, and he regained significant muscle strength. He was subsequently transferred to the gastroenterology ward, where further endoscopic assessment confirmed ongoing pyloric narrowing. Given his history of multiple unsuccessful dilatations and persistent symptoms, he was referred to surgical services for consideration of a definitive gastrojejunostomy. This case highlights the importance of considering gastrointestinal causes of profound electrolyte disturbances and the potential for these metabolic abnormalities to mimic primary neuromuscular or cardiac pathologies. It also underscores the critical role of multidisciplinary collaboration in managing complex cases involving metabolic, nutritional, and functional decline. Early recognition and a systematic approach to diagnosis and treatment can prevent complications, improve outcomes, and avoid unnecessary interventions."

We report a 88-year-old woman who developed a Stanford type A AAD 14 days after transcatheter aortic valve implantation with a balloon-expandable valve. Although the patient was initially discharged without complications, she later presented with chest discomfort. A scheduled computed tomography scan incidentally revealed an AAD originating at the sinotubular junction, where the valve frame contacted calcified tissue. Consequently, a surgical repair was performed. In this case, postoperative down-titration of antihypertensive agents and dual antithrombotic therapy (aspirin and edoxaban) may have contributed to the progression of the intramural hematoma and dissection. Although delayed AAD has been predominantly reported in association with self-expanding valves, this case highlights that multiple factors can contribute to AAD with balloon-expandable valves. Therefore, patients with AAD risk factors should be closely monitored."

However, a fully automated pipeline for aortic stenosis (AS) analysis remains largely unexplored. This study aimed to develop a DL framework to streamline clinical AS assessment.
A total of 499 AS studies (1,996 echocardiographic view) were selected from 17,436 cases of patients with valvular heart diseases (VHDs) obtained from three hospitals to form training (n=302), validation (n=76), and internal testing (n=121) datasets, while a prospectively collected set of 3,278 consecutive echocardiograms served as a real-world test data set. The DL framework automatically classified echocardiographic views, detected the presence of AS, and employed two algorithms to assess severity: multiview and single-view.
The DL model achieved high performance in AS detection in the prospective test dataset, with an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.942. The correlation between DL-graded metrics and manual measurements was excellent for aortic valve (AV) peak velocity (r=0.94; P<0.001), mean peak gradient (r=0.91; P<0.001), left ventricular outflow tract diameter (LVOTd) (r=0.81; P<0.001), AV velocity-time integral (VTI) (r=0.94; P<0.001), LVOT VTI (r=0.88; P<0.001), and AV area (r=0.87; P<0.001). Based on these metrics, the AUC of severe AS was the highest at 0.976 [95% confidence interval (CI): 0.953-1.0], significantly superior to those for moderate AS (AUC =0.907) and mild AS (AUC =0.874). The two-dimensional parasternal long-axis view method yielded comparable AUCs for all AS severities (AUC: 0.869-0.920).
The proposed DL algorithm has the potential to automate and enhance the efficiency of clinical workflows for AS screening and grading in echocardiography."

Mild AS is often asymptomatic with a favorable prognosis, whereas symptomatic severe AS progresses rapidly and carries high mortality. Although conventional echocardiography typically uses left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) to assess left ventricular (LV) systolic function, its sensitivity in detecting subclinical myocardial damage in AS patients remains limited. In this study, we used real-time 3-dimensional (3D) automatic left atrial quantitative (RT-3D Auto LAQ) technique to evaluate left atrial (LA) function in severe AS patients with preserved ejection fraction, investigate the diagnostic efficacy of LA functional parameters for this condition, and identify the positive predictors of concurrent heart failure symptoms.
A total of 56 patients admitted to the Fourth Affiliated Hospital of Harbin Medical University who were diagnosed as having severe AS with ejection fraction ≥50% were included as the case group and divided into subgroups A and B according to New York Heart Association (NYHA) cardiac function classification. Subgroup A comprised NYHA cardiac function class I and II, subgroup B comprised NYHA cardiac function class III and IV, and an additional 56 age- and gender-matched healthy patients were selected as the control group. The parameters of the case group and the control group, subgroups A and B were recorded and compared, and the parameters were statistically analyzed. The factors associated with the development of grade III and IV heart failure in patients with severe AS with predicted ejection fraction retention were determined by plotting the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve and logistic regression analysis.
ROC curve analysis: the ROC curves of LA emptying rate parameters and strain parameters showed that the area under the curve (AUC) of left atrial storage period strain (LASr) and left atrial expansion index (LAEI) in predicting NYHA III and IV in patients with severe AS with preserved ejection fraction was relatively large, which were 0.855 and 0.778, respectively. The cutoff values were 16.5% and 97%, respectively. The sensitivity was 76.7% and 80%, respectively. The specificity was 80% and 65.4%, respectively, and the Youden index was 0.575 and 0.454, respectively. Logistic regression analysis: among the LA volume, emptying rate parameters, and strain parameters, LASr and LAEI were positive predictive factors for severe AS patients with preserved ejection fraction for the development or presence of class III and IV heart failure.
Application of the real-time 3D Auto LAQ technique confirmed impaired LA three-phase function and volume enlargement in severe AS heart failure patients with preserved ejection fraction. Among the LA emptying rate parameters and strain parameters, LASr and LAEI correlated with the development of class III or IV heart failure."
PubMed,aortic stenosis,Prognostic Value of Pericoronary Adipose Tissue Attenuation After Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement in Patients With Aortic Stenosis and Obstructive Coronary Artery Disease.,Tingting Hu; Shuangxiang Lin; Xinfa Ding; Xinhong Wang; Jianzhong Sun,10.31083/RCM40045,2025-10,Reviews in cardiovascular medicine,"This study aimed to examine the prognostic value of pericoronary adipose tissue (PCAT) attenuation at three months after transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) in patients with aortic stenosis (AS) and obstructive coronary artery disease (CAD).
This retrospective study included 226 patients with both obstructive CAD and AS who underwent TAVR. PCAT attenuation was measured three months post-TAVR using coronary computed tomography angiogram (CCTA) images. Univariable and multivariable Cox regression analyses were conducted to evaluate the association between PCAT attenuation and major adverse cardiac events (MACEs).
Of the 226 patients, 37 experienced MACEs during a median follow-up period of 1.5 years. High PCAT attenuation was significantly associated with MACEs (-65.3 Hounsfield units (HU) vs. -71.6 HU; p < 0.01). The optimal PCAT attenuation threshold of -67.5 HU, determined by receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis, showed 84% sensitivity and 75% specificity (area under the curve (AUC) = 0.88) for predicting MACEs. Multivariable Cox regression confirmed that higher PCAT attenuation was independently associated with an increased risk of MACEs (hazard ratio (HR) = 1.83, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.44-2.32; p < 0.01). Inclusion of PCAT attenuation increased the C-index from 0.41 to 0.82 (p = 0.01) and the net reclassification improvement (NRI) by 0.55 (95% CI: 0.34-0.78; p = 0.01).
PCAT attenuation was independently associated with the risk of MACEs in post-TAVR patients with obstructive CAD and AS, suggesting the potential utility of PCAT attenuation for risk stratification."

Conduction block requiring permanent pacemaker (PPM) implantation remains a common complication post-TAVR. This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to clarify perioperative (≤30-day) predictors of PPM implantation.
A systematic search was performed using the PubMed, Web of Science, and Embase databases to gather all relevant studies examining the relationship between TAVR and pacemaker implantation outcomes within 30 days of the procedure. Pooled odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated using a random-effects model.
A total of 82 studies comprising 124,808 patients were included. The overall incidence of PPM implantation within 30 days post-TAVR was 17.5%. Key baseline risk factors included right bundle branch block (RBBB) (OR, 5.48; 95% CI, 4.52-6.64) and first-degree atrioventricular block (AVB) (OR, 2.30; 95% CI, 1.82-2.90). Baseline left bundle branch block (LBBB), mitral annular calcification, and male sex were not significantly associated with PPM implantation. A longer membranous septum (MS) length was associated with a reduced risk (OR, 0.78; 95% CI, 0.66-0.93). Additionally, procedural risk factors included greater implant depth (OR, 1.20; 95% CI, 1.13-1.28), the use of self-expanding valves (OR, 2.59; 95% CI, 2.06-3.27), and balloon predilation (OR, 1.37; 95% CI, 1.10-1.71). The cusp overlap technique (COT) significantly reduced PPM risk (OR, 0.45; 95% CI, 0.35-0.58). Furthermore, a greater difference between MS length and implantation depth (ΔMSID) was inversely correlated with PPM implantation risk (OR, 1.36; 95% CI, 1.22-1.50), and post-TAVR new-onset LBBB was a strong predictor of PPM implantation (OR, 2.26; 95% CI, 1.66-3.07).
This meta-analysis identified key perioperative predictors of PPM implantation following TAVR. RBBB, first-degree AVB, increased implant depth, self-expanding valves, and predilation all have been shown to increase PPM risk, whereas COT and lower ΔMSID are protective factors.

Once regarded as rare and elusive, CA is now recognized as a significant cause of heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF), arrhythmias, and valvular disease, especially in older patients. CA is characterized by extracellular deposition of misfolded protein fibrils, which infiltrate the myocardium and disrupt the structural and electrical integrity. Although CA can stem from multiple amyloid types, transthyretin amyloidosis (ATTR) and light-chain (AL) amyloidosis are the predominant subtypes with cardiac involvement, each carrying distinct implications for prognosis and therapy. This review explores CA as a clinical reality often obscured by more common cardiovascular syndromes. Moreover, this review focuses on the varied presentations of CA in real-world practice, how the condition overlaps with HFpEF, the subtle clues for CA amid common valvular disorders, and the complex rhythm manifestations of the condition. Particular attention is given to thromboembolic risk, microvascular dysfunction, and the evolving paradigm of preclinical or asymptomatic amyloidosis management. Furthermore, this review addresses contemporary challenges such as financial toxicity and the cost-effectiveness of screening, emphasizing the benefits of early detection and therapy. The paper also discusses risk stratification and staging, drawing from validated models to guide both prognosis and treatment decisions, and the role of histopathological characterization. Thus, this review underscores the importance of timely recognition and tailored intervention in transforming CA from a terminal diagnosis into a manageable chronic condition."

Elevated Lp(a) contributes to lipid accumulation, vascular inflammation, and plaque instability, primarily through oxidized phospholipids that promote monocyte adhesion and foam cell formation. Genetic studies have identified variants in the LPA gene as major determinants of Lp(a) levels, with higher concentrations consistently associated with adverse cardiovascular outcomes. Intravascular imaging techniques, such as optical coherence tomography and intravascular ultrasound, along with coronary computed tomography angiography (CCTA), have confirmed strong correlations between elevated Lp(a) and increased plaque burden, lipid-rich necrotic cores, and thin fibrous caps. In addition to coronary involvement, Lp(a) is implicated in systemic atherosclerosis, contributing to peripheral artery disease, cerebrovascular disease, and calcific aortic stenosis. Although conventional lipid-lowering therapies exert minimal effects on Lp(a), novel treatments such as proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 inhibitors and RNA-targeted agents offer promising approaches to mitigating Lp(a)-mediated risk. This review summarizes current insights into the pathophysiological role of Lp(a) in HRP formation and progression, integrating evidence from genetic, mechanistic, and imaging studies, while highlighting emerging therapeutic strategies. Nonetheless, continued research is essential to enhance our understanding of Lp(a)-driven plaque vulnerability and to inform precision-targeted cardiovascular prevention."

Studies have demonstrated that ""left atrial strain"" serves as a predictive marker for adverse cardiovascular events in diseases such as heart failure with preserved ejection fraction, moderate aortic stenosis, and diastolic dysfunction. Therefore, this study used exercise stress echocardiography (ESE) to identify high-risk factors in the early stages of HCM.
A total of 142 HCM patients, diagnosed at the Sichuan Provincial People's Hospital in Chengdu, China, between 2017 and 2018, were included, along with 80 age- and gender-matched normal controls. ESE was employed to examine all subjects, and a 5-year follow-up of the HCM patients was conducted. HCM patients were classified into positive event and non-event groups based on follow-up results. Comparisons were made between the groups, focusing on left atrial reservoir strain, conduit strain, contractile strain, left ventricular global longitudinal strain at rest and peak exercise, and strain reserve.
(1) Significant impairments in global longitudinal strain (GLS), left atrial reservoir strain (LASr), and reserve function were observed in the positive events group: the resting (R) 4D and 2D GLS (R_4D_GLS: -13.20 ± 3.35; R_2D_GLS: -17.13 ± 3.71), and peak (P) 2D GLS (P_2D_GLS: -14.45 ± 3.51) were reduced (p < 0.05), accompanied by deteriorated GLS reserves (Δ2D_GLS: -2.68 ± 2.78; Δ2D_GLS %: -13.57% ± 18.89%; p < 0.05). The resting 2D and 4D left atrial (LA) reservoir strain at end-diastole (R_LASr_ED: 14.36 ± 5.52; R_4D_LASr: 10.30 ± 3.24) and peak 2D LASr (P_LASr_ED: 12.18 ± 5.71) were significantly impaired (p < 0.05), with a notable loss in reserve capacity (ΔLASr_ED: -2.18 ± 4.03; ΔLASr_ED %: -14.19% ± 27.85%; p < 0.05). (2) Correlations: positive events demonstrated strong correlations with R_4D_LASr (r = -0.67), R_LASr_ED (r = -0.58), P_LASr_ED (r = -0.61), and P_2D_GLS (r = 0.58). The positive events showed a weak linear association with the rest left ventricular outflow tract pressure gradient (R_LVOT-PG)(r = 0.35) and an ""inverted U-shaped"" relationship with the peak left ventricular outflow tract pressure gradient (P_LVOT-PG). (3) Logistic regression and collinearity analysis showed that the R_4D_LASr (odds ratio (OR) = 0.655, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.547-0.783) and P_2D_GLS (OR = 1.383, 95% CI 1.142-1.675) were independent predictors for positive events.
ESE provides critical information to predict risk factors in HCM patients: R_4D_LASr and P_2D_GLS have independent predictive values for positive cardiovascular events, which can assist in clinical assessment and the identification of high-risk HCM patients, promote individualized and precise risk stratification of HCM in clinical practice, and improve long-term prognosis."

An overview of age-specific treatment pathways from first diagnosis of severe VAS is lacking.
To assess patient journeys and outcomes after severe pediatric VAS diagnosis, by describing its clinical course and treatment trajectories based on a 37-year single-center experience.
Baseline and time-related data of children diagnosed with severe congenital VAS between 1985 and 2022 were retrospectively collected. Time-related death (Kaplan-Meier estimator) and intervention occurrence (Aalen-Johansen estimator) were analyzed.
245 children (73.1 % male, median age: 1.2 years (IQR:0.1-7.0)) were diagnosed with severe VAS (53 aged <30 days, 74 between 30d-1y, 84 between 1y-12y, 34 between 12y-18y). Median survival follow-up was 23.3 years (IQR:10.3-31.2) (99.0 % complete). Thirty-five-year incidence of death after diagnosis was 16.2 %(95 %CI:9.7-22.2 %). Of 245 patients, 211 patients (86.1 %) underwent an intervention and 34 (13.9 %) did not undergo an intervention. Of these 34 children, 7 children showed time-related Doppler gradient regression to mild-or-moderate VAS and 17 had stable severe VAS. These 24 children experienced a 6.0 % incidence of death at 30-years after diagnosis. The most common intervention over time (47.5 %) was balloon valvuloplasty, especially in neonates and infants, followed by aortic valve replacement (37.5 %), especially in older children.
This study highlights the vast heterogeneity of treatment pathways and outcomes in children diagnosed with severe VAS at different ages. The observed stabilization of severe VAS or regression of the serial peak Doppler gradient to mild-or-moderate VAS without symptoms in 24 children highlights the need for better insight into determinants of disease course."

The study aims to understand the role of mature adipocytes in AS and their association with histologic, clinical, and echocardiographic data, an area previously overlooked in AS research. We enrolled 25 patients (15 women and 10 men) with severe AS undergoing elective aortic valve replacement. Each patient underwent clinical and transthoracic echocardiographic evaluations before surgery. We obtained AS valves and left ventricular (LV) septal biopsies to assess the presence of adipocytes within the valve using perilipin 1 (PLIN1) immunohistochemistry, and we also examined other histological characteristics of the ventricular biopsies. Adipocytes were detected in 76% of the aortic stenotic valve samples, often grouped adjacent to calcified areas. Patients with higher values of PLIN1 valvular adipocytes were generally older (p = 0.06) and had lower BMI values (p = 0.06). Moreover, the group with a higher presence of PLIN1(+) valvular adipocytes had significantly decreased mean gradient values and reduced M1 macrophage infiltration in ventricular biopsies. In a binary regression analysis, only mean gradient was significantly associated with the presence of PLIN1(+) adipocytes in the valve, regardless of age, BMI and ventricular M1 macrophage levels. These preliminary findings suggest that valvular adipocytes could be related to the progression of AS, but more investigation is necessary."

Fractional flow reserve (FFR) may yield unreliable results due to altered coronary hemodynamics, leading to discordance with non-hyperemic indices. Women with AS develop distinct myocardial remodeling patterns that may predispose to coronary microvascular dysfunction. We investigated whether sex influences the diagnostic performance and agreement of invasive physiological indices in severe AS.
This prospective single-center study enrolled 221 patients with severe AS and intermediate coronary stenoses. We performed comprehensive physiological assessment of 416 vessels using FFR, instantaneous wave-free ratio (iFR), and quantitative flow ratio (QFR). Discordance in the detecting significant ischemia was defined using standard thresholds (FFR ≤ 0.80, iFR ≤ 0.89, QFR ≤ 0.80). Multivariable logistic regression identified predictors of discordance.
Among 130 women and 91 men with similar angiographic disease severity, women demonstrated systematically weaker correlations between all physiological indices. FFR/iFR concordance was significantly lower in women (90.2% vs. 96.1%; p = 0.021). Discordance was predominantly FFR-negative/iFR-positive (9.8% in women vs. 3.9% in men). Female sex independently predicted FFR/iFR discordance (OR 2.70; 95% CI: 1.03-7.04; p = 0.043), along with smoking status and percent diameter stenosis. No FFR-positive/iFR-negative cases occurred.
Female sex is an independent predictor of FFR/iFR discordance in severe AS, manifesting exclusively as the FFR-negative/iFR-positive pattern. This finding suggests sex-specific differences in coronary microvascular function that may influence revascularization decisions. Recognition of these differences might be important for optimal management of coronary disease in severe AS."

In 153,312 participants, a higher Life's Essential 8 (LE8) score was independently associated with decreased CAVS risk (HR/SD: 0.72, 95% CI: 0.68-0.76, P < 2E-16), while a higher genetic risk score was independently associated with increased CAVS risk (HR/SD: 1.63, 95% CI: 1.54-1.71, P < 2E-16). Restricted cubic spline revealed approximately linear negative associations between LE8 score and CAVS risk across all genetic risk groups. Although no multiplicative interaction was found between cardiovascular health (CVH) and genetic risk, significant additive interaction was identified (CAVS, Relative excess risk due to interaction: 3.77, 95% CI: 1.30-8.50). Among participants with high genetic risk, those with ideal CVH had a lower 10-year cumulative CAVS incidence rate than those with poor CVH (0.33% vs. 1.80%, P < 0.001). Besides, a significant multiplicative interaction was observed between LE8 score and age (P value = 0.007). Similar trends were also observed for early-onset and late-onset CAVS. In conclusion, regardless of the genetic risk group, the higher LE8 score was associated with lower CAVS risk in an approximately linear pattern. In particular, high genetic risk and poor CVH had a synergistic effect on CAVS risk, meaning that participants with high genetic risk and poor CVH would amplify their CAVS risk. Therefore, early and sustained optimization of CVH, particularly among those with high genetic risk, is essential to mitigate CAVS and its subtypes risk."

Established treatments of HOCM include beta-blockers, calcium channel blockers, surgical myectomy, and alcohol septal ablation (ASA); however, elderly patients with a high surgical risk or an unsuitable coronary anatomy have limited therapeutic options. Transcatheter edge-to-edge repair (TEER) has been widely adopted in the treatment of MR, and emerging evidence suggests it could alleviate SAM-related LVOT obstruction. However, clinical research on octogenarians with HOCM is limited.
We report the case of an 83-year-old woman with a history of HOCM, hypertension, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, who presented with progressive dyspnea and chest tightness despite optimal medical therapy. Echocardiography revealed severe asymmetric septal hypertrophy, significant SAM, dynamic LVOT obstruction with a peak gradient of 233 mmHg during the Valsalva maneuver, and severe MR originating from the A2-P2 segment. Surgical risk assessment revealed a EuroSCORE II of 9.5% and a Society of Thoracic Surgeons score of 10.2%. Given the absence of suitable septal perforator arteries for ASA and the prohibitive surgical risk, the heart team performed TEER with the MitraClip™ system. A single narrow translational range (NTR) clip was deployed at the A2-P2 position under three-dimensional transesophageal echocardiography guidance, resulting in immediate MR reduction (from severe to mild), SAM resolution, and a decreased resting LVOT gradient to 81 mmHg. Her hemodynamics improved markedly, with left atrial pressure dropping from 55 to 25 mmHg. The patient was discharged with a New York Heart Association classification of I-II. At the 8-month follow-up, she remained asymptomatic, MR was mild, and her LVOT gradient had further decreased to 20 mmHg.
TEER is a safe and effective therapeutic alternative for elderly HOCM patients with severe MR and SAM-related LVOT obstruction in whom surgical myectomy or ASA is unsuitable. This case showed sustained symptomatic and hemodynamic improvement at the mid-term follow-up, supporting further research on the use of TEER in this high-risk population."

Cardiac involvement, known as Fabry cardiomyopathy, may rarely present with left ventricular outflow tract (LVOT) obstruction, which is often refractory to pharmaceutical therapy and may require septal reduction therapy (SRT). Herein, we report the first clinical experience of transapical beating-heart septal myectomy (TA-BSM), a novel SRT procedure, in treating severe LVOT obstruction secondary to Fabry cardiomyopathy.
Four genetically confirmed FD patients with symptomatic LVOT obstruction underwent TA-BSM between October 2022 and September 2024. The cohort comprised two males with classic early-onset FD and two heterozygous females with predominantly cardiac involvement. Preoperative assessments included clinical evaluation, echocardiography, cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) imaging, and genetic testing. TA-BSM was performed via a small apical puncture without cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB), under transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) guidance. Repeated resections were performed intraoperatively to optimize LVOT gradient, mitral regurgitation (MR), and systolic anterior motion (SAM). All procedures were technically successful without perioperative complications; all patients were discharged in a stable condition on postoperative day 7. At a mean follow-up of 12±8.8 months, all patients showed significant symptomatic improvement, with New York Heart Association (NYHA) functional class improving from III/IV to I/II. Echocardiography during follow-up revealed marked reductions in LVOT gradient (from 111.0±44.3 to 26.5±8.3 mmHg), MR grade (from ≥3+ to ≤2+), SAM grade (from ≥2 to ≤1), and septal thickness (from 26±4.1 to 18±3.9 mm).
TA-BSM appears to be a feasible and effective therapeutic option for Fabry cardiomyopathy patients with severe LVOT obstruction refractory to medical therapy. These preliminary findings support the potential role of this novel, minimally invasive SRT technique in this rare patient population."

This study aimed to quantify the influence of TEER devices on PISA geometry and EROA calculation using patient-specific computational fluid dynamics (CFD) models and to develop a correction approach for the more accurate assessment of residual mitral regurgitation.
For 38 patients undergoing TEER, individualized CFD models for post-TEER mitral regurgitation were constructed based on the multimodal fusion of cardiac computed tomography (CT) and three-dimensional transesophageal echocardiography. The distance from the midpoint of the mitral regurgitation orifice to the TEER device (recorded as D) was measured. The TEER devices were then removed from the CFD models. The PISA radius with and without the TEER device was measured, and the corresponding EROA1 and EROA2 were calculated. The EROA correction coefficient (CC) was calculated as follows: CC = EROA2/EROA1.
A total of 49 CFD model sets of post-TEER for mild-or-greater residual mitral regurgitation were constructed, with 57 sets of PISA. According to the relative position of PISA and the TEER device, four types of PISA were observed: Type 1 included PISA located far from the TEER device (15 cases; CC: 0.93±0.07); Type 2 included PISA adjacent to the TEER device (37 cases; CC: 0.65±0.10); Type 3 included PISA inside the TEER device (3 cases; with CCs of 1.81, 2.72, and 1.06, respectively); and Type 4 included PISA between two TEER devices (2 cases; with CCs of 0.30 and 0.31, respectively). In Types 1 and 2 PISA, D and CC were significantly correlated (R=0.88; P<0.001), and the calculation of EROA could be corrected with the following formula: CC = 0.52 × D + 0.53.
Individualized CFD models can be used to assess the impact of TEER devices on PISA. For types 1 and 2 PISA, CCs based on echocardiography data can be applied to reduce or eliminate the influence of TEER devices on the calculation of EROA."

These complications span a spectrum of presentations, from early-phase structural disruptions such as ventricular septal rupture, papillary muscle rupture with acute mitral regurgitation (MR), and left ventricular free wall rupture (LVFWR), to later-stage manifestations, including true ventricular aneurysms and pseudoaneurysms. While surgical intervention has traditionally been considered the standard of care, surgical intervention is often associated with prohibitive risk in hemodynamically unstable or frail patients. In this context, transcatheter approaches have gained traction as viable, less invasive alternatives, offering the potential for hemodynamic stabilization, symptom relief, and improved short-term outcomes in selected patients. Nonetheless, data from observational studies and registry-based analyses remain limited, underscoring the need for further research. This review synthesizes the current evidence base and clinical experience related to transcatheter management of mechanical complications after MI, emphasizing patient selection, procedural strategies, device selection, and reported outcomes."

Cardiovascular Imaging,"In patients with ventricular functional mitral regurgitation (VFMR) undergoing transcatheter edge-to-edge repair (M-TEER), the prognostic significance of the ratio between mitral regurgitant volume and left atrial volume (LAV) remains unclear. This ratio may reflect the proportional or disproportionate burden of regurgitation on the left atrium. To address this gap, we aimed to investigate the association between the regurgitant volume (RVol)/LAV ratio and clinical outcomes in patients with VFMR, using data from a multicentre prospective registry.
We calculated the RVol/LAV ratio from baseline transthoracic echocardiograms. The median value of the RVol/LAV ratio was 0.40. A total of 1830 patients who underwent M-TEER were allocated into two groups: the low RVol/LAV (RVol/LAV ratio <0.40) and high RVol/LAV (RVol/LAV ratio ≥0.40) groups. The primary endpoint was heart failure hospitalization.Eight hundred eighty-eight and 942 patients were included into the low RVol/LAV ratio and high RVol/LAV ratio groups, respectively. The median follow-up period was 508 days. At three years after repair, 215 (37.6%) and 187 (32.1%) patients in the low RVol/LAV and high RVol/LAV groups, respectively, were hospitalized for heart failure. The patients in the low RVol/LAV group demonstrated a significantly higher risk of heart failure hospitalization than did those in the high RVol/LAV group (hazards ratio, 1.25; 95%confidence interval, 1.03-1.52; p = 0.022). Furthermore, using multivariable Cox regression analysis, the low RVol/LAV was an independent predictor of the primary endpoint.
The RVol/LAV ratio might serve as a valuable metric for improving risk stratification in patients with VFMR."

Data from all patients undergoing M‑TEER procedures at 154 hospitals in the German mandatory quality assurance registry in 2020 were analyzed. The observed IHM was adjusted against the expected mortality predicted by the German MKL-KATH score (O/E) and EuroScore II (O/E2). Regression analyses and volume quartile analyses were performed on hospital volume (HV), IHM rate, O/E, and intra-hospital complications. Additionally, binomial analysis was performed to verify results.
A total of 5099 patients (age 77.9 ± 2.5 years, mean EuroScore II 17.9 ± 5.9%) underwent M‑TEER procedures during the study period. The mean observed IHM was 1.79 ± 3.4%. Neither unadjusted nor risk-adjusted IHM was related to HV in linear regression (adjusted p = 0.56) or logistic regression (p = 0.515) analyses. The IHM rates for the first and fourth quartiles were nearly identical (p = 0.842). Any selected volume cut-off could not differentiate between hospitals with unacceptable (> 95th percentile O/E of all hospitals), acceptable (O/E ≤ 95th percentile), or better-than-average quality (O/E < 1). A caseload cut-off of 30cases per year would exclude 83 hospitals with acceptable or 72 with better-than-risk-adjusted quality (54% and 47% of all hospitals, respectively).
Hospital volume is an imprecise surrogate for assessing the quality of hospitals performing M‑TEER. The association between HV and IHM in patients undergoing elective M‑TEER in Germany was weak and not consistent across various analytical approaches. Other instruments may be more suitable for identifying hospitals with critical performance levels."

A retrospective analysis encompassing 198 patients with suspected PH-LHD, admitted from July 2010 through December 2023, was executed. Patients were divided into Cpc-PH and Ipc-PH/No-PH groups based on RHC in accordance with the 7th World Symposium on Pulmonary Hypertension criteria for PECS model construction. Chi-square and L1-regularized backward elimination refined predictive indicators. Model efficacy and stability were appraised via receiver operating characteristic and 5-fold cross-validation.
The PECS model, incorporating a suite of indicators including valvular heart disease, left atrial systolic diameter, interventricular septal thickness, mitral valve E/Em ratio, left ventricular fractional shortening, and tricuspid regurgitation velocity, demonstrated good predictive performance, achieving an area under characteristic (AUC) of 0.761 (95% CI: 0.692-0.823, P < 0.001).

Cardiovascular evaluation revealed aortic valve stenosis and mitral insufficiency, reflecting systemic disease burden.The patient's spinal interventions preceded regulatory approval of nitisinone for AKU in the European Union, a disease-modifying therapy with potential to modify disease progression. This case underscores the importance of distinguishing AKU from inflammatory spondyloarthropathy and highlights the need for early diagnosis and interdisciplinary care."

While extensively studied in adults, its evolution from childhood remains underexplored. This study aimed to evaluate morphological changes in MVP from paediatric to adult age and their association with MR progression using transthoracic echocardiography (TTE).
This retrospective single-centre study included 53 patients with confirmed MVP diagnosed in childhood and followed up into adulthood (mean follow-up 9 ± 5 years). Each patient had at least two TTEs, and echocardiographic parameters were assessed and indexed for body surface area and height. The presence and progression of mitral annulus disjunction (MAD) were also analysed.
At baseline, the mean age was 8.13 ± 3.25 years; at final follow-up, 18.45 ± 6 years. MAD was present in 60% of patients at both TTEs, while 13% developed MAD over time. Indexed MVP morphological parameters, including leaflet length, annular diameter, and MAD distance, remained stable from childhood to adulthood. However, the severity of MR increased over time and was associated with changes in multiple mitral valve parameters, rather than a single feature. No significant arrhythmic events or implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) implantations were recorded.
MVP-related structural changes remain morphometrically stable when indexed for growth, yet MR severity can worsen due to a combination of morphological alterations. MAD can be identified in paediatric patients and may develop over time. These findings support the view that MVP may encompass different phenotypes and potentially represent a form of cardiomyopathy."

To examine the association of MR grade and the risk of ischemic stroke (IS) in AF patients with heart failure (HF).
We investigated 2748 patients with known AF who were hospitalized due to acute decompensated HF. All patients underwent echocardiography during hospitalization. Patients were divided into groups based on the degree of MR (high-grade MR [3-4] vs. no/low-grade MR [0-2]). The primary endpoint was IS during long term follow-up.
Mean age was 79 ± 11 years, 48% were women. After 2 years of follow-up, the cumulative incidence of IS among patients with high-grade MR was significantly lower compared to patients with no/low-grade MR (6% vs. 12%, respectively; P-value = 0.0064). Multivariate Fine and Gray analysis, adjusting for CHA₂DS₂-VASc, and accounting for the competing risk of death and valve intervention, showed the presence of high-grade MR was associated with a significant 50% (P = 0.013) reduction in the risk of IS compared with no/low-grade MR. When added to the CHA₂DS₂-VASc score, MR grade allowed more accurate prediction of IS with an overall improvement of 12% (95% confidence interval 5-17%) using net reclassification index analysis.
Our findings suggest an inverse correlation between MR grade and the risk of stroke among AF patients with HF. These findings may be used for improved risk assessment in this population."

Associations between these cardiac abnormalities and the ADPKD genotype or disease severity remain poorly defined. We investigated the prevalence and associations of valvulopathies and LVH with renal function, renal size, systemic features and genotype in ADPKD.
This retrospective, single-centre study analysed 154 adult ADPKD patients. Data included echocardiography (LVH, valvulopathies), abdominal ultrasound (renal diameter), cranial magnetic resonance imaging, estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) and genetic testing (PKD1/PKD2 mutations) in 87 patients. Associations were assessed using appropriate statistical tests including logistic regression for multivariable analysis.
Aortic regurgitation was associated with larger mean renal diameter (P = .027) and lower eGFR (P < .001). However, when adjusted for gender and age the associations are no longer significant. Interventricular septal thickness correlated positively with renal diameter (r = +0.32, P < .001) and negatively with eGFR (r = -0.39, P < .001). Left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH, prevalence 30%) was significantly associated with PKD1 mutations (PKD1 non-truncating versus PKD2 adjusted P-value = .011; PKD1 truncating versus PKD2 adjusted P-value = .011), independent of hypertension, age, sex and anaemia (adjusted OR 8.5, P = .008). Mitral valve prolapse was associated with truncating PKD1 mutations (P = .007), independent of hypertension, age, sex and anaemia (adjusted OR 3.950, P = .037). No associations were found with hepatic, pancreatic or intracranial cysts/aneurysms.
This study demonstrates an independent association between LVH and PKD1 mutations and links aortic regurgitation with renal disease severity in ADPKD. These findings highlight genotype-phenotype correlations that may help stratify cardiovascular risk and inform personalized management in ADPKD."

Safe and effective transcatheter options are needed for these patients.
To evaluate the safety and effectiveness of the Tendyne Transcatheter Mitral Valve System in symptomatic patients with mitral disease due to severe MAC.
The SUMMIT-MAC study is the first prospective clinical trial designed to assess the use of the Tendyne system for severe MAC. All patients had severe MAC with significant mitral valve dysfunction and were at high surgical risk. An echocardiography core laboratory performed independent assessments of mitral disease. Adverse events were adjudicated by an independent clinical events committee. The primary endpoint was freedom from all-cause mortality and heart failure hospitalization (HFH) at 12 months post-index procedure.
Overall, 103 patients (78.0±6.5 years; 55% women) with severe MAC and mitral regurgitation (MR) or stenosis underwent treatment with Tendyne. MR was present in nearly all patients at baseline (i.e., 97% of patients with grade >2+). Technical success was achieved in 94.2%, with a 30-day mortality of 6.8%. The primary endpoint was met - freedom from all-cause mortality and HFH was 60.4% at 12 months (performance goal: 43%; p=0.0002) Heart failure symptoms improved significantly (NYHA Class I/II, 30.6% vs. 87.5%, paired baseline vs 12 months; p<0.0001) and quality-of-life improved significantly (mean paired increase in the Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire overall summary, 18.7±24.4 points; p<0.0001).
In this first report of the primary outcomes of the SUMMIT-MAC clinical trial, transcatheter mitral valve replacement with Tendyne led to successful treatment of mitral valve disease due to MAC and significant improvements in heart failure symptoms and quality-of-life."

This study aimed to evaluate the clinical significance of MR reduction and TMPG elevation in patients with functional mitral regurgitation (FMR) after M-TEER.
A total of 2,360 FMR patients were evaluated using postdischarge echocardiography after M-TEER. The relationship between TMPG and outcomes was assessed using spline analysis and group-based comparisons. Based on residual MR severity and TMPG, patients were categorized into 5 groups to assess the prognostic impact of postprocedural hemodynamics: MR ≤ mild and TMPG <5 mm Hg (n = 1,702), MR ≤ mild and TMPG ≥5 to <10 mm Hg (n = 164), moderate MR and TMPG <5 mm Hg (n = 361), moderate MR and TMPG ≥5 to <10 mm Hg (n = 71), and MR > moderate or TMPG 10 mm Hg (n = 62). The primary endpoint was all-cause death or heart failure hospitalization.
The 2-year primary endpoint event rates increased progressively with higher TMPG, from 25.0% at 1 mm Hg to 47.0% at 6 mm Hg. In multivariable analysis, TMPG per 1 mm Hg increment was independently associated with the primary endpoint (HR: 1.10; 95% CI: 1.02-1.17; P = 0.008). Using MR ≤ mild as the reference, moderate MR was not linked to higher risk, whereas MR > moderate remained a significant predictor of primary endpoint. The patients with MR ≤ mild and TMPG <5 mm Hg had the lowest incidence of the primary endpoint among the 5 groups (28.4%, 39.0%, 33.0%, 43.7%, 48.4%; P < 0.001). However, event risk was not significantly different between patients with moderate MR and TMPG <5 mm Hg and those with MR ≤ mild and TMPG <5 mm Hg (HR: 1.13; 95% CI: 0.92-1.41; P = 0.24). Failure to achieve MR ≤ mild and TMPG <5 mm Hg was associated with larger left atrial volume index, greater effective regurgitation orifice area, elevated baseline TMPG, and old-generation G2 device use.
In patients with FMR, elevated TMPG was consistently associated with higher risks of the primary endpoint. Mild or moderate residual MR with low TMPG was associated with more favorable prognosis, suggesting that balancing MR reduction and TMPG may help refine risk stratification after M-TEER.

However, these studies were limited by small numbers with low generalizability.
Danish nationwide registries were used to identify patients with first-time E. faecalis BSI from 2010 -2021 without previous colorectal neoplasia (CRN). Age-, sex- and calendar-matched comparators from the general population was identified (1:5). We estimated the six-month cumulative incidence of CRC and CRN and a multivariable adjusted Cox analysis was used for relative comparison between groups.
We identified 4,664 patients with E. faecalis BSI (median age: 74.9 years, 73.4% males) and 23,320 comparators from the general population. For patients with E. faecalis BSI the six-month incidence of CRC was 0.45% (95% CI: 0.28-0.72%) and of CRN 2.34% (95% CI: 1.88-2.88). For matched comparators the incidence of CRC was 0.12% (95% CI: 0.08-0.17) and of CRN 0.48% (95% CI: 0.39-0.57). In adjusted analysis, patients with E. faecalis BSI had a higher HR of CRC (HR=3.70 (95% CI: 1.91-7.19) and CRN (HR=4.64 (95% CI: 3.40-6.34) than matched comparators. The six-month mortality was 36.3% in patients with E. faecalis BSI while this was 1.7% among comparators.
In patients with first-time E. faecalis BSI the six months incidence of CRC was around 0.5% and 2.3% for the diagnosis of CRN, which were 3-4 times higher than in a matched cohort from the general population. Nevertheless, the absolute risks do not justify systematic screening for CRC or CRN in patients with E. faecalis BSI."

In normal humans, contrast (microbubbles) commonly appears in the left heart following agitated saline contrast injection into a systemic vein via intrapulmonary (IP) shunting. The aim of this study was to determine whether this phenomenon also occurs in dogs.
Forty-eight dogs with either a normal echocardiogram or trivial to mild mitral regurgitation were studied. A standard ASCE protocol was used, with each dog lying in right lateral recumbency.
Left heart contrast was identified in 37 dogs (77%).
Agitated saline contrast echocardiography was performed only once per dog and under a single condition, and intra-operator and interoperator variability was not assessed. Echocardiography alone cannot completely exclude patent foramen ovale, and stress in the hospital environment may have influenced shunting.
Left heart contrast following ASCE is common in dogs without a right-to-left shunting intracardiac defect. This presumably occurs via intrapulmonary arteriovenous anastomoses."

A one-dimensional reduced-order Navier-Stokes model (ROM) simulated aortic pulse pressure under various physiological conditions. Phenome-wide association studies (PheWAS) were conducted to link aortic traits to diseases using electronic health records (EHR). Significant associations were identified between aortic pulse pressure and conditions like aortic aneurysms, heart valve disorders, hypertension, and obesity. Notably, pulse pressure-but not aortic diameter-was also linked to diseases such as diabetes mellitus, wheezing, and chronic airway obstruction. The ROM-simulated pulse pressure showed not only previously recognized associations with diseases such as aortic aneurysm and hypertension, but also associations with conditions affecting organs outside the aorta. ROM hemodynamic simulations can be applied to thoracic images at the scale of thousands of patients. The ROM-simulated pulse pressure showed not only previously recognized associations with diseases including aortic aneurysm and hypertension, but also other diseases outside the aorta."

This report describes a 3-month-old male and a 7-month-old female presenting with microcephaly, dysmorphic facial features, developmental delay, hypotonia, congenital heart defects, abnormal kidney ultrasound, and abnormal cranial MRI findings. The male exhibited left ventricular noncompaction (LVNC), while the female also had abdominal distension and chronic constipation. Whole-exome sequencing (WES) was employed to identify the causative variants. A systematic review of MRXS34 clinical phenotypes was also conducted. WES revealed a novel maternally inherited Xq13.1 hemizygous deletion, encompassing exons 6-13 of the NONO gene in the male, and a recurrent de novo heterozygous c.344G>A (p.Arg115His) variant in NONO in the female. The latter demonstrated extreme X-chromosome inactivation (XCI) skewing. To date, 33 unrelated male cases of MRXS34 have been documented, and 27 NONO variants, have been identified worldwide. The phenotypes in our patients overlap with those previously reported or closely resemble those of MRXS34. Macrocephaly, corpus callosum anomalies, and LVNC exhibit relatively high penetrance but tend to worsen with age. Additionally, dysplastic pulmonary valve/pulmonary hypertension and recurrent chronic constipation episodes may be integral to an alternative NONO-related disorder. This study expands the phenotypic and allelic diversity of NONO-related disorder by providing further genotype-phenotype correlations from two additional cases. The co-occurrence of a NONO variant with extreme XCI skewing likely underpins the pathogenicity of this rare female case, which presents with severe phenotypes akin to those seen in male patients with MRXS34."

While this important public health problem has been well described in Western countries, available data from Eastern Europe are quite limited. Our study set out to describe this particular patient profile and its background, the clinical course of IE in this population, and evolution during and after hospitalization in a major infectious disease hospital in Bucharest, Romania. Methodology We reviewed the patient records of 57 people who inject drugs (PWID) admitted with IE between August 2019 and July 2025. Clinical, microbiological, and outcome data were collected and analyzed using standard descriptive statistics. Results The patients were mostly young men with a median age of 34 years. Most of these patients used heroin and other psychoactive substances and faced severe chronic co-infections: 63% were human immunodeficiency virus-positive, and 98% had hepatitis C. Most patients presented to the hospital with fever, malaise, and respiratory symptoms. Echocardiography confirmed valvular vegetations in over 90% of cases, most frequently on the tricuspid valve. Blood cultures were positive in 70%, most often revealing Staphylococcus aureus bacteriemia. More than half had embolic complications, 30% needed intensive care, and a quarter were candidates for cardiovascular surgery. The median hospital stay was 28 days, while mortality remained high at 17.5% during hospitalization and 35% at one year. Conclusions IE among PWID represents a life-threatening illness, particularly affecting young adults with multiple infections and comorbidities who are additionally burdened with social challenges. Despite prolonged hospitalizations and intensive care, their short- and long-term outcomes remain unfavorable."

The literature strongly links MASLD to increased epicardial fat thickness, left ventricular hypertrophy, and valvular calcifications. The effects of Lactobacillus casei and Chlorella vulgaris microalgae on MASLD prevention are good. NF-kB, Nrf-2, and cardiac tissue structural alterations in C57BL/6 mice produced MASLD were studied.
Forty adult male C57BL/6 mice were allocated to five groups: control (CTL, standard chow), MASLD (high fat diet for 6 weeks), MASLD + Chlorella vulgaris (150 mg/kg), and MASLD + Lactobacillus casei (108 CFU/ml). Oral gavage needle-treated mice for 35 days. After blood drawing, dissection, and preparation, heart tissue stereology was assessed. Real-time RT PCR was used to analyze NF-kB and Nrf-2 gene expression, and calorimetric methods were used to measure SOD, GPX, catalase, TAC, MDA, and LDH enzyme activity. NF-kB gene expression, ALT, LDH, AST enzyme activity, MDA concentration, left ventricle volume, cardiomyocyte volume, connective tissue volume, and capillary length increased significantly (p < 0.05).

Congenital heart disease,"Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) is a rare, progressive disorder characterized by pulmonary vascular remodeling, increased pulmonary vascular resistance, and ultimately right ventricular failure. Despite therapeutic advances, delayed diagnosis and imprecise risk stratification remain key challenges. Artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) offer opportunities across the care continuum. This includes early detection from electronic health records, electrocardiography and imaging, automated, standardized interpretation of echocardiography, computed tomography (CT), and cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) potentially expediting referral and final diagnosis. Deep learning applied to echocardiography achieves expert-level PAH classification and provides automated right-heart quantification while CT/CMR-based models segment the heart and great vessels, quantify lung disease radiomics, and infer hemodynamics, supporting noninvasive triage and prognostication. In future, remote monitoring with wearables and telemedicine, coupled with AI analytics, promises to enable proactive management and potentially reduce hospitalizations. While early studies are promising, translation to practice requires rigorous external validation, prospective studies, bias auditing and seamless integration into guideline-aligned workflows. Overall, AI stands to augment expert clinical judgement by converting high-dimensional, multimodal data into actionable insights. With careful governance and evidence generation, AI has the potential to shorten time-to-diagnosis, refine risk stratification, and personalize therapy in PAH, ultimately improving outcomes for this high-risk population."

Quality of care & clinical outcomes,"GLP-1 receptor agonists (GLP1-RAs) lower cardiovascular risk in type 2 diabetes (T2D), but their impact in patients with valvular heart disease, including those undergoing transcatheter aortic-valve implantation (TAVI), remained unexplored.
We evaluated clinical outcomes with GLP-1 RA use post-TAVI in patients with T2D.
We conducted a retrospective cohort study using the TriNetX network, including 25,184 adults (≥18 years) with T2D who underwent TAVI (2015-2023). Patients were stratified based on GLP1-RA initiation within 14 days post-TAVI. Baseline characteristics, comorbidities, medications, and laboratory data were balanced using 1:1 propensity score matching (PSM). Cox models estimated hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for events from one-month post-TAVI until most recent follow-up.
PSM yielded 1,101 patients per group, with a mean age of 73 years and 39% female. Mean follow-up duration was 2.2±1.1 and 2.6±1.8 years for GLP1-RA users and non-users, respectively. GLP1-RA use was also associated higher survival probability (HR 0.708 [95% CI, 0.583-0.859]), and lower rates of all-cause hospitalization (HR 0.790 [95% CI, 0.706-0.885]), major cardiovascular events (HR 0.849 [95% CI, 0.749-0.963]), and acute heart failure exacerbation (HR 0.785 [95% CI, 0.677-0.909]), acute kidney injury (HR 0.843 [95% CI, 0.719-0.988]), and major kidney events (HR 0.665 [95% CI, 0.510-0.866]). No differences were observed in acute myocardial infarction, cerebral infarction, or cardiac arrest.
In patients with T2D undergoing TAVI, GLP1-RA use are associated with significant survival benefits and improved cardiorenal outcomes. However, these findings are limited by the observational design, high comorbidity burden, lack of data on medication compliance and specific cause of death. Prospective trials are warranted to confirm these benefits."

This review outlines the complex interplay of traditional, transplant-specific, and recipient- and donor-related risk factors that sustain a high cardiovascular burden post-transplantation. While kidney function restoration reduces uremic toxins and improves cardiometabolic parameters, new challenges arise from immunosuppressive therapies, persistent hypertension, post-transplant diabetes mellitus, and chronic inflammation. Common cardiovascular complications include coronary artery disease, heart failure, valvular disease, peripheral artery disease, and refractory hypertension. Risk stratification tools and guidelines often fail to account for transplant-specific variables, resulting in suboptimal management. Although some pharmacological strategies and careful antihypertensive regimens show promise, most evidence is extrapolated from non-transplant populations due to the lack of dedicated randomized controlled trials. Emerging therapies like SGLT2 inhibitors, GLP-1 receptor agonists and non-steroidal mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists hold potential but require further validation in this population. Moreover, sex disparities persist in access to transplantation and in post-transplant outcomes, with men generally experiencing higher cardiovascular risk but women potentially facing greater relative mortality.

However, the characteristics and outcomes between AFDAS and KAF have not been well studied. We aimed to further explore the clinical characteristics and long-term functional outcomes between AFDAS and KAF.
We retrospectively analyzed acute ischemic stroke patients admitted to our hospital between 2010 and 2017, who was also diagnosed with AF. The poor outcome was defined by the combination of death and any disability as scored by the modified Rankin Scale (mRS) score at 3 months and 12 months.
Among the final sample of 698 patients, 370 (53%) were classified into KAF and 328 (47%) were AFDAS. Compared to KAF, patients with AFDAS had a lower prevalence of hypertension (P = 0.01), previous stroke (P = 0.02), higher prevalence of valvular heart disease (P = 0.02), less prescribed with anticoagulants during the hospitalization (P < 0.01), and higher mortality at 3 months (OR 1.77, 95%CI 1.07-2.92, P = 0.03). Patients with AFDAS had an increased trend of mRS score compared to KAF (3 months, OR 1.37, 95% CI 1.04-1.81, P = 0.02; 12 months, OR 1.32, 95%CI 1.01-1.75, P = 0.04).
Patients with AFDAS had a higher risk of death and an increased trend of mRS score compared to KAF. Lower utilization of anticoagulation may be a major reason of worse outcome in AFDAS. Further investigation is required to identify whether the differences of the outcomes between AFDAS and KAF is confounded by pre-existing anticoagulation."

Classic psychedelics have shown promise in treating various mental health disorders. This study evaluated the feasibility and tolerability of an 8-week regimen of microdosed lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) as a treatment for major depressive disorder in an open-label phase 2A trial (LSDDEP1). Nineteen participants (15 male), most of whom were taking an antidepressant medication (n = 15), took 16 doses of LSD (8 μg initially, then 6-20 μg twice weekly at home), with the first dose administered in the clinic. We assessed tolerability through withdrawal rates due to adverse events and feasibility by clinic visit attendance. Safety measures included adverse events, blood laboratory tests, electrocardiography (ECG), and echocardiography. Depression was measured using the Montgomery-Åsberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS). No serious or severe adverse events and clinical alterations in safety measures were observed, being this the first study to evaluate valvulopathy after repeated psychedelic administration in humans. One participant withdrew due to experiencing anxiety when dosing; all scheduled clinic visits were attended. MADRS scores were reduced by 59.5 % at the end of the intervention and were sustained for up to six months. Improvements were also noted in anxiety, rumination, stress, and quality of life. While limited by an open-label design and small sample size, this study provides preliminary evidence supporting the safety and feasibility of treating moderate depression with microdosed LSD and underscores a need for further randomised controlled trials.

Asia,"Rheumatic heart disease remains the most common valvular heart disease in Asia and often leads to severe calcification of the valve leaflets. However, the causes of calcification and the factors influencing the prognosis of surgical patients are not yet clearly understood.
This study aimed to explore the impact of plasma high-density lipoprotein (HDL) levels on the formation of rheumatic mitral valve calcification and the surgical prognosis.
This retrospective cohort study included 847 patients who underwent mitral valve surgery for rheumatic heart disease at the Beijing Anzhen Hospital from January 2016 to December 2022. Patients were divided into a high HDL group (n = 413) and a low HDL group (n = 434) based on preoperative HDL levels.
Among 847 surgical patients (median follow-up 44.1 months), Kaplan-Meier analysis revealed that the high HDL group had higher mid-term survival (P = 0.018) and lower major adverse cardiovascular events risk (P = 0.005). Multivariate Cox regression confirmed HDL as independent risk factor for major adverse cardiovascular events (HR: 0.370; 95% CI: 0.220-0.620; P < 0.001), whereas other traditional lipid markers, including low-density lipoprotein (HR: 0.82; 95% CI: 0.54-1.23; P = 0.328) and triglycerides (HR: 0.65; 95% CI: 0.38-1.10; P = 0.107), were not statistically significant. Logistic regression indicated HDL as a protective factor against mitral valve calcification (HR: 0.01; 95% CI: 0.000-0.300; P = 0.009). Restricted cubic splines indicated that Agatston scores decreased with rising HDL when <1.3 mmol/L (P for nonlinear = 0.05; P for overall = 0.014).
The findings suggest that higher preoperative HDL levels could be correlated with lighter valve calcification, enhanced mid-term survival rates, and a decreased risk of cardiovascular events."

While traditionally attributed to sarcomeric mutations, recent studies have highlighted the pivotal contribution of immune dysregulation and stromal-immune interactions in its pathophysiology. However, the molecular drivers bridging structural remodeling and immune activation remain poorly defined.
This study aimed to characterize the clinical and immunological role of the transcription factor MEIS3 in HCM through integrative transcriptomic and single-cell analyses, with a focus on its diagnostic potential and regulatory interactions within the cardiac microenvironment.
We performed bulk RNA sequencing on peripheral blood samples from clinically diagnosed HCM patients (n = 4) and matched healthy controls (n = 3), followed by differential expression analysis and weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA). Machine learning algorithms (LASSO and Random Forest) were used to identify key diagnostic genes. Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) from myocardial tissues was used to localize gene expression. The immunological context was evaluated via xCell-based immune deconvolution, cytokine-immune cell correlation analysis, and ceRNA network construction centered on MEIS3.
MEIS3 was significantly upregulated in HCM samples and identified as a core hub gene in the HCM-associated blue WGCNA module. Machine learning consistently ranked MEIS3 among the top discriminatory markers (AUC > 0.90). scRNA-seq revealed MSCs as the predominant MEIS3-expressing population in HCM myocardium. Functional enrichment implicated MEIS3 in pathways related to protein synthesis, mitochondrial metabolism, and immune modulation. Immune deconvolution indicated increased M1 macrophages, NK cells, and dendritic cells in HCM. MEIS3 expression positively correlated with key immunomodulatory cytokines (CXCL12, BMP1) and altered immune landscapes. The ceRNA network identified candidate lncRNA-miRNA-MEIS3 axes potentially driving its overexpression. Cytokine-immune cell analysis revealed MEIS3-linked cytokines bridging stromal and immune compartments, reinforcing its central role in immunoregulatory remodeling.
MEIS3 functions as a stromal-centric immunomodulator in HCM, shaping cytokine expression and immune infiltration in the diseased heart. Its expression shows diagnostic potential and may represent a novel target for immuno-modulatory strategies. These findings open new avenues for immuno-targeted interventions in HCM management."

However, current deep learning methods for surgical instrument-tissue interaction recognition often rely on static images or coarse temporal sampling, limiting their ability to capture rapid surgical dynamics. Therefore, this study systematically investigates the impact of incorporating fine-grained temporal context into deep learning models for interaction recognition.
We conduct extensive experiments with multiple curated video-based datasets to investigate the influence of fine-grained temporal context for the task of instrument-tissue interaction recognition using video transformer with spatio-temporal feature extraction capabilities. Additionally, we propose a multi-task-attention module that utilizes cross-attention and a gating mechanism to improve communication between the subtasks of identifying the surgical instrument, atomic action, and anatomical target.
Our study demonstrates the benefit of utilizing the fine-grained temporal context for recognition of instrument-tissue interactions, with an optimal sampling rate of 6-8 Hz identified for the examined datasets. Furthermore, our proposed MTAM significantly outperforms state-of-the-art multi-task video transformer on the CholecT45-Vid and GraSP-Vid datasets, achieving relative increases of 4.8 %  and 5.9 %  in surgical instrument-tissue interaction recognition, respectively.
In this work, we demonstrate the benefits of using a fine-grained temporal context rather than static images or coarse temporal context for the task of surgical instrument-tissue interaction recognition. We also show that leveraging cross-attention with spatio-temporal features from various subtasks leads to improved surgical instrument-tissue interaction recognition performance.

However, memorization in generative models can lead to unintended leakage of sensitive patient information, limiting model utility and jeopardizing patient privacy.
We propose RELICT-NI (REpLIca deteCTion-NeuroImaging), a framework for detecting replicas in synthetic neuroimaging datasets. RELICT-NI evaluates image similarity using three complementary approaches: (1) image-level analysis, (2) feature-level analysis via a pretrained medical foundation model, and (3) segmentation-level analysis. RELICT-NI was validated on two clinically relevant neuroimaging use cases: non-contrast head CT with intracerebral hemorrhage (N = 774) and time-of-flight MR angiography of the Circle of Willis (N = 1,782). Expert visual scoring was used as the reference for identifying replicas. Balanced accuracy at the optimal threshold was reported to assess replica classification performance of each method.
The reference visual rating identified 45 of 50 and 5 of 50 generated images as replicas for the NCCT and TOF-MRA use cases, respectively. For the NCCT use case, both image-level and feature-level analyses achieved perfect replica detection (balanced accuracy = 1) at optimal thresholds. A perfect classification of replicas for the TOF-MRA case was not possible at any threshold, with the segmentation-level analysis achieving the highest balanced accuracy (0.79).
Replica detection is a crucial but often neglected validation step in developing deep generative models in neuroimaging. The proposed RELICT-NI framework provides a standardized, easy-to-use tool for replica detection and aims to facilitate responsible and ethical synthesis of neuroimaging data.
Our developed replica detection framework provides an important step towards standardized and rigorous validation practices of generative models in neuroimaging. Our method promotes the secure sharing of neuroimaging data and facilitates the development of robust deep learning models."

However, due to the complexity of operating on the encoded 'logical' qubits [5,6], understanding the physical principles for building fault-tolerant quantum devices and combining them into efficient architectures is an outstanding scientific challenge. Here we utilize reconfigurable arrays of up to 448 neutral atoms to implement the key elements of a universal, fault-tolerant quantum processing architecture and experimentally explore their underlying working mechanisms. We first employ surface codes to study how repeated QEC suppresses errors [6,7], demonstrating 2.14(13)x below-threshold performance in a four-round characterization circuit by leveraging atom loss detection and machine learning decoding [8,9]. We then investigate logical entanglement using transversal gates and lattice surgery [10-12], and extend it to universal logic through transversal teleportation with 3D [[15,1,3]] codes [13,14], enabling arbitrary-angle synthesis with polylogarithmic overhead [5,15]. Finally, we develop mid-circuit qubit re-use [16], increasing experimental cycle rates by two orders of magnitude and enabling deep-circuit protocols with dozens of logical qubits and hundreds of logical teleportations [17-20] with [[7,1,3]] and high-rate [[16,6,4]] codes while maintaining constant internal entropy. Our experiments reveal key principles for efficient architecture design, involving the interplay between quantum logic & entropy removal, judiciously using physical entanglement in logic gates & magic state generation, and leveraging teleportations for universality & physical qubit reset. These results establish foundations for scalable, universal error-corrected processing and its practical implementation with neutral atom systems."
PubMed,deep learning,Dynamic differential privacy technique for deep learning models.,Emad Elabd,10.1038/s41598-025-27708-0,2025-11-10,Scientific reports,"Deep learning is a field within artificial intelligence that uses large datasets to train models capable of recognizing patterns and making predictions. One of the serious challenges facing model creators during data training is preserving the privacy of the data. Adversaries use membership inference attack to expose the privacy of the data used in training the model. They identify whether a specific data point was used in the training process or not. To protect these models against this type of attack, differential privacy approach can be used. Differential privacy involves adding noise to the training weights during the data training phase according to a specific probability distribution. At every step during the data training process, a fixed amount of noise is consistently added to the training weights. This paper utilizes a modified version of the differential privacy technique to defend against membership inference attacks. The new algorithm does not add regular noise to the training weights in each step but it adds it randomly during training process. Adding noise randomly increases the randomness in training phase and decrease the chances of prediction in the case of an attack. The model performance is evaluated using a set of metrics, including accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and the privacy budget (ε). The results demonstrate that the Gaussian Randomized Noise Differentially Private Stochastic Gradient Descent (Gaussian RanN-DP-SGD) approach consistently outperforms other standard Differential Privacy (DP) methods across accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. Regarding privacy preservation, the Gaussian RanN-DP-SGD method achieves the most favorable privacy-utility trade-off, maintaining a satisfactory balance between model utility and user privacy. Notably, it delivers acceptable performance within a privacy budget range of [Formula: see text], which is suitable for most practical applications."

However, the automatic segmentation of polyps remains a considerable challenge owing to their high variability in polyp size, shape, and color, along with the indistinct boundaries between polyps and surrounding mucosal tissues. Although existing deep learning-based methods have shown encouraging results in addressing these problems, they still encounter the following challenges: (1) the lack of incorporation of geometric orientation information restricts the model's understanding of structural features; (2) the models show low sensitivity to small polyps, often resulting in missed detections; and (3) insufficient multi-scale information fusion affects both the completeness and accuracy of segmentation. To address these challenges, we introduce a global feature attention network (GFANet), which integrates three innovative modules: the global feature direction encoder (GFDE), the feature attention module (FAM), and the multi-scale information aggregation (MIA) module. Specifically, GFDE captures global context from both vertical and horizontal directions, greatly enhancing the model's ability to localize polyps with blurred boundaries or camouflage-like appearance. FAM enhances feature representation within polyp regions while suppressing background noise. MIA progressively aggregates features across multiple scales and semantic levels, boosting the segmentation accuracy for polyps of various sizes. In our experiments, we conducted a systematic comparison between GFANet and ten state-of-the-art polyp segmentation networks. The results demonstrate that GFANet achieved superior performance across five publicly available datasets. On the CVC-300 dataset, the model achieved 90.2% mean dice coefficient (mDice) and 83.5% mean intersection over union (mIoU), representing the best results among all competing approaches. Furthermore, on the ETIS-LaribPolypDB dataset, GFANet outperformed the classical model PraNet by as much as 17.2% in terms of mDice, highlighting its strong cross-dataset generalization capability."

Traditional petrophysical modeling and cross-plot method struggle to characterize nonlinear relationships under complex geological conditions. Machine learning methods such as support vector machines (SVM) and BP neural networks rely on manual feature extraction, resulting in limited generalization ability. These methods show significant accuracy degradation in noisy data, with insufficient noise immunity. For this reason, this study uses petrophysical modeling to generate large-scale and diverse synthetic data sets of elastic and anisotropic parameters based on field logging data. And an enhanced stacked bi-directional long short-term memory (S-BiLSTM) model is proposed, which uses stacking of bi-directional LSTM layers to enhance feature extraction and prediction capabilities. Validation is carried out using seismic field-measured data from an oil field in southwest China, and the results show that the method has high accuracy and robustness in porosity distribution prediction. Specifically, the prediction accuracy of the S-BiLSTM model reaches 92.19%, which is 7.81% higher than that of the LSTM model and 14.06% higher than that of the RNN model. It also performs well under noisy data. At a signal-to-noise ratio of 10dB its accuracy is 82.81% surpassing RNN at 59.38% and LSTM at 68.75%. When the signal-to-noise ratio drops to 1dB its accuracy remains 76.12% significantly higher than RNN at 44.81% and LSTM at 53.5%.

Electrocardiography (ECG) is a fundamental diagnostic tool for identifying cardiac abnormalities; however, traditional methods rely on manual interpretation and conventional machine learning (ML) models, which often struggle with feature extraction and long-range dependencies. Recent advancements in deep learning (DL) have led to the adoption of transformer-based architectures for ECG classification. In this study, we propose the Swin Transformer a hierarchical vision transformer model for automated ECG-based heart disease detection. By leveraging shifted window self-attention mechanisms, the Swin Transformer effectively captures both local and global dependencies, overcoming the limitations of convolutional and recurrent architectures. The proposed approach was evaluated on benchmark ECG datasets and compared with traditional ML models, including Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Neural Networks. Experimental results demonstrate that the Swin Transformer significantly outperforms existing methods, achieving 99.8% accuracy, 99.72% precision, 99.91% recall, and an AUC of 99.99%, establishing a new benchmark in ECG classification. Additionally, eigenvalue analysis confirms the model's ability to retain essential features while minimizing redundancy, ensuring robust generalization across diverse ECG patterns. Despite its superior performance, challenges such as computational complexity and interpretability remain, necessitating future research into Explainable AI (XAI) techniques, model optimization for real-time applications, and hybrid deep learning frameworks. Overall, our findings suggest that the Swin Transformer is a highly effective, scalable, and clinically viable solution for automated ECG-based cardiac disease detection, offering unprecedented accuracy and reliability over traditional approaches."

Thus, we propose a multitask learning model to estimate the remote photoplethysmogram (PPG) and respiratory rate simultaneously based on facial videos using complex-valued neural networks. The RGB channel images are obtained from a region of interest of the facial video streams and a complex-numbered dataset is constructed. The multitask learning model designed for the complex domain can yield a small network architecture by reducing the number of parameters, which is advantageous for small embedded devices. Using a public dataset of face video streams from multiple participants, the proposed multitask learning model could simultaneously learn the remote PPG and respiratory rate with higher performance and a smaller structure compared with conventional real-valued neural networks. These results validate the potential of the proposed model for the accurate and efficient remote monitoring of physiological disorders."

While deep learning-based approaches have advanced this field, challenges such as coarse-grained function-level detection, scalability limitations, and constrained accuracy persist. Although slice-level detection effectively reduces noise, it frequently sacrifices essential syntactic and semantic information, which undermines vulnerability representation, elevates false positive rates, and ultimately limits practical applicability. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a code vulnerability detection method based on an augmented program dependency graph and optimized CodeBERT. The method augments the traditional program dependency graph by extending its structure to capture richer semantic and structural information in the code. Furthermore, it employs the Code Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (CodeBERT) pretrained model for extracting code embedding features. Additionally, a hybrid loss function optimization strategy tailored for CodeBERT is proposed to address the long-tail distribution characteristics of code vulnerability detection.

PubMed,deep learning,Deep learning-based approach for accurate detection of fetal QRS complexes in abdominal ECG signals.,Kimia Esmaeili Alidash; Hamed Danandeh Hesar,10.1038/s41598-025-22999-9,2025-11-10,Scientific reports,"Congenital heart defects are the leading cause of mortality related to birth defects, making early monitoring of fetal electrocardiogram (FECG) vital for the detection of abnormal fetal heart rate (FHR) patterns. Accurate fetal QRS complex detection in FECG is crucial for assessing fetal health, including heart rate and the early identification of congenital conditions. This study presents a novel automated framework using a one-dimensional Convolutional Neural Network (1D-CNN) to detect fetal QRS complexes from abdominal electrocardiogram (AECG) signals, sourced from the PhysioNet Non-Invasive FECG Database (NI-FECGDB). The proposed CNN architecture comprises five convolutional layers, seven batch normalization layers, three dropout layers, and three dense layers. In the initial phase to generate annotations tailored for the proposed network, each AECG signal was partitioned into overlapping 1-second windows, facilitating data augmentation. Binary annotations were generated for each 100-millisecond segment based on the presence or absence of fetal QRS complexes. Subsequently, after performing preprocessing steps, the developed algorithm was applied, and its performance was evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, mean squared error, F1-score, sensitivity, specificity, and precision. The results were compared with those from previous studies utilizing the NI-FECGDB database. The proposed lightweight 1D-CNN architecture demonstrated exceptional performance, achieving 96.79% accuracy, 97.91% sensitivity, 92.79% specificity and 97.88% precision while requiring only 20 AECG signals for training - a significant improvement over existing methods that typically demanded larger datasets. This framework's innovative design eliminated the need for maternal ECG component extraction, thereby reducing computational complexity and potential signal decomposition artifacts. The combination of a simplified five-layer architecture with our novel 100 ms resolution labeling strategy enabled high-precision fetal QRS detection while maintaining minimal preprocessing requirements. These advances position our method as a robust and efficient solution for clinical fetal monitoring applications."
PubMed,deep learning,Optimized fall detection using hybrid BiLSTM BiGRU additive attention model and BAOA driven feature selection system.,Mithun Singh Ahirwar; Vaibhav Soni,10.1038/s41598-025-22909-z,2025-11-10,Scientific reports,"With the increasing aging population and the prevalence of fall-related injuries among the elderly, the need for precise and reliable fall detection systems has become crucial. Deep learning techniques have been used to play a transformative role in fall detection domain due to their ability to learn complex patterns and relationships in data. However, these methods also face significant challenges and limitations. In this paper we have proposed a novel fall detection method utilizing a hybrid model combining Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (BiLSTM) and Bidirectional Gated Recurrent Unit (BiGRU) networks, enhanced with additive attention mechanism and an optimized feature selection process utilizing the Binary Arithmetic Optimization Algorithm (BAOA). The proposed hybrid BiLSTM-BiGRU-Additive Attention Model and BAOA Driven Feature Selection system is designed to proficiently capture temporal dependencies in the data. The model is evaluated on three datasets collected using wearable sensors, namely SisFall, UMAFall, and UP-Fall, experimental results demonstrate that the proposed model significantly outperforms traditional deep learning architectures, and non-optimized versions, achieving accuracies of 99.50%, 99.85%, and 99.68% for the SisFall, UMAFall, and UP-Fall datasets, respectively making our proposed model suitable for real-time fall detection systems."

Accurate and accessible assessment of the onset of fatigue is essential to achieving optimal exercise benefits and preventing overuse injuries. To obtain fatigue-related parameters in different age groups, we applied deep learning algorithms and signal processing technology to analyze cycling movement features for the people aged over 45. 20 healthy adults aged over 45 and 20 aged 18-30 were recruited. Participants were asked to ride a stationary exercise bike at their self-regulated pedaling speeds for 10 min and wear a COSMED K5 device to collect physiological signals. The Keypoint RCNN (KR) algorithm and three signal processing methods (Fourier transform, short-time Fourier transform, and multiscale entropy analysis were used to analyze the cycling movement data. Based on time-frequency analysis, subjects' movement status change points were identified when fatigue occurred. Four movement status parameters were calculated, including the peak frequency before/after the movement status change point and the complexity index average (CIA) before/after the movement status change point. Inter-group and intra-group movement features, movement status, and physiological data were compared to determine fatigue-related features. Results showed that the peak frequency (p = 0.005), the peak frequency before/after the change point (p = 0.008/0.019), the CIA after the change point (p = 0.014), the maximum heart rate, maximal oxygen consumption, metabolic equivalents, and energy efficiency exhibited significant inter-group differences. The KR algorithm demonstrated outstanding performance in keypoint detection, achieving an accuracy of 86.5%, significantly outperforming OpenPose. With an inference speed of 30 FPS, it fulfills the demands for real-time monitoring. In addition, CIA valuses before and after change pointsshowed significant differences in the the middle-aged and elderly people group. After the change point, the CIA canidentify movement status changes in inter-group and intra-group comparisons, suggesting it can be used as a indicator of fatigue status, especially for people aged over 45."
PubMed,deep learning,Identification and cause analysis on unplanned reoperations by text classification approach.,Zhancheng Liang; Wenyang Huang; Hongyu Xu; Zhenkun He; ChunQiu Yuan; Yan Liang; Qiuquan Guo; Tianzhao Liu; Peipei Jia,10.1038/s41598-025-22791-9,2025-11-10,Scientific reports,"Unplanned reoperations (URs) not only increase the hospitalization period and healthcare cost, but also raise the death risk of patients. The analysis of URs is thus significant for their quality control and reduction. However, the massive text data generated in hospitals makes the identification of URs a tedious task with potential bias. Current research on UR is limited to data analysis and lack automated classification using deep learning and natural language processing. Here we propose the UR-Net framework. It implements the UR identification and cause analysis by processing the long texts of ward round documentation and applying few-shot learning on multi-class cause classification. Our framework consists of the URNet-XL with a batch fusion method based on XLNet model, and the URNet-GT for cause classification based on the pre-trained model combined with feature extraction modules of multi-head attention and a bi-directional Gated Recurrent Unit. High weighted F1 scores of 96.34% and 93.37% are obtained for the respective processes in comparison with the baseline methods. The Area Under receiver operating characteristic Curve (AUC) of 97.86% indicates an excellent UR classification on the unbalanced dataset. Our approach provides a new route of UR identification and analysis with the potential of reducing its occurrence."
PubMed,deep learning,Modelling of hybrid deep learning framework with recursive feature elimination for distributed denial of service attack detection systems.,Sultan Alkhliwi,10.1038/s41598-025-22936-w,2025-11-10,Scientific reports,"Dealing with network security has always been a challenging task, particularly in the prevention and detection of distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks. Attacks such as DDoS pose hazards to the system by compromising its accessibility to individuals who need to use a specific server. This type of cyberattack occurs when a system is overloaded with a massive amount of traffic, causing the network to become unavailable. This attack type focuses on engaging the service with correct operators without breaching safety parameters. Responsible artificial intelligence (AI) refers to the ethical development and deployment of AI systems that prioritise fairness, transparency, privacy, and accountability. Currently, the deep learning method is very effective in distinguishing DDoS traffic from harmless traffic by removing the representation of higher-level features from lower-level traffic. The study presented in this paper proposes a responsible artificial intelligence-based hybridisation framework for attack detection using recursive feature elimination (RAIHFAD-RFE) for cybersecurity systems. The study aimed to analyse and propose efficient cybersecurity tactics for preventing, mitigating and detecting DDoS attacks using advanced methods. As a primary step, the RAIHFAD-RFE technique utilises the Z-score standardisation method for the data pre-processing phase to clean, transform and organise raw data into a structured format. Furthermore, the recursive feature elimination (RFE) model is employed for feature selection (FS) to identify and retain the most essential features, thereby improving model performance and reducing model complexity. Moreover, the hybridisation of long short-term memory and bidirectional gated recurrent unit (LSTM-BiGRU) models was employed for classification. To optimise model performance, the improved orca predation algorithm (IOPA) is utilised for hyperparameter tuning to select the optimal parameters for enhanced accuracy. A comprehensive experimental analysis of the RAIHFAD-RFE approach was performed under the CIC-IDS-2017 and Edge-industrial internet of things (IIoT) datasets. A comparison study of the RAIHFAD-RFE approach provided superior accuracy values of 99.35% and 99.39%, respectively, compared to existing models on the dual dataset."
PubMed,deep learning,Automated lumbar spine segmentation in MRI using an enhanced U-Net with inception module and dual-output mechanism.,Jaysel Theresa Silveira; Girisha S; Poornima Panduranga Kundapur,10.1038/s41598-025-20721-3,2025-11-10,Scientific reports,"Accurate segmentation of spinal structures, including vertebrae, intervertebral discs (IVDs), and the spinal canal, is crucial for diagnosing lumbar spine disorders. Deep learning-based semantic segmentation has significantly improved accuracy in medical imaging. This study proposes an enhanced U-Net incorporating an Inception module for multi-scale feature extraction and a dual-output mechanism for improved training stability and feature refinement. The model is trained on the SPIDER lumbar spine MRI dataset and evaluated using Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score, and mean Intersection over Union (mIoU). Comparative analysis with the baseline models-U-Net, ResUNet, Attention U-Net, and TransUNet-shows that the proposed model achieves superior segmentation accuracy, with improved boundary delineation and better handling of class imbalance. An evaluation of loss functions identified Dice loss as the most effective, enabling the model to achieve an mIoU of 0.8974, an accuracy of 0.9742, a precision of 0.9417, a recall of 0.9470, and an F1-score of 0.9444, outperforming all four baseline models. The Inception module enhances feature extraction at multiple scales, while the dual-output mechanism improves gradient flow and segmentation consistency. Initially focused on binary segmentation, the approach was extended to multiclass segmentation, enabling separate identification of vertebrae, IVDs, and the spinal canal. These enhancements offer a more precise and efficient solution for automated lumbar spine segmentation in MRI, thereby supporting enhanced diagnostic workflows in medical imaging."

Objectives Iliofemoral calcium modification by intravascular lithotripsy (IVL) may enable transfemoral access in PAD patients. Methods Between June 2022 and February 2024, all consecutive TAVR patients at our institution were prospectively screened for use of IVL according to the predefined TREATABLE classification, involving parameters such as calcification, vessel kinking and stenosis. Endpoints comprised successful TAVR, safety, and three-month outcomes (DRKS00034681). In an independent retrospective approach, all TAVR patients treated between February 2020 and June 2022 were evaluated with the TREATABLE classification towards complication rates without use of IVL (DRKS00029242). Results Two hundred twenty-nine prospective patients were included and after application of the TREATABLE classification, 26 patients (11.4%) received IVL-supported transfemoral TAVR. According to the TREATABLE classification, there was a similar extent of kinking ( p = 0.468), but a significantly higher severity of calcification in the IVL-treated group ( p &lt; 0.001). In the retrospective analysis of the additional 1000 patients, 966 (96.6%) received transfemoral and 34 alternative access TAVR. 154 transfemoral and all alternative access TAVR were identified as high-risk according to the TREATABLE classification. Comparing the retrospective and prospective TREATABEL cohorts, transfemoral high-risk patients in the retrospective cohort without IVL showed a higher rate of post-interventional stenosis or occlusion (12.3% vs. 0%, p = 0.049). Conclusion This observational study shows a favourable success and safety level of IVL-supported transfemoral TAVR despite severe PAD, based on the TREATABLE classification. Therefore, the newly developed classification provides a suitable tool for identifying patients who would benefit from facilitating transfemoral TAVR by IVL. Graphical Abstract"

This article aims to present our institutional approach, supported by the current literature, in managing several challenging anatomical scenarios. We focus on seven high-impact scenarios—bicuspid aortic valve (BAV), hostile transfemoral access, iliofemoral/aortic tortuosity, adverse aortic angulation, heavy annulus/Left Ventricular Outflow Tract (LVOT) calcification, small annulus, and risk of coronary obstruction—and propose a practical approach to minimize the risk of complications. In BAV, current generation transcatheter heart valves (THV) achieve favorable early outcomes when sizing accounts for supra-annular constraints and implantation depth is tailored. Transfemoral access remains dominant in contemporary registries, yet a meaningful minority of cases require adjunctive peripheral vascular intervention to enable THV delivery-system passage. In case of annulus or LVOT calcification, small annuli, complex aortic anatomy, high risk for coronary obstruction, and pre-procedural Computed Tomography (CT) allow for an accurate sizing of THV and tailored procedural planning. A structured, CT-driven pathway that links anatomic findings to specific facilitation and bailout steps can standardize decision-making and improve safety across these challenging scenarios. We strongly highlight the importance to build a network where most complex procedures are carried out in Valve Centers where expert operators are trained to manage high volume, high complexity, and difficult complications."

However, as a diagnostic test, the real-world clinical utility of AI-ECG reliability requires the consistency of its results when repeated under similar conditions. Aim To evaluate the reliability of AI-ECG models for different ECGs for the same person, across different diagnostic labels, and using varied modeling approaches. Methods We used ECG images (2000-2024) from 5 hospitals and an outpatient network within a large, integrated US health system. For each individual, we identified multiple ECGs recorded within a 30-day period. We evaluated 7 models: 6 convolutional neural networks (CNNs) trained to detect individual SHDs, including LV systolic dysfunction, left valve diseases and severe LVH; an ensemble XGBoost integrating individual CNNs as a composite screen for multiple SHDs. We used concordance correlation coefficient (CCC), Spearman correlation, Cohen’s kappa, and percent agreement in binary screen status to test model reliability. We evaluated factors associated with different AI-ECG outputs (Δ probability&gt; 0.5) and assessed stability across ECG layouts (digital, printed, photo). Results Across sites, we identified 1,118,263 ECG pairs, with a median 1 (1-3) days between ECGs. The ensemble XGBoost had the higher test-retest correlation (CCC: 0.89-0.92) and agreement (kappa: 0.75-0.82) between pairs compared with CNNs (CCC: 0.78-0.88; kappa: 0.57-0.72). After adjusting for demographics, ECG pairs that included one or both inpatient ECG were significantly more likely to yield unstable predictions (ORs: 1.60 [1.50-1.70] and 1.91 [1.78-2.05], respectively) compared with pairs with both ECGs obtained in outpatient settings. Among outpatient pairs across sites, the XGBoost model had a CCC of 0.89-0.94, a Spearman correlation of 0.90-0.94, and a kappa of 0.78-0.84, with concordance rates of 89-92%. Notably, ensemble model predictions were also stable across different ECG layouts. Conclusion An ensemble AI-ECG model integrating multiple CNN predictions had higher reliability compared with models for individual disorders. Discordance was more common in inpatient ECGs, suggesting instability in high-acuity settings. Reliable ensemble AI-ECG model outputs support readiness for clinical implementation for SHD screening.

Surgical aortic valve replacement (SAVR) remains the standard therapy, while transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) is increasingly adopted across a broader range of risk profiles due to accumulating evidence and advancements in device technology. Observational registries and early trial data indicate that TAVI is technically feasible in selected BAV anatomies, with device-success rates exceeding 90%. Nonetheless, bicuspid morphology is still technically demanding, with several possible pitfalls during transcatheter procedure and pre-procedural planning compared with tricuspid valve. The rates of moderate-to-severe paravalvular leak (PVL), permanent pacemaker implantation (PPI), and annular complications remain high, especially in the presence of extensive calcifications with raphe or tapered roots, underscoring the importance of meticulous multimodality imaging, dedicated sizing algorithms, and device-specific strategies. Long-term durability signals are encouraging but remain limited, underlining the need for prospective trials with extended follow-up. This review summarizes current knowledge on BAV anatomy and its management, exploring the available evidence supporting the role of transcatheter approach in this challenging and unique scenario."

This study aims to assess trends in procedural volumes, patient characteristics, and outcomes for patients undergoing TAVI or surgical aortic valve replacement (SAVR) in Sweden. Methods: This was a descriptive, non-comparative, nationwide cohort study using the SWEDEHEART registry. We included 21,383 patients who underwent TAVI or SAVR between 2013 and 2023 (11,366 TAVI and 10,017 SAVR). Trends in patient characteristics, preoperative risk, complications and mortality were examined. Findings: TAVI procedures increased from 307 (26.1%, n = 307/1174) in 2013 to 1851 (71.2%, n = 1851/2601) in 2023, while SAVR volumes declined from ∼1000 annually before 2018 to roughly 750 procedures annually. Median age of TAVI patients were 81 (IQR 77, 85) years and 71 (IQR 65, 76) years for SAVR patients. The median EuroSCORE II for TAVI decreased from 5.6 (IQR 3.3, 10.2) to 2.7 (IQR 1.7, 4.6) (p = 0.002), and STS-PROM from 3.3 (IQR 1.9, 4.1) to 1.6 (IQR 1.1, 2.8) (p = 0.0021). Among SAVR patients, EuroSCORE II decreased from 1.5 (IQR 1.0, 2.3) to 1.3 (IQR 0.9, 2.1) (p = 0.022) and STS-PROM from 1.8 (IQR 1.2, 3.0) to 1.6 (IQR 1.1, 2.6) (p = 0.0082). Any in-hospital complications declined significantly for TAVI (29.2%, n = 210/719 to 13.2%, n = 244/1851), while SAVR complication rates increased slightly (18.4%, n = 354/1921 to 18.7%, n = 140/750). In-hospital mortality for TAVI declined from 3.6% (n = 26/719) to 1.0% (n = 18/1851), and 1-year mortality from 11.1% to 6.9% (p = 0.019). SAVR in-hospital all-cause death decreased from 1.6% to 0.4% (n = 3/750) and 5.0% to 2.2% for 1-year mortality (p = 0.013). Interpretation: TAVI has become the predominant treatment strategy for AS in Sweden expanding access within the treated cohort. Despite this, current 2023 SAVR results demonstrate similar in-hospital complication rates compared to TAVI (18.7% vs 13.2%), but lower in-hospital (0.4% vs 1.0%) and 1-year mortality rates (2.2% vs 6.9%). Funding: This study was supported by ALF and national research funding bodies."

Understanding the natural history and predictors of disease progression is critical for optimizing timing of intervention and patient follow-up. Objective: The main objective of this systematic review was to evaluate the natural course of degenerative AS and identify clinical, echocardiographic, and biochemical predictors of progression. Secondary objectives included assessing annual changes in hemodynamic parameters, incidence of adverse cardiac outcomes, and impact of comorbidities on disease acceleration. Methods: A systematic search was performed in PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, Cochrane Library, LILACS, ClinicalTrials.gov, and ICTRP. Observational and interventional studies published in the last 5 years were included, with extension to 10 years if fewer than 10 eligible studies were available. Two independent reviewers screened titles and abstracts, extracted data, and assessed bias using RoB 2, ROBINS-I, or QUADAS-2 as appropriate. Certainty of evidence was graded using GRADE. Results and Discussion: 27 studies met inclusion criteria. Most cohorts demonstrated a nonlinear yet measurable progression of valve calcification and gradient increase over time. Elevated baseline aortic jet velocity, lipoprotein(a), and valvular calcium scores were consistent predictors of faster progression. The pooled annual increase in mean gradient ranged between 4–8 mmHg, and event-free survival declined significantly once peak velocity exceeded 4.0 m/s. Conclusion: Degenerative AS is a dynamic and heterogeneous condition influenced by metabolic, inflammatory, and structural mechanisms. Early identification of high-risk phenotypes may guide timely valve replacement and improve outcomes."

OpenAlex,aortic stenosis,Study on the Correlation Between Ventricular Function Evaluated by <i>Z</i> ‐Score of Atrioventricular Annular Plane Systolic Excursion and Pulmonary Artery Abnormality and Retrograde Ductus Arteriosus Flow in Fetuses With Ebstein Anomaly,Xianfeng Guo; Bowen Zhao; Yilin Li; Xinyu Zhou,10.1002/jcu.70122,2025-11-04,Journal of Clinical Ultrasound,"ABSTRACT Purpose Ebstein anomaly (EA) is a congenital heart disease that can cause intrauterine fetal death. Pulmonary valve stenosis or atresia (PS/PA) and retrograde ductus arteriosus flow (RDAF) are important factors leading to a poor prognosis, but the causes of its formation are still unclear. This study aimed to assess the correlation between left and right ventricular function and PS/PA and RDAF in fetuses with EA using MAPSE and TAPSE Z ‐score values measured by free angle M‐mode (FAM) echocardiography. Methods This retrospective cohort study of 34 EA and 68 normal fetuses was enrolled. Differences in Z ‐score values were compared between the control, EA with and without PS/PA groups, and between EA‐PS/PA with and without RDAF group. Correlation analysis was performed between Z ‐score values with the ratio of inner diameter of the pulmonary to the aortic valve annulus (PA/AO) and RDAF. Results The differences in Z ‐score values were significant ( p &lt; 0.001) between three groups. Z ‐score values were lower in EA‐PS/PA with RDAF compared to the without RDAF group ( p &lt; 0.05). Z ‐scores were all positively correlated with PA/AO in the EA group ( p &lt; 0.05), and negatively correlated with RDAF in the EA‐PS/PA group ( p &lt; 0.05). Conclusion Decreased ventricular function of EA fetus is related to the formation of PS/PA. After the formation of PS/PA, the degree of damage to ventricular function is not related to the diameter of the pulmonary artery; it is related to the formation of RDAF."

This study evaluated its performance following aortic valve replacement (AVR). Methods This single-center, prospective, observational study included patients aged ≥ 60 years with end-diastolic interventricular septum thickness (IVSd) ≥ 12 mm, who underwent hydroxydiphosphonate (HDP) bone scintigraphy after AVR between March 2021 and July 2024. The diagnostic performance of the RAISE Score assessed at 30-day follow-up and of simpler screening parameters for pathological HDP uptake (Perugini 1–3) were analyzed, along with their association with all-cause mortality and heart failure (HF) hospitalization. Results Among 131 included patients (median age 81 years; 64% male) pathological HDP uptake was found in 21 (16%), and 11 (8.4%) were diagnosed with ATTR-CM. A RAISE Score ≥ 2 demonstrated 76% sensitivity and 56% specificity for pathological bone scintigraphy, while a Score ≥ 3 showed 62% sensitivity and 78% specificity. The parameters age ≥ 83 years and the combination of carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS) and/or N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) ≥ 1,400 pg/mL performed similarly to the RAISE Score. Cardiac HDP uptake showed a strong trend toward HF hospitalization (HR [95%-CI]: 5.81 [0.93–36.20]; p = 0.060) and all-cause mortality (HR [95%-CI]: 3.27 [0.95–11.24]; p = 0.060). CTS and/or NT-proBNP ≥ 1,400 pg/mL was significantly associated with higher all-cause mortality (HR [95%-CI]: 3.92 [1.04–14.84]; p = 0.044), whereas the RAISE Score was not. Conclusion After AVR, the complex RAISE Score showed lower sensitivity than originally reported, while simpler parameters demonstrated comparable predictive value for ATTR-CM screening. Advanced age, CTS history and elevated NT-proBNP levels seem most valuable for identifying candidates for bone scintigraphy. Graphical Abstract A total of 131 patients aged ≥ 60 years, with an IVSd ≥ 12 mm and an AVR between March 2021 and July 2024, underwent standard diagnostic evaluation for ATTR-CM, including HDP bone scintigraphy. Pathological findings on bone scintigraphy (Perugini Score 1–3) were observed in 16% of the patients and were associated with worse clinical outcomes. The performance of the proposed RAISE Score [11], along with simplified or modified screening parameters, was evaluated in predicting both pathological scintigraphy results and clinical outcomes. ATTR-CM = transthyretin amyloidosis cardiomyopathy; AVR = aortic valve replacement; CTS = carpal tunnel syndrome; HDP = hydroxydiphosphonate; IVSd = interventricular septum thickness at end-diastole; NT-proBNP = N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide."
OpenAlex,aortic stenosis,Abstract 4365172: Aortic Valve Type and Stenosis Can Be Identified from Wearable-Recorded Seismocardiograms Using Machine-Learned Classifiers,Ethan Johnson; Michael Chinkers; Cynthia K. Rigsby; Joshua D. Robinson; Bradley D. Allen; Michael Markl,10.1161/circ.152.suppl_3.4365172,2025-11-03,Circulation,"Introduction: Patients with aortic valve disease, such as bicuspid aortic valve (BAV), require regular echocardiography or cardiovascular (CV) MRI to monitor for complications such as valve stenosis (AS) and aortic dilation. However, repeated imaging can be burdensome and incur substantial cost. Seismocardiogram (SCG) chest acceleration measurements recorded by inexpensive wearable devices can give indicators of valve-mediated hemodynamic changes, and as such may have supplemental value for such patients. This study investigated using SCG recordings coupled with a novel machine-learned (ML) classifier for SCG signals to identify patient valve type and presence/absence of aortic valve stenosis (AS). Hypothesis: We hypothesize that accurate classification of aortic valve type and AS can be made from SCG recordings with ML analysis compared to those from standard-of-care imaging (ground truth: cardiac MRI or echo). Methods: Healthy controls (no known CV disease) and aortic valve disease patients with tricuspid (TAV), BAV, or post-repair mechanical valve who received echo or MRI (clinical CV protocol) were enrolled for same-day 2-minute wearable SCG measurement (fig. A). Standard clinical assessment of valve/flow function was used (fig. B). Informed consent was given with IRB oversight. Clinical imaging used 4D flow MRI (1.5T,1-3mm3/30-40ms) or 2D Doppler echo (1.7-3.3MHz,12-40FPS). From clinical read of valve type/function, subjects were grouped in four classes: AS (any degree), BAV no-AS, TAV no-AS, mechanical. A hybrid network with convolutional neural network and multi-layer perceptron was trained (80/20 train/test) to classify patient valve status from SCG wavelet coefficients and demographics (age/sex/height/weight). Performance was evaluated by 20-fold cross-validation. Results: Enrolment was 129 subjects (97 MRI/32 echo): 46 controls (45.9±17.4y/20F) and 83 patients (22.4±15.8y/20F; 67 BAV/6 TAV/10 mech.). Classification area-under-curve (AUC) was high for all classes (AUC≥0.79). Across all ML validations, correct classification was achieved for ≥75% of subjects. Conclusion: This evaluation of a machine-learned classifier for SCG indicate potential utility in screening for valve-mediated hemodynamic changes, which reverberate through the chest and cause altered vibrations. The low cost and ease of acquisition for SCG would make it an appealing complement to imaging as the current standard for aortic valve abnormality screening and management."
OpenAlex,aortic stenosis,Abstract 4360927: Flow Matters: Prognostic Value of Sex-Specific Transvalvular Flow Rate in PLFLG Aortic Stenosis,Shani Dahan; Jacob P. Dal‐Bianco; C. Cabrera; Jonathan Passeri; Evin Yucel; Giselle Alexandra Suero-Abreu; Rachel Goldberg; Robert A. Levine; Judy Hung,10.1161/circ.152.suppl_3.4360927,2025-11-03,Circulation,"Background: Paradoxical low-flow, low-gradient (PLFLG) severe aortic stenosis (AS) is a high-risk phenotype characterized by low transvalvular gradients despite preserved left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF). While stroke volume index is conventionally used to define flow state, transvalvular flow rate (Q)—a measure incorporating both volume and ejection duration— offers a more physiologic assessment of forward flow. Given known sex-based differences in flow dynamics, we aimed to evaluate whether sex-specific Q thresholds are associated with adverse outcomes in PLFLG severe AS. Methods: We included 1,189 patients with adjudicated PLFLG severe AS (aortic valve area &lt;1.0 cm2, mean gradient &lt;40 mmHg, LVEF ≥50%, and Q ≤210 mL/sec) from an institutional echocardiographic database. Sex-specific Q thresholds were derived using the maximally selected rank statistic (≤150 mL/sec in males, ≤180 mL/sec in females). The primary outcome was a composite of all-cause mortality and aortic valve replacement (SAVR/TAVR). Results: In both sexes, lower Q was associated with a smaller aortic valve area, lower stroke volume index and reduced transvalvular gradients. Patients with low Q had significantly lower event-free survival, particularly among females, for both all-cause mortality and the composite outcome (log-rank p&lt;0.001)(Figure). In a multivariable analysis, low Q independently predicted adverse composite outcome in both males (HR 1.54, 95% CI: 1.10–2.16) and females (HR 1.39, 95% CI: 1.16–1.65). Conclusion: Sex-specific transvalvular flow rate thresholds are independently associated with adverse outcomes in paradoxical low-flow low-gradient severe aortic stenosis. These findings support the clinical utility of sex-specific Q, particularly in women, for refining risk stratification and guiding timely intervention."

We previously demonstrated that a higher aortic tortuosity index (ATI), defined as the ratio of aortic length (from the sinotubular junction to the terminal aorta) to body height measured by 3D-computed tomography, was associated with complete atrioventricular block (CAVB). However, the anatomical mechanisms linking ATI to conduction disturbances (CD) requiring pacemaker implantation (PMI) remain unclear. Purpose: To investigate whether anatomical variations—specifically, aortic angle and membranous septum (MS) length—mediate the association between ATI and CD requiring PMI after TAVR. Methods: We analyzed 198 consecutive patients with severe AVS who underwent TAVR. ATI, aortic angle, and MS length were quantified using pre-procedural 3D-CT imaging. CD requiring PMI within 30 days post-TAVR was observed in 20 patients (10.2%). Patients were stratified by median ATI (3.24), aortic angle (49°), and MS length (3.3 mm). Structural equation modeling (SEM) was applied to evaluate both direct and indirect effects of ATI on CD through aortic angle and MS length. Results: Patients with higher ATI (&gt;3.24) had a significantly greater incidence of CD requiring PMI than those with lower ATI (18.2% vs. 3.0%, p = 0.001). SEM demonstrated a significant direct effect of higher ATI on CD (path coefficient = 0.26, p &lt; 0.01), along with a significant indirect effect mediated by aortic angle and MS length (path coefficient = 0.15, p &lt; 0.05). Conclusion: Higher ATI is associated with increased risk of CD requiring PMI after TAVR, and this relationship is mediated by steeper aortic angle and shorter MS length. Aortic tortuosity may reflect age-related anatomical remodeling that predisposes patients to conduction injury during TAVR."
OpenAlex,aortic stenosis,Abstract 4367403: A Hidden Threat: Trazodone-Induced Warfarin Failure Leading to Acute Mechanical Aortic Valve Thrombosis,C Vogt; Saad Ullah Malik; Kristopher Pfirman,10.1161/circ.152.suppl_3.4367403,2025-11-03,Circulation,"Background: Warfarin remains essential for preventing thrombosis in patients with mechanical heart valves. However, its narrow therapeutic index and susceptibility to drug interactions demand careful monitoring. We present a case of subacute mechanical aortic valve thrombosis likely precipitated by a warfarin–trazodone interaction. Case Presentation: A 58-year-old man with a history of bicuspid aortic stenosis requiring mechanical valve replacement—previously stable on chronic warfarin therapy (5 mg daily)—presented to the ED with three days of worsening dyspnea, cough, and upper back pain. Upon arrival, he was hypertensive, hypoxic, and in respiratory distress, exhibiting cold extremities, bilateral crackles, and an audible mechanical valve click. Labs revealed an INR of 1.3 (previously therapeutic), lactate 9.0 mmol/L, troponin 233 ng/L, and BNP 6812 pg/mL. CTA showed possible multifocal pneumonia. Initially, he was diagnosed with septic shock and ARDS, requiring vasopressors and BiPAP. Shortly after, he suffered a cardiac arrest, requiring intubation and vasopressor escalation. Transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) revealed a peak gradient of 3.7 m/s and mean gradient of 28 mmHg across the prosthetic valve. Urgent transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) showed severely restricted leaflet motion with torrential aortic regurgitation—highly suggestive of valve thrombosis. Due to prohibitive surgical risk, thrombolysis with alteplase (25 mg over 6 hours) was administered. Repeat TEE demonstrated improved leaflet motion (velocity 2.2 m/s, mean gradient 17.6 mmHg), LVEF of 25%, and new severe mitral regurgitation. He was stabilized on milrinone and extubated by hospital day five. Despite restarting warfarin—at doses up to 30 mg daily (three times his prior regimen)—therapeutic INR was not achieved until 10 days later. Further interrogation revealed, thirteen days prior to ED visit, he was started on trazodone 50 mg. No other interacting medications or hepatic dysfunction were identified. Trazodone was identified as the likely culprit and had been discontinued. His INR subsequently normalized. Discussion: Trazodone may reduce warfarin efficacy, leading to subtherapeutic INR and valve thrombosis in mechanical valve patients. While the exact mechanism is unclear, proposed theories include CYP2C9 induction, increased warfarin clearance, or protein-binding displacement. This case highlights the need for close INR monitoring when initiating trazodone in patients on warfarin."

Sehnert; Saumya Das,10.1161/circ.152.suppl_3.4369991,2025-11-03,Circulation,"Introduction: Heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) remains a leading cause of morbidity and mortality despite current therapies. The transverse aortic constriction (TAC) model in rodent mimics conditions such as hypertension and aortic stenosis and is widely used to study HFrEF. SGK1, a stress activated kinase, plays a key role in cardiac remodeling, fibrosis, and inflammation, critical in HF progression. Genetic inhibition of SGK1 by cardiac-specific expression of dominant-negative SGK1 in a TAC model is shown to be cardioprotective. Small molecule inhibitors of SGK1 (SGK1i) have not previously been evaluated in the TAC model. Research Questions: To evaluate the efficacy of novel, potent and selective SGK1i in a TAC model. Methods: Male, Sprague Dawley Rats, that had undergone TAC (20G suture) or sham surgery were dosed once a day via oral gavage from Day 3 until the end of the study on Day 56 with vehicle, SGK1i A, or SGK1i B. All animals had echocardiography on Days 21, 28, 42 and 56 to monitor disease progression. Tissues were stained by picrosirius red, and collagen was quantified using ImageJ software. Results: SGK1i ameliorated the progression to heart failure following TAC compared to the vehicle treated group, noted by a higher ejection fraction in the SGK1i groups compared to the vehicle group that is apparent even at day 21 (EF%: Sham 71.93, Vehicle 59.27, SGK1i A 70.66, SGK1i B 72.20) and is sustained through day 56 (EF%: Sham 70.50, Vehicle 49.87, SGK1i A 65.28, SGK1i B 64.22). In addition, parameters of LV structure were preserved in the SGK1i groups through the course of the study (LVESV mL Day 56: Sham 0.11, Vehicle 0.23, SGK1i A 0.13, SGK1i B 0.13). Morphometric measurements confirmed a significant increase in HW/BW in vehicle treated animals, which was mitigated by SGK1i. Hemodynamic studies confirmed the beneficial effects of SGK1i compared to vehicle treated animals (LVEDP, stroke work preserved, LV elastance better), with SGK1i groups not significantly different from sham animals. Finally, histological analysis demonstrated significantly less fibrosis and myofibrillar disarray in similar sections of SGK1i treated versus vehicle groups. Conclusions: SGK1i prevented the development of TAC pressure overload-induced decline in systolic function, had beneficial effects on cardiac hypertrophy, and reduced fibrosis. These data support the continued development of SGK1 inhibitors as promising novel therapeutics for HF."

He became unresponsive at home, prompting ED evaluation. Initial ECG was unremarkable with no ischemic changes. Troponins peaked at 100 ng/L. A transthoracic echocardiogram showed a normal left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) of 60–65% with no wall motion abnormalities. Elective cardiac catheterization was pursued to evaluate for coronary artery disease. Differential Diagnosis: Acute coronary syndrome (ACS), stroke, transient ischemic attack, seizure, GERD, and anxiety were considered. The normal ECG and preserved ejection fraction initially lowered suspicion for ACS, though rising troponins remained concerning. Treatment and Management: Coronary angiography revealed severe multivessel disease including diffuse left main coronary artery (LMCA) stenosis. Midway through the procedure, the patient developed chest pain and cardiac arrest due to pulseless electrical activity and received 25 minutes of cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) before acheiving return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC). Emergent veno-arterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (VA-ECMO) was initiated. A non-selective aortic root angiogram showed 100% LMCA occlusion and the patient underwent salvage percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) to the LMCA. A micro-axial pump was placed. He underwent rescue three-vessel coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) after stabilization. Outcome and Follow-Up: Despite aggressive intervention, the patient’s LVEF dropped to 14% with persistent cardiogenic shock. Serial echocardiograms showed no improvement. He was transitioned to comfort care and passed away 10 days after admission. Teaching Points: Total LMCA occlusion is a rare but catastrophic event, especially when iatrogenically precipitated during elective procedures. Non-invasive cardiac imaging (e.g., coronary CTA, calcium scoring) may help stratify risk before elective catheterization in patients with significant risk factors prior to initiating invasive procedures. Early recognition, effective CPR, mechanical circulatory support including ECMO and micro-axial pumps, and coordinated multi-disciplinary revascularization strategies are critical in such high-risk presentations."

However, the long-term effects of functional tricuspid regurgitation (FTR) on AF recurrence and the improvement of TR after radiofrequency catheter ablation (RFCA) remain unclear. Methods This retrospective, single-center observational study involved 1,690 patients with persistent atrial fibrillation (PsAF) who underwent AF ablation between January 2012 and June 2022. 153 paients with significant FTR were propensity matching 153 patients with no or mild FTR based on age, body mass index, and mitral regurgitation (MR) severity. Patients were followed up for at least 1 year. Procedural success was defined as freedom from any atrial tachyarrhythmia (&amp;gt;30 s) after the 3-month blanking period, off antiarrhythmic drugs. Significant FTR was defined as moderate to severe TR. Significant TR improvement was defined as a reduction in TR severity by ≥2 grades from pre- to post-ablation. Results Among the observational cohort, 153 patients (9.1%) had significant FTR, the severity of which correlated with female sex, AF duration, atrial/ventricular remodeling, and NT-proBNP levels. During the 12-month follow-up, the procedural success rate was 67.6% (207/306). RFCA significantly reduced the proportion of RA and RV enlargement ( P &amp;lt; 0.001), and improved the severity of FTR ( P &amp;lt; 0.001). Logistic regression analyses showed that AF recurrence [odds ratio (OR) 18.244, 95% CI 7.500–52.427, P &amp;lt; 0.001]) was the strongest independent risk factor for non-significant TR improvement after ablation. After a mean follow-up of 5.3 ± 3.7 years, the overall procedural success rate was 47.4% (145/306). The overall success rate was significantly lower in patients with significant FTR compared to those with no or mild FTR (37.3% VS 57.5%, P &amp;lt; 0.001). A comparable difference was observed between ventricular FTR and no or atrial FTR (27.1% VS 53.4%, P &amp;lt; 0.001). Conclusions Significant FTR was an independent predictor of AF recurrence in patients with PsAF undergoing RFCA. The long-term success was poor in the subgroups of significant FTR and those with ventricular FTR. Furthermore, successful RFCA was associated with significantly improved FTR in patients with PsAF."

The condition remains diagnostically challenging due to overlapping features with other autoimmune and psychiatric disorders, absence of definitive biomarkers, and variable infectious histories. Objective To describe a diagnostically complex case of PANDAS in a preadolescent girl presenting with concurrent choreiform movements, acute psychosis, and subclinical valvular changes. Case A 12-year-6-month-old previously healthy girl developed sudden-onset involuntary dance-like movements and acute psychiatric symptoms, including auditory hallucinations and bizarre delusions. Neurological examination revealed chorea without focal deficits. Echocardiography showed mild mitral and tricuspid regurgitation. Anti Streptolysin O (ASTO) test was positive, but other Laboratory markers of inflammation were normal. The temporal clustering of symptoms, subtle cardiac findings, positive ASTO test and exclusion of alternative diagnoses supported a working diagnosis of PANDAS. Management included antipsychotic, benzodiazepine, and anticonvulsant therapy, with referral for tertiary evaluation and potential immunomodulation. Conclusion This case emphasizes the importance of early recognition of PANDAS in children with abrupt neuropsychiatric and motor symptom onset, the necessity of thorough differential diagnosis, and the value of multidisciplinary care in optimizing outcomes."

Mitral Annular Calcification (MAC) may adversely affect procedural success and increase post-procedural mitral regurgitation (MR). Objective: To evaluate the impact of Mitral Annular Calcification on post-PTMC outcomes. Methodology: This mixed retrospective and prospective study was conducted at Peshawar Institute of Cardiology from April 2021 to December 2024. A total of 303 patients with severe MS (MVA ≤1.0 cm², mean gradient &gt;10 mmHg) were included. Echocardiographic parameters including Wilkins and commissural scores were assessed. Procedural success was defined as post-PTMC MVA &gt;1.5 cm², ≥50% increase in MVA, and absence of severe MR or major complications. Data were analyzed using SPSS 26. Results: Mean age was 38.88±11.38 years; 80.9% were females. Wilkins score ≤8 was observed in 82.8%, and 63% had no commissural calcium. Mean MVA increased from 0.92±0.16 cm² to 1.8±0.31 cm²; 91.7% achieved procedural success. Severe MR occurred in 11.2%, with one mortality. Commissural score correlated positively with MR (r=0.475, p&lt;0.001) and negatively with MVA (r=–0.398, p&lt;0.001). Patients with commissural score 2 had a 5.24-fold higher risk of severe MR (p=0.027).

OpenAlex,mitral regurgitation,Relative Survival Following TEER for Significant Mitral Regurgitation: A Contemporary Cohort Analysis,Marcel Almendárez; Isaac Pascual; Beatriz Nieves; Rut Álvarez‐Velasco; Alberto Alperi; Rebeca Lorca; Carmen de la Hoz; Víctor León; Luis Carlos Zamayoa; Ismael Rivera; Asier Herrero; Pablo Avanzas,10.3390/jcm14217825,2025-11-04,Journal of Clinical Medicine,"Background/Objectives: Mitral regurgitation (MR) is the most common valvular defect worldwide, with an increasing incidence attributed to the aging population. Transcatheter edge-to-edge repair (TEER) is a viable treatment, but its long-term survival impact, particularly across sexes, remains underexplored. We aimed to assess relative survival (RS) and excess mortality (EM) in patients undergoing TEER for significant MR, with a focus on sex-based differences. Methods: We analyzed 253 patients treated with TEER between October 2015 and August 2024, stratified by sex. Observed survival (OS) was calculated using the actuarial life table method; expected survival (ES) was estimated via the Ederer II method using matched population data. Primary endpoints were RS and EM; secondary endpoints included mortality differences by MR subtype. Results: OS at 1, 2, and 3 years was 88.9%, 87.4%, and 78.9%, respectively. EM peaked in the first year (7.8%) and declined thereafter. RS was lower than in the general population, primarily due to persistently reduced RS and elevated EM in men. Women achieved RS comparable to matched peers from year one. Sex was not an independent predictor of mortality (HR 0.88, 95% CI 0.38–2.03, p = 0.771). Conclusions: In patients with significant MR undergoing TEER, EM was concentrated in the first year. Women reached RS comparable to the general population, while men showed persistent excess mortality. Sex was not independently associated with survival after adjustment."

Individual patient and procedural factors such as age, comorbidities, and aortic manipulation influence stroke risk. This meta-analysis aims to evaluate predictors of stroke risk in patients undergoing CABG. Methods: A comprehensive search was conducted across major databases to identify studies assessing the predictive factors for stroke risk in patients undergoing CABG. Odds ratios (OR) with 95% CIs were pooled using a random effects model, and all analyses were performed using R studio version 4.4.3. Results: A total of 16 studies comprising 123,535 patients were included. Atrial fibrillation, female sex, diabetes mellitus, heart failure, hypertension, cardiovascular disease, peripheral arterial disease, renal failure, carotid bruits, and previous stroke were all significantly associated with an increased risk of stroke, with odds ratios (ORs) ranging from 1.33 to 4.94. Previous strokes (OR: 3.08; 95% CI: 1.98, 4.80) and carotid bruits (OR: 4.94; 95% CI: 2.49, 9.85) showed the strongest associations. However, no significant associations were observed for angina (OR: 1.19; 95% CI: 0.59,2.39), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (OR: 1.41; 95% CI: 0.75, 2.63), myocardial infarction (OR: 1.19; 95% CI: 0.76, 1.87), mitral regurgitation (OR: 1.18; 95% CI: 0.76, 1.84), or previous thoracic surgery (OR: 1.26; 95% CI: 0.59, 2.69). Despite varying degrees of heterogeneity across outcomes, leave-one-out analyses consistently confirmed the robustness of these results, indicating that no individual study significantly altered the overall findings. Conclusion: This meta-analysis identifies key predictors of stroke following CABG, with previous strokes and carotid bruits showing the strongest associations. Recognizing these risk factors enables targeted prevention and management strategies, potentially reducing stroke incidence and improving patient outcomes."
OpenAlex,mitral regurgitation,Abstract 4371805: False-Positive Aortic Intimal Flap on Echocardiography in an Asymptomatic Adolescent: Clinical Correlation Prevents Misdiagnosis,Tapendra Koirala; Siddharth Mahajan; Ryan Jones,10.1161/circ.152.suppl_3.4371805,2025-11-03,Circulation,"Background: Echocardiography is frequently used as a first-line imaging tool for aortic evaluation, but its susceptibility to artifacts can lead to false-positive findings. Aortic dissection is a critical diagnosis that requires confirmation with advanced imaging before initiating treatment. This case report highlights the clinical importance of clinical correlation and confirmatory imaging when echocardiographic findings suggest aortic dissection in the absence of symptoms. Case presentation: A 12-year-old male with a remote history of self-resolving dyspnea and previously noted trivial mitral regurgitation presented for routine follow-up. He was clinically well with no cardiac symptoms, normal vital signs, and an unremarkable physical exam. Echocardiography revealed an apparent intimal flap (Figure 1-3) in the proximal ascending aorta, raising concern for aortic dissection. There was no associated turbulent flow, pericardial effusion, or signs of hemodynamic compromise. Due to the gravity of potential dissection, a contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) aortogram was performed. CT imaging showed normal aortic anatomy with no evidence of dissection, intimal flap, aneurysm, or other structural abnormalities. Retrospective echocardiographic image review suggested the finding was likely an artifact, possibly due to reverberation or suboptimal transducer angulation. A repeat echocardiogram three months later showed a persistent but less prominent artifact. No intervention was required, and the patient remained asymptomatic. Conclusion: This case demonstrates that echocardiographic artifacts can mimic life-threatening conditions such as aortic dissection. CT aortography remains the gold standard in confirming aortic pathology, particularly in cases where echocardiographic findings are incongruent with the clinical presentation. Incorporating clinical judgment and confirmatory imaging prevents unnecessary anxiety, testing, and interventions, especially in pediatric patients."
OpenAlex,mitral regurgitation,Abstract 4343741: Massive Aortic Root Thrombus and Coronary Embolization in a Heart Transplant Recipient on Venoarterial Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation (VA-ECMO) for Graft Dysfunction: An Imaging Case Report,Chun Kit Wong; Kent H. Rehfeldt,10.1161/circ.152.suppl_3.4343741,2025-11-03,Circulation,"A 44-year-old recent heart transplant recipient supported by VA-ECMO presented to the operating room (OR) for left ventricular (LV) vent removal. She had a history of double-inlet LV with right atrioventricular valve atresia and transposition of great arteries, status post fenestrated Fontan complicated by end-stage heart failure. Three days ago, she underwent a fourth sternotomy and orthotopic heart transplant complicated by coagulopathy and severe bi-ventricular dysfunction necessitating initiation of central VA-ECMO. Due to massive blood product transfusion and ventricular dilatation, an apical LV vent was inserted. Postoperatively the arterial line waveform remained non-pulsatile. The patient was brought to the OR for mediastinal debridement and removal of the LV vent for the purpose of assessing ventricular function and improving arterial pulsatility. Pulse pressure remained negligible at an ECMO flow of 4.5 L/min. Transeosphageal echocardiography (TEE) demonstrated extensive thrombosis of the aortic root, particularly involving the right and non-coronary sinuses (Fig 1a). The aortic valve (AV) did not open. Patency of the left main coronary ostium was evident by color Doppler (Fig 1b) although no right coronary artery (RCA) flow could be visualized. The tip of LV vent was seen tenting the anterior leaflet of mitral valve (MV) causing significant regurgitation. (Fig. 2a-d) After vent removal, LV contraction gradually increased and the AV began to open. This progressively dislodged thrombus from the aortic root. At the conclusion of imaging, there was a highly mobile, bi-lobed thrombus attached to the sinotubular junction (Fig 1c-d). Right ventricular (RV) function remained severely reduced. Moderate mitral regurgitation persisted, arising from A2 leaflet prolapse. This patient subsequently underwent transcatheter thrombectomy and aspiration of the aortic root with cerebral protection device. Coronary angiogram confirmed proximal RCA occlusion (Fig. 3). Attempts to remove RCA thrombus were only partially successful. She eventually required a second heart transplant due to RV infarction. Discussion: This case illustrates a TEE-detected complication of excessive LV venting during VA-ECMO support, namely aortic root thrombosis associated with lack of AV opening. TEE also demonstrated the associated complications of RCA occlusion and iatrogenic mitral valve injury. Unfortunately, these complications were not detected soon enough to avoid RV infarction."

Kevin Heist; Dan Blendea,10.1161/circ.152.suppl_3.4367285,2025-11-03,Circulation,"Background: Functional mitral regurgitation (FMR), both atrial (AFMR) and ventricular (VFMR), results from multiple interacting mechanisms including atrial and ventricular remodeling, changes in mitral annular geometry, leaflet tethering, and heart rate variability. The relative contribution of each factor to FMR severity remains unclear. Purpose: We aimed to assess the short-term effect of a one-time change (shock) in each FMR determinant on the evolution of MR severity and other variables. Additionally, we quantified how much of the variance in MR severity is explained by shocks to its known etiological factors. Methods: Transthoracic echocardiography was used to evaluate FMR in 26 patients, yielding 810 systolic timestamps (583 for the AFMR group and 227 for the VFMR group, 30 fps). For each frame, we recorded RR interval, MR jet area, LA and LV volumes, MV annular diameter, and tenting height. We estimated vector autoregression (VAR) models separately in AFMR and VFMR groups, followed by Forecast Error Variance Decomposition (FEVD) up to step 8 (~264 msec). The FEVD at step 8 quantified the percent of MR variance attributable to each variable. To assess statistical significance, we repeated VARs for each variable pair and visually evaluated impulse response function (IRF) plots: a variable was considered significant if its IRF 95% CI excluded 0. Results: FEVD revealed high self-persistence: most variables primarily explained their own future values. LV volume emerged as a key upstream influencer across the network, while MR area had limited predictive power (Figure 1A, C). In AFMR, MR area was largely self-driven (92.7%) with modest contributions from LV volume (3.2%) and tenting height (2.4%) (Figure 1B). IRF plots showed that only MR area, LA volume, and LV volume had statistically significant effects on MR area (Figure 2). In VFMR, MR area remained self-driven (83.9%), but external contributions were stronger: RR (6.3%), tenting height (3.6%), and MV annulus (3.1%) (Figure 1D). Only MR area, tenting height, and LV volume showed significant IRF effects (Figure 3). Conclusions: In AFMR, short-term MR variability appears driven by LA and LV volume, though LV volume shows a stronger effect, possibly due to transient ventricular changes being more detectable than slow atrial remodeling. In VFMR, MR variability is shaped primarily by tenting height and LV volume, reinforcing the role of subvalvular tethering and dynamic loading in VFMR pathophysiology."
OpenAlex,mitral regurgitation,Abstract 4369952: A Royal Flush: A Unique Case of Carcinoid Heart Disease Manifesting in a Rare Fashion as Quadruple Valve Involvement,Elise Fraser; L. Leonardo Rodriguez; Anand Mehta; Shinya Unai; Ben Alencherry,10.1161/circ.152.suppl_3.4369952,2025-11-03,Circulation,"A 56-year-old woman presented to her primary care physician with a 1-year history of facial flushing and short-lived paroxysms of chest pain. An electrocardiogram was performed which showed normal sinus rhythm and p-mitrale. Transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) revealed normal left ventricle (LV) size and function, moderate to severe aortic regurgitation, moderate mitral regurgitation (MR), moderate tricuspid regurgitation (TR), and mild pulmonic regurgitation. An agitated saline study suggested an intrapulmonary shunt (positive after &gt;10 beats). Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (CMR) confirmed these findings but reclassified the TR and MR as severe and the LV as dilated. CMR also incidentally noted numerous complex hepatic masses, largest measuring 6cm. Dedicated liver MRI confirmed this, and biopsy showed strong, diffusely positive staining for neuroendocrine markers, consistent with a well-differentiated neuroendocrine tumor (carcinoid). Positron Emission Tomography/Computed Tomography (PET/CT) revealed high uptake in the pancreatic head, cecum, and right scapula in addition to known liver lesions. Treatment with octreotide was initiated after obtaining a baseline serum serotonin level 1489 ng/mL (normal 50-220 ng/mL). The patient reported mild symptoms and NT Pro BNP was elevated at 265 pg/mL (normal &lt;125 pg/mL). Given LV dilation, severe valve disease, and likely concealed symptoms, cardiac surgery consultation was pursued. Transesophageal echocardiogram with moderate sedation was deferred due to risk of carcinoid crisis. In coordination with oncology, surgery was scheduled after initiating octreotide. Preoperative octreotide infusion was administered, and she underwent four-valve replacement with bioprostheses. Intraoperatively, all four valves had thickened, retracted leaflets; a 7 mm patent foramen ovale (PFO) was also identified and closed. Pathology of valve specimens showed extracellular plaque deposition and bland spindle cells, consistent with carcinoid valve disease. The patient had an uneventful postoperative course. Carcinoid heart disease is a rare, morbid manifestation of neuroendocrine tumors, mediated by elevated serotonin and other vasoactive substances causing fibrotic valve dysfunction. It usually affects right-sided valves, but left-sided involvement may occur with intracardiac shunt or pulmonary metastases. This case illustrates the multidisciplinary diagnosis and management of an exceedingly rare form of carcinoid heart disease."

Pressman,10.1161/circ.152.suppl_3.4362147,2025-11-03,Circulation,"Background: Mitral annular calcification (MAC) is a chronic inflammatory condition that is associated with future cardiovascular events. There is limited data that explores how MAC impacts outcomes in patients with pre-existing mitral regurgitation (MR). Methods: This is a retrospective analysis using the TriNetX US Collaborative Network database. A database of hospitalized patients ≥50 years was queried using ICD-10 and TriNetX curated codes. We identified those given a discharge diagnosis of MR between 2020-2023, excluding patients with rheumatic mitral valve disease or ESRD. We then stratified by presence/absence of a new diagnosis of MAC (occurring after MR diagnosis). Cohorts were balanced for socio-demographics, body mass index, and common comorbidities including hypertension, hyperlipidemia, diabetes, and tobacco use, with a standard difference of &lt;0.1 considered to indicate adequate balancing. Hazard ratios were calculated for outcomes, with a P&lt;0.05 considered significant. Results: Our query yielded 11,462 patients in the MAC group and 450,474 patients in the no MAC group. Following propensity matching, each group had 11,462 patients. All targeted variables were adequately balanced. Average age was similar in both the MAC and no MAC groups (76 years vs 75.8 years). The populations were majority white (80.3% vs 81.2%) and female (56.8% vs 57.0%). BMI was also similar (29.2 vs 28.7). Among patients with pre-existing MR, subsequently diagnosed MAC was associated with increased 1-year risk of hospitalization (HR 1.22, 95%CI 1.180-1.262, p&lt;0.0001), ICU admission (HR 1.38, 95%CI 1.250-1.524, p&lt;0.0001), ischemic heart disease (HR 1.446, 95%CI 1.289-1.622, p&lt;0.0001), new onset HFpEF (HR 1.286, 95%CI 1.160-1.425, p&lt;0.0001), cerebrovascular disease (HR 1.341, 95%CI 1.190-1.512, p&lt;0.0001), prosthetic valve replacement (HR 2.126, 95%CI 1.786-2.530, p&lt;0.0001), and mitral stenosis (HR 3.16, 95%CI 2.490-5.234, p&lt;0.0001). There was not a significant difference between groups for HFrEF (HR 0.955, p=0.4377), cardiogenic shock (HR 1.188, p=0.1098), or cardiac arrest (HR 1.155, p=0.1979). Conclusions: In patients with previously diagnosed MR, a subsequent diagnosis of MAC was associated with increased 1-year risk of hospitalization, new onset ischemic heart disease or HFpEF, and a variety of other adverse cardiovascular outcomes."

Lund; Frieder Braunschweig; Peter Svenarud; Magnus Dalén; Bahira Shahim,10.1161/circ.152.suppl_3.4368255,2025-11-03,Circulation,"Background: New-onset postoperative atrial fibrillation or flutter (POAF) is a known complication following mitral valve surgery in patients with mitral valve prolapse (MVP) and mitral regurgitation (MR). Aim: To characterize the types, clinical correlates, and long-term outcomes of POAF in patients undergoing mitral valve surgery for degenerative MR. Methods: Patients with MVP and moderate or severe degenerative MR who underwent mitral valve surgery between 2010-2024 at Karolinska University Hospital were included. Data were extracted from electronic medical records, ECGs, and echocardiograms. Comprehensive outcome tracking was performed with no patients lost to follow-up. Patients were excluded if they had prior atrial fibrillation/flutter, mitral stenosis, rheumatic mitral valve disease, endocarditis, or prior mitral valve surgery. Cox regression was adjusted for age, sex, BMI, hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, diabetes, hemoglobin, prior PCI or CABG, eGFR, NYHA class, pulmonary hypertension, LVEF, and mitral valve repair vs replacement. Results: Among 786 patients, 49.7% developed POAF, 82.4% during the index hospitalization. Most events were paroxysmal 89.5%, persistent 6.1%, and permanent 4.3%. Patients with POAF were older, more often in NYHA class III-IV, had lower LVEF and elevated pulmonary artery systolic pressures compared to those without POAF. No differences were observed in preoperative left atrial volume index, MR severity, MVP etiology or anticoagulation use between the groups. Patients with POAF were less likely to have undergone mitral valve repair, had longer cardiopulmonary bypass and cross-clamp time, and more frequently underwent concomitant CABG or tricuspid valve intervention. During a median follow-up time of 4.4 years, POAF was independently associated with increased risk of heart failure hospitalization, permanent pacemaker implantation and mitral valve reoperation, Figure. There were no significant associations with endocarditis, stroke or all-cause mortality. Conclusions: POAF occurred in nearly half of all patients undergoing mitral valve surgery for degenerative MR, most commonly in paroxysmal form during the index hospitalization. POAF was associated with worse preoperative status, more complex surgical procedures, and significantly increased long-term risk of heart failure, pacemaker implantation and reoperation. These findings highlight the need for strategies to prevent and manage POAF in this high-risk population."

Mensch; Malte Kuniss; Thomas Neumann; Andreas Rieth; Julia Treiber; Samuel Sossalla; Andreas Hain,10.1161/circ.152.suppl_3.4357473,2025-11-03,Circulation,"Background: Arrhythmia-induced cardiomyopathy (AIC) is a potentially reversible cause of heart failure triggered by sustained arrhythmias. Its true real-world prevalence and clinical recognition remain limited. This study aimed to assess the frequency, predictors, and outcomes of AIC in patients with newly diagnosed left ventricular systolic dysfunction (LVSD) and concurrent arrhythmia, undergoing rhythm control while protected by a wearable cardioverter-defibrillator (WCD). Methods: We analyzed 780 patients treated with a WCD between 2017 and 2023. Among them, patients with newly diagnosed idiopathic LVSD (LVEF &lt;35%) and arrhythmias (atrial fibrillation, flutter, or ventricular ectopy &gt;20%) were identified. Diagnostic workup included echocardiography, cardiac MRI, and ischemia testing or coronary angiography. Patients underwent rhythm control (cardioversion, antiarrhythmic drugs, and/or catheter ablation) and were followed up to 6 months. AIC was defined as LVEF improvement &gt;15% in patients with restored sinus rhythm. Results: Among 780 patients treated with a WCD, 142 (18.2%) had first diagnosis of LVSD in the presence of arrhythmia (Figure 1). Of these, 68 (47.9%) had an identifiable etiology (Figure 2). The remaining 74 (52.1%) with idiopathic LVSD were analyzed. At mean follow-up of 133 days (4.5 months), 20 (27%) of 74 patients remained in arrhythmia (non-responders). Among 54 responders with restored sinus rhythm, 32 (59.3%) fulfilled AIC criteria; 22 (40.7%) were non-AIC. LVEF improved from 28% to 43% in AIC vs. 24% to 32% in non-AIC. Full recovery (LVEF &gt;50%) was achieved in 56.3% of AIC patients during follow-up. Atrial fibrillation was most common (81.3% AIC vs. 95.5% non-AIC), followed by flutter; ventricular ectopy occurred in 9.4% of AIC cases. Heart failure therapy was comparable. Non-AIC patients showed larger LVEDD/LVESD, lower heart rates, more mitral regurgitation, and more frequent late gadolinium enhancement on MRI. No appropriate WCD shocks occurred. ICDs were implanted in 36.4% of non-AIC vs. 3.1% of AIC patients (p=0.001). No deaths were reported. LVEF &lt;25% predicted lack of full recovery (p=0.04). Conclusions: AIC is a common and reversible form of LVSD in patients with arrhythmia and newly diagnosed idiopathic cardiomyopathy. Early rhythm control supported by WCD, combined with detailed diagnostics including cardiac MRI and ischemia testing, enables identification of reversible dysfunction and may reduce unnecessary ICD implantation."

Transcatheter mitral valve-in-valve (ViV) implantation is a challenging but increasingly viable option, especially in high-risk patients. We report a complex mitral ViV procedure in a 78-year-old woman with multiple comorbidities and severe mitral bioprosthetic valve failure. Case Report: A 78-year-old woman with a history of RHD and surgical MVR 12 years prior was readmitted for progressive dyspnea (NYHA III) and pulmonary edema despite high-dose diuretics. Past history included hypertension, atrial fibrillation, chronic kidney disease (Cr=3.0 mg/dL), and VVi pacemaker. Catheterization revealed severe pulmonary venocapillary hypertension (27 mmHg), moderate pulmonary artery hypertension (59×22 [35] mmHg), and elevated right atrial pressure (19 mmHg). Transesophageal echo showed severe regurgitation of a severely calcified mitral bioprosthesis (external effective annulus=26 mm). Left ventricle (LV) outflow tract obstruction risk was low (area: 292 mm 2 ). STS-PROM mortality for surgical reintervention was 8.2%. The heart team opted for mitral ViV with a Sapien Ultra 29mm valve. Using a Swartz 8F sheath and BRK needle, a posteroinferior transseptal puncture was performed, and a 0.035"" guidewire was advanced to the LV and exchanged for a pigtail catheter. A Safari extra-support guide was then positioned in the LV, and a second stiff wire was placed in the superior left pulmonary vein. Due to difficulty advancing the prosthesis, sequential septal dilations were performed with 8.0 mm and 10.0 mm balloons. The Sapien Ultra was then advanced across the septum but could not cross the stenotic surgical valve. The wire was repositioned from the pulmonary vein to the LV, and valvuloplasty was done with a 20×30 mm AltoSa balloon. The valve was then successfully navigated and implanted under rapid pacing with nominal deployment. Post-procedure 3D echo confirmed good valve dynamics with a mean gradient of 2 mmHg and visualization of a ruptured surgical leaflet. At 4-month follow-up, the patient remains in NYHA class I, with no adverse events. Conclusion: This case illustrates the feasibility of mitral ViV in RHD with severe prosthetic calcification. Preprocedural planning, balloon preparation, and wire strategy were critical for success. The Sapien Ultra prosthesis provided excellent hemodynamic results in a high-risk patient."

Chang; Howard Goldschmidt; Suneet Mittal; Rajiv Tayal,10.1161/circ.152.suppl_3.4362838,2025-11-03,Circulation,"Description of Case: An 81-year old-female with paroxysmal atrial fibrillation (AF) and severe aortic stenosis presented with AF with rapid ventricular response and volume overload. She had undergone an uncomplicated transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) 14 days prior with post procedure echocardiogram (TTE) demonstrating ejection fraction greater than 70%, a mean gradient across the TAVR valve of 11 mmHg, and mild mitral regurgitation (MR). Management included diuresis, rate control, and a failed cardioversion. TEE at the time of cardioversion, while tachycardic, demonstrated systolic anterior motion of the mitral valve (SAM) but no gradient across the aortic valve. She underwent atrioventricular (AV) junction ablation and placement of a left bundle branch area pacing (LBBAP) lead. Immediately post-procedure, she developed acute dyspnea and a new systolic murmur. Right heart catheterization revealed pulmonary artery pressure 90/30 mmHg and wedge pressure 39 mmHg with a prominent v-wave, and cardiac index of 1.6 L/min/m 2 . A simultaneous LV-AO pressure tracing demonstrated a gradient of 52 mmHg. TTE revealed a late-peaking doppler signal across the aortic valve with a peak velocity of 4 m/s, SAM, and severe MR. An Impella CP was placed for circulatory support. TTE revealed the LBBAP lead was adjacent to a 1.8 cm basal septal bulge (Figure 1). The next day, a transvenous RV apical pacing lead was placed, and simulatenous LV-AO pressure tracing revealed a peak-to-peak gradient of 45 mmHg during LBBAP, which immediately decreased to 5 mmHg with RV apical pacing (Figure 2). This led to a decrease in MR from severe to mild. Given the dynamic nature of the obstruction, alcohol septal ablation was performed. The Impella CP was removed and vasopressors were weaned. A permanent RV apical lead was added and used for pacing. The patient remained hemodynamically stable and was discharged to rehabilitation. Discussion: This case highlights a report of dynamic left ventricular outflow tract (LVOT) obstruction precipitated by LBBAP in a patient post-TAVR who previously did not have evidence of LVOT obstruction. Previously, RV apical pacing was a seldom used treatment for obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. Changing the pacing location to RV apical pacing instantly resolved the LVOT obstruction highlighting the need to be wary of pacing strategies in post TAVR patients who may have septal hypertrophy and may be at risk of LVOT obstruction secondary to LBBAP."

Studies have showed trace element concentrations varied in patients with AF and may be involved in the pathogenesis of AF. However, no data is currently available for those with VHD. Methods Urine samples as well as clinical data were collected from 72 VHD patients with AF (VHDAF) and 72 VHD patients without AF (VHD) and further analyzed for a panel of trace elements: lithium, manganese, cobalt, copper, zinc, arsenic, selenium, strontium, Cadmium, mercury, thallium, lead. Quantile g-computation was adopted to explore the joint effect of the 12 trace elements on AF in this population, and internal validation was performed using 1,000 bootstrap re-samples. Results Compared with the VHD group, Sr levels were reduced, while Mn, Cu and Hg concentrations were increased in the VHDAF group. Quantile g-computation model indicated a significant association between the mixtures of the 12 urinary trace elements and AF in patients with heart valve disease (adjusted OR: 2.051; 95% CI: 1.180–3.565; p = 0.011). Positive partial effect was owing to Cu (weight: 0.43) and Hg (weight: 0.18), while negative partial effect mainly attributed to Sr (weight: 0.43) and Li (weight: 0.23). Conclusion VHDAF patients had higher Cu levels and lower Sr levels, and the two elements have been supposed to exert the largest influence on AF. Further research is needed to establish the causal relationships."
OpenAlex,valvular heart disease,Chronic Mitral Valve Fibrosis in Rheumatic Heart Disease: From Immune Trigger to Inflammatory and Mechanical Progression,Zhou Liu; Ruifei Liu; Jiajun Liang; Maozhou Wang; Meili Wang; Hongjia Zhang; Wenjian Jiang,10.1161/jaha.125.045169,2025-11-06,Journal of the American Heart Association,"Rheumatic heart disease is a chronic valvular disorder resulting from acute rheumatic fever, predominantly affecting the mitral valve and characterized by progressive fibrotic thickening. Although the initial insult is driven by autoimmune responses triggered by Group A Streptococcus infection, the sustained progression of valvular fibrosis involves a complex interplay of persistent immune activation, chronic inflammation, and, critically, long‐term mechanical stress. Mechanical forces arising from altered hemodynamics and structural valve deformation perpetuate valvular interstitial cell activation, endothelial‐to‐mesenchymal transition, and extracellular matrix remodeling, thereby driving fibrosis even after acute inflammation resolves. Current therapeutic options to halt or reverse mitral valve fibrosis are limited, with surgical repair or replacement remaining the primary interventions for advanced disease. Advancing mechanistic understanding through physiologically relevant models, coupled with early diagnostic strategies and multitargeted antifibrotic approaches, holds promise for preserving valve function. Integrating molecular insights with scalable public health measures may ultimately mitigate the global burden of rheumatic heart disease and improve outcomes for affected populations."
OpenAlex,valvular heart disease,Insights into preclinical models of calcific aortic valve disease and their translational potential,Isabelle Lafosse; Romuald Mentaverri; Carine Avondo; Youssef Bennis; Christophe Tribouilloy; Lucie Hénaut,10.3389/fcvm.2025.1621990,2025-11-06,Frontiers in Cardiovascular Medicine,"Calcific aortic valve disease (CAVD) is characterized by a fibrocalcific remodeling of the aortic valve. This pathology is the most prevalent valvular heart disease worldwide and is associated with a poor prognosis. Despite extensive research, no pharmacological treatments are available to slow or reverse valvular degeneration, making aortic valve replacement the only current therapeutic option. This lack of clinical success may stem from an incomplete understanding of the disease's mechanisms and the limitations of current preclinical models, which do not fully replicate the complexity of CAVD and its associated risk factors and comorbidities. Indeed, while existing models offer valuable insights, a deeper understanding of CAVD requires incorporating comorbidities, gender-specific mechanisms, and dynamic cellular and tissue-level changes. This review aims to provide the reader with an overview of preclinical models developed in recent years to study CAVD, assessing their strengths and limitations. We review how these models can be used to mimic and/or investigate the cellular and molecular mechanisms involved in CAVD development, and highlight how key risk factors and comorbidities can be incorporated to enhance the translational potential of research. We hope that this approach will help guide researchers in selecting the most appropriate model for their studies, with the goal of advancing the identification of effective therapeutic candidates."

OpenAlex,valvular heart disease,A zebrafish model of chronic heart failure caused by protein aggregation in heart valves,Yitong Li; S. Maegawa; Ryo Kimura; Shu Suzuki; Taiki Nishimura; Masahiko Ajiro,10.1038/s42003-025-08882-3,2025-11-04,Communications Biology,"Abstract We previously developed a unique zebrafish, tomato , expressing the red fluorescent protein DsRed under the control of the tph2 promoter. Unexpectedly, the tomato fish showed cardiac dilation and symptoms resembling those of chronic heart failure. Therefore, we investigate the pathogenesis and causes of these cardiac abnormalities. Crossbreeding suggests a link between DsRed expression and heart enlargement. Histological analysis confirms atrial dilation and thickening of the atrioventricular valve. RNA sequencing and immunohistological imaging reveal that valve thickness is due to the upregulated inflammation, cell proliferation, and epithelial-mesenchymal transition. Importantly, immunohistological staining elucidates DsRed accumulation in the atrioventricular valve, and removal of DsRed via Cre-mRNA injection rescues these heart defects. This study establishes a potential model of heart failure caused by protein aggregation in the cardiac valve. These findings highlight the potential of this transgenic zebrafish for investigating valvular heart diseases and chronic heart failure and developing new therapies."
OpenAlex,valvular heart disease,Abstract 4367684: The wandering stent: Tricuspid Valve Injury from a Migrated Endovascular Stent,Alfredo Mora Guevara; Jack A. Cannon; Daniel A. Ricketti; Ayobamidele Balogun,10.1161/circ.152.suppl_3.4367684,2025-11-03,Circulation,"Introduction: Endovascular stents are commonly used for vascular access in patients undergoing hemodialysis. While these devices are generally safe, rare but serious complications such as stent migration and associated endocarditis can occur. Migration into cardiac chambers has been reported, often requiring surgical intervention due to the high risk of valvular damage. Case presentation: A 71-year-old male with a medical history of end-stage kidney disease on dialysis and hyperlipidemia, presented with fevers and shortness of breath. On presentation vital signs were notable for tachycardia. Sepsis was suspected, and blood cultures grew Streptococcus gallolyticus, and subsequently started on Ceftriaxone. Echocardiogram revealed a large, migrated endovascular stent in the right atrium, measuring approximately 6 cm × 1.4 cm. Stent appeared to be attached to the anterior leaflet of the tricuspid valve. Left ventricular function ejection fraction was 55%. No vegetations or pericardial effusion were appreciated. Patient reported undergoing an uncomplicated creation of the left arm fistula with vascular stent approximately two years prior. Percutaneous retrieval was attempted twice unsuccessfully. Later, his course was complicated by cardiac tamponade requiring pericardiocentesis, with drainage of approximately 550 mL of sanguineous fluid. This complication was suspected due to myocardial microperforation during the attempted stent retrieval. Following hemodynamic stabilization, the patient underwent cardiac surgery with successful removal of the migrated stent and bioprosthetic tricuspid valve replacement. He then completed a full course of antibiotics for bacteremia and was discharged to a physical rehabilitation facility. Discussion: Stent migration into the heart is a rare but potentially life-threatening complication. It’s commonly associated with improper sizing, placement, or vessel wall degradation over time. Once in the cardiac chambers, stents can cause mechanical damage, serve as a nidus for infection, and impair valvular function. While percutaneous retrieval is typically the first-line approach, surgical intervention is often necessary when complications like tamponade or valve involvement occur. This case calls attention to the importance of long-term monitoring of intravascular devices, especially in patients with dialysis access, and highlights the need and importance for multidisciplinary management when complications arise."
OpenAlex,valvular heart disease,Abstract 4360993: Phenotypic Sex-Based Differences in Left Ventricular Geometry in Chronic Aortic Regurgitation,Anika Sonig; Lydia DeAngelo; Richard H. Grimm; L. Leonardo Rodriguez; Brian P. Griffin; Zoran Popović; David Chen; Christopher Nguyen; Deborah Kwon,10.1161/circ.152.suppl_3.4360993,2025-11-03,Circulation,"Background: Chronic Aortic Regurgitation (AR), a prevalent form of valvular heart disease, is associated with significant mortality and morbidity if left untreated. Emerging studies demonstrate significant sex-specific differences in AR presentation and clinical outcomes, yet current management guidelines do not account for these sex differences. Additionally, females with AR tend to exhibit increased symptoms despite reduced ventricular volume and preserved function. Research Question: How do left ventricular structure and geometry differ between sexes across varying severities of AR? Methods: A single-center, retrospective cohort study was conducted and included patients with an aortic regurgitant fraction &gt;20% by cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) or ≥ moderate AR by echocardiography. AR severity was quantified using regurgitant fraction (ARFrac) thresholds, quantified by CMR (Mild: ARFrac &lt; 20, Moderate: 20 ≤ ARFrac ≤ 33, Severe: ARFrac &gt; 33). Cardiac geometry measured by CMR was determined using LV mass index (LVMassi), left ventricular end diastolic diameter indexed (LVEDDi), LV end systolic diameter index (LVESDi), interventricular septal thickness (IVS), posterior wall thickness (PWT), LV length, and derived indices including relative wall thickness (RWT) and sphericity. Volumetric measures included LVEDVi, LVESVi, and LVEF. Comparisons were stratified by sex, and significance was assessed using Wilcoxon rank-sum tests. Results: We evaluated 370 patients with AR, 63 female (17%), median age of 51 years. See Table 1 for the comparisons of age, hypertension, diabetes, ARFrac, and LV morphologic features stratified by sex. Radar plots significant sex differences in morphologic features across varying AR severity levels (mild, moderate, and severe). Opposite changes in RWT and sphericity were present in the setting of severe AR, based on sex. Conclusion: There are evident sex-specific differences in AR LV remodeling. Males exhibit more chamber dilation with increased sphericity and RWT with severe AR, while females maintain smaller, with decreased sphericity and increased RWT in the setting of severe AR. These differences may contribute to disparities in symptom presentation and AR severity. Recognizing sex-based remodeling patterns may inform the future development of more personalized clinical guidelines for AR management, including risk stratification and surgical referral thresholds."
OpenAlex,valvular heart disease,Abstract 4346565: The inhibition of ATP citrate lyase prevents pathological cardiac fibrosis via the regulation of de novo lipogenesis and histone acetylation,Naoya Kuwahara; Manabu Nagao; Masakazu Shinohara; Kenta Kaneshiro; Tatsuro Ishida; Hiromasa Otake,10.1161/circ.152.suppl_3.4346565,2025-11-03,Circulation,"Background: Cardiac fibrosis is characterized by excessive extracellular matrix deposition in heart tissue that occurs early in heart failure (HF) and is caused not only by cardiac diseases such as ischemic heart disease and valvular diseases but also by lifestyle diseases such as hypertension and diabetes. Therefore, the inhibition of cardiac fibrosis has been considered an important therapeutic approach for treating HF. ATP citrate lyase (ACLY) is a key metabolic enzyme that converts mitochondria-derived citrate into acetyl-CoA. ACLY is essential for de novo lipogenesis (DNL) and histone acetylation, needs for cellular growth and organ fibrosis. Although fatty acids are required for energy production and biomass synthesis in the heart, the biological roles and regulatory mechanisms of ACLY-mediated DNL in pathological cardiac fibrosis remain largely unknown. Hypothesis: The inhibition of ACLY reduces pathological cardiac fibrosis by suppress DNL and histone acetylation. Methods: Adeno-associated virus serotype 9 (AAV9)-mediated shRNA targeting Acly was intravenously injected into C57BL/6J male mice from the retro-orbital sinus. The mice were subsequently continuously infused with a mixture of angiotensin II (AngII) and phenylephrine (PE) for two weeks. Cardiac phenotypes were evaluated via histological staining. Cell migration assays, stable isotope tracing with 13C-labeled glucose, and chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays were performed using human cardiac fibroblasts (HCFs). Results: ACLY expression was upregulated in the heart sections of mice treated with AngII/PE, especially in fibrotic areas. Masson’s trichrome staining and immunoblots revealed that gene silencing of Acly significantly reduced cardiac fibrosis and the expression of fibrous proteins in these mice. And gene silencing of Acly improves prognosis. SiRNA-mediated ACLY knockdown suppressed the proliferation and expression of fibrous proteins in cultured HCFs stimulated with transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β). Mechanistically, ACLY inhibition reduced DNL, limiting the fatty acid supply essential for cellular growth and proliferation; it also decreased H3K9 and H3K27 acetylation, in addition to the presence of acetylated H3K9 and H3K27 at the promoter regions of fibrotic genes. Conclusion: Our findings demonstrated that ACLY plays pivotal roles in promoting pathological cardiac fibrosis. Targeting ACLY may emerge as a novel therapeutic strategy to prevent the progression of HF."

Bohra; Aishwarya Yamparala; Kyle Gobeil,10.1161/circ.152.suppl_3.4361536,2025-11-03,Circulation,"Background: Understanding cardiovascular mortality is key for shaping public health priorities. Two major sources in the U.S.—CDC WONDER and the Global Burden of Disease (GBD) study—report mortality differently. While CDC WONDER reflects death certificate data, GBD employs modeling techniques and redistributes ill-defined (""garbage"") codes to improve cause of death attribution. Prior comparisons have focused on ischemic heart disease and stroke, but other cardiovascular conditions remain understudied. Methods: We examined trends in valvular heart disease (I34.0-I37.9), hypertensive heart disease (I11.0, I11.9), peripheral arterial disease (I70.2), infective endocarditis (I38), and aortic aneurysm (I71) using both databases from 1999–2020. Annual U.S. mortality data from GBD and CDC WONDER were analyzed. For each condition, absolute deaths and crude mortality rates (CMRs) per 100,000 population were extracted. Percent change from 1999 to 2020 was calculated. CMRs were reported with 95% uncertainty intervals (UI) for GBD and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for CDC WONDER. Results: Substantial differences were found between the databases. Valvular heart disease deaths rose by 38.8% (GBD) and 32.2% (CDC). CMRs increased from 7.15 (UI: 7.62–6.18) to 8.33 (9.12–6.74) in GBD and from 11.8 (CI: 11.7–11.9) to 13.2 (13.1–13.4) in CDC. Hypertensive heart disease exhibited the most pronounced increase where deaths rose by 147.2% (GBD) and 474.7% (CDC). GBD CMRs rose from 10.6 (11.2–9.46) to 22.0 (23.62–19.21); CDC from 8.9 (9.2–8.9) to 43.8 (44.3–43.8). Peripheral arterial disease deaths rose 20.9% (GBD) but fell 50.4% (CDC). CMRs changed from 3.21 (3.45–2.82) to 3.26 (3.55–2.78) in GBD and from 0.6 (0.6–0.7) to 0.3 (0.3–0.3) in CDC. Infective endocarditis deaths increased by 41.9% (GBD) and 36.4% (CDC). CMRs rose from 2.4 (2.53–2.17) to 2.86 (3.07–2.50) in GBD and from 3.3 (3.4–3.3) to 3.8 (3.9–3.8) in CDC. Aortic aneurysm deaths declined 31.6% (GBD) and 18.9% (CDC). GBD CMRs fell from 6.19 (6.45–5.63) to 3.55 (3.76–3.15); CDC from 7.9 (8.0–7.8) to 5.4 (5.5–5.3). Conclusion: Cardiovascular mortality trends varied significantly between GBD and CDC WONDER. Differences were especially striking in hypertensive heart disease and peripheral arterial disease, likely due to methodological variation in death coding and redistribution. Awareness of these discrepancies is crucial for interpreting national mortality data and informing policy."

Marchlinski,10.1161/circ.152.suppl_3.4337942,2025-11-03,Circulation,"Background: Non-ischemic cardiomyopathy (NICM) patients with heart failure (HF) undergoing ventricular tachycardia (VT) ablation are at risk for long-term HF events. Left ventricular (LV) endocardial unipolar (Uni) and/or bipolar (Bi) low voltage areas (LVA) at ablation indicate abnormal myocardium, and their extent may predict HF events. Objective: To evaluate and compare the prognostic ability of endocardial Uni-LVA and Bi-LVA for the prediction of HF outcomes in NICM patients undergoing VT ablation. Methods: NICM and HF patients undergoing VT ablation between Jan 2020 and Dec 2023 at the Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania were included. Exclusions were ARVC, HCM, valvular disease, prior cardiac surgery. Uni-LVA was defined as &lt;8.27mV and Bi-LVA &lt;1.5mV during sinus/paced rhythm. Patients were followed at 6 weeks post-ablation, then at 6-month intervals. The HF outcomes included death, LVAD implant, heart transplant, or HF hospitalization. Patients were grouped into mild, moderate, and severe tertiles based on the extent of Uni-LVA and Bi-LVA. The association between tertiles and HF outcome was assessed by Cox regression, adjusted for age, sex, CKD, and LVEF. Results: A total of 137 patients with NICM and HF (mean age 62±12 years; 22.6% women) underwent VT ablation and LV endocardial voltage mapping. Of those, 129 had HFrEF (LVEF 30.5±10.8) and 8 had HFpEF (LVEF 56.5±4.4). Median Bi-LVA was 12.9% [IQR 5.4, 22.5] of the total LV endocardial surface. Bi-LVA tertiles were &lt;8% (mild), 8-18.5% (moderate), &gt;18.5% (severe). Median Uni-LVA was 50.1% [IQR 27.8, 76.5] of the total endocardial LV surface. Uni-LVA tertiles were &lt;35% (mild), 35–68% (moderate), &gt;68% (severe). HF outcomes occurred in 51 (37.2%) patients over a median follow-up of 2.6 years [IQR 1.8, 4.6]. HF outcome incidence was similar between mild Bi-LVA (24.4%, reference) and moderate Bi-LVA (30.4%, HR=0.77, 95%CI: 0.34–1.74, p=0.5), but significantly higher in severe Bi-LVA (56.5%, HR=2.8, 95%CI: 1.3–5.7, p=0.005). HF outcome incidence was 13.3% in mild Uni-LVA (reference), and significantly increased in moderate Uni-LVA (41.3%, HR=2.96, 95%CI: 1.1–7.6, p=0.02) and severe Uni-LVA (56.5%, HR=4.4, 95%CI: 1.7–10.9, p&lt;0.001). Conclusions: The extent of endocardial LVA, particularly unipolar abnormalities, noted during VT ablation in NICM patients is a prognostic indicator for late HF outcomes. Even moderate degrees of Uni-LVA are associated with a threefold increase in the risk of late HF outcomes."

Hsu,10.1161/circ.152.suppl_3.4367249,2025-11-03,Circulation,"Background: Rhythm control with catheter ablation (CA) of atrial fibrillation (AF) leads to reverse remodeling of AF substrate. Comorbidities may impact this process and outcomes. Sparse cardiovascular (CV) guidelines address comorbidities and rhythm control practices after CA. We characterized incident comorbidities after index CA that may impact outcomes, reablation, or antiarrhythmic drug (AAD) practices after CA in the ARRC-AF study. Methods: 2,429,863 patients in Optum’s deidentified Market Clarity Data (Market Clarity ® ) newly diagnosed with AF (2007–2021) were followed until disenrollment, death, or study end; 23,323 patients underwent index CA. Comorbidity status before CA and comorbidity event rates after CA were analyzed. We examined these before and during intervening periods between CAs and while receiving medical therapy. Results: Among the 23,323 patients who underwent index CA (median follow-up: 3.2 years; 44.6% prescribed AADs), baseline comorbidities included hypertension (51.8%), coronary artery disease (17.9%), obstructive sleep apnea (14.4%), diabetes (11.7%), heart failure (10.5%), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (8.9%), peripheral vascular disease (5.4%), valvular heart disease (4.9%), and chronic kidney disease (1.1%). During follow up, 19,461 patients (83.4%) had no further CA; 3,862 patients (46.7% prescribed AADs) had ≥1 reablation (1 reablation, 14.2%; 2 reablations, 2.0%; ≥3 reablations, 0.4%; interval between Cas of 539, 536, and 458 days, respectively). Individual comorbidity event rates after CA ranged from 0 to 4.7% in the 3 cohorts with ≥1 comorbidity/patient ( Table ). Conclusion: After CA, new comorbidities continue to emerge at a modest rate. In general, comorbidity event rates increased as the number of reablations increased. Both CV and non-CV comorbidities need to be assessed before reablation (with and without long-term AAD therapy) for potential impact on endpoints and need best practice management. Co-morbidities can impact outcomes and need to be considered for their impact on sample sizes, study endpoints, morbidity, and mortality in AF ablation trials. Optimizing management of comorbidities could potentially improve results of AF interventions"

Research Question/Hypothesis: We hypothesised that unsupervised machine learning (ML) applied to routinely collected variables could yield a more informative HF stratification than the conventional LVEF-based framework. Goals/Aims: To develop an ML-derived multidimensional HF classification, test its prognostic performance, and compare it with existing LVEF categories. Methods/Approach: We analysed 13,238 patients in the nationwide JROAD-HF registry in Japan. Forty-six clinical, laboratory, and echocardiographic variables entered a latent-class model; the cohort was randomly split 1:1 into discovery and internal-validation sets to assess robustness. (Figure 1) Clinical endpoint defined as a composite of 5-year cardiovascular death and heart failure readmission. Results: The model identified three phenogroups by minimum Bayesian Information Criteria. Phenogroup 1 “Advanced Low-Output HF” (predominantly male, age 73.6 ± 12 years) showed severe systolic dysfunction (LVEF 35.5 %), renal impairment, and heavy burdens of ischemic heart disease (52 %) and cardiomyopathy (29%). Phenogroup 2 “Early Afterload-Mismatch HF” (predominantly male, age 68.8 ± 12 years) was the youngest, markedly hypertensive, with intermediate LVEF (41.9%) and diverse etiologies. Phenogroup 3 “Elderly HFpEF-like HF” (predominantly female, age 84.5 ± 7 years) was lean and anemic, with preserved LVEF 53.5%, atrial fibrillation (45%), and valvular disease (42%). The four most discriminative variables were age, total bilirubin, LV diastolic diameter, and serum hemoglobin rather than LVEF and yielded an adjusted Rand index of 0.94 in the validation set, indicating excellent reproducibility. Five-year Kaplan–Meier curves showed the lowest mortality in Phenogroup 2 and the highest in Phenogroup 1 (log-rank p &lt; 0.001), whereas LVEF categories showed no significant separation (p = 0.267) (Figure 2 A and B). Conclusions: ML-driven phenomapping of routine hospital data delineated three distinct HF groups that outperformed the traditional LVEF classification in prognostic discrimination."

Emerging evidence indicates that oxidative stress plays a significant role in the pathophysiology of CAVD by promoting damage to the endothelium lining the aortic valve. Our previous data provided evidence that sortilin orchestrates a complex intracellular signaling pathway culminating in endothelial dysfunction in mice through increased ROS production. Research Questions: To unveil the potential involvement of sortilin in the molecular mechanisms linking endothelial injury and oxidative stress in the progression of CAVD. Methods: Isolated human valve endothelial cells were used to identify the molecular mechanisms in vitro. Göttingen minipigs were randomly assigned to either a standard diet (SD) or a diet high in fat and cholesterol (HF) for 20 weeks. During this period, they received oral administration of either a placebo or the sortilin inhibitor AF38469. Blood samples were collected at baseline, during, and at the end of treatment for biochemical and oxidative stress marker analyses. Aortic cusps were analyzed histologically for cellularity, collagen, fibrosis, and calcification. Immunohistochemistry and Western blot assessed oxidative stress and osteoblast markers. Vascular reactivity studies evaluated endothelial function in isolated resistance vessels. Results: Immunohistochemistry revealed that the HF diet compromised endothelial integrity on the aortic valve surface, while sortilin inhibition preserved it. Furthermore, the HF diet group exhibited increased oxidative stress, activation of myofibroblast/osteoblast phenotypes, and mineralization in the valve, all of which were reduced by the sortilin inhibitor. Moreover, AF38469 significantly prevented the increased plasma cholesterol ( p&lt; 0.0001) and triglyceride ( p&lt; 0.0001) levels as well as the endothelial dysfunction observed in the placebo-treated HF diet group. Conclusions: Our data suggest that sortilin negatively regulates valvular degeneration by influencing the destruction of endothelial integrity, the increase in inflammation and oxidative stress, thereby highlighting its therapeutic potential in CAVD."

McNamara; Evangelos K. Oikonomou; Aline F Pedroso; Rohan Khera,10.1161/circ.152.suppl_3.4369348,2025-11-03,Circulation,"Background: Wearable devices can capture 1-lead ECGs but are primarily used for detecting rhythm disorders. AI deployed on these ECGs could enable scalable detection of structural heart diseases (SHDs). However, wearable ECGs are noisier than clinical ECGs, and it is essential to develop and validate noise-resilient models that reliably detect SHD on real-world wearable devices. Aim: We first developed and externally validated a noise-adapted AI-ECG model to detect SHD from lead I of clinical ECGs. In the prospective WATCH-SHD study, we then assessed its performance in detecting SHD from an Apple Watch-acquired 1-lead ECG. Methods: Using 266,054 ECGs from 110,006 patients at Yale (2015–23), we developed an AI-ECG algorithm to detect SHD from lead I ECGs (resembling Apple Watch 1-lead ECGs) paired with echocardiograms within 30 days. SHD was defined as a composite of LVEF &lt;40%, severe left-sided valvular disease, or severe LVH (IVSd &gt;15 mm + LV diastolic dysfunction). ECGs were augmented with random Gaussian noise during training to improve the model’s robustness against noisy signal acquisition. The model was then externally validated in 44,591 patients across 4 community hospitals and 3,014 participants from the population-based ELSA-Brasil. Subsequently, we prospectively enrolled 600 participants undergoing an outpatient echocardiogram at Yale and obtained a 30-s, 1-lead ECG with an Apple Watch to assess the AI tool’s performance in detecting SHD. ECG acquisition and inference were conducted in real-time using the CarDS-Plus app. Results: The AI model had an AUROC of 0.92 (95% CI, 0.91-0.93) for detecting SHD from lead I of clinical ECGs in the Yale test set and generalized well to the external cohorts, with AUROCs ranging from 0.89 to 0.92. In the prospective WATCH-SHD, 596 of 600 participants (99.3%; median age 62 years [IQR, 46–71]; 52% women) successfully obtained a 1-lead ECG on the Apple Watch, of whom 21 (5.3%) had SHD. This included 15 with LVEF &lt;40%, 5 with severe valvular disease, and 1 with severe LVH. The AI model had an AUROC of 0.88 (0.78–0.98) for detecting SHD from Apple Watch-acquired 1-lead ECG. At the threshold for optimizing Youden’s index, the model’s sensitivity was 86%, specificity 87%, NPV 99%, and PPV 27% for detecting SHD. Conclusions: A noise-adapted AI tool integrated with an automated platform can detect SHD from a 30-s, 1-lead ECG acquired with an Apple Watch. This has the potential to transform SHD screening in communities."

Untreated symptomatic AS carries a one-year mortality rate of up to 50%, while timely diagnosis allows for effective treatment. AS progresses gradually over years and is typically monitored with surveillance echocardiography. AS progression rates vary significantly between individuals. Current guidelines recommend uniform surveillance intervals, which may result in unnecessary imaging for slow progressors and delayed diagnosis for rapid progressors. This study aims to analyze a large echocardiographic dataset with longitudinal follow-up to identify risk factors for rapid AS progression, ultimately supporting individualized surveillance strategies based on patient-specific risk profiles. Methods: This retrospective study included patients with serial echocardiograms between 2011 and 2021. A natural language processing algorithm was developed to extract AS severity from each report. Rapid AS progression was defined as an increase in Vmax of ≥0.3 m/s per year, and severe AS was defined as Vmax ≥4.0 m/s. Multivariable logistic regression models were constructed to evaluate clinical factors associated with rapid progression. Results: The study included 24,821 patients with borderline, mild, or moderate AS. Mean follow-up was 4.1 years. 2,492 patients experienced rapid AS progression and 1,998 progressed to severe AS. Factors associated with rapid progression included older age (OR 1.12, 95% CI 1.07–1.18), male sex (OR 1.18, 95% CI 1.08–1.29), renal disease (OR 1.13, 95% CI 1.03–1.24), liver disease (OR 1.25, 95% CI 1.06–1.47), and anemia (OR 1.19, 95% CI 1.02–1.38) while coronary artery disease was associated with a lower risk (OR 0.76, 95% CI 0.68–0.84). Among racial and ethnic groups, white patients had the highest risk of rapid AS progression. Conclusion: Approximately 10% of patients studied experienced rapid disease progression. Older age, male sex, white race, and clinical factors such as renal disease, liver disease, and anemia were associated with rapid AS progression. These patients may benefit from closer follow-up and shorter echocardiographic surveillance intervals. This work lays the foundation for developing a personalized risk score to inform patient-specific surveillance intervals based on individual risk profiles."
OpenAlex,valvular heart disease,Abstract 4337649: The Toothpaste Heart: Striking Imaging of a Multisystem Calcific Cardiovascular Case in a Young Male with ESRD,Maya Asami Takagi; Garrett Cohen; Sandhya Venugopal,10.1161/circ.152.suppl_3.4337649,2025-11-03,Circulation,"Introduction: Extensive vascular and valvular calcification is typically seen in older adults with longstanding cardiovascular disease. In younger patients, it often reflects complex systemic pathology. Case Presentation: A 44-year-old male presented with central, burning chest pain that worsened when lying flat and improved when upright, shortly after a dialysate adjustment and suspected leakage. His relevant history included cocaine-associated NSTEMI at age 22, non-ischemic cardiomyopathy with LVEF 30% diagnosed at age 39, and ESRD secondary to proliferative glomerulonephritis with monoclonal deposits. He underwent kidney transplant at age 27 but resumed peritoneal dialysis by age 29. Investigations: Coronary angiography revealed new triple-vessel CAD. Echocardiography showed LVEF 35%, moderately reduced RV function, low-flow low-gradient aortic stenosis, moderate-to-severe mitral annular calcification (MAC), mild mitral stenosis, and pulmonary hypertension. Non-contrast ECG-gated cardiac CT showed a 25 × 62 mm calcified apical mass, diffuse coronary and vascular calcifications, pleural calcifications, calcified pulmonary nodules, and dramatic “toothpaste-like” MAC suggestive of caseous transformation. Management: Despite extensive structural disease, the patient remained hemodynamically stable. A multidisciplinary heart team—including general cardiology, heart failure, and cardiothoracic surgery—guided evaluation. CT surgery was consulted for CABG consideration; further workup included a PET-FDG scan for myocardial viability. Pericardiectomy was discussed due to concern for constrictive pericarditis in the setting of pericardial calcifications, though right heart catheterization did not show hemodynamic findings of constriction. Ultimately, CABG was deferred due to patient stability and preference to delay intervention. Medical therapy included heparin, dual antiplatelet therapy, statin initiation, and renal-adjusted guideline-directed heart failure treatment. Conclusion: This case highlights extreme cardiovascular and extraosseous calcification in a young patient with ESRD and chronic heart failure. The “toothpaste” appearance of the mitral annulus suggests caseous transformation, a rare MAC variant. While vascular calcification is common in ESRD, this represents a severe form of CKD–mineral bone disorder. Multidisciplinary care is essential in managing overlapping cardiac, renal, and metabolic conditions, and in guiding personalized risk stratification."
OpenAlex,valvular heart disease,Abstract 4366354: Unmasking Risk: Clinical Outcomes of Moderate Aortic Stenosis with Concomitant Mitral Regurgitation—A Cardiac MRI-Based Evaluation,El‐Moatasem Gabr; Mianli Xiao; Mujtaba Saeed; Amr Darwish; Akila Bersali; Aneesh Dhore; Edward A. Graviss; Maan Malahfji; Dipan J. Shah,10.1161/circ.152.suppl_3.4366354,2025-11-03,Circulation,"Objective: The clinical trajectory of patients with moderate aortic stenosis (AS) complicated by concomitant mitral regurgitation (MR) remains poorly defined. While management strategies in severe AS are well established, patients with moderate AS and MR often fall below guideline-based thresholds for intervention despite symptoms and remodeling. We used cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR)—a robust modality for accurate valve quantification, particularly in mixed valvular disease— to assess the prognostic impact of MR in moderate AS and to compare the outcomes to patients with severe AS. Methods: We analyzed consecutive patients from the DeBakey CMR Registry (2008–2023) with ≥moderate AS on clinically indicated CMR. Exclusions included &gt;mild aortic regurgitation or mitral stenosis, subaortic obstruction, infiltrative cardiomyopathies, pre-capillary pulmonary hypertension, advanced malignancy, or unavailable follow-up. Patients were stratified by AS severity (moderate vs. severe) and MR grade (&lt;moderate vs. ≥moderate), with valve severity assessed per current CMR guidelines. The primary outcome was a composite of cardiovascular death or heart failure hospitalization. Statistical analysis was performed in R (Vienna, Austria), with significance defined as p&lt;0.05. Results: In a multivariate Cox regression analysis of 422 patients with moderate AS, both mitral regurgitant (MR) fraction on CMR (hazard ratio [HR] per 5% increase: 1.10; 95% CI: 1.04–1.16; P &lt; 0.001) and the presence of ≥ moderate MR (HR: 1.86; 95% CI: 1.31–2.65; P &lt; 0.001) were independently associated with the composite outcome (Table 1). In moderate AS, penalized spline regression analysis showed a statistically significant increase in risk with increasing MR fraction (P&lt;0.001 for linearity; P=0.028 for non-linearity; Figure 1). Kaplan-Meier curves demonstrated poorer 3-year event-free survival in patients with moderate AS and concomitant ≥moderate MR (33%) compared with both isolated severe AS (71%) and severe AS with ≥moderate MR (49%) (Figure 2). Conclusion: In moderate AS, concomitant MR is an independent predictor of adverse clinical composite outcomes. Patients with moderate AS and ≥moderate MR had worse composite outcomes than those with isolated severe AS, underscoring the additive risk of dual-valve pathology. These findings support more vigilant monitoring and may justify re-evaluation of treatment thresholds in this mixed valvular disease subgroup."
OpenAlex,valvular heart disease,Abstract 4370895: Combined left- and right-sided native valve infective endocarditis with no predisposing risk factors or intracardiac shunt,Diana Inshyna; Abdul Hakim Almakadma; Farzane Saeidifard,10.1161/circ.152.suppl_3.4370895,2025-11-03,Circulation,"Combined left and right-sided Infective Endocarditis (IE) is rare and typically occurs with underlying predisposing factors such as intravenous drug use, presence of hemodialysis catheters, congenital defects, and intracardiac devices. We present a 62-year-old woman with diabetes, hypertension, and severe peripheral vascular disease, diagnosed with combined left- and right-sided native valve IE despite lack of typical underlying risk factors. She presented with altered mental status and sepsis; blood cultures were positive for Streptococcus group G . Initial transthoracic echocardiogram revealed an 8 mm echogenicity on the atrial aspect of the mitral valve. Subsequently, a transesophageal echocardiogram was performed, revealing a large (2 x 0.9 cm) highly mobile mass on the anterior leaflet of the mitral valve with mild to moderate mitral regurgitation (Figures 1,2) ; additionally, a small size (0.9 x 0.7 cm) highly mobile mass was seen on the tricuspid valve with mild tricuspid regurgitation ( Figures 1,3 ), meeting criteria for combined left- and right-sided infective endocarditis. The patient was assessed by the cardiothoracic team, and due to presence of multiple comorbidities the risk of surgery was deemed to outweigh the benefits for valve replacement or repair. Therefore, she was treated medically with broad-spectrum antibiotics with subsequent significant improvement and did not develop any complications throughout her hospital stay. IE has an incidence of 3–10 cases per 100,000 annually in developed countries, with Staphylococcus aureus as the most common pathogen. Tricuspid valve IE accounts for 5–10% of cases. Although rare, combined left and right-sided IE can develop without underlying risk factors as in our clinical case. Multivalvular IE also poses greater risk for severe complications, including valvular dysfunction, heart failure, abscess formation, and conduction abnormalities, as well as systemic and pulmonary embolization, contributing to high morbidity. This case illustrates the importance of early diagnosis and individualized treatment in rare presentations of combined IE. It highlights that conservative, non-surgical management can be effective in select patients and supports the need for further research to guide treatment strategies in complex IE cases."

This study is conducted in order to accurately analyze the medication patterns of diabetic cardiomyopathy. A deep reinforcement learning algorithm is proposed and optimized using K-means clustering data analysis in artificial intelligence learning algorithms. The optimized algorithm is also used to construct a medication law analysis model, with a view to analyzing the Chinese medicine medication law of diabetic cardiomyopathy through this model. The study first analyzes the optimized algorithm for comparison experiments. The results demonstrated that the prediction error rate of the optimized algorithm was only 1.2%, and the prediction speed reached 8.2 bps. Moreover, the checking rate of the algorithm reached 98.7%, and all the performances were optimized for the comparison algorithm. The analytical model based on this algorithm was tested. The results indicated that the accuracy of the model in analyzing patients’ medication patterns reached 99.5%. Moreover, the medical resource utilization was increased by 34.3% with the use of this model. From these results, it can be concluded that the analysis model proposed in the study can accurately analyze the medication pattern of patients with diabetic cardiomyopathy so as to reduce the waste of resources and accelerate the speed of recovery of patients."

OpenAlex,deep learning,<scp>VahigoNet</scp> : Leveraging Deep Learning for Transparent and High‐Performance Hypertension Prediction,Muhammad Hasnain; Nadeem Javaid; Imran Ahmed; Nabil Alrajeh,10.1002/cpe.70420,2025-11-08,Concurrency and Computation Practice and Experience,"ABSTRACT Hypertension continues to be a primary cause of global death, necessitating early and accurate forecasting for effective treatments. The existing methods have drawbacks such as class imbalance, poor modeling of sequential and spatial connections, high computation costs, and lack of interpretability, even though Deep Learning (DL) models offer possible solutions. To tackle these difficulties, we present VahigoNet, a novel blending DL model that incorporates vanilla recurrent neural networks (VRNN) for capturing temporal correlations, Google network for extracting hierarchical spatial features, and highway networks (HighwayNet) for adaptive feature refinements. To achieve strong generalization, we utilize the synthetic minority oversampling technique (SMOTE) for data balance. VahigoNet substantially outperforms baseline models, showing enhancements of 9.39% in accuracy, 10.27% in precision, 8.63% in recall, 9.39% in F1‐score, and 3.10% in area under the curve‐receiver operating characteristic. A 10‐fold cross validation method is utilized to assess the model's generalizability, markedly reducing overfitting and improving robustness. A paired t ‐test is performed to evaluate statistical significance, demonstrating that the enhancements are substantial and clinically relevant. Additionally, explainable artificial intelligence (AI) methodologies, including local Interpretable model‐agnostic explanations (LIME) and SHapley Additive exPlanations, are incorporated to provide both local and global perspectives on feature contributions. These explainability strategies enhance transparency, making VahigoNet a more interpretable and clinically reliable model for hypertension prediction. The results demonstrate that VahigoNet is an exceptionally efficient and transparent method, achieving a balance between predictive capability and practical relevance in medical diagnostics."
OpenAlex,deep learning,Searching for supersymmetry using deep learning with the ATLAS detector,L. G. Gagnon,10.71781/17529,2025-11-08,@nalyses (University of Ottawa),"Le Modèle Standard de la physique des particules (MS) est une théorie fondamentale de la nature dont la validité a été largement établie par diverses expériences. Par contre, quelques problèmes théoriques et expérimentaux subsistent, ce qui motive la recherche de théories alternatives. La Supersymétrie (SUSY), famille de théories dans laquelle une nouvelle particule est associée à chaque particules du MS, est une des théories ayant les meilleures motivations pour étendre la portée du modèle. Par exemple, plusieurs théories supersymétriques prédisent de nouvelles particules stables et interagissant seulement par la force faible, ce qui pourrait expliquer les observations astronomiques de la matière sombre. La découverte de SUSY représenterait aussi une importante étape dans le chemin vers une théorie unifiée de l'univers. Les recherches de supersymétrie sont au coeur du programme expérimental de la collaboration ATLAS, qui exploite un détecteur de particules installé au Grand Collisioneur de Hadrons (LHC) au CERN à Genève, mais à ce jours aucune preuve en faveur de la supersymétrie n'a été enregistrée par les présentes analyses, largement basées sur des techniques simples et bien comprises. Cette thèse documente l'implémentation d'une nouvelle approche à la recherche de particules basée sur l'apprentissage profond, utilisant seulement les quadri-impulsions comme variables discriminatoires; cette analyse utilise l'ensemble complet de données d'ATLAS enregistré en 2015-2018. Les problèmes de la naturalité du MS et de la matière sombre orientent la recherche vers les partenaires supersymétriques du gluon (le gluino), des quarks de troisième génération (stop et sbottom), ainsi que des bosons de gauge (le neutralino). Plusieurs techniques récentes sont employées, telles que l'utilisation directe des quadri-impulsions reconstruites à partir des données enregistrées par le détecteur ATLAS ainsi que la paramétrisation d'un réseau de neurone avec les masses des particules recherchées, ce qui permet d'atteindre une performance optimale quelle que soit l'hypothèse de masses. Cette méthode améliore la signification statistique par un facteur 85 par rapport au dernier résultat d'ATLAS pour certaines hypothèses de masses, et ce avec la même luminosité. Aucun excès signifif au-delà du Modèle Standard n'est observé. Les masses du gluino en deçà de 2.45 TeV et du neutralino en deça de 1.7 TeV sont exclues à un niveau de confiance de 95%, ce qui étend largement les limites précédentes sur deux modèles de productions de paires de gluinos faisant intervenir des stops et des sbottoms, respectivement."

The model was generated as an object to recognize selected human faces and emotional states based on visual data recorded on the human face in real time. The study was placed against the background of available literature on the analysis of facial expressions and emotion classification methods. In addition to the concept of the original solution, the assumptions of the research experiment were given, a method for measuring facial expressions was selected for the experimental conditions, and a set of data was developed for training a neural model of the facial expression system with their preparation for ANN learning. Ultimately, various artificial neural networks were trained to model the facial expression system and sensitivity and comparative tests were performed in Simulink to, among others: assess the quality of the model in relation to real data. Very high results of ANN training of the facial expression system model were obtained (MSE on the order of 10−14, R close to 1), as well as relatively high model quality relative the facial expression system, measured, among others, average relative error, the value of which was several percent. However, in terms of prediction effectiveness, because of the obtained results, which are not very high for the assumed high measurement accuracies, the research that has been started is continued."
OpenAlex,deep learning,E-SAM and power of podcasts: advancing inclusive leadership and women’s entrepreneurship in developing economies,Anant Deogaonkar; Sunita Dhote; Chandan Vichoray,10.1108/jmd-05-2025-0300,2025-11-08,Journal of Management Development,"Purpose This study identifies three variables–lack of market access, limited knowledge, and weak support systems–that contribute to the disproportionate challenges women business owners face. By integrating diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) considerations, the study highlights how digital platforms like data podcasts can provide scalable, inclusive solutions. Design/methodology/approach Entrepreneurship skill analysis model (E-SAM) to analyze social enterprises to develop an understanding of the systems and processes they adopt. Findings The study offers strategic guidance for policymakers and stakeholders to pilot inclusive policies that empower women entrepreneurs in resource-constrained environments. To this purpose, we propose a range of interventions for each practical solution, from the lightest touch to the most involved, to provide the government with a means of piloting and refining its policy design and implementation strategies before rolling them out on a larger scale. Practical implications From a policy and implementation perspective, E-SAM acts as a policy sandbox that allows governments, NGOs, and funding agencies to simulate and pre-test various interventions before scaling them in real-world contexts. The model’s performance (92.0%) and efficiency (94.1%) scores demonstrate that even modest investments–such as training, capital support or DEI-driven governance–can yield significant growth and sustainability for women-led enterprises. Practitioners can use E-SAM to design sector-specific programs, assess the cost-effectiveness of entrepreneurship schemes, and identify high-leverage intervention points. For instance, public-private partnerships can be tailored to the types of enterprises most affected by knowledge gaps or market disconnects, as reflected in simulation outputs. Additionally, digital podcasting can be integrated into incubation and skill development programs as a cost-effective tool to foster engagement, community legitimacy and scalable mentorship in remote or underserved areas. Social implications The E-SAM model contributes meaningfully to social transformation by addressing the deeply rooted structural inequalities that limit women’s entrepreneurial agency in developing economies. By simulating the decision-making processes of women entrepreneurs under constraints such as limited market access, weak social networks and institutional barriers, the model highlights how exclusion is both systemic and solvable. For example, when social capital interventions are introduced in the simulation, women’s involvement rates increase by over 35%, underscoring the power of collective support and peer learning. Moreover, the integration of data podcasting into the E-SAM framework offers a culturally relevant and scalable tool for information dissemination, mentorship and digital literacy. Podcasts, as localized narrative platforms, reduce informational asymmetry and build confidence among first-generation women entrepreneurs. This aligns strongly with SDG 5 (gender equality) and SDG 10 (reduced inequalities) by democratizing access to entrepreneurial knowledge and expanding pathways for advocacy and visibility. Originality/value No previous studies available on the podcast and women entrepreneurs."

In this study, we employed in silico approaches to optimize monoclonal antibodies targeting the Zika virus envelope protein (ZIKV E) in the Domain III (DIII) region, which is crucial for receptor binding and virus entry. A high‐resolution crystal structure of ZIKV E in complex with the neutralizing antibody ZV‐64 was used as a template for designing a library of antibody variants through targeted double‐point mutations. The variants were systematically evaluated for stability, binding affinity, solubility, and protein–protein interaction potential using FoldX, DeepPurpose, SoluProt, and molecular docking. Among all the mutants, Variants‐213 and ‐206 were identified as the top candidates, exhibiting the most favorable predicted binding affinity and solubility compared to the control antibody. The molecular dynamics simulations further revealed the structural stability of the two mutant variants, in which Variant‐206 showed a predicted binding energy (−76.90 kcal/mol) along with higher conformational flexibilities. The findings demonstrate the use of computational antibody engineering to identify potentially high‐affinity therapeutics against ZIKV, providing a foundation for future experimental validation and therapeutic development against ZIKV."

Ceci a demandé une étude approfondie des problèmes encourus par les chercheurs dans cette branche de la vision par ordinateur. Ce mémoire établi deux axes problématiques, celui venant des données et celui des modèles. Concernant les données, les méthodes accomplissant l’état-de-l’art dans ce domaine sont appliqués sur des bases de données qui potentiellement sous représentent les défis existant dans les vidéos de tous les jours. Ainsi, il est possible que l’innovation évolue ultimement vers des cul-de-sacs et une nouvelle bases de données est suggérées afin de résoudre ce problème. Quant aux modèles, la génération de vidéos est à la frontière des applications des procéssus génératifs. C’est un champs de recherche encore très ouvert aux découvertes de tailles car non seulement est-il devant des obstacles d’ingénieries, tant aux niveaux logiciels que physiques, mais il se trouve à être un véritable casse-tête. En apprentissage profond, la modélisation d’images statiques entre présentement dans une phase plus mature, mais qu’en est-il pour des séquences d’images et de leurs générations? De très récents modèles ont réussi d’impressionnantes générations image par image et exhibent de longues séquences sans dégradation rapide de la qualité visuelle. En analysant ceux-ci, ce mémoire propose le modèle feature flow comme un choix raisonnable à considérer pour cette tâche et espère convaincre pourquoi. La génération comme sujet d’étude elle-même a fait également l’objet d’une attention particulière à travers ce mémoire. Il augmente le déjà populaire generative adversarial networks avec un mécanisme d’inférence, adversarially learned inference. Cette version améliorée excelle aux mêmes tâches que son prédécesseur tout en offrant une représentation abstraite des données grâce au mécanisme d’inférence.

OpenAlex,deep learning,Deep learning of representations and its application to computer vision,Ian Goodfellow,10.71781/9782,2025-11-08,@nalyses (University of Ottawa),"L’objectif de cette thèse par articles est de présenter modestement quelques étapes du parcours qui mènera (on espère) à une solution générale du problème de l’intelligence artificielle. Cette thèse contient quatre articles qui présentent chacun une différente nouvelle méthode d’inférence perceptive en utilisant l’apprentissage machine et, plus particulièrement, les réseaux neuronaux profonds. Chacun de ces documents met en évidence l’utilité de sa méthode proposée dans le cadre d’une tâche de vision par ordinateur. Ces méthodes sont applicables dans un contexte plus général, et dans certains cas elles on tété appliquées ailleurs, mais ceci ne sera pas abordé dans le contexte de cette de thèse. Dans le premier article, nous présentons deux nouveaux algorithmes d’inférence variationelle pour le modèle génératif d’images appelé codage parcimonieux “spike- and-slab” (CPSS). Ces méthodes d’inférence plus rapides nous permettent d’utiliser des modèles CPSS de tailles beaucoup plus grandes qu’auparavant. Nous démontrons qu’elles sont meilleures pour extraire des détecteur de caractéristiques quand très peu d’exemples étiquetés sont disponibles pour l’entraînement. Partant d’un modèle CPSS, nous construisons ensuite une architecture profonde, la machine de Boltzmann profonde partiellement dirigée (MBP-PD). Ce modèle a été conçu de manière à simplifier d’entraînement des machines de Boltzmann profondes qui nécessitent normalement une phase de pré-entraînement glouton pour chaque couche. Ce problème est réglé dans une certaine mesure, mais le coût d’inférence dans le nouveau modèle est relativement trop élevé pour permettre de l’utiliser de manière pratique. Dans le deuxième article, nous revenons au problème d’entraînement joint de machines de Boltzmann profondes. Cette fois, au lieu de changer de famille de modèles, nous introduisons un nouveau critère d’entraînement qui donne naissance aux machines de Boltzmann profondes à multiples prédictions (MBP-MP). Les MBP-MP sont entraînables en une seule étape et ont un meilleur taux de succès en classification que les MBP classiques. Elles s’entraînent aussi avec des méthodes variationelles standard au lieu de nécessiter un classificateur discriminant pour obtenir un bon taux de succès en classification. Par contre, un des inconvénients de tels modèles est leur incapacité de générer deséchantillons, mais ceci n’est pas trop grave puisque la performance de classification des machines de Boltzmann profondes n’est plus une priorité étant donné les dernières avancées en apprentissage supervisé. Malgré cela, les MBP-MP demeurent intéressantes parce qu’elles sont capable d’accomplir certaines tâches que des modèles purement supervisés ne peuvent pas faire, telles que celle de classifier des données incomplètes ou encore celle de combler intelligemment l’information manquante dans ces données incomplètes. ￼Le travail présenté dans cette thèse s’est déroulé au milieu d’une période de transformations importantes du domaine de l’apprentissage à réseaux neuronaux profonds qui a été déclenchée par la découverte de l’algorithme de “dropout” par Geoffrey Hinton. Dropout rend possible un entraînement purement supervisé d’architectures de propagation unidirectionnel sans être exposé au danger de sur- entraînement. Le troisième article présenté dans cette thèse introduit une nouvelle fonction d’activation spécialement con ̧cue pour aller avec l’algorithme de Dropout. Cette fonction d’activation, appelée maxout, permet l’utilisation de aggrégation multi-canal dans un contexte d’apprentissage purement supervisé. Nous démontrons comment plusieurs tâches de reconnaissance d’objets sont mieux accomplies par l’utilisation de maxout. Pour terminer, sont présentons un vrai cas d’utilisation dans l’industrie pour la transcription d’adresses de maisons à plusieurs chiffres. En combinant maxout avec une nouvelle sorte de couche de sortie pour des réseaux neuronaux de convolution, nous démontrons qu’il est possible d’atteindre un taux de succès comparable à celui des humains sur un ensemble de données coriace constitué de photos prises par les voitures de Google. Ce système a été déployé avec succès chez Google pour lire environ cent million d’adresses de maisons."
OpenAlex,deep learning,Natural image processing and synthesis using deep learning,Iaroslav Ganin,10.71781/10125,2025-11-08,@nalyses (University of Ottawa),"Nous étudions dans cette thèse comment les réseaux de neurones profonds peuvent être utilisés dans différents domaines de la vision artificielle. La vision artificielle est un domaine interdisciplinaire qui traite de la compréhension d’images et de vidéos numériques. Les problèmes de ce domaine ont traditionnellement été adressés avec des méthodes ad-hoc nécessitant beaucoup de réglages manuels. En effet, ces systèmes de vision artificiels comprenaient jusqu’à récemment une série de modules optimisés indépendamment. Cette approche est très raisonnable dans la mesure où, avec peu de données, elle bénéficient autant que possible des connaissances du chercheur. Mais cette avantage peut se révéler être une limitation si certaines données d’entré n’ont pas été considérées dans la conception de l’algorithme. Avec des volumes et une diversité de données toujours plus grands, ainsi que des capacités de calcul plus rapides et économiques, les réseaux de neurones profonds optimisés d’un bout à l’autre sont devenus une alternative attrayante. Nous démontrons leur avantage avec une série d’articles de recherche, chacun d’entre eux trouvant une solution à base de réseaux de neurones profonds à un problème d’analyse ou de synthèse visuelle particulier. Dans le premier article, nous considérons un problème de vision classique: la détection de bords et de contours. Nous partons de l’approche classique et la rendons plus ‘neurale’ en combinant deux étapes, la détection et la description de motifs visuels, en un seul réseau convolutionnel. Cette méthode, qui peut ainsi s’adapter à de nouveaux ensembles de données, s’avère être au moins aussi précis que les méthodes conventionnelles quand il s’agit de domaines qui leur sont favorables, tout en étant beaucoup plus robuste dans des domaines plus générales. Dans le deuxième article, nous construisons une nouvelle architecture pour la manipulation d’images qui utilise l’idée que la majorité des pixels produits peuvent d’être copiés de l’image d’entrée. Cette technique bénéficie de plusieurs avantages majeurs par rapport à l’approche conventionnelle en apprentissage profond. En effet, elle conserve les détails de l’image d’origine, n’introduit pas d’aberrations grâce à la capacité limitée du réseau sous-jacent et simplifie l’apprentissage. Nous démontrons l’efficacité de cette architecture dans le cadre d’une tâche de correction du regard, où notre système produit d’excellents résultats. Dans le troisième article, nous nous éclipsons de la vision artificielle pour étudier le problème plus générale de l’adaptation à de nouveaux domaines. Nous développons un nouvel algorithme d’apprentissage, qui assure l’adaptation avec un objectif auxiliaire à la tâche principale. Nous cherchons ainsi à extraire des motifs qui permettent d’accomplir la tâche mais qui ne permettent pas à un réseau dédié de reconnaître le domaine. Ce réseau est optimisé de manière simultané avec les motifs en question, et a pour tâche de reconnaître le domaine de provenance des motifs. Cette technique est simple à implémenter, et conduit pourtant à l’état de l’art sur toutes les tâches de référence. Enfin, le quatrième article présente un nouveau type de modèle génératif d’images. À l’opposé des approches conventionnels à base de réseaux de neurones convolutionnels, notre système baptisé SPIRAL décrit les images en termes de programmes bas-niveau qui sont exécutés par un logiciel de graphisme ordinaire. Entre autres, ceci permet à l’algorithme de ne pas s’attarder sur les détails de l’image, et de se concentrer plutôt sur sa structure globale. L’espace latent de notre modèle est, par construction, interprétable et permet de manipuler des images de façon prévisible. Nous montrons la capacité et l’agilité de cette approche sur plusieurs bases de données de référence."
OpenAlex,deep learning,Deep learning and reinforcement learning methods for grounded goal-oriented dialogue,Harm de Vries,10.71781/11140,2025-11-08,@nalyses (University of Ottawa),"Les systèmes de dialogues sont à même de révolutionner l'interaction entre l'homme et la machine. Pour autant, les efforts pour concevoir des agents conversationnels se sont souvent révélés infructueux, et ceux, malgré les dernières avancées en apprentissage profond et par renforcement. Les systèmes de dialogue palissent de devoir opérer sur de nombreux domaines d'application mais pour lesquels aucune mesure d'évaluation claire n'a été définie. Aussi, cette thèse s'attache à étudier les dialogues débouchant sur un objectif clair (goal-oriented dialogue) permettant de guider l'entrainement, et ceci, dans des environnements multimodaux. Plusieurs raisons expliquent ce choix : (i) cela contraint le périmètre de la conversation, (ii) cela introduit une méthode d'évaluation claire, (iii) enfin, l'aspect multimodal enrichie la représentation linguistique en reliant l'apprentissage du langage avec des expériences sensorielles. En particulier, nous avons développé GuessWhat?! (Qu-est-ce donc?!), un jeu imagé coopératif où deux joueurs tentent de retrouver un objet en posant une série de questions. Afin d’apprendre aux agents de répondre aux questions sur les images, nous avons développés une méthode dites de normalisation conditionnée des données (Conditional Batch Nornalization). Ainsi, cette méthode permet d'adapter simplement mais efficacement des noyaux de convolutions visuels en fonction de la question en cours. Enfin, nous avons étudié les tâches de navigation guidée par dialogue, et introduit la tâche Talk the Walk (Raconte-moi le Chemin) à cet effet. Dans ce jeu, deux agents, un touriste et un guide, s'accordent afin d'aider le touriste à traverser une reconstruction virtuelle des rues de New-York et atteindre une position prédéfinie."

Gunjal; Prof. S. B. Bhosale,10.48175/ijarsct-29706,2025-11-08,International Journal of Advanced Research in Science Communication and Technology,"The integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in materials engineering has revolutionized the process of material selection and property prediction. Among various AI methods, Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) have emerged as powerful tools capable of modeling complex nonlinear relationships between material composition, processing parameters, and mechanical or thermal properties. This review presents a comprehensive analysis of recent advances in AI-based material informatics, focusing on ANN-driven approaches for predicting properties such as tensile strength, hardness, and thermal conductivity, and for recommending suitable materials in engineering design. The study examines key methodologies, dataset sources, preprocessing techniques, and ANN architectures used across the literature. Additionally, it compares hybrid frameworks that integrate ANNs with multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) techniques for intelligent material recommendation. Challenges such as data scarcity, model interpretability, and generalization across diverse material classes are critically discussed. Finally, the paper outlines potential research directions, including the integration of deep learning, uncertainty quantification, and cloud-based deployment for scalable material intelligence systems. This review aims to provide insights into current trends, technological developments, and future opportunities for AI-driven material selection and property prediction systems in mechanical and materials engineering."
