However, its diagnostic accuracy in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) -a population characterized by extensive extra-valvular calcification- remains unclear.
This retrospective multicenter study included 2909 adults who underwent AVCS and echocardiography between 2015 and 2025 across Mayo Clinic sites. Patients were stratified by glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) to assess AVCS diagnostic performance for severe AS in CKD vs non-CKD cohorts. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves, stratified by sex and eGFR categories, were used to evaluate diagnostic accuracy. Optimal thresholds were derived using Youden's index and compared with guideline-recommended cutoffs.
AVCS demonstrated high diagnostic accuracy in patients with preserved renal function (AUC 0.861), but performance declined with worsening CKD. AUC dropped to 0.791 (eGFR <60), 0.727 (eGFR <45), and 0.691 (eGFR <30). Specificity declined significantly across worsening eGFR, despite stable sensitivity. Sex-stratified analysis revealed similar results.
AVCS remains a reliable tool to rule out severe AS in patients with CKD, but declining specificity with worsening kidney function -likely due to nonvalvular calcification- highlights the risk of false positives. In CKD populations, AVCS thresholds should be interpreted cautiously and integrated with multimodal evaluation and clinical data."

This study aimed to examine perioperative changes in frailty among nonagenarian patients undergoing TAVI.
In this single-center observational analysis, 38 consecutive nonagenarian patients (7.3% of 523 TAVI cases) were evaluated. Frailty parameters-including grip strength, cognitive function (MMSE), overall physical performance (SPPB), gait speed, and activities of daily living (Katz index)-were measured before and after the procedure. No significant differences were observed between preoperative and postoperative values for grip strength (17.4 ± 7.1 vs. 16.1 ± 7.4 kgf, p = 0.102), MMSE (24.1 ± 3.9 vs. 24.3 ± 4.6, p = 0.923), or overall SPPB scores (8.7 ± 2.8 vs. 7.5 ± 3.0, p = 0.084). In contrast, gait speed decreased significantly from 0.8 ± 0.3 m/s to 0.7 ± 0.3 m/s (p = 0.001), and the Katz index also showed a small but statistically significant decline (p = 0.042). The proportion of patients with a walking speed below 0.9 m/s did not change significantly (67.6% vs. 83.8%, p = 0.146).
In a carefully selected nonagenarian cohort, TAVI did not substantially worsen most frailty indices. However, mild in-hospital declines in gait speed and ADL were observed, underscoring the importance of structured early rehabilitation strategies."

Surgical aortic valve replacement (SAVR) and transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) are established treatment options. Neurological complications such as subclinical cerebral ischemia, delirium, and postoperative cognitive decline can occur during either treatment; however, precise data on neurological impairment remain scarce.
The aim of this study was to compare neurological outcomes of patients undergoing TAVI or SAVR.
COSTA (Cognitive Outcome after Surgical and Transcatheter Aortic valve replacement) is a single-center sub-study of the randomized DEDICATE trial (clinicaltrials.gov ID: NCT04535076). Neurocognitive tests (memory, attention, language, executive functions), questionnaires on neuropsychology (cognitive failures questionnaire [CFQ], hospital anxiety, and depression scale [HADS]), and health-related quality of life (SF-36) were used before intervention and 3 months thereafter. Cranial magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was carried out post-intervention. In addition, there was a systematic assessment of delirium during the hospital stay.
The study cohort (mean age 71.8 years, 32% female) consisted of SAVR (n = 13) and TAVI (n = 18) patients. In the SAVR group, subsyndromal delirium was more common (54 vs. 11%, p = 0.017; OR = 8.58), visual recognition ability was worse (mean difference (MD) =  - 0.6 vs. + 0.3, p = 0.036, η2 = 0.14), and emotional impairment was numerically more declined (MD =  - 36.8 vs. - 4.7, p = 0.058, η2 = 0.12) when compared to the TAVI group.
In this small, exploratory sample, SAVR showed a trend toward less favorable neuropsychological outcomes compared with TAVI in patients with low-to-intermediate surgical risk.

While fibroblast activation in HCM has been noted in previous studies, the underlying regulatory mechanisms have not been thoroughly explored. In this study, we analyzed the latest single-nucleus sequencing (snRNA-seq) datasets related to HCM caused by the two most common mutations. We also examined the largest existing snRNA-seq and spatial transcriptomics datasets of HCM for external validation. Additionally, we conducted preliminary histopathological and molecular biology experiments to validate our findings and explore potential mechanisms. Our analysis revealed a phenotypic transformation of macrophages in both cases of HCM. These pro-inflammatory macrophages, driven by the high expression of ENPP2, mediated intercellular interactions that influenced fibroblast activation. The resulting increase in lysophosphatidic acid appeared to act as a plausible intermediary. Activated fibroblasts secreted substantial amounts of COL14A1, which is a critical component of myocardial fibrosis. These findings were consistent across different genetic backgrounds, suggesting their universal applicability in most HCM cases. Our study provides valuable insights into the mechanisms underlying myocardial fibrosis in HCM, highlighting the role of macrophage transformation and fibroblast activation. These findings offer potential for the identification of novel diagnostic or prognostic biomarkers and the development of targeted therapies with clinical translational potential."

This retrospective analysis included preoperative and postoperative data of 157 consecutive patients who underwent isolated sAVR between January 2016 and January 2023. Body mass index and indexed effective orifice area were calculated. The severity of PPM was assessed using the valve academic research consortium-3 criteria, and patients were categorized into (1) Insignificant PPM and (2) Significant PPM. Left ventricular geometries were classified based on the left ventricular mass index (LVMi) and relative wall thickness. Functional capacity was evaluated according to the New York Heart Association classification.
The mean age of the 91 patients who met the selection criteria was 64.2±8.9 years, and 44% were female and 56% were male. Sixteen patients (17.6%) were assigned to the significant PPM group. The median change in LVMi was -33 g/m2 in the insignificant PPM group and -14.5 g/m2 in the significant PPM group (p=0.037). Multivariate logistic regression demonstrated a significant association between LVMi change and significant PPM (odds ratio: 1.021, p=0.043). Although no significant change was observed in left ventricular geometry in either the groups, a significant difference was noted in the functional capacity changes (p=0.01).
Avoiding significant PPM provides better regression in LVMi and greater improvement in functional capacity; however, it is not sufficient for a significant change in left ventricular geometr y."

A 60-year-old male with poorly controlled hypertension, chronic kidney disease, and atrial fibrillation presented with progressive dyspnea and chest tightness. Echocardiography revealed a bicuspid aortic valve with moderate stenosis and regurgitation, reduced ejection fraction, and left ventricular dilation. Computed tomography showed near-occlusive coarctation of the descending aorta. Given high surgical risk, conventional surgery was deemed unfeasible.
A single-session transcatheter ""one-stop"" approach, combining balloon angioplasty, aortic valve replacement, and stent implantation, was performed, resulting in immediate hemodynamic improvement.

However, few clinical studies have concentrated on the application of TAVR in elderly AS patients. This study aimed to explore the efficacy and safety of TAVR in elderly patients with AS.
Clinical and imaging data of 143 AS patients undergoing Transcatheter aortic valve replacement were retrospectively analyzed. These patients were divided into non-elderly group (< 65 years old) and elderly group (≥ 65 years old), and the baseline characteristics and clinical outcomes were compared between the two groups.
The baseline characteristics showed no significant difference between the two groups. After surgery, echocardiography revealed that the forward flow velocity of aortic valve was higher in the non-elderly group than that in the elderly group (234.2 ± 49.8 cm/s vs. 209.9 ± 57.7 cm/s, P=0.022), while there was no significant difference in other indicators.

This in-vitro study assessed coronary perfusion in a high-risk VIV-TAVI scenario. A patient deemed at high-risk and treated with preventive Chimney stenting was selected as case study. A 3D-printed aortic root model was fabricated from pre-operative imaging and used to replicate the patient's VIV-TAVI setting. A CoreValve-Evolut-23 was implanted within a Trifecta-19 at five depths, with commissural alignment and 60° misalignment, to explore procedural variability and associated risk margins. The model was tested in a pulsatile mock loop with a coronary perfusion simulator. Flow and pressure were recorded pre- and post-VIV-TAVI under physiological conditions. Across all tested configurations, VIV-TAVI didn't significantly impair left or right coronary flows. The recommended depth optimized hemodynamic valve performance. Findings suggest refining coronary obstruction risk stratification in VIV-TAVI to improve decision-making regarding preventive interventions."

First-phase ejection fraction (EF1), a sensitive marker of early systolic function, aids in assessing systolic-diastolic relationships in human hypertension and aortic stenosis. This study examines temporal changes in these relationships in mouse models of HFpEF and elevated afterload. Mouse models of abdominal aortic banding (AAB) and HFpEF (induced by hypertension and high fat feeding) underwent comprehensive serial echocardiography. In AAB, EF1 significantly decreased at week 1 post-surgery (18.8 ± 1.2 vs 24.3 ± 0.8%, p<0.001) compared to controls, with further reduction at week 3 (16.8 ± 0.6%) and week 6 (13.9 ± 0.9%, both p<0.001). EF, global longitudinal strain (GLS) and longitudinal strain rate (LSR) remained unchanged until week 3. Isovolumic relaxation time (IVRT) was the only abnormal index of diastolic function at week 1. In the HFpEF model, EF1 significantly decreased at week 2 (19.1 ± 1.1 vs 25.8 ± 1.0%, p<0.001) compared to controls, while EF, GLS, and LSR were unaltered. At week 3, EF1 decreased further (18.1 ± 0.7%) alongside a significant reduction in GLS (p<0.01), while EF and LSR remained unchanged. IVRT increased early in the HFpEF model, followed by later left atrial (LA) enlargement. EF1, an early marker of systolic impairment, decreases early in HFpEF and afterload-induced dysfunction, accompanied by IVRT prolongation. LA dilatation appears later. These findings highlight the interplay between systolic and diastolic dysfunction in HFpEF progression."

However, data on the sex-related impact on bioprosthetic valve durability and very long-term clinical outcomes remain scarce. This study aimed to assess 10-year survival, prognosis, and valve performance in males and females undergoing TAVR with self-expanding bio-prostheses (CoreValve/Evolut R).
Consecutive patients with severe symptomatic aortic stenosis treated with TAVR between 2007 and 2014 at ten Italian centers were prospectively included in the Medtronic One Hospital Clinical Service (OHCS) database and included in the present analysis. The overall population was classified according to sex. The primary endpoint was a composite of all-cause mortality, heart failure rehospitalization, or stroke at 10 years. Secondary endpoints included the single components of the primary endpoint, cardiovascular death, and valve performance.
Among 1944 patients included in the analysis, 54.9% (n = 1068) were female. Compared to males, females were older and exhibited a higher baseline risk profile, characterized by more advanced renal disease and higher transvalvular gradients, yet they more frequently had preserved left ventricular ejection fraction and a lower prevalence of prior cardiovascular events. At 10 years, the primary endpoint occurred significantly more often in male patients, a finding that persisted after adjustment for relevant confounders (adjusted HR 1.15; p = 0.028) and was primarily driven by all-cause mortality. Structural valve deterioration, bioprosthetic valve failure, and valve performance were comparable between sexes at the 10-year follow-up.
Despite older age and increased procedural risk, female patients demonstrated more favorable long-term survival and similar valve durability compared to males over 10 years following TAVR with first-generation CoreValve/Evolut R prostheses. These findings underscore the long-term reliability of self-expanding valves and highlight the need for individualized, sex-specific strategies in TAVR patient selection and management."

The histological structure of a fifth aortic arch differs from that of normal aortic arches. Therefore, it is unclear whether the tissue of a fifth aortic arch can be safely utilized to reconstruct the aortic arch during surgical repair of arch obstruction. We herein report the case of a neonate who underwent surgical repair of a PFAA with interrupted aortic arch, right aortic arch, and aberrant left subclavian artery. Similar to those for a ductus arteriosus, the histological findings of the resected PFAA in this case showed intimal thickening, myxoid deposition in the intima and media, and proliferation and migration of smooth muscle cells into the intima. When reconstructing the aortic arch, we suggest that, if possible, the fifth aortic arch tissue be resected.
The histological findings of a persistent fifth aortic arch (PFAA) are important in determining the treatment strategy because the tissue may be unsuitable for reconstruction of the aortic arch. In the present case, the tissue of the PFAA was histologically similar to that of a ductus arteriosus and thus may have caused re-stenosis or formation of an aneurysm in the future. We therefore recommend resecting the PFAA tissue during aortic arch reconstruction."

Digital health,"Health systems face increasing waiting times for transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI), incurring excess deaths and morbidity. To determine whether remote patient monitoring (RPM) using connected technologies can mitigate these risks by prioritizing patients awaiting TAVI, we aimed to measure the clinical safety and effectiveness of an RPM-based prioritization programme.
Prospective observational cohort study of all patients awaiting TAVI at Imperial College Healthcare NHS Trust, London, UK, between 24th April 2023 and 15th November 2023. An RPM pathway was implemented for all patients accepted for TAVI. These patients responded to a weekly symptom questionnaire via web, smartphone RPM platform or telephone monitoring; with rule-based clinical escalation. The primary endpoint was the rate of adverse events (defined as emergency department presentation, unplanned hospitalization, or death), compared with a propensity score-matched (PSM) historical control group. Secondary endpoints included pathway performance characteristics for detection of deterioration. 200 patients met inclusion criteria. Despite growth of the waiting list, responsible for longer waiting times experienced by the RPM group [median 104 days (IQR 61.00-176.00) vs. 75 days (IQR 38.75-118.00)], there was no difference in rates of adverse events between RPM-patients and historical controls (Log rank P = 0.9). The RPM pathway had high sensitivity for prediction of waiting list death (100%). Patients deemed at high-risk of deterioration experienced shorter waiting times to treatment.
RPM for patients awaiting TAVI is feasible and may mitigate the adverse effects of longer waiting times through accurate detection of deterioration and by informing prioritization decisions."

Adults with SAS, prospectively registered in the Dutch Congenital Cor Vitia (CONCOR) registry between 2001-2019, were included. All-cause mortality, SAS (re-) operation, and cardiovascular events, including arrhythmias, heart failure, (re-)operation for aortic regurgitation (AR), were assessed. Longitudinal changes in echocardiographic peak velocity, interventricular septal thickness (IVST), and left ventricular posterior wall thickness (LVPW) were analysed using linear mixed-effects models. Differences in the history of SAS repair (operated/unoperated patients), isolated/non-isolated SAS, and sex were explored.
Overall, 312 patients were included [age: 26.0 (interquartile range, IQR: 20.0-35.3) years, 68.3% history of SAS repair] with a median follow-up of 16 (IQR: 10-20) years (4423 patient-years). Unadjusted survival at 15 years was lower in the operated group compared to the unoperated group (P = .009) and no significant differences were observed between sexes (P = .083) or isolated/non-isolated SAS (P = .810). The cumulative incidence of (re-)operation for AR at 15 years was 7.6% (95% CI 4.7%-11.0%). The hazard of SAS repair during follow-up was higher in the unoperated group compared to the operated group [HR 0.2 (95% CI 0.1-0.5), P < .001], after correction for covariates. Peak velocity progression was 0.1 m/s (P = .357) during the first period and 0.3 m/s (P = .032) during the second (after ±10 years). No patient showed fast progression (≥0.3 m/s/year) in peak velocity. At baseline no evidence of left ventricular hypertrophy was observed, following IVST/LVPW criteria.
Survival of adult SAS patients with a history of SAS repair was substantially lower compared to the unoperated group, reflecting a potentially more severe SAS phenotype. Nevertheless, long-term clinical event rates were considerable. SAS remained stable, suggesting less echocardiographic follow-up may suffice, particularly in mild phenotypes without AR. Additionally, follow-up should focus on the clinical sequelae of SAS."

Patients with a small aortic annulus (SAA) make up to one-third of the cases and face higher risks of prosthesis-patient mismatch and high valvular gradients.
This meta-analysis aimed to compare balloon-expandable and self-expanding valves used in TAVR in patients with a SAA, focusing on hemodynamic and clinical outcomes.
We systematically searched Cochrane Central, PubMed, and EMBASE for studies comparing balloon-expandable and self-expanding valves in patients with SAA undergoing TAVR. Random effects models were applied to generate odds ratios (ORs) and mean differences with 95% confidence interval (CI).
Fifteen studies (two randomized controlled trials and 13 propensity-matched studies) with 5149 patients (48.4% balloon-expandable valves) were identified. BEVs were associated with a lower indexed effective orifice area (mean difference: -0.18, 95% CI: -0.25 to -0.10; P < 0.00001) and higher transvalvular mean pressure gradient (mean difference: 4.32, 95% CI: 3.39-5.24; P < 0.00001) and peak pressure gradients (mean difference: 4.87, 95% CI: 1.23-8.51; P = 0.009). Permanent pacemaker implantation (OR: 0.57, 95% CI: 0.44-0.73; P < 0.0001) and major bleeding (OR: 0.67, 95% CI: 0.47-0.96; P = 0.03) were lower in balloon-expandable valves. BEVs increased the odds of any prosthesis-patient mismatch (OR: 2.28, 95% CI: 1.61-3.22; P < 0.00001) and severe prosthesis-patient mismatch (OR: 3.16, 95% CI: 2.19-4.58; P < 0.00001).
In patients with SAA undergoing TAVR, SEVs offer superior hemodynamic performance, whereas BEVs are associated with fewer conduction disturbances and bleeding events. Both valve platforms yielded similar clinical outcomes, underscoring the need for individualized device selection."

This process leads to cytotoxicity and organ dysfunction. Cardiac involvement is the main prognostic determinant and requires a multidisciplinary management approach. In recent years, the treatment of AL amyloidosis has significantly evolved with the introduction of innovative agents such as proteasome inhibitors, immunomodulators, and monoclonal antibodies like daratumumab, which has shown a favorable impact on hematological outcomes and organ function. The daratumumab-CyBorD regimen is currently the standard first-line therapeutic option. The therapy is tailored based on the stage of cardiac and renal damage, aiming for a complete hematological and organ response. The management of cardiac involvement, including aortic stenosis, atrial fibrillation, thromboembolic risk, conduction disorders, arrhythmias, and heart failure, plays a crucial role in prognosis. An integrated multidisciplinary approach in specialized centers experienced in the disease is essential to optimize clinical outcomes."

A contrast-enhanced CT revealed a 5.5 cm ascending thoracic aortic aneurysm, bicuspid aortic valve, and a left atrial mass. Transesophageal echocardiography showed a tumor in the left atrium attached to the fossa ovalis. Infectious evaluation was undertaken, and polymerase chain reaction was positive for anaplasmosis. Coronary angiography found severe coronary artery disease. After completing a course of antibiotics and recovering from his acute illness, the patient underwent left atrial tumor resection, aortic valve replacement, aortic aneurysm repair, and coronary artery bypass grafting. Pathology confirmed the tumor was a myxoma. This case illustrates that allowing time for clinical stabilization and completion of a course of antibiotics for sepsis due to anaplasmosis prior to urgent cardiovascular surgery may be a reasonable approach."

We aimed to assess the contemporary lifespan and associated factors in patients with severe AS undergoing TAVR.
We performed a retrospective cohort study of patients who underwent TAVR at the 4 largest centers in Israel between July 2008 and March 2023. Mortality predictors were assessed using multivariable Cox regression analysis.
The cohort included 6191 patients (51% females; mean age 82.7 ​± ​5.4 years; median follow-up 5.9 years). The overall estimated 5- and 10-year survival was 70 and 42%, respectively. To assess temporal trends, patients were stratified to early (2008-2015; n ​= ​2058) and late (2016-2023; n ​= ​4133) eras. Patients in the early TAVR era had significantly lower survival probability, compared to the late era (hazard ratio 2.0 (95% confidence interval 1.8-2.2), p ​< ​0.001], with an 8-year survival of 39 and 71%, respectively. Using an age threshold of ≥80 years, defined using spline analysis the 8-year survival in the early vs. late eras was 37 vs. 47% among older patients and 66 vs. 82% among younger patients.
Lifespan following successful TAVR has markedly improved over the past decade across age groups. Notably, patients younger than 80 years, at the time of TAVR exhibit an estimated survival exceeding 10 ​years. These findings should be integrated into Heart Team decision-making for optimal lifelong management of AS."

Crossref,mitral regurgitation,Prophylactic surgical left atrial appendage exclusion in young patients undergoing open-heart surgery for mitral valve repair: A brain-heart preventive perspective,Alfred Ibrahimi; Romina Teliti; Verona Beka; Kolja Sievert; Horst Sievert; Jacob Zeitani,10.36922/bh025510076,2026-02-05,Brain &amp; Heart,"Cardioembolic stroke remains one of the most severe manifestations of cardiovascular disease, with atrial fibrillation (AF) responsible for a large proportion of ischemic cerebrovascular events. Stroke prevention strategies are currently dominated by oral anticoagulation guided by CHA2DS2-VASc scores, which emphasize age and comorbidities and therefore have limited applicability in younger patients with low conventional risk profiles. Although bleeding risk is routinely assessed using tools such as HAS-BLED, lifelong anticoagulation may still confer a substantial cumulative hemorrhagic burden over decades of treatment. The left atrial appendage (LAA) represents the primary anatomical source of thromboembolism in AF, yet current guidelines largely restrict surgical or percutaneous LAA exclusion to patients with AF who have contraindications to anticoagulation, reflecting a predominantly reactive approach. This Perspective advocates reconsideration of prophylactic surgical LAA exclusion at the time of open mitral valve repair in younger patients. Although early mitral repair limits atrial remodeling, it does not abolish lifetime AF risk, and post-operative or late-onset AF remains frequent. Moreover, residual or recurrent mitral regurgitation promotes progressive atrial dilation and fibrosis, increasing long-term thromboembolic risk even in patients initially in sinus rhythm. By integrating atrial remodeling, LAA morphology and function, residual mitral pathology, and the limitations of lifelong anticoagulation, a selective preventive framework emerges. An anatomical brain-heart prevention strategy may reduce lifetime cerebrovascular risk and improve long-term outcomes. While prospective data are needed, existing evidence supports individualized discussion of prophylactic LAA exclusion during mitral valve repair in selected young patients with structural atrial disease."

Crossref,mitral regurgitation,Mechanisms of mitral valve development and disease,Enshi Wang; Bin Zhou,10.3389/fcvm.2026.1773671,2026-02-04,Frontiers in Cardiovascular Medicine,"The mitral valve apparatus comprises the annulus, valve leaflets, chordae tendineae, and papillary muscles, forming an integrated biomechanical unit essential for unidirectional blood flow. The leaflets and chordae are primarily derived from endocardial cells, and damage to these structures results in either mitral stenosis or mitral regurgitation, depending on the underlying pathology. This review compares three major mitral valve diseases, rheumatic mitral stenosis, congenital mitral stenosis, and myxomatous mitral valve prolapse, to highlight their distinct etiologies, molecular mechanisms, and structural endpoints. Rheumatic mitral stenosis is an acquired immune-mediated disease triggered by Group A streptococcal infection, in which molecular mimicry leads to autoantibody formation and chronic inflammation. Immune-cell infiltration and cytokine release drive the progression of leaflet fibrosis, commissural fusion, calcification, and pronounced chordal shortening, ultimately culminating in fixed obstruction. Large-scale genetic studies have not identified strong causal genes, instead revealing associations with immune-related risk loci, while valve-specific epigenetic mechanisms are poorly explored. Congenital mitral stenosis arises from developmental abnormalities of the mitral valve complex during embryogenesis and is classified into four anatomical subtypes. Due to its low incidence, the condition remains the least studied at the molecular and genetic levels. In contrast, myxomatous mitral valve prolapse is a degenerative, polygenic disorder driven by aberrant TGF                     β                     -dependent endothelial-to-mesenchymal transformation, valve interstitial cell activation, and extracellular matrix remodeling. Genetic studies have identified multiple causal genes, including                     FLNA                     ,                     DCHS1                     ,                     DZIP1                     , and                     TNS1                     , underscoring its mechano-genetic origin. Despite their distinct causes, immune-mediated, developmental, and degenerative/genetic, all three diseases converge on progressive structural failure of the MV apparatus. Notably, pathological remodeling of the chordae plays a decisive role in disease progression and the need for surgical intervention. A deeper understanding of both shared and disease-specific mechanisms, particularly valve- and chordae-specific molecular regulation, is essential to advance translational research in mitral valve disease."

However, data on the long-term prognostic impact of MR and its progression or regression over time remain limited, particularly across individual HCM subtypes.                                                           METHODS:                     Patients with HCM were retrospectively included from a Japanese multicenter registry and compared by MR severity (moderate or greater versus mild or less) within each subtype: hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy (HOCM), end-stage HCM (ES-HCM), and other HCM (including nonobstructive, midventricular obstruction, and apical HCM).                                                           RESULTS:                                            Among 3602 patients (HOCM: n=837; ES-HCM: n=275; other HCM: n=2490), the prevalence of moderate or greater MR was highest in HOCM (36.3%), followed by ES-HCM (21.5%) and other HCM (8.5%). During a median follow-up of 5.3 (interquartile range, 2.1–9.3) years, the cumulative 5-year incidence of all-cause death or heart failure hospitalization was not significantly different between the moderate or greater MR and mild or less MR groups in HOCM (14.6% versus 12.4%;                       P                       =0.35) or ES-HCM (60.7% versus 54.7%;                       P                       =0.84). After adjustment for clinical covariates, no significant association was observed in either subtype (HOCM: hazard ratio, 1.13 [95% CI, 0.79–1.60],                       P                       =0.51; ES-HCM: hazard ratio, 0.84 [95% CI, 0.55–1.28],                       P                       =0.42). In contrast, in other HCM, moderate or greater MR was significantly associated with the higher 5-year cumulative incidence of all-cause death or heart failure hospitalization (34.2% versus 13.9%,                       P                       &lt;0.001), which remained significant after adjustment, with a significant interaction (hazard ratio, 1.45 [95% CI, 1.09–1.91],                       P                       =0.01;                       P                       interaction                       =0.02). MR severity improved over time in HOCM, showed no clear change in ES-HCM, and worsened in other HCM (                       P                       &lt;0.001, 0.46, and &lt;0.001, respectively;                       P                       interaction                       &lt;0.001).                                                                                CONCLUSIONS:                     In patients with HCM, moderate or greater MR was not associated with worse outcomes in HOCM or ES-HCM, but had significant prognostic implications in other HCM subtypes, suggesting the need for HCM subtype-specific MR management."

With a focus on the prevalent psychological complications following the onset of this condition, this study aimed to explore the correlation between antenatal depression and Corona disease anxiety, personality traits, and postpartum depression during the COVID-19 pandemic.                                                           Materials and Methods:                     This cross-sectional descriptive-analytical study investigated women receiving care at health centers affiliated with Kerman University of Medical Sciences during the last month of their pregnancy and the postpartum period in 2022. Following the acquisition of informed consent, participants were assessed using various measures, including demographic and obstetric information, the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale, the Corona Disease Anxiety Scale (CDAS), and the NEO Personality Inventory-Revised during their third trimester of pregnancy. The same group of participants completed the Edinburgh Depression Scale and the Corona Disease Anxiety Scale (CDAS) 4-6 weeks after childbirth.                                                           Results and Discussion:                     There was a significant correlation between family income, unwanted pregnancy as perceived by both the mother and father, and antenatal depression. Additionally, marital satisfaction played a significant role in postpartum depression. Furthermore, antenatal depression was significantly associated with neuroticism, agreeableness, and physical symptoms related to Corona disease anxiety. Personality traits, with the exception of extroversion and conscientiousness, and various domains of Corona disease anxiety, excluding psychological symptoms, were also significantly associated with postpartum depression.                                                           Conclusion:                     During pandemics or epidemics, such as the COVID-19 outbreak, experiencing mental distress during pregnancy can contribute to mental health issues during the postpartum period. This risk is particularly true in individuals with unique personality traits, emphasizing the need for increased focus on mental health within prenatal care during these crises."

Method:                     This cross-sectional study was conducted in Kerman, Iran. Data were collected from patients who visited Afzalipour Hospital in Kerman more than twice during the COVID-19 epidemic from the end of February 2020 to March 21, 2021. We conducted two key analyses: 1. Mixed effect logistic regression was used to check the relationship between the variables and COVID-19 severity. 2. Mixed effect linear regression was used to check the relationship between the variables and the length of stay in the hospital.                                                           Results:                     The findings indicated that the most important risk factors for the severity of COVID-19 were heart diseases (OR=1.67,95%CI:1.20-2.30), increasing age (OR=2.23 for age&gt;54, 95%CI:1.70- 2.90), male gender (OR=1.47,95%CI:1.10-1.96), respiratory diseases other than asthma, and frequency of admission (OR=1.60,95%CI:1.20-2.15). All patients who underwent readmission experienced a shorter duration of hospitalization during their subsequent admission (OR=0.94,95%CI:0.91,0.96) and had a higher mortality rate (30% within 14 days, 26.6% between 14-90 days). Patients readmitted at intervals of 14-90 days and greater than 90 days exhibited lower disease severity compared to those readmitted within the 0-14 day period.                                                           Conclusion:                     Examining readmissions, the severity of COVID-19, and the length of hospital stay in affected patients are important factors for planning and allocating resources for COVID-19 management and treatment. These factors can help policymakers develop effective clinical guidelines for hospitalization or outpatient treatment of COVID-19 patients and contribute to reducing the burden of disease in the community."

Kinovea, as an accessible motion-analysis software, provides both visual and quantitative feedback. However, its application in supporting technique development among beginner athletes remains insufficiently explored. Aim: This study aims to describe the use of Kinovea in biomechanics training and examine its contribution to the awareness of kinematic characteristics and movement techniques among beginner athletes. Methods: A descriptive qualitative design involved 72 beginner athletes aged 18–25 years selected through purposive sampling. Data were collected over 16 weeks through interviews, field observations, and motion video recordings analyzed using Kinovea. Kinematic data focused on joint angles, stride behavior, and movement phases during walking, running, and the flight phase. Qualitative data were analyzed using content analysis with NVivo 12, while kinematic results were interpreted descriptively to identify performance patterns and areas for technical refinement. Result: Kinematic analysis showed coordinated joint-angle patterns across all phases. Walking analysis identified arm swing angles of 50.9°–58.8° and leg separation angles of 64.3°–67.2°, indicating a stable gait rhythm. The running analysis revealed knee angles of 68.8°–69.8° and elbow angles of 87.6°–89.1°, indicating efficient propulsive mechanics. The flight phase demonstrated knee angles of 81.2°–87.8° and elbow angles of 80.4°–88.3°, suggesting effective momentum use and postural stability. These measurements supported stride-efficiency assessment and technique evaluation. Qualitative findings revealed that Kinovea enabled athletes to interpret movement phases and identify technical inefficiencies through slow-motion and frame-by-frame visualization. Conclusion: Kinovea supports basic motion analysis by providing clear kinematic information and helping beginner athletes observe and refine their movement techniques. The findings also offer practical value for coaches by enabling more precise identification of inefficient patterns and guiding targeted corrections during early-stage training."

Although both del Nido and St. Thomas cardioplegia solutions are widely used, comparative evidence in adult rheumatic mitral valve replacement remains limited. This study aimed to compare their myocardial protective efficacy and clinical outcomes. Methods A prospective comparative study was conducted between May 2022 and October 2024. Total 50 adult patients undergoing mitral valve replacement—20 with severe mitral regurgitation (MR) and 30 with severe mitral stenosis (MS) were included. Patients were divided into two groups based on cardioplegia type (del Nido or St. Thomas). Intraoperative parameters, postoperative left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF), troponin I levels, inotropic and ventilatory support, and ICU/hospital stay were analysed. Results Baseline characteristics were comparable across groups. The mean number of cardioplegia doses was significantly lower in the del Nido group (1.6 ± 0.5 vs 3.2 ± 0.8; p &lt; 0.001). Postoperative LVEF was better preserved with del Nido cardioplegia (MS: 53.3 ± 7.2% vs 45.3 ± 10.6%; p = 0.023). Troponin I levels at 6, 24, and 48 h were lower in the del Nido group, though not statistically significant. Patients receiving del Nido required less inotropic and ventilatory support, with shorter ICU and hospital stays. One in-hospital death occurred in the del Nido group due to sepsis. Conclusion Del Nido cardioplegia offers comparable or superior myocardial protection to St. Thomas solution in adult mitral valve replacement, with fewer interruptions, reduced dosing, and faster postoperative recovery."

The 2019 classification distinguishes TRALI type I [no acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) risk factors] from type II (pre-existing or concurrent ARDS risk factors). We describe a case of TRALI type II after red blood cell (RBC) transfusion in a patient with cancer, sepsis, and suspected endocarditis. A 64-year-old woman with metastatic breast cancer on doxorubicin was hospitalized for fever and acute kidney injury. Echocardiography revealed a mobile mass on the posterior mitral leaflet with severe mitral regurgitation, and she was treated with ceftaroline and daptomycin. On hospital day 20, she received an RBC transfusion for anemia (hemoglobin 6.2 g/dL). Five hours later, she developed sudden hypoxemic respiratory failure with new bilateral infiltrates consistent with pulmonary edema, without fluid overload or cardiac decompensation. Despite non-invasive ventilation, she deteriorated and died. TRALI type II was considered the most likely diagnosis, underscoring the need for vigilance."

Catheter looping and knot formation are rare but potentially hazardous complications. Case summary An 82-year-old woman with permanent atrial fibrillation and severe mitral and tricuspid valve regurgitation presented with complete atrioventricular block and a ventricular escape rhythm at 28 bpm. A temporary transvenous pacing catheter inserted via the right internal jugular vein failed to achieve consistent ventricular capture and became entrapped at 45 cm, forming a knot near the venous introducer. Given the patient's frailty and high surgical risk, a multidisciplinary team opted for a fully percutaneous strategy for removal. After definitive pacemaker implantation, the knotted catheter was successfully retrieved using a stepwise approach: engagement of the loop with a deflectable ablation catheter, externalization through a femoral sheath, and extraction using a 13-F dilator sheath to minimize venous trauma. Discussion This case highlights procedural pitfalls during emergency temporary pacing without fluoroscopy and illustrates a safe, creative percutaneous solution for knot retrieval using tools familiar to electrophysiology and lead extraction operators."

Left atrial reservoir strain (LASR) is a sensitive marker of atrial dysfunction and may offer incremental prognostic value. This study evaluated whether LASR predicts all-cause mortality and heart failure (HF) hospitalizations in FMR, its performance in VFMR versus AFMR, and its utility over standard echocardiographic parameters. Methods We retrospectively analyzed 102 patients (mean age 68 ± 14 years, 41.2% female) with at least moderate FMR who underwent transesophageal echocardiography between 2018 and 2023. Patients were categorized into VFMR (LV dysfunction or remodelling) and AFMR (LA enlargement with preserved LV function). LASR was assessed using speckle-tracking echocardiography. Primary and secondary endpoints were all-cause mortality and HF hospitalization, respectively. Cox models evaluated associations with outcomes, including subgroup analysis by LASR quartiles and additional risk stratification combining LASR with peak tricuspid regurgitation (TR) velocity. Results LASR was independently associated with all-cause mortality in multivariate Cox regression (adjusted HR = 0.887, p = 0.039). Higher LASR quartiles were associated with improved survival ( p = 0.013). When combined with peak TR velocity in a composite risk model, patients with LASR ≤ 9.0% or TR velocity &gt; 3.0 m/s had significantly higher risks of mortality (HR = 2.853, p = 0.012) and HF hospitalization (HR = 3.922, p = 0.029). Conclusions LASR, particularly when combined with TR velocity, provides strong prognostic value in FMR, supporting its potential role in refining risk assessment."

Alexopoulos; Doreen Nakagaayi; Elizabeth R. Blackwood; Felix Barasa; Joan Chepkorir Kiyeng; Wycliffe Kosgei; G. Titus Ng’eno; Shanti Nulu; Rebecca Lumsden; Andrea Beaton; Gerald S. Bloomfield,10.5334/gh.1522,2026-01-30,Global Heart,"Background: Rheumatic heart disease (RHD) is a key contributor to maternal cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). Though low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), particularly those in SSA, face a greater burden of RHD, existing systematic reviews have not specifically focused on cardiac and obstetric complications among affected women. We aimed to study cardiac and obstetric complications in pregnant and postpartum women with RHD in SSA and to evaluate the rate of valvular interventions in pregnant or postpartum women with severe disease. Methods: We performed a systematic search in MEDLINE and online sources for studies of women of childbearing age (15–49 years) with RHD published after 2000 in SSA. Included study types were randomized controlled trials, retrospective and prospective cohort studies, case-control studies, case reports, and case series. Two authors independently extracted data and critically appraised articles. PROSPERO registration number: CRD42024628121. Results: We identified 1,478 unique citations, and nine full-text studies met inclusion criteria. Included studies were case series (7), one cohort study, and one case-control study, including a total of 787 pregnant women with cardiac disease, of whom the majority had RHD. Mitral stenosis and regurgitation were the most common valve lesions. Heart failure and arrhythmia occurred in at least 12.9% and up to 36% of study participants, respectively. Eight studies reported deaths due to cardiac causes (median: six deaths due to cardiac disease; total number of deaths: 56). Preterm labor/delivery was the most reported obstetric event, with incidence ranging from 5.2–35.2%. Few pregnant patients received any valve intervention. Conclusions: Pregnant women with RHD in SSA are at risk for both adverse cardiac and obstetric outcomes in pregnancy, particularly heart failure and preterm labor. Future efforts may include registries focused on pregnant women with RHD and scaling cardiac interventional capacity to benefit pregnant women with RHD in SSA. Unstructured Abstract We performed a systematic search in MEDLINE and online sources to study cardiac and obstetric complications and rates of valvular interventions in pregnant and postpartum women with rheumatic heart disease (RHD) in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). Two authors independently extracted data and critically appraised articles. Nine full-text studies met inclusion criteria, capturing 787 pregnant women with cardiac disease, mostly RHD. Heart failure and arrhythmia occurred in at least 12.9% and up to 36% of study participants, respectively. Fifty-six deaths were reported from cardiac causes. Preterm labor/delivery was the most reported obstetric event, and few pregnant patients received any valve intervention. We found that women with RHD in SSA are at risk for adverse cardiac and obstetric outcomes in pregnancy, particularly heart failure and preterm labor. Future efforts may include registries focused on pregnant women with RHD and scaling cardiac interventional capacity to benefit pregnant women with RHD in SSA."

Tang; David Nordsletten,10.3389/fcvm.2025.1673443,2026-01-30,Frontiers in Cardiovascular Medicine,"Introduction Mitral regurgitation (MR) is a common valvular disease associated with complications such as pulmonary hypertension, atrial fibrillation, and heart failure. However, its full impact on the cardiovascular system, especially on right heart function, is not yet fully understood. Understanding this relationship is important because the right ventricle (RV) is critical for maintaining cardiovascular function. Dysfunction of the RV, which may be contributed by conditions like MR, is strongly associated with poor clinical outcomes. Despite its importance, comprehensively studying MR's effect on the RV has been challenging due to the complex, interdependent nature of cardiovascular dynamics, limited patient data, and the difficulty in synthesizing disparate information to clarify the left heart-right heart connection. Methods The primary goal of this study is to investigate the effects of MR on cardiovascular hemodynamics and RV function by integrating 3D models of the left heart with a closed-loop 0D models of the entire cardiovascular system. We further conduct detailed analyses using patient-specific models to explore how various system modifications impact the RV, providing insights into the nuanced effects of MR on the right heart. Results and Discussion This analysis provides several clinically relevant insights. First, progressive MR markedly increases RV afterload and predisposes the RV to dysfunction, even when intrinsic RV contractility is preserved or enhanced. Second, MR-specific severity indices and left-heart metrics alone fail to capture the true burden on the right heart; RV impairment can progress despite stable or only modestly changing MR descriptors. Finally, these findings highlight the need to incorporate direct assessment of RV structure and function into the evaluation of MR, as RV vulnerability plays a critical role in determining patient risk and guiding management decisions."

Duan,10.1161/jaha.125.044333,2026-01-30,Journal of the American Heart Association,"Background Transcatheter edge‐to‐edge mitral valve repair is a key therapeutic option for patients with severe symptomatic mitral regurgitation at high surgical risk. This prospective study aimed to develop a novel end‐to‐end deep learning model for preoperative artificial intelligence assessment in transcatheter edge‐to‐edge mitral valve repair (TEERAI‐pre) candidates using multiview, multimodal echocardiography. Methods TEERAI‐pre, a video vision transformer–based classification model, predicts morphological suitability for transcatheter edge‐to‐edge mitral valve repair from multiview, multimodal echocardiography. A transformer‐based feature‐level fusion module was designed in TEERAI‐pre to integrate multiview, multimodal features for final prediction. An internal data set of 633 patients (7997 transthoracic echocardiographic videos; 766 pulsed‐wave Doppler images) was split for 5‐fold cross‐validation. An external data set of 150 patients (1735 transthoracic echocardiographic videos; 169 pulsed‐wave Doppler images) across 2 hospitals evaluated generalizability. Reference standards were provided by 2 experienced valvular cardiologists per international guidelines. Results On the internal data set, TEERAI‐pre achieved 75.0% accuracy (95% CI, 71.7%–78.4%) for classifying red (unsuitable), yellow (challenging), and green (ideal) zones, with 77.1% precision, 75.5% recall, and 76.2% F1 score. External validation yielded 73.3% accuracy, 74.0% precision, and 74.0% recall. Multiview multimodal integration improved performance. Binary classification (red versus green) showed TEERAI‐pre matched senior experts and outperformed intermediate/junior echocardiologists. Feature‐level fusion outperformed output‐level fusion and single‐view model. Backbone selection and calibration analysis confirmed robust performance. Conclusions TEERAI‐pre demonstrates strong performance in transcatheter edge‐to‐edge mitral valve repair preoperative assessment using transthoracic echocardiographic videos and images, supporting more accurate patient selection and enhancing clinical workflow efficiency.

Loyaga‐Rendon; Milena Jani; Manuel K. Rausch; Aitor Aguirre; Jeremy W. Prokop; Timek Ta,10.1161/jaha.125.046137,2026-01-30,Journal of the American Heart Association,"Background Right‐sided heart failure (RHF), in the presence of tricuspid valve regurgitation, results from left‐sided heart failure, pulmonary hypertension (PH), or heart malformations. The occurrence of RHF and tricuspid regurgitation represents a critical indicator of hospitalization rates and all‐cause mortality. However, RHF has remained understudied, specifically with respect to the tricuspid valve. Methods Using the outbred sheep ( Ovis aries ) model of pulmonary artery banding that induces RHF and tricuspid regurgitation, we generated 3 batches of RNA sequencing for 354 samples containing right ventricle, left ventricle, each tricuspid and mitral valve leaflet, and the pulmonary artery representing both male and female sheep. The reads were assembled into a de novo sheep heart transcriptome for differential analysis. Results The de novo sheep heart transcriptome enhanced transcript mapping of reads by 43% to 45% in the heart valves relative to the reference transcriptome. Identified transcripts produce validated tissue‐specific pathways in ventricles (2756 isoforms), pulmonary arteries (535 isoforms), and valves (1215 isoforms), with transcript differences between the mitral and tricuspid valve involved in extracellular and endocrine signaling. Pulmonary artery banding resulted in the most significant transcriptional changes in the tricuspid valve with alterations in endocrine and immune pathway genes. Conclusions This project highlights the complexity of heart valve tissues and their transcriptional activity in a sheep model of RHF. It suggests potential therapeutic interventions in heart valve remodeling in pulmonary artery hypertension, RHF, and tricuspid regurgitation. This work highlights the need for further human and model organism research into the dynamic valve cells and genes."
OpenAlex,mitral regurgitation,Assessing the impact of transcatheter edge-to-edge repair on reverse remodeling in secondary mitral regurgitation: a systematic review and meta-analysis,Adolf Lichtfusz; Nina Galdzytska; Dorottya Gergő; Bence Szabó; Péter Hegyi; Zsolt Molnár; Gábor Zoltán Duray; Judit Papp,10.3389/fcvm.2025.1714337,2026-01-30,Frontiers in Cardiovascular Medicine,"Background and aim Transcatheter edge-to-edge repair (TEER) is a minimally invasive approach to reduce secondary mitral regurgitation (SMR) in patients with heart failure. However, there is limited evidence on its effectiveness in achieving reverse remodeling. Our aim was to assess the effects of TEER over time and to compare the effects of TEER plus GDMT vs. GDMT alone on echocardiographic parameters. Methods A systematic search of MEDLINE, EMBASE, and CENTRAL was conducted from inception to November 16, 2023. Eligible studies included patients with SMR treated with TEER and echocardiographic follow-ups. We evaluated changes in left ventricular end-diastolic diameter (LVEDD), left ventricular end-systolic diameter (LVESD), left ventricular end-diastolic volume (LVEDV), left ventricular end-systolic volume (LVESV), left atrial volume (LAV), left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) and NTproBNP levels. Results Of 9,290 identified studies, 38 met inclusion criteria. After TEER, statistically significant reductions were observed in LVEDD (–1.63 mm), LVESD (–1.20 mm), LVEDV (–14.21 mL), and LVESV (–9.24 mL). Changes in LAV (–5.70 mL) and LVEF (+1.10%) were not statistically or clinically meaningful. NT-proBNP decreased substantially (–1,340 pg/mL). In comparative analyses, TEER plus GDMT did not show statistically significant differences vs. GDMT alone for any parameter, including LVEDD (–1.02 mm), LVEDV (–11.98 mL), LVEF (–0.14%), and LVESV (–5.29 mL). TEER reduced grade 3–4 MR from 99% to 9%. Systematic Review Registration identifier CRD42023483404. Conclusion TEER results in statistically significant but clinically small changes in echocardiographic parameters, and no clear advantage over GDMT alone. These findings should be interpreted with caution given the high heterogeneity and low certainty of evidence. Further studies are needed to define which SMR patient subgroups may derive meaningful reverse-remodeling benefit from TEER.

OpenAlex,mitral regurgitation,Short-term outcomes of minimally invasive open-heart surgery in children at Cho Ray Hospital,Todd Le; Van Phung Doan; Ngoc Vi Hoang,10.47972/vjcts.v54i.1647,2026-01-29,Tạp chí Phẫu thuật và Tim mạch và Lồng ngực Việt Nam,"Background: Minimally invasive surgery has emerged as a major developmental trend in open-heart surgery worldwide over the past two decades. In Viet Nam, minimally invasive open-heart surgery in pediatric patients has been developing since 2014 and is currently performed at several major cardiovascular centers. This study reports the early outcomes of minimally invasive open-heart surgery in children at Cho Ray Hospital. Objective: To evaluate the early outcomes of minimally invasive cardiac surgery in pediatric patients at Cho Ray Hospital. Methods: A retrospective descriptive study was conducted by reviewing medical records of pediatric patients with congenital or acquired heart diseases who underwent surgery at the Pediatric Cardiac Surgical Intensive Care Unit, Cho Ray Hospital, from January 2020 to December 2025. Surgical approaches did not involve full median sternotomy and were performed with cardiopulmonary bypass support. Patients with isolated patent ductus arteriosus or isolated coarctation of the aorta were excluded. Results: A total of 40 pediatric patients underwent minimally invasive open-heart surgery, including 24 females (60%). The mean age at operation was 6.8 years (range: 3 months to 15 years), with a mean body weight of 25.5 kg (range: 4.7–65 kg). Preoperative diagnoses were ventricular septal defect in 23 patients (57.5%), atrial septal defect in 13 patients (32.5%), mitral regurgitation in 2 patients (5%), cor triatriatum in 1 patient (2.5%), and left atrial myxoma in 1 patient (2.5%). Minimally invasive surgical approaches included lower partial sternotomy in 11 patients (27.5%), right submammary thoracotomy in 18 patients (45%), and right vertical axillary thoracotomy in 11 patients (27.5%). The mean postoperative length of hospital stay was 19.8 days (range: 6–39 days). Early postoperative outcomes were favorable, with no in-hospital mortality, no reoperations, and no atrioventricular block requiring permanent pacemaker implantation (0%). Postoperative complications were infrequent, consisting of pneumothorax in 2.5% of patients and surgical site infection in 2.5%. Conclusion: In this study, the complication rate was very low, and no mortality was observed. Cardiac lesions were completely repaired, with no significant residual defects detected on postoperative echocardiography. Minimally invasive open-heart surgery in pediatric patients at Cho Ray Hospital demonstrated good and safe short-term outcomes. Minimally invasive open-heart surgery in pediatric patients performed at Cho Ray Hospital is safe and associated with favorable short-term outcomes."
OpenAlex,mitral regurgitation,Severe mitral regurgitation after acute myocardial infarction: from clinical cases to treatment,Hung Dung Van; Le Hoang Duy Do,10.47972/vjcts.v54i.1627,2026-01-29,Tạp chí Phẫu thuật và Tim mạch và Lồng ngực Việt Nam,"Overview: Severe mitral regurgitation after acute myocardial infarction is rare but very serious with a very high mortality rate despite aggressive treatment. Through 8 clinical cases, our aim was to evaluate the mid-term outcome and review the literature on management. Results: Median age: 65 yo (34-74). Six cases were male, admitted to the hospital with acute myocardial infarction 24-72 hours ago. Clinical progression was very rapid with acute pulmonary edema and cardiogenic shock (6/8 cases). 6 patients underwent emergency surgery for mitral valve replacement (5), mitral valve valvuloplasty (1), and coronary artery bypass grafting (4); 2 patients underwent semi-emergent mitral valve repair. Postoperative period was severe and prolonged with high dose of inotropic drugs and intra-aortic balloon pump. However, 7 cases recovered well and were discharged. One case was operative death. In surgery, complete rupture of the posterio-median papillary muscle accounted for the majority of 6/8 cases. Conclusion: The cause of severe mitral regurgitation after myocardial infarction is mainly due to posterio-median papillary muscle injury. Depending on the clinical manifestations and the conditions of the cardiovascular center, treatment includes a combination of medical treatment, mitral valve surgery and transcatheter mitral valve intervention. Surgical valve replacement or mitral repair gives good results in the medium term."
