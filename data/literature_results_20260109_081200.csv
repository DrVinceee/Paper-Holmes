PubMed,aortic stenosis,Incidental Finding of Secondary Focal Segmental Glomerulosclerosis in Renal Allograft due to Renal Artery Stenosis.,Zhixin Huang; Fangzhou Guo; Tong Wu; Zeying Jiang; Shuqi Huang; Yunfei Teng; Qihua Wang; Jue Wang; Zhenyu Xu; Shicong Yang; Yan Wang; Longshan Liu; Wenfang Chen,10.1111/petr.70254,2026-01,Pediatric transplantation,"Focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS), which can be caused by many etiologies, is one of the major causes of nephrotic syndrome and end-stage kidney disease. Multiple etiologies, including glomerular hyperperfusion, can cause secondary FSGS. Unilateral renal artery stenosis can lead to FSGS of the contralateral native kidney, but it is not well demonstrated whether transplant renal artery stenosis can cause a similar change in a single transplanted kidney.
A female underwent kidney transplantation at the age of 17 on January 14, 2020. Her renal function remained stable until 25 months later, when the patient presented with hypertension and elevated serum creatinine (SCr), with an unremarkable urine test. Ultrasound and computed tomography angiography (CTA) revealed stenosis at the initial segment of the main transplant renal artery. After percutaneous transluminal angioplasty of the main transplant renal artery, her SCr and blood pressure recovered. 5 months later, hypertension recurred with moderate proteinuria (2.5 g/d). An allograft biopsy showed a remarkable cellular FSGS lesion. Due to the absence of glomeruli in the electronic microscope sample, a second biopsy was performed a month later. Unexpectedly, no FSGS, except for very mild glomerular hypoperfusion and remarkably enlarged juxtaglomerular apparatus, was found. Hemodynamic abnormality in the kidney was suspected as the two biopsy sites were from the lower pole and upper pole, respectively. The donor kidney had an accessory renal artery on a common aortic patch with the main renal artery. Doppler ultrasonography confirmed two different hemodynamic areas in the kidney. Transplant renal artery stenosis of the main artery induced an FSGS lesion in the region dominated by the accessory artery. Endovascular stenting was performed, and her proteinuria turned negative, with SCr recovering only 3 days later. The patient had long-term follow-up after discharge and had a favorable condition.
Transplant renal artery stenosis can cause regional hyperperfusion leading to adaptive FSGS, presenting with proteinuria and morphologically manifesting as a cellular variant of FSGS instead of the classic variant, which is usually closely related to hyperperfusion. The lesion must be differentiated from primary and other secondary FSGS. Removal of the hemodynamic abnormality can quickly relieve hypertension and proteinuria."

This study aimed to elucidate clinical and molecular differences between HD and non-HD patients with AS, focusing on transcriptomic profiling of resected aortic valves.
We retrospectively analysed 183 patients with severe AS who underwent surgical aortic valve replacement (SAVR) at the University of Yamanashi Hospital from February 2015 to May 2024. Among them, 34 patients were receiving maintenance HD, while 149 were not. Clinical data, echocardiographic findings, and computed tomography-based valve calcification were assessed. RNA sequencing was conducted on aortic valve specimens from five HD and four non-HD patients. Differentially expressed genes were identified, followed by enrichment analysis and immune cell profiling using CIBERSORTx.
HD patients exhibited lower body mass index, a higher prevalence of ischaemic heart disease, elevated C-reactive protein and B-type natriuretic peptide levels, and impaired diastolic function compared to non-HD patients. RNA sequencing revealed 35 upregulated and 30 downregulated genes in HD valves. Enrichment analysis demonstrated that genes involved in immune response and ossification were upregulated in aortic valves from HD patients. CIBERSORTx analysis suggested increased macrophage infiltration. Comparison with public datasets identified HD- associated gene signatures.
Patients with AS on HD exhibited distinct clinical features and gene expression profiles. Upregulation of immune and ossification-related genes, alongside macrophage infiltration, suggests a key role for immune response in AS progression among HD patients."

Less is known about the operator volumes-outcomes association in the contemporary era.
To determine whether an operator-level volume-outcomes association exists for TAVR and MTEER in the contemporary era.
This cohort study examined data from patients undergoing TAVR or MTEER between January 2020 and December 2023 included in the Society of Thoracic Surgeons (STS)/American College of Cardiology (ACC) Transcatheter Valve Therapies (TVT) Registry, a national all-comers real-world registry. Consecutive patients undergoing TAVR for aortic stenosis or MTEER for mitral regurgitation were included. Data analysis was performed from October 2024 to December 2025.
TAVR or MTEER.
The primary outcome measures were (1) 30-day all-cause mortality, (2) a 30-day composite outcome, and (3) in-hospital procedural complications following TAVR or MTEER. Data from the STS/ACC TVT Registry were analyzed for patients undergoing TAVR or MTEER between 2020 and 2023. The primary analysis assessed the association between operator volume and 30-day outcomes using a 2-level random-effects logistic regression model. The interaction between operator and hospital volumes and the association between TAVR and MTEER outcomes were also evaluated.
A total of 358 943 patients underwent TAVR at 827 hospitals (7524 operators; median [IQR] annual volume, 24 [11-47]), and 51 407 patients underwent MTEER at 493 hospitals (2483 operators; median [IQR] annual volume, 12 [7-19]). For TAVR, median (IQR) patient age was 79.0 (73.0-85.0) years, and 152 186 patients (42.4%) were female; for MTEER, median (IQR) patient age was 79.0 (71.0-84.0) years, and 23 402 patients (45.5%) were female. Low-volume operators demonstrated inferior process of care measures compared with high-volume operators. In adjusted analyses, a higher risk of 30-day mortality (odds ratio [OR], 1.13; 95% CI, 1.02-1.26; P = .02) and in-hospital complications (OR, 1.09; 95% CI, 1.03-1.16; P = .005) was observed for low-volume TAVR operators (<15/y) compared with high-volume operators (>37/y). For MTEER, in-hospital complications (OR, 1.31; 95% CI, 1.11-1.56; P = .002) were higher for low-volume operators (<8/y) compared with high-volume operators (>16/y), while 30-day mortality was not different (OR, 1.16; 95% CI, 0.96-1.41; P = .12). Associations were consistent across hospital volume strata. Operator-level outcomes for TAVR and MTEER were not correlated.
In this cohort study, results from a large, contemporary US registry demonstrate a persistent inverse association between operator volume and patient outcomes for both TAVR and MTEER. These findings may help inform future policies aimed at ensuring optimal outcomes."
PubMed,aortic stenosis,Explaining the Comprehension-Production Vocabulary Gap Through Neural Networks and Cross-Syndrome Evidence: Insights From Williams Syndrome.,Dean D'Souza; Hana D'Souza; Julien Mayor; Ángel Eugenio Tovar,10.1111/desc.70115,2026-03,Developmental science,"The comprehension-production vocabulary gap is a well-documented hallmark of language development; however, anecdotal evidence suggests that this asymmetry may be reduced in children with Williams syndrome (WS). Here, we use empirical data to characterise the comprehension-production gap and computational modelling to investigate potential mechanisms underlying this distinctive linguistic profile, focusing on children aged 7 months to 6 years. Using parental reports (Communicative Development Inventories), we measured the receptive and expressive vocabularies of children with WS (n = 67) and compared them to typically developing children (n = 1210) and cross-syndrome groups with Down syndrome (n = 27), and fragile X syndrome (n = 15). Results confirm that children with WS show a unique trajectory: alongside general delay, they exhibit a significantly reduced comprehension-production asymmetry not observed in other groups. To elucidate the potential origins of this phenomenon, we implemented a biologically inspired neural network-self-organising map (SOM)-to model early word learning and evaluate visual and auditory map representations. Our findings reveal that WS-like vocabulary patterns can emerge from selective difficulties in visual processing, leading to exemplar-based rather than prototype-based object representations. The model suggests that these visual processing challenges, consistent with known visuospatial difficulties in WS, may contribute to the atypical comprehension-production relationship, while broader processing constraints may underlie general delays. This study provides a mechanistic account of vocabulary development in WS, highlighting the role of visual constraints in shaping lexical outcomes. More broadly, it underscores the need to conceptualise language development as an interaction between sensory input and cognitive subsystems, explaining why the comprehension-production gap is not a uniform feature of language acquisition."

In this study, we present a case of upper limb neurological symptoms following a serratus anterior plane block (SAPB) administered after MICS, which was visualized via contrast x-ray imaging. A 74-year-old woman with severe aortic stenosis underwent aortic valve replacement via minithoracotomy. We preoperatively inserted a SAPB catheter deep into the serratus anterior muscle (SAM). Postoperative x-ray imaging with contrast medium revealed its distribution extending from the chest wall (second to fourth ribs), detached from the thorax, toward the right upper arm. We initiated a programmed intermittent bolus infusion (PIBI) via the catheter, but the patient developed reduced grip and sensory deficits in the right arm. Discontinuation of PIBI on postoperative day five led to neurological symptom resolution by day six. The clinical course and contrast distribution suggested that the catheter tip may have migrated to the superficial layer of the SAM. These findings highlight the importance of confirming catheter placement and carefully monitoring neurological symptoms when atypical contrast spread patterns are observed."

To study the impact of CMA on clinical and hemodynamic outcomes following ViV-TAVI for failed SAVR.
Data of patients who underwent ViV-TAVI for failed SAVR valves at two institutions (Heart Center Leipzig at Leipzig University, Leipzig, Germany; Cedars-Sinai Smidt Heart Institute, Los Angeles, USA) were retrospectively collected and compared regarding the existence of CMA. Outcomes of interest included Valve Academic Research Consortium (VARC)-3-based clinical endpoints, Computed Tomography-based hypoattenuated leaflet thickening (HALT), hemodynamic outcome, and mid-term all-cause mortality.
Of the 687 patients who underwent ViV-TAVI, post-procedural CT of sufficient quality to measure commissural alignment was available in 180 patients (47.8% females, mean age 78.0 years). Self-expanding TAVI valves were used in 49.2% of the cases. CMA was found in 35 individuals (19.4%) and was associated with reduced VARC-3-based technical success (80% vs. 93%, p = 0.03), driven by increased rates of coronary obstruction (17.1% vs. 5.6%, p = 0.03). The incidence of HALT was 31.7%, without differences in patients with and without CMA. VARC-3-based device success was 62.9%, driven by an incidence of residual mean valve gradient (≥ 20 mmHg) of 35.4%, without differences between groups. Midterm survival after a mean of 747 days was 84.6% and comparable between groups.
For patients undergoing ViV-TAVI for failed SAVR, technical success is reduced for cases of CMA due to higher odds of coronary obstruction, without differences in mid-term survival."

The Pullback Pressure Gradient (PPG), a novel physiological metric, categorizes coronary artery disease (CAD) into focal or diffuse patterns based on coronary physiology.
This study investigates the association between the PPG and coronary atherosclerosis, as characterized by intravascular ultrasound (IVUS).
This is a pre-specified analysis of the PPG Global study (NCT04789317). We included stable patients with hemodynamically significant lesions (FFR ≤0.80) undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) guided by IVUS. PPG was calculated from manual FFR pullbacks before PCI. Pathophysiological CAD patterns were classified as focal or diffuse based on the median PPG (0.62).
A total of 261 patients (264 vessels) with PPG and IVUS were included. The mean age was 69±11 years, 77% were male, and 33% had diabetes mellitus. A significant correlation was observed between PPG and plaque burden (r=0.53, 95% CI 0.43-0.61, p<0.001). Vessels with focal CAD exhibited significantly higher plaque burden compared to those with diffuse CAD (83±6% vs. 76±8%, p<0.001). The prevalence of attenuated plaques was greater in vessels with high PPG (68% vs. 39%, p <0.001), while calcified plaques were more frequent in vessels with low PPG (60% vs. 78%, p=0.003).
In vessels with flow-limiting stenoses, high PPG is associated with increased plaque burden. Vessels with high PPG (focal disease) predominantly exhibited lipid-rich plaques, whereas those with low PPG (diffuse disease) had a greater calcium burden."

Data on bridging stent choice in IBD are limited. The aim of this meta-analysis was to assess Advanta V12/iCast outcomes when used as bridging stent during IBD procedures.
The English medical literature was systematically searched through PubMed, Scopus, and Cochrane Library (last search: 03.01.2025). The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses statement was followed, and a predefined protocol was registered to PROSPERO. Randomized controlled trials and observational studies (2000--2025) reporting on the Advanta V12/iCast-related outcomes were eligible. The ROBINS-I tool and Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluations (GRADE) were used to assess the risk of bias and quality of evidence. Primary outcomes were technical success, stenosis/occlusion, endoleak Ic/IIIc, and reintervention rates during follow-up. Data on the outcomes of interest were synthesized using proportional meta-analysis.
From 2698 study reports, 10 observational studies (510 targeted IIAs, 467 IIAs bridged with Advanta V12/iCast) were included. According to ROBINS-I, eight studies were of low and two were of moderate quality. Technical success was 98% (95% confidence interval (CI) = 93%-100%; I2 = 0%; certainty: very low). Regarding the 30-day outcomes, the occlusion/stenosis rate was 2% (95% CI = 0%-9%; I2 = 0%), the endoleak Ic/IIIc rate was 0.3% (95% CI = 0%-3%; I2 = 0%) and the reintervention rate was 1% (95% CI = 0%-3%; I2 = 0%). The mean follow-up among studies was 23.4 months (95% CI = 14.2-32.7). During follow-up, the occlusion/stenosis rate was 4% (95% CI = 1%-11%; I2 = 19%; certainty: very low), the endoleak Ic/IIIc overall rate was 5% (95% CI = 3%-8%; I2 = 0%; certainty: very low), and the reintervention rate was 5% (95% CI = 3%-9%; I2 = 0%; certainty: very low).
The Advanta V12/iCast balloon-expandable covered stent showed low occlusion/stenosis, endoleak, and reintervention rates at 30 days and follow-up and appeared to be a reliable bridging stent choice in IBDs.Clinical ImpactThe available literature on iliac branch devices does not provide adequate evidence supporting bridging stent selection. This systematic review and meta-analysis on the use of Advanta V12/iCast as bridging stent showed a high technical success rate of 98%, along with low occlusion/stenosis, endoleak Ic/IIIc and reintervention rates at 30 days, which were maintained below 5% during the total follow-up. These results reflect on the reliability of Advanta V12/iCast when used as bridging stent in iliac branch devices. However, the low quality of evidence should be considered upon result interpretation."

Classically, TAVI is performed via femoral arterial access. However, some patients who have severe peripheral arterial disease do not have safely accessible femoral arteries. In such patients, the use of carotid access has been well described via the 'clamp-and-sew' technique. We describe a minimally invasive carotid access technique for TAVI deployment. The right common carotid is accessed by a 3 cm suprasternal incision. The carotid sheath is entered, and the surgeon obtains proximal and distal control of the carotid artery. The surgeon then makes two opposing purse strings over the anterior surface of the carotid artery. The Seldinger technique is used to obtain access to the carotid artery, followed by placement of the TAVI sheath. The valve is then deployed and echocardiographically confirmed. Upon removal of the TAVI sheath, the purse strings are tightened and sequentially tied. Haemostasis is achieved and skin is closed. This minimally invasive TAVI technique provides an option for patients with unfavourable peripheral access sites while offering the benefits of TAVI compared to open valve replacement."

The complication rate of transfemoral access BAV (transfemoral valvuloplasty [TFV]) is comparable to that of transcatheter aortic valve replacement. Transradial access BAV (transradial valvuloplasty [TRV]) is technically feasible; however, comparative data for TFV are lacking. We aim to compare TFV and TRV in terms of technical and hemodynamic success, periprocedural safety, and short-term clinical outcomes.
Consecutive patients undergoing BAV at a tertiary center from 2021 to 2024 were assessed. TRV was performed with ultrasound guidance and an 8F short sheath equipped with compatible balloons. Hemodynamic success was defined as a reduction in gradient of 30% or more. The primary outcome was the periprocedural composite of a Valve Academic Research Consortium (VARC) 3 major vascular complication, grade 3 to 4 bleeding, and balloon entrapment, and nonaccess-related events, including complete heart block, periprocedural stroke, hypotension, severe aortic insufficiency, and periprocedural death. The secondary outcome was the 30-day composite of all-cause mortality, cardiac-related hospitalization, and discharge failure. Inverse probability of treatment weighting, followed by multivariate regression, was employed to address confounders.
105 TRV and 148 TFV were included. Technical success rate was 96.2% for TRV and 98.7% for TFV (P = .21). The primary outcome event rate was significantly lower in the TRV compared to the TFV group: 2.53% vs 17.47%; adjusted odds ratio, 0.13; 95% CI, 0.04-0.49; P = .003. Technical and hemodynamic success and secondary outcomes were comparable between TRV and TFV.
In comparison to TFV, TRV is associated with lower rates of periprocedural safety events while maintaining similar short-term clinical outcomes and hemodynamic performance."

Cavitron ultrasonic surgical aspiration (CUSA) has been reported as a method for controlled debridement of severe MAC during mitral valve surgery, however experience in the literature is limited.
We assessed 30-day and intermediate-term outcomes in 67 consecutive patients (mean age: 72 (SD 9) years; female sex: 65.7% (44/67)) with severe MAC who underwent mitral valve repair or replacement for mitral stenosis and/or regurgitation using CUSA between 3/2021 and 12/2024. Operations included isolated mitral valve replacement (41.8% (28/67)), isolated mitral valve repair (4.5% (3/67)), mitral and aortic valve replacement (37.3% (25/67), mitral valve replacement with coronary bypass (6.0% (4/67)), and mitral and aortic valve replacement with coronary bypass (10.4% (7/67)). Intermediate survival was estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method.
Mortality rate was 6.0% (4/67), stroke was 3.0% (2/67), and new postoperative atrial fibrillation was 29.0% (20/67). There were no atrioventricular groove ruptures. At a median echocardiographic follow-up time of 361 days (IQR 112, 671) moderate paravalvular leak occurred in 3.0% (1/67). Mid-term all-cause mortality was 9.0% at a mean follow-up time of 42.5 (95% CI 39.0, 46.0) months.
The use of CUSA to debride severe mitral annular calcification in patients undergoing mitral valve surgery is associated with acceptable short-term morbidity and mortality and durable intermediate-term results. This technique allows surgical intervention in patients who may otherwise be deemed prohibitive surgical risk."

A retrospective study of 20 prenatal cases with 7q11.23 CNVs diagnosed by SNP array or CNV sequencing (CNV-seq) was conducted. Clinical data, including ultrasound findings, genetic results, and pregnancy outcomes, were analyzed.
Classic 7q11.23 deletions (1.42 Mb median size) were associated with ultrasound anomalies in 100% of cases (11/11), predominantly cardiovascular defects (36.4%, 4/11) and growth restriction (18.2%, 2/11). While 7q11.23 duplications (1.42-3.03 Mb) were associated with anomalies in 50% of cases (3/6), including cleft palate and ventriculomegaly. Inheritance pattern analysis revealed 50% of deletions (6/12) and 42.9% of duplications (3/7) were inherited, either from phenotypically normal or abnormal parents. Termination of pregnancy (TOP) occurred in 76.5% (13/17) of ongoing pregnancies, primarily for de novo CNVs. Four live births involved inherited CNVs.
7q11.23 CNVs exhibit significant prenatal phenotypic variability and inheritance heterogeneity. Advanced genomic testing and inheritance pattern analysis are critical for accurate diagnosis and counseling."

Here we demonstrate that sphingosine kinase 1 (SPHK1) is a key node in these contexts. Sphk1 is the most upregulated transcript in Eln(-/-) aortic SMCs at embryonic day 15.5 when these cells are initially hyperproliferative. The aorta of humans with SVAS also upregulates SPHK1. Reduced ELN increases levels of transcription factor early growth response 1, resulting in increased SPHK1 levels. SMC-specific Sphk1 deletion or pharmacological inhibition of SPHK1 attenuates SMC proliferation and mitigates aortic disease. Furthermore, treatment with a SPHK1 inhibitor reduces DA SMC accumulation, leading to DA patency in wild-type mice. These findings indicate that inhibiting SPHK1 may be a therapeutic strategy for SVAS and select congenital heart diseases in which patent DA maintains circulation."

HUS can be divided into 2 subtypes: typical HUS and atypical HUS (aHUS). The standard treatment for aHUS, a complement-mediated thrombotic microangiopathy, as approved in the United States and European Union involves long-term administration of eculizumab or ravulizumab with complement-mediated thrombotic microangiopathy. This report is of a 70-year-old woman with aHUS triggered by artificial mitral valve dysfunction. CASE REPORT A 70-year-old woman with history of artificial mitral valve replacement was admitted to the nephrology department with suspected HUS. She presented with malaise, dyspnea, anemia, thrombocytopenia, hemolysis, and schistocytes in blood smear. Complement factors were normal, but sC5b-9 was elevated, suggesting complement overactivation. ADAMTS-13 was >10%, ruling out thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura. Infection with a Shiga toxin-producing bacterium was ruled out. Genetic tests for complement factors revealed no pathogenic variants. The patient was treated with eculizumab, leading to significant clinical improvement. Due to her cardiac history, a comprehensive cardiologic evaluation was performed, revealing perivalvular leakage and severe dysfunction of the mitral valve prosthesis. She subsequently underwent a 2-step intravascular mitral valve repair. The administration of eculizumab resulted in clear improvement in hemolysis, renal function, and platelet count prior to mitral valve surgery, strongly supporting the diagnosis of an aHUS-type thrombotic microangiopathy. Surgical intervention was subsequently performed and contributed to long-term stabilization. CONCLUSIONS This case underscores the challenges of treating thrombotic microangiopathy in a patient with multiple comorbidities and complicated medical history."

We aimed to determine (i) whether baseline RRI predicts survival after mitral transcatheter edge-to-edge repair (M-TEER) and (ii) whether RRI changes in response to the procedure.
In this prospective, single-center cohort we enrolled consecutive patients with severe mitral regurgitation who underwent M-TEER between October 2020 and December 2021 (trial registration number 412/20, date of registration 02.09.2020). Baseline demographics, estimated laboratory parameters, comprehensive echocardiography, and Doppler-derived RRI were collected before and 3 months after intervention. The primary endpoint was all-cause mortality. Associations were analyzed with multivariable Cox regression. Renal endpoints were not systematically collected and were therefore not included as clinical outcome measures.
Among 109 patients (53.2% women), the median baseline RRI was 0.71 (IQR 0.67-0.75) and showed no correlation with eGFR, left-ventricular ejection fraction, or echocardiographic measurements of mitral regurgitation at baseline. Higher RRI was associated with all-cause mortality, and in exploratory post hoc analyses an RRI cutoff > 0.70 remained predictive independent of baseline renal function (HR 5.37, p 0.07). RRI improved significantly 3 months after M-TEER (0.67; IQR 0.63-0.70; p < 0.001), particularly in patients with a post-procedural MR reduction of at least 1 grade. However, the change in RRI showed no correlation with mortality or changes in renal function.
A baseline RRI above 0.70 was independently associated with mortality following M-TEER, underscoring its potential prognostic relevance. The marked post-procedural decline in RRI, especially in patients with relevant MR improvement, suggests that RRI reflects hemodynamic rather than renal filtration changes. Given the limited sample size and number of events, these findings should be considered exploratory and hypothesis-generating, requiring validation in larger multicenter cohorts."

We report a case of mitral valve replacement in a 76-year-old woman with a large caseous cavity, coronary artery disease, severe mitral valve stenosis and atrial fibrillation. Preoperative computed tomography showed a large caseous cavity (3 x 3.5 cm) in the posterior annulus extending into the atrioventricular groove. After unroofing and evacuation, the cavity was excluded with a pericardial patch. The lower edge of the patch was sutured to the ventricular side of the cavity; valve sutures passed through the residual posterior leaflet, the upper edge of the patch and the atrial edge of the cavity. The mitral prosthesis was then secured. The patient was weaned from cardiopulmonary bypass without complications. Intraoperative echocardiography demonstrated a well-seated mitral prosthesis with no valvular or paravalvular leaks. Postoperative imaging confirmed successful exclusion of the cavity in the atrioventricular groove. The postoperative echocardiogram revealed a mean gradient of 4 mmHg across the mitral prosthesis and no mitral regurgitation. Patch exclusion of the caseous cavity is a safe and feasible approach to support implanting a mitral prosthesis and obliterating a cavity."

Transcatheter edge-to-edge repair (TEER) of the mitral valve has been introduced as a therapeutic alternative for individuals with LVOT obstruction and concurrent MR, but there are insufficient outcome data. We aim to perform a systematic review and patient-level meta-analysis of the studies reporting the outcomes of TEER of the mitral valve in HCM.
Original studies published in PubMed and Google Scholar were included if ​≥1 of the following pre- and post-TEER measures were reported: peak resting or provoked LVOT gradients, MR grade, mitral valve gradient, or New York Heart Association (NYHA) functional class. One unpublished case from the Minneapolis Veterans Affairs Medical Center was also included.
Nineteen publications and 37 patients (mean age 70.1 [±15.2] years, 50% male, mean follow-up time of 9.2 [±6.4] months) were analyzed. Compared to baseline measurements, there was a significant reduction in the mean peak resting and provoked LVOT gradients (69.2 [±40.3] mmHg vs. 11.7 [±8.6] mmHg and 98.2 [±53.4] mmHg vs. 14.1 [±13.9] mmHg, respectively), median MR grade (4.0 [3.0-4.0] vs. 1.0 [1.0-1.0]), and proportion of patients with an NYHA functional class ≥3 (100 vs. 7%) post-TEER (all p < 0.001). There was a significant increase in mean mitral valve gradients post-TEER (2.2 [±1.0] mmHg vs. 4.3 [±1.3] mmHg, p < ​0.001).
TEER can be an effective therapeutic option for improving LVOT obstruction, MR severity, and NYHA functional class in patients with HCM."

One of the advantages of the proposed LVAD is in cases where end-stage left ventricular failure is accompanied by mitral valve regurgitation and pulmonary hypertension. Another advantage is minimally invasive implantation with minimal thoracic trauma, without disrupting the breathing process, which shortens the length of hospital stay. The best drive system for converting the rotary motion of the servo motor into reciprocating motion of the piston of the suction-discharge device was chosen. Two types of drive were considered, namely a yoke mechanism and a crank mechanism that were evaluated in terms of energy efficiency of the entire device. One of the most important conclusions is that both mechanisms have comparable operating parameters for balloon inflation and similar electrical energy consumption which amounts to comparable operating times for these mechanisms. However, the energy consumption of the yoke mechanism is slightly higher. At the same time the pressure in the left ventricle and aorta is slightly lower in comparison with a yoke mechanism. Furthermore, the results of the study also showed that the balloon pressures were significantly higher with crank drive, which may cause the balloons to wear out more quickly. The mass flow rates generated by both drives are similar with a slight advantage for the yoke mechanism. Finally, typical aortic, atrial and left ventricular pressure plots during the cardiac cycle are also shown."

While her preoperative transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) did not reveal a discrete mass, it showed a mean mitral gradient of 7 mmHg; intraoperative transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) identified a 2 cm × 1.2 cm thrombus on the bioprosthetic MV. Given these findings, the surgical team decided to replace the mitral valve concurrently with LVAD implantation. Although this approach is not routine, the goal was to improve her quality of life and reduce postoperative complications. Post-procedure TEE showed an improved MV mean gradient of 3 mmHg with no evidence of paravalvular leak. The patient was subsequently discharged home in stable condition without any thromboembolic events. This case highlights the challenges of managing complex valvular pathology in patients undergoing LVAD placement."

The mechanisms underlying SMR are multifactorial. While guideline-directed medical therapy and cardiac resynchronisation therapy remain the cornerstone of HFrEF management, many patients with significant SMR continue to experience significant symptoms and adverse outcomes. Managing SMR within the context of HF necessitates a multifaceted approach. Transcatheter edge-to-edge repair (TEER) has emerged as a transformative intervention, demonstrating improvements in survival, functional capacity, and HF-related hospitalisations in clinical trials and real-world registries in selected patients. This review provides a comprehensive overview of the evidence supporting TEER, focusing on procedural and follow-up outcomes, and its role in reshaping the therapeutic approach for HF patients with SMR. Additionally, we highlight the critical role of patient selection and identify predictors of poor outcomes as key determinants of TEER success."

Current prognostic assessment of AR does not include the magnitude of mitral regurgitation (MR). Cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) can integrate volumetric data to obtain a novel combined parameter, total regurgitant fraction (TRF), which could have the potential ability to measure the combined effects of AR and MR on left ventricle (LV) overload. The aim of our study was to explore the usefulness of TRF in predicting the future need of aortic valve surgery in patients with CAMR.
Patients with CAMR and prior CMR studies were retrospectively recruited. A total of 45 patients were included, of whom 10 (22%) developed surgery indications. At the median follow-up time point (3.2 years), survival without surgery indication was 95% in the group with TRF < 40% compared to 90% in the group with aortic regurgitant fraction (ARF) < 29%. In contrast, 67% of patients with TRF ≥ 40% developed surgery indications after 3.2 years compared to 55% of patients with ARF ≥ 29%. In the multivariate analysis, the model including binary TRF had the highest hazard ratio of 13.846 (2.822 to 67.939, P = 0.001).
TRF is a promising CMR parameter that could improve the prediction of the need for surgery in patients with CAMR. Further studies with larger populations should be performed to confirm these findings."

None.
UFT completion was achieved in 209 patients (80.1%). 159 (60.9%) patients were extubated in the operating room after surgery. There were 13 reintubations, 12 for the need of a reoperation, and one due to respiratory insufficiency. No patients died within 30 days, and 97% of the cohort was still alive at follow-up. Successful patients had lower postoperative troponin, creatinine, pleural/mediastinal/pericardial drain output, fewer reoperations (1.5% v 19.2%) and a shorter hospital length of stay (5 days v 6 days).
The UFT protocol including stepdown from ICU within 6 hours after surgery proved feasible and safe to implement in a carefully selected cardiac surgery population and enabled efficient ICU bed turnover without compromising clinical outcomes. This approach may support the broader implementation of fast-track strategies."

However, the long-term prognostic impact of MVHD in this population remains poorly characterized. The aim of this study was to evaluate the long-term clinical outcomes and echocardiographic evolution of MVHD in TAVR recipients.
A total of 1,918 consecutive patients with severe symptomatic aortic stenosis (AS) undergoing TAVR were included. MVHD was defined as the presence of moderate or greater mitral (MR) and/or tricuspid regurgitation (TR) prior to the procedure. Baseline, procedural, and follow-up data (median of 4.0 [2.8-5.2] years) were prospectively collected. Changes in MR and/or TR severity were assessed from baseline to the last available echocardiography RESULTS: A total of 450 (23.5%) patients had MVHD at baseline. The presence of MVHD was associated with an increased all-cause mortality (adjusted HR: 1.21, 95% CI: 1.04-1.40; p=0.011) and cardiovascular mortality (adjusted HR: 1.29, 95% CI: 1.04-1.61; p=0.018) at follow-up. After adjustment, only baseline moderate or greater TR remained independently associated with all-cause mortality (HR: 1.38; CI: 1.04-1.84; p=0.027). At discharge, MR improved in 181 patients (51.7%) with similar rates across MR mechanism (p = 0.582), while those with TR improved in 71 (40.5%). MVHD improvement was sustained over time, whereas the absence of recovery was associated with a higher risk of all-cause mortality and cardiovascular mortality up to 6 years.
Patients with MVHD exhibit worse long-term outcomes after TAVR. While TAVR provides sustained improvement of concomitant valvular lesions in about half of patients, lack of recovery at discharge, predicted poorer long-term survival, highlighting the need for comprehensive baseline assessment and close echocardiographic follow-up in this high-risk population."

To investigate the temporal trend in baseline characteristics and outcomes of patients with secondary MR who underwent transcatheter edge-to-edge repair of the mitral valve in the real world compared with those from the published landmark trials.
A comprehensive systematic literature search was conducted using MEDLINE, EMBASE, and CENTRAL databases, and the identified observational studies were divided into two five-year recruitment periods. The first period included 36 studies that enrolled patients between 2008 and 2012, and the second period included 25 studies that recruited patients between 2013 and 2017-2018. Pooled variables of each five-year recruitment period were compared with those of the landmark trials. A random-effects model was used for statistical comparisons. RStudio and RevMan software were used for the analysis.
Overall, there were no major variations in the findings between the first and the second five-year recruitment periods. EVEREST program vs observational studies: Patients in the EVEREST program were more likely to have non-ischemic MR etiology [odds ratio (OR) = 3.59, 95% confidence interval (CI): 2.92-4.42] and atrial fibrillation (OR = 1.71, 95%CI: 1.42-2.06).

COAPT trial vs observational studies: COAPT patients were more likely to have prior myocardial infarction (OR = 1.62, 95%CI: 1.27-2.06) and renal insufficiency (OR = 2.66, 95%CI: 2.05-3.45). They were more likely to receive beta-blockers (OR = 2.54, 95%CI: 1.68-3.85) and an implanted cardiac device (OR = 2.20, 95%CI: 1.71-2.84). There was no difference in procedure success or mortality. MITRA-FR trial vs observational studies: MITRA-FR patients were less likely to have atrial fibrillation (OR = 0.49, 95%CI: 0.34-0.69) and renal insufficiency (OR = 0.18, 95%CI: 0.11-0.28) but more likely to have a history of myocardial infarction (OR = 1.48, 95%CI: 1.06-2.05) and to receive diuretics (OR = 19.81, 95%CI: 2.75-142.48) and implantable cardiac devices (OR = 1.69, 95%CI: 1.21-2.37).

There was no difference in terms of MR grade or mortality at 12-month follow-up.
Patients in the landmark studies may have favourable or unfavourable characteristics when compared to those in the observational studies, but this did not translate into different outcomes over time."

The role of concomitant tricuspid annuloplasty (TA) during mitral valve repair (MVr) remains controversial. To address this, we performed a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized and observational studies published up to November 2024, comparing isolated MVr versus MVr with concomitant TA in patients with DMR (CRD42024627505). Reconstructed Kaplan-Meier time-to-event data were analyzed using Cox frailty models to evaluate survival, TR progression, and permanent pacemaker (PPM) implantation. Sensitivity analyses included randomized or propensity-matched cohorts. A total of five studies, including 3,123 patients, were analyzed. Early (1-year) and long-term (up to 15 years) survival were comparable between isolated MVr and concomitant TA (97.3% vs. 96.9%, HR: 1.25, 95% CI: 0.76-2.08, p=0.381 and 72.2% vs 79.7%, HR: 1.28, 95% CI: 0.96-1.72, p=0.092, respectively). Concomitant TA significantly reduced the risk of ≥moderate TR progression (HR: 0.34, 95% CI: 0.17-0.70, p=0.003). However, PPM implantation was higher with TA during the perioperative period (7.4% vs 1.1%, HR 5.76, 95% CI 3.13-10.59) and remained elevated at 2 years. Sensitivity analyses confirmed these findings. In conclusion, in patients undergoing MVr for DMR, concomitant TA effectively prevents TR progression without compromising survival but is associated with increased PPM implantation. These results support a selective, guideline-directed approach to TA based on patient- and disease-specific risk factors."

This report describes a seven-year-old male Dutch rabbit (Oryctolagus cuniculus) diagnosed with congestive heart failure caused by both mitral and tricuspid regurgitation. Clinical signs included coarse lung crackles, mild tachycardia, and muffled heart sounds. Blood analysis showed moderate leukocytosis with neutrophilia and monocytosis. Echocardiography revealed enlargement of the left atrium, significant valvular regurgitation, and small fluid accumulations in the pleural and pericardial cavities. Treatment with furosemide and enalapril provided brief improvement over 2 weeks before the rabbit's death. The case highlights valvular regurgitation as a frequent cause of heart failure in aging rabbits and emphasizes the value of early detection and timely therapy in improving outcomes and extending quality of life in affected animals."

We aimed to analyze how age, diagnosis, autograft support, and Konno-incision impact outcome.
Patients (0-18 years) undergoing primary/secondary Ross/Ross-Konno from August 1993 to November 2023 were included. Mortality, autograft replacement rate, and greater than mild autograft regurgitation were analyzed in the full cohort and subgroups (age, diagnosis, primary/secondary Ross, Ross/Ross-Konno, autograft support) using time-to-event methods. Propensity-score matching was performed to adjust for differences in baseline characteristics of patients undergoing supported/nonsupported Ross procedures.
In total, 196 patients underwent Ross/Ross-Konno procedures (N = 117/79; 60/40%) with median age/weight of 9.4 years [interquartile range, 3.4-14.1 years]/31.7 kg [12.9-57 kg] and median follow-up of 8.8 years [1.6-14.8 years]. Twenty-year freedom from death, autograft replacement rate, and rate of greater than mild autograft regurgitation was 88.7% (95% confidence interval, 79.8%-93.8%), 13.2% (7.1%-24.7%), and 17.7% (11.3%-27.8%), respectively. Lowest 20-year freedom from death was observed among neonates/infants 47.6% (7.5%-80.8%)/58.9% (34.5%-76.8%) compared with older patients (97.6%; 90.6%-99.4%, P < .001). In total, 83.3% of all deceased neonates/infants had associated mitral valve disease. Patients with isolated aortic valve stenosis and/or Konno-incision were at greater mortality risk (P = .02). 20-year autograft replacement rate was highest among adolescents (12-18 years): 30.7% (15.5-60.9), without statistical significance (P = .08), and greater in secondary Ross: 23.8% (11.4-49.7, P = .03). Matched pairs (supported vs nonsupported Ross, n = 30 each) did not show differences in primary outcomes.
The Ross procedure in pediatric patients demonstrated good long-term outcomes. Mortality risk is greater in neonates/infants and patients with isolated aortic stenosis. Adolescent patients/patients undergoing secondary Ross procedures were associated with greater autograft replacement rates."

This study compares the early outcomes of these 2 approaches to performing SM in patients with obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (oHCM).
We analyzed the outcomes of 200 consecutive patients undergoing transapical beating-heart myectomy and 200 patients receiving transaortic on-pump myectomy. The primary outcome was procedural success, defined as a peak left ventricular outflow tract (LVOT) gradient <30 mm Hg on predismissal echocardiography. Secondary outcomes included transfusion and postoperative atrial fibrillation rates and intensive care unit (ICU) length of stay.
Both techniques significantly reduced LVOT gradient (median reduction: transapical, 102 mm Hg to 15 mm Hg; transaortic, 88 mm Hg to 12 mm Hg; P < .001 for both). Transapical beating-heart myectomy was associated with a shorter ICU stay (median, 24.0 hours vs 26.0 hours; P < .001), a lower atrial fibrillation rate (9.5% vs 30.0%; P < .001), and fewer transfusions (8.0% vs 22.0%; P < .001) but resulted in a higher incidence of new-onset left bundle branch block (63.8% vs 37.0%; P < .001) and longer postoperative hospital stay (median, 11 days vs 5 days; P < .001), owing mainly to institutional protocols. Overall 30-day mortality was 0.5% (n = 1) in the transapical beating-heart myectomy group and 1.0% (n = 2) in the transaortic on-pump myectomy group (P = .562).
Transapical beating-heart SM provides comparable hemodynamic outcomes to transaortic on-pump myectomy with advantages in ICU recovery time, transfusion rates, and postoperative atrial fibrillation. It may be a viable, less invasive alternative for selected oHCM patients. Further studies, including randomized trials, are needed to assess long-term outcomes."

In this report, we describe a case of K. aerogenes IE in an elderly male patient who initially presented to urgent care with a UTI. He had been diagnosed and prescribed a course of oral antibiotics; however, the treatment failed due to antimicrobial resistance. This led to the development of bacteremia and sepsis requiring hospital admission. He later developed endocarditis as confirmed by echocardiography, which was complicated by mitral regurgitation, respiratory failure, and multiple embolic central nervous system (CNS) strokes. He was treated with intravenous (IV) antibiotics and assessed by cardiac surgery, though operative management was deferred until his overall condition improved. This case underscores the importance of early recognition and timely management of IE in patients with persistent Klebsiella bacteremia unresponsive to initial therapy, emphasizing a multidisciplinary approach to achieve optimal outcomes, especially when dealing with such rare causative organisms."
PubMed,mitral regurgitation,Iatrogenic atrial septal defect following transcatheter edge-to-edge mitral valve repair: A systematic review and meta-analysis.,Deng Lei; Chunlan Zhou; Junqing Zhou; Chen Luo; Baoshi Zheng,10.1097/MD.0000000000046486,2025-12-26,Medicine,"Transcatheter edge-to-edge mitral valve repair (TEER) requires transseptal access of the left atrium, which usually causes an iatrogenic atrial septal defect (iASD). It is controversial that whether these patients with iASD persistence will progress to a bad prognostic state. So it's worthwhile to evaluate whether the procedure of TEER induced iASD leads to development of a relevant interatrial shunt. This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to identify predictors of iASD persistence in patients with mitral regurgitation (MR) undergoing TEER and assess its effect on in-hospital outcomes and mortality.
In this systematic review and meta-analysis, we conducted a literature search in various databases. Our investigation summarized data from contemporary studies on the incidence of iASD following TEER for MR and its association with clinical outcomes.
10 studies were analyzed, possible predictors of risk factors for the persistence of iASD after TEER seemed to be atrial fibrillation before surgery (OR 1.40; P = .04), residual MR > 2+(OR 2.36; P = .001), residual tricuspid regurgitation > mild(OR 1.52; P = .01), and prolonged fluoroscopic time(MD [in minutes] 5.36; P = .007). Patients with iASD persistence after TEER seemed to have a greater risk to suffer from right heart overload reflecting from the enlarged right ventricle end-diastolic dimension (RVEDD) (MD 3.27; P < .00001) and the enlarged diameter of the right atrium (MD 4.41; P < .00001). Patients with iASD persistence after TEER had a greater risk of heart failure rehospitalization (OR 2.71; P = .003).
This systematic review and meta-analysis identified several related predictors of iASD persistence, possibly leading to right heart volume overload and a higher risk of heart failure rehospitalization. In order to generalize our findings, larger clinical studies in independent patient cohorts are necessary. What's more, there is a need to perform a careful decision for interventional closure of an iASD after TEER."

Methods: This prospective single-center cohort study included 101 patients with chronic heart failure (mean age 62 ± 15.5 years; 70.3% male) with paroxysmal or persistent drug-refractory atrial fibrillation who underwent atrioventricular node ablation and CRT-D implantation. All patients received optimal medical therapy before and after undergoing the procedure. Predictors of 5-year mortality were assessed using exploratory machine-learning methods, including random forest and Shapley additive explanations. Results: During 5-year follow-up, 13 cardiovascular deaths were recorded. Five key predictors of mortality were identified: left ventricular ejection fraction, 6 min walk distance, mean pulmonary artery pressure, systolic relaxation coefficient, and degree of mitral regurgitation. The exploratory predictive model showed high accuracy (92%) in terms of classifying the outcomes. Conclusions: Atrioventricular node ablation (AVNA) combined with CRT-D was associated with the observed long-term clinical outcomes observed in patients with drug-refractory tachysystolic atrial fibrillation. The exploratory machine learning analysis identified key mortality-associated factors, which may support future efforts in personalized risk stratification and hypothesis generation. The combination of AVNA and CRT-D was associated with the observed long-term outcomes in this real-world cohort."

With a focus on the prevalent psychological complications following the onset of this condition, this study aimed to explore the correlation between antenatal depression and Corona disease anxiety, personality traits, and postpartum depression during the COVID-19 pandemic.                                                           Materials and Methods:                     This cross-sectional descriptive-analytical study investigated women receiving care at health centers affiliated with Kerman University of Medical Sciences during the last month of their pregnancy and the postpartum period in 2022. Following the acquisition of informed consent, participants were assessed using various measures, including demographic and obstetric information, the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale, the Corona Disease Anxiety Scale (CDAS), and the NEO Personality Inventory-Revised during their third trimester of pregnancy. The same group of participants completed the Edinburgh Depression Scale and the Corona Disease Anxiety Scale (CDAS) 4-6 weeks after childbirth.                                                           Results and Discussion:                     There was a significant correlation between family income, unwanted pregnancy as perceived by both the mother and father, and antenatal depression. Additionally, marital satisfaction played a significant role in postpartum depression. Furthermore, antenatal depression was significantly associated with neuroticism, agreeableness, and physical symptoms related to Corona disease anxiety. Personality traits, with the exception of extroversion and conscientiousness, and various domains of Corona disease anxiety, excluding psychological symptoms, were also significantly associated with postpartum depression.                                                           Conclusion:                     During pandemics or epidemics, such as the COVID-19 outbreak, experiencing mental distress during pregnancy can contribute to mental health issues during the postpartum period. This risk is particularly true in individuals with unique personality traits, emphasizing the need for increased focus on mental health within prenatal care during these crises."

Method:                     This cross-sectional study was conducted in Kerman, Iran. Data were collected from patients who visited Afzalipour Hospital in Kerman more than twice during the COVID-19 epidemic from the end of February 2020 to March 21, 2021. We conducted two key analyses: 1. Mixed effect logistic regression was used to check the relationship between the variables and COVID-19 severity. 2. Mixed effect linear regression was used to check the relationship between the variables and the length of stay in the hospital.                                                           Results:                     The findings indicated that the most important risk factors for the severity of COVID-19 were heart diseases (OR=1.67,95%CI:1.20-2.30), increasing age (OR=2.23 for age&gt;54, 95%CI:1.70- 2.90), male gender (OR=1.47,95%CI:1.10-1.96), respiratory diseases other than asthma, and frequency of admission (OR=1.60,95%CI:1.20-2.15). All patients who underwent readmission experienced a shorter duration of hospitalization during their subsequent admission (OR=0.94,95%CI:0.91,0.96) and had a higher mortality rate (30% within 14 days, 26.6% between 14-90 days). Patients readmitted at intervals of 14-90 days and greater than 90 days exhibited lower disease severity compared to those readmitted within the 0-14 day period.                                                           Conclusion:                     Examining readmissions, the severity of COVID-19, and the length of hospital stay in affected patients are important factors for planning and allocating resources for COVID-19 management and treatment. These factors can help policymakers develop effective clinical guidelines for hospitalization or outpatient treatment of COVID-19 patients and contribute to reducing the burden of disease in the community."

Kinovea, as an accessible motion-analysis software, provides both visual and quantitative feedback. However, its application in supporting technique development among beginner athletes remains insufficiently explored. Aim: This study aims to describe the use of Kinovea in biomechanics training and examine its contribution to the awareness of kinematic characteristics and movement techniques among beginner athletes. Methods: A descriptive qualitative design involved 72 beginner athletes aged 18–25 years selected through purposive sampling. Data were collected over 16 weeks through interviews, field observations, and motion video recordings analyzed using Kinovea. Kinematic data focused on joint angles, stride behavior, and movement phases during walking, running, and the flight phase. Qualitative data were analyzed using content analysis with NVivo 12, while kinematic results were interpreted descriptively to identify performance patterns and areas for technical refinement. Result: Kinematic analysis showed coordinated joint-angle patterns across all phases. Walking analysis identified arm swing angles of 50.9°–58.8° and leg separation angles of 64.3°–67.2°, indicating a stable gait rhythm. The running analysis revealed knee angles of 68.8°–69.8° and elbow angles of 87.6°–89.1°, indicating efficient propulsive mechanics. The flight phase demonstrated knee angles of 81.2°–87.8° and elbow angles of 80.4°–88.3°, suggesting effective momentum use and postural stability. These measurements supported stride-efficiency assessment and technique evaluation. Qualitative findings revealed that Kinovea enabled athletes to interpret movement phases and identify technical inefficiencies through slow-motion and frame-by-frame visualization. Conclusion: Kinovea supports basic motion analysis by providing clear kinematic information and helping beginner athletes observe and refine their movement techniques. The findings also offer practical value for coaches by enabling more precise identification of inefficient patterns and guiding targeted corrections during early-stage training."

Ye; Yiyi Jiang; Hanmin Wang; Dan Wang,10.3390/diagnostics16010163,2026-01-04,Diagnostics,"Background/Objectives: Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is an autosomal dominant disorder driven by mutations in the NF1 gene, whose pathogenesis centers on the loss of neurofibromin function and subsequent hyperactivation of the RAS/MAPK pathway. Notably, to the best of our knowledge and following a systematic literature search conducted by our research team, no cases of NF1 complicated by severe cardiac structural abnormalities that ultimately lead to cerebral infarction have been reported to date. Thus, it is of paramount importance to avoid missed diagnosis by performing comprehensive cardiac-related examinations in patients with NF1. Case Presentation: A 20-year-old male patient diagnosed with NF1 presented with right-sided limb weakness and was initially identified with cerebral infarction. To clarify the underlying etiology, a comprehensive clinical evaluation was performed, including cardiac imaging assessments (to characterize cardiac structural changes) and whole-exome sequencing (to identify the presence of procoagulant gene mutations). Comprehensive evaluation revealed a spectrum of cardiac structural abnormalities in the patient: aortic valve prolapse with severe regurgitation, non-infective vegetations on the aortic valve leaflets, mild-to-moderate mitral regurgitation, left ventricular hypertrophy and dilation, and left atrial dilation. Whole-exome sequencing detected exclusively a pathogenic variant in the NF1 gene, with no other pathogenic/likely pathogenic variants or thrombophilia-associated polymorphisms being found. Laboratory investigations ruled out infectious etiologies, supporting the notion that NF1-mediated cardiac structural and developmental anomalies are the primary driver of cardiac vegetation formation, given the absence of other identified contributing factors; embolization of one such vegetation ultimately led to both splenic and cerebral infarction. Conclusions: This case emphasizes the necessity of implementing early and proactive cardiac evaluations in patients with NF1. Additionally, for NF1 individuals—particularly those presenting with suggestive vascular or cardiac symptoms—a comprehensive multifactorial assessment of thrombotic risk is critical. Collectively, maintaining clinical vigilance for cardiac abnormalities in NF1 patients and avoiding diagnostic oversight is essential to reduce life-threatening risks."

We present a case where an apico-aortic conduit offered a safer alternative. Case presentation A 20-year-old woman with Type IIIc GD (homozygous D409H mutation) presented with New York Heart Association (NYHA) Class III dyspnoea, palpitations, and syncope. She had hypertension, hypothyroidism, and a sibling deceased from the same condition. On enzyme replacement therapy for 6 years, she was found to have severe calcification of the aortic valve, root, and ascending aorta, stenosis of arch vessels, grade II aortic regurgitation, mild mitral stenosis, and proximal left anterior descending artery stenosis. Intraoperatively, extensive calcification precluded root and arch reconstruction. A left ventricular apex–descending thoracic aorta conduit with a mechanical valve was constructed, combined with coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) to the left anterior descending artery and an innominate artery bypass. Recovery was uneventful, and follow-up at 13 months showed the patient in NYHA Class I with patent conduit and grafts. Conclusions An apico–aortic conduit can provide a safe and effective solution in GD with porcelain aorta, avoiding high-risk aortic manipulation. To our knowledge, this is the first reported use of a valved conduit in Gaucher-related calcification, broadening surgical options for this complex patient group."
OpenAlex,mitral regurgitation,The Incremental Role of Stress Echocardiography in Valvular Heart Disease: A Narrative Review,Adriana Correra; Alfredo Mauriello; Carmen Del Giudice; Celeste Fonderico; Matilde Di Peppo; Vincenzo Russo; Antonello D’Andrea; Giovanni Esposito; Natale Daniele Brunetti,10.3390/diagnostics16010148,2026-01-02,Diagnostics,"Background/Objectives: The diagnosis and risk stratification of valvular heart disease have traditionally relied on resting echocardiography. However, in a significant portion of patients, resting findings do not fully reflect the hemodynamic severity of the condition, particularly in asymptomatic individuals with severe valvular disease or those with nonspecific symptoms. In this context, stress echocardiography emerges as a vital imaging modality, providing a dynamic assessment of valvular, ventricular, and pulmonary function under hemodynamic load (from physical exercise or pharmacological agents). Methods: We conducted a comprehensive synthesis and critical evaluation of the current landscape, recent advancements, and future directions regarding the application of stress echocardiography in valvular heart disease. Results: This comprehensive review explores the incremental role of stress echocardiography in valvular heart disease, analyzing the evolution of its clinical applications, from low-flow, low-gradient aortic stenosis to the evaluation of contractile reserve and exercise-induced pulmonary hypertension in mitral stenosis and regurgitation. We discuss standardized protocols, key parameters to monitor, and the diagnostic and prognostic outcomes from major clinical trials and current guidelines. Attention is given to stress echocardiography’s ability to unmask the true severity of the disease and to identify patients at high risk for adverse events, thereby guiding crucial clinical decisions, such as the optimal timing for surgical or transcatheter intervention. Conclusions: The review evaluates the limitations of modality and outlines future research directions, including its integration with new technologies like 3D echocardiography and speckle tracking techniques, to further optimize the role of stress echocardiography as a decision-making tool in the multidisciplinary management of valvular heart disease."

This leads to myocardial ischemia via a coronary steal phenomenon. While typically fatal in infancy, a small proportion of patients survive into adulthood due to the development of extensive collateral circulation from the right coronary artery (RCA). Prompt surgical correction is essential to prevent fatal outcomes. Case Presentation: We report the case of a 36-year-old male who presented with a one-year history of exertional angina (CCS Class II) and dyspnea (NYHA Class III). Investigations revealed ALCAPA with a dilated, super-dominant RCA, and associated partial anomalous pulmonary venous return (PAPVR) and moderate mitral regurgitation. Surgical correction was performed using the Takeuchi procedure with simultaneous mitral valve repair and PAPVR correction. The patient had an uneventful recovery. Results: The patient demonstrated marked postoperative improvement and was discharged in stable condition on postoperative day four. At two-year follow-up, cardiac CT confirmed a patent intrapulmonary baffle with no ischemic changes or mitral regurgitation. The patient remained asymptomatic and resumed normal daily activities, indicating excellent long-term functional recovery. Conclusion: This case highlights the importance of early recognition and individualized surgical planning in adult ALCAPA, particularly when associated with structural defects such as mitral regurgitation and PAPVR. The Takeuchi procedure, when appropriately applied, offers sustainable long-term outcomes and should be considered a viable option in anatomically challenging adult presentations."

Thrombocytosis may increase thromboembolic risk, and severe functional mitral regurgitation (MR) from left-ventricular dilation further worsens clinical status. A 38-year-old woman, three months postpartum, presented with worsening dyspnea, orthopnea, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, and leg edema. She had hypertension and dyslipidemia. Examination revealed fluid overload and elevated jugular venous pressure. ECG showed sinus tachycardia with ST-T changes, and chest X-ray demonstrated cardiomegaly with pulmonary congestion. Laboratory testing identified thrombocytosis (platelets 627,000/µL). Echocardiography revealed severe LV dilation (LVEDD 63 mm), markedly reduced ejection fraction (21%), grade 3 diastolic dysfunction, severe functional MR, and spontaneous echo contrast. This case illustrates the interaction of PPCM, reactive thrombocytosis, and severe MR, emphasizing the need for thorough cardiac–hematologic evaluation and multidisciplinary management to optimize outcomes."

Emphasis is placed on the involvement of specific coronary vessels and the occurrence of multivessel disease across different types of valvular lesions. Methodology: A total of 335 patients, aged between 18 and 60 years, who had undergone coronary angiography prior to valve surgery, were retrospectively analyzed. CAD was defined as ≥50% stenosis in at least one major coronary artery. The prevalence and distribution of CAD were assessed in relation to various valvular pathologies, including aortic stenosis (AS), aortic regurgitation (AR), mitral stenosis (MS), and mitral regurgitation (MR). Results: The highest prevalence of CAD was found in patients with MR (85.7%) and AS (56.3%), with the left anterior descending (LAD) artery being the most frequently involved vessel. In contrast, isolated left circumflex (LCx) artery involvement was exclusively observed in patients with AR (100%). Three-vessel CAD (3VCAD) was most common among MR patients (85.7%). Combined LAD + LCx involvement was seen in 33.3% of cases, while MS showed a comparatively lower CAD prevalence. Left main (LM) artery involvement, although rare, was most frequently found in MS patients (16.7%). Conclusion: This study highlights a substantial burden and distinct angiographic patterns of CAD among VHD patients undergoing preoperative evaluation. Given the high prevalence, particularly among those with AS and MR, routine coronary angiography should be considered essential in pre-surgical assessment. Further large-scale studies are warranted to strengthen diagnostic and management protocols in local populations."
OpenAlex,mitral regurgitation,O04 Oral antimicrobial therapy for infective endocarditis: real-world experience from a teaching hospital in Scotland,Nikolas Rae; Emma Duncan; Neil Stevenson,10.1093/jacamr/dlaf239.004,2026-01-01,JAC-Antimicrobial Resistance,"Abstract Background Treatment of infective endocarditis with oral antibiotics is not common in the UK despite an evidence base supporting this approach in appropriate patients. From late 2022 onwards the Infection Unit in Ninewells Hospital, Dundee, has adopted the use of oral antibiotic therapy in the treatment of selected patients with infective endocarditis. Objectives We aimed to review the clinical efficacy and outcomes in patients treated with oral antimicrobial therapy for infective endocarditis in our unit. Methods We retrospectively reviewed patients treated with oral antimicrobial therapy for infective endocarditis. Patient records were reviewed for basic demographics, endocarditis characteristics and treatment (both IV and oral). Adverse outcomes (defined as all-cause mortality, unplanned cardiac surgery, recurrence of bacteraemia or embolic events) were assessed for within 6 months of completion of therapy. Results In total 29 patients were identified, of which 21 (72%) were male. Mean age was 67 (range 36-94). Of the patients included, 20 were classed as ‘definite’ endocarditis by Duke-ISCVID 2023 criteria, with the remaining 9 meeting ‘possible’ Duke-ISCVID 2023 criteria. Structures involved included aortic valve (15 patients), mitral valve (11 patients), ICED (2 patients) and tricuspid valve (1 patient), with 9 of the 27 valve infections occurring in prosthetic valves. In total, 15 of 29 (52%) patients had moderate to severe valvular regurgitation, 5 (17%) patients had a vegetation of 10mm or greater and 4 patients underwent surgery during the course of their illness. With regards to microbiology, our cohort included 14 patients with Streptococcus spp., 12 patients with Staphylococcus aureus (all MSSA), 2 patients with Enterococcus faecalis and one patient with coagulase-negative Staphylococcus spp. Mean peak C-reactive protein was 163 mg/L (range 17–400) with mean C-reactive protein at transition to oral therapy of 21 mg/L (range 3–98). In total, 22 patients (76%) met the criteria used in the POET trial. Mean duration of IV therapy was 15 days (range 6–30). Mean duration of oral therapy was 26 days (range 14–42). Mean total duration of therapy was 41 days (range 28-56). The final oral antibiotic regimens used included linezolid in 19 patients (65%), amoxicillin in 5 patients (17%), co-trimoxazole in 3 patients (10%) and amoxicillin with rifampicin in 2 patients (7%). Change of oral agent due to adverse drug effects was required in 6 patients, all occurring in patients prescribed linezolid. Adverse outcomes occurred in three patients (embolic events in two patients and one death 4 months after treatment completion due to cardiac failure), with 5 patients yet to complete the full 6 month follow-up period. Conclusions Oral antimicrobial therapy can be used in appropriate patients with infective endocarditis, with good efficacy and relatively low rates of adverse effects despite significant complexity of illness. Alteration of oral regimen was frequently required when linezolid was used."

Methodology: A descriptive, observational study was conducted at the Pediatric Cardiology Department of Faisalabad Institute of Cardiology (FIC), Pakistan, from February to July 2023. Patients aged ≥10 years with unoperated VSD were enrolled, and the diagnosis was confirmed via transthoracic echocardiography. The clinical presentation, type of VSD, associated cardiac conditions, and complications were analyzed. Results: A total of 128 patients were included, with 60.9% aged 10–18 years and 39.1% aged over 18 years. Males accounted for 55.5% of the cohort. Most patients (89.1%) presented at the outpatient department. Perimembranous VSD was the most common type (58.6%), followed by sub-arterial (23.4%), inlet (7.8%), and muscular (7.8%) defects. Pulmonary hypertension (21.9%), aortic valve prolapse (12.5%), and mitral regurgitation (10.2%) were the most frequent associations. Eisenmenger syndrome (31.3%) was the most common complication. Older patients were significantly more likely to have pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) (p = 0.0006) and Eisenmenger syndrome (p = 0.0002). A significant association was found between VSD type and aortic valve prolapse (p &lt; 0.0001). A p-value &lt; 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Conclusion: Perimembranous VSD is the most prevalent defect in adolescents and adults. Many patients experience worsening functional status, with Eisenmenger syndrome emerging as a major complication. Early screening and timely intervention are crucial in preventing disease progression. Serial echocardiography should be incorporated into follow-up care for all unrepaired VSD patients. Establishing specialized adult congenital heart disease (ACHD) clinics in tertiary hospitals is essential for long-term management and improving patient outcomes."

Literature focusing on pediatric population especially in Nepal is scarce. We aimed to describe echocardiographic characteristics and complications in children newly diagnosed with RHD and to assess associations with age and sex.Methods: We conducted a retrospective review of echocardiographic records at Shahid Gangalal National Heart Center from January to December 2018 in children aged ≤15 years with RHD. Data on valve involvement, lesion severity, and complications were extracted and analyzed.Results: Among 9,482 echocardiograms, 133 new pediatric RHD cases (1.4%) were identified. Age ranged from 5–15 years (mean 11.4 ± 2.5 years); 78.9% were aged ≥10 years. Mitral valve involvement occurred in 99.2% of cases; aortic valve was involved in nearly all those with mitral lesions. Combined mitral regurgitation (MR) and aortic regurgitation (AR) was the most common pattern (60.1%), followed by isolated MR (26.3%). Isolated MR (with or without mitral stenosis) was more frequent among females, while AR (with or without MR) occurred more often in males. Severe MR was the predominant severe lesion (57.9%), mainly in older children. Complications included severe pulmonary hypertension (11.3%), pericardial effusion (6%), and infective endocarditis (5.3%).Conclusion: Newly diagnosed pediatric RHD in Nepal nearly always involves the mitral valve, with combined MR and AR being most prevalent. Severity increases with age, and lesion patterns differ by sex. These findings underscore the importance of early detection and tailored management strategies."
OpenAlex,mitral regurgitation,Culture Negative Infective Endocarditis Presenting as Renal Infarction in a Low risk Young Woman: A Case Report,Sandip Pandey; Anu Timalsina; Nawaraj Ranabhat; Sagar Pokhrel; Vivek Chhetri,10.31729/jnma.v64i293.9300,2025-12-31,Journal of Nepal Medical Association,"Culture-negative infective endocarditis is difficult to diagnose because it often presents with vague symptoms, delaying recognition and worsening outcomes. Renal infarction is rare but may be the first clue. A previously healthy 32-yearold woman had intermittent fever for six weeks and sudden right-sided flank pain for two days. Examination revealed a holosystolic murmur and right costovertebral angle tenderness. Investigations showed raised inflammatory markers and a positive rheumatoid factor, while repeated blood cultures were negative. Echocardiography showed severe mitral regurgitation without visiblevegetations, and computed tomography angiography confirmed right renal infarction. Using modified Duke criteria, the diagnosis was made and empiric intravenous vancomycin and ceftriaxone were started. Despite intensive care and aggressive therapy, she deteriorated and died from refractory heart failure due to severe valvular dysfunction. This case shows the disease can be insidious even in low-risk patients, stressing early suspicion, multidisciplinary care, and timely surgical evaluation when appropriate."

OpenAlex,mitral regurgitation,Reversible Hypocalcaemic Dilated Cardiomyopathy causing Decompensated Heart Failure- A Case Report,Shlok Bhardwaj; Bhupinder Singh,10.5195/ijms.2025.4003,2025-12-31,International Journal of Medical Students,"Background: Hypocalcaemia induced heart failure, commonly seen in children due to Vitamin D deficiency, is a rare clinical syndrome in adults. These patients are refractory to routine treatment, but the timely diagnosis of the underlying etiology and correction of calcium promptly restores myocardial function. The Case A 55-year-old non-alcoholic and non-smoker female, previously diagnosed as a case of dilated cardiomyopathy, presented with complaints of progressive dyspnoea on exertion from NYHA-II to NYHA-IV over a span of 1 week. At admission the patient was conscious, afebrile; having respiratory distress, peripheral oxygen saturation of 93% at room air, blood pressure of 92/56 mmHg equal in both arms, regular pulse rate of 100 beats per minute, audible left ventricular S3, mild peripheral edema, and bilateral basal crepitations. She was diagnosed to have decompensated heart failure. Chest X-Ray revealed cardiomegaly. Electrocardiogram showed sinus tachycardia (90 beats/minute), QRS axis of -20o, prolonged QTc of 574 milliseconds. Laboratory analysis at admission revealed minimally deranged liver and renal functions, and highly elevated BNP. Relevant biochemical parameters are shown in the given table. Transthoracic echocardiogram revealed dilated left chambers (left ventricle end-diastolic diameter: 61 mm, left ventricle end-systolic diameter: 52 mm), left ventricle (LV) severe global systolic dysfunction (LVEF=22%) due to diffuse hypokinesia, restrictive type of diastolic dysfunction with elevated filling pressure indexes (E/E’=19), mild functional mitral regurgitation, mild tricuspid regurgitation, moderate pulmonary hypertension (systolic pulmonary artery pressure of 50 mmHg). Normal coronary angiography ruled out underlying ischemia. Patient was initially started on furosemide as decongestive therapy. Subsequent investigations conducted due to prolonged QTc revealed severe hypocalcaemia (corrected calcium of 4.38 mg/dL), inappropriately normal PTH, and presence of basal ganglia calcification on CT head was highly suggestive of primary hypoparathyroidism. Parenteral treatment with Gluconic Calcium was started: 950 mg of calcium (1 ampoule) at 6 hours, followed by oral treatment- high dose of calcium (1g TDS) and alfacalcidol (0.25µg TDS) along with management of heart failure. The patient had progressive clinical improvement and was discharged in NYHA class II on Day 10. Patient’s serum calcium progressively improved during course of stay and was within normal limits at the time of discharge. Treatment at discharge included loop diuretic, ACE inhibitor, Calcium, alfacalcidol. Patient was followed up regularly; and NYHA class, renal functions, serum calcium level, and ECG were assessed. At follow up after 3 months, patients had significant improvement in LV function and normalised LV function after 6 months. Conclusion: Considering the rarity of hypocalcemia induced dilated cardiomyopathy in adults, this etiology must be suspected in a cardiac patient with ECG changes suggestive of hypocalcaemia (as in our case). Early calcium supplementation, usually along with vitamin D, reduces and even reverses ventricular hypertrophy and dilatation as well as conduction abnormalities, as it was in our case."
