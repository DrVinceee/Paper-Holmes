Despite negative blood cultures, multimodality imaging revealed a large posterior aortic root mass. 18F-FDG PET-CT demonstrated intense peripheral uptake with a central metabolic defect, and cardiac MRI confirmed an aortic root abscess containing a central signal void. Intraoperative exploration confirmed a sinus of Valsalva aneurysm complicated by the abscess. This case highlights the critical role of integrating echocardiography, PET-CT, and MRI to diagnose complex, culture-negative paravalvular complications and guide surgical management."

To address this, we developed S-RACE, a secure, cloud-based platform designed to systematically transform raw hospital data into high-quality, research-grade evidence. S-RACE features an end-to-end pipeline, starting with on-premises anonymisation for data privacy, followed by Natural Language Processing (NLP) to extract and standardise clinical information into the FHIR format. This curated data foundation is essential for building robust AI models. The platform's integrated ""Data Science Lab"" supports responsible AI development, incorporating explainability techniques and adhering to governance standards like ISO 42001 and the EU AI Act. Currently, S-RACE is populated with data from 31,276 patients, powering 19 research projects across fields including oncology, cardiology, and diabetes. We demonstrate its utility in kidney cancer and aortic stenosis, where models trained on S-RACE's automatically processed RWE showed performance comparable to those trained on manually curated data. S-RACE provides a scalable, governed environment for RWD curation, offering a trustworthy foundation to accelerate the clinical adoption of responsible AI."

Despite widespread use, optimal periprocedural anaesthetic management remains highly variable, and evidence-based guidance is lacking.
An interdisciplinary panel of Italian experts in anaesthesiology, cardiology, and cardiac surgery conducted a systematic review of the literature and used the RAND/UCLA Appropriateness Method to evaluate 1032 clinical scenarios across a range of risk profiles and comorbid conditions. Ratings were conducted over three rounds, including a moderated in-person meeting to refine and discuss appropriateness scores.
A minimally invasive approach, local anaesthesia alone, and conscious sedation were judged appropriate across most clinical scenarios. Invasive monitoring, such as placement of an additional arterial catheter or a central venous catheter, was recommended only in selected high-risk patients. Several approaches or interventions were consistently rated inappropriate across all evaluated scenarios, including nurse-administered anaesthesia, pulmonary artery catheterisation, and cardiac output monitoring using pulse wave analysis. Other approaches, such as general anaesthesia and deep sedation, were considered inappropriate in most cases but retained uncertainty in select clinical contexts. Several recommendations were rated as necessary to define a minimum standard of care.
This Italian consensus statement provides practical, expert-driven recommendations to standardise anaesthetic care for transfemoral TAVI. While many recommendations reached strong consensus, areas of uncertainty remain, underscoring the need for further clinical research. Patient-centred, individualised decision-making remains essential, guided by institutional experience and procedural complexity."

We evaluated short- and long-term mortality following TAVR in patients with active or prior cancer using a large single-center registry.
We conducted a retrospective cohort study of 1511 patients who underwent TAVR at a tertiary center between 2013 and 2022, categorized by cancer status: no cancer, past cancer, or active cancer (defined as diagnosis within 12 months, metastatic disease, or ongoing oncologic treatment). Mortality outcomes were assessed using Kaplan-Meier curves and Cox proportional hazards models, with multivariable adjustment for clinical risk factors.
Among 1511 patients, 1336 (88.4 %) had no cancer, 123 (8.1 %) had past cancer and 52 (3.5 %) had active cancer. Patients with active cancer had similar 30-day (HR 0.82; 95 % CI 0.11-6.01; p = 0.845) and 1-year mortality (HR 1.73; 95 % CI 0.80-3.72; p = 0.160) compared with those without cancer. At 3 years, active cancer was independently associated with increased mortality (HR 2.04; 95 % CI 1.24-3.34; p = 0.004), with the highest risk seen in gastrointestinal and hematologic malignancies. Patients with breast or prostate cancer had more favorable outcomes.
TAVR in patients with active cancer is associated with comparable short- and mid-term outcomes relative to those without patients, supporting its feasibility in selected individuals. Long-term mortality varies by cancer type, highlighting the need for multidisciplinary, individualized decision-making when evaluating procedural candidacy."

However, the long-term prognostic impact of MVHD in this population remains poorly characterized. The aim of this study was to evaluate the long-term clinical outcomes and echocardiographic evolution of MVHD in TAVR recipients.
A total of 1,918 consecutive patients with severe symptomatic aortic stenosis (AS) undergoing TAVR were included. MVHD was defined as the presence of moderate or greater mitral (MR) and/or tricuspid regurgitation (TR) prior to the procedure. Baseline, procedural, and follow-up data (median of 4.0 [2.8-5.2] years) were prospectively collected. Changes in MR and/or TR severity were assessed from baseline to the last available echocardiography RESULTS: A total of 450 (23.5%) patients had MVHD at baseline. The presence of MVHD was associated with an increased all-cause mortality (adjusted HR: 1.21, 95% CI: 1.04-1.40; p=0.011) and cardiovascular mortality (adjusted HR: 1.29, 95% CI: 1.04-1.61; p=0.018) at follow-up. After adjustment, only baseline moderate or greater TR remained independently associated with all-cause mortality (HR: 1.38; CI: 1.04-1.84; p=0.027). At discharge, MR improved in 181 patients (51.7%) with similar rates across MR mechanism (p = 0.582), while those with TR improved in 71 (40.5%). MVHD improvement was sustained over time, whereas the absence of recovery was associated with a higher risk of all-cause mortality and cardiovascular mortality up to 6 years.
Patients with MVHD exhibit worse long-term outcomes after TAVR. While TAVR provides sustained improvement of concomitant valvular lesions in about half of patients, lack of recovery at discharge, predicted poorer long-term survival, highlighting the need for comprehensive baseline assessment and close echocardiographic follow-up in this high-risk population."

The advent of artificial intelligence-enabled electrocardiograms (AI-ECG) and point-of-care cardiac-ultrasonography (POCCUS) offers promising new approaches for patient screening. We explored the feasibility and potential of integrating these innovative technologies into a practical SHD screening framework.
Outpatients undergoing ECG at the Mayo Clinic ECG laboratory between November 2023 and February 2024 were pragmatically offered POCCUS, performed by novice operators and reviewed by expert echocardiographers. AI-ECG and POCCUS findings were integrated to assess SHD, including reduced left ventricular systolic function (ejection-fraction<50%), aortic stenosis, and increased left ventricular wall thickness suggestive of cardiac amyloidosis or hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. Operators were blinded to patients' comorbidities and formal echocardiogram results.
Of 486 patients (median-age 64 years;49% women), 286 had available formal echocardiography, with 17.5% having SHD. AI-ECG had a 32% positive predictive value (PPV) and a 94% negative predictive value (NPV) to detect any SHD. Adding POCCUS increased the overall PPV to 64% with an NPV of 93%, with an increase in diagnostic accuracy from 67% to 88%. Notably, 89.5% (17/19) of the ""false positives"" by AI-ECG+POCCUS had less-than-moderate-SHD. Applying the AI-ECG+POCCUS screening workflow on the entire cohort resulted in a number-needed-to-screen of eight to identify one patient requiring formal echocardiography.
The integration of AI-ECG and POCCUS holds promise as a potentially effective screening method for SHD, facilitating improved patient selection for formal echocardiography."

Cardiovascular interventions,"Cardiac conduction disturbances remain the most frequent complication of transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR), but the clinical implications of new left bundle branch block (LBBB) after TAVR remain controversial. Here, we aim to assess the impact of new LBBB after TAVR on patient outcomes in a large, real-world registry.
The study population consisted of patients in the TVT registry (Society of Thoracic Surgery and American College of Cardiology Transcatheter Valve Therapy Registry) who underwent TAVR for aortic stenosis between 2016 and 2022 and were discharged alive from the index hospitalization. Key exclusion criteria included preexisting conduction defects and a permanent pacemaker before TAVR or during the index hospitalization. Clinical outcomes were compared between patients with and without new LBBB using Cox proportional hazards models adjusted for baseline demographic, clinical, and echocardiographic variables.
Among 202 533 TAVR recipients, 32 933 (16.3%) developed new LBBB after TAVR. Over the study period, there was a significant decrease in the incidence of new LBBB from 19.9% in the first quarter of 2016 to 14.4% in the third quarter of 2022. Patients with new LBBB after TAVR, compared with those without LBBB, had significantly greater 1-year all-cause mortality (adjusted hazard ratio, 1.19 [95% CI, 1.13-1.25]; P<0.001), hospital readmission (adjusted hazard ratio, 1.23 [95% CI, 1.19-1.28]; P<0.001), and new pacemaker requirement (adjusted hazard ratio, 3.50 [95% CI, 3.26-3.76]; P<0.001). Patients with new LBBB also had lower Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire Overall Summary scores (adjusted difference, -1.7 points [95% CI, -2.1 to -1.3]; P<0.001) and left ventricular ejection fraction (adjusted difference, -2.8% [95% CI, -3.4% to -2.2%]; P<0.001).
New LBBB after TAVR is associated with worse 1-year outcomes, including death, rehospitalization, and permanent pacemaker, as well as worse health status and lower left ventricular ejection fraction. These findings suggest that continued efforts to limit the development of conduction disturbance after TAVR are warranted."

This retrospective study enrolled 292 severe aortic stenosis patients underwent SE-TAVR. PVR severity was assessed pre-discharge. Multivariate logistic regression identified independent predictors of mild/moderate PVR, optimal cutoff values for significant anatomical parameters were determined using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis. Patients were subsequently stratified into three risk groups based on these thresholds.
Mild/moderate PVR occurred in 24.0 % of patients. Independent predictors included aortic annular perimeter (OR:1.067, P = 0.015), device landing zone calcific volume (OR:1.006 per 10 mm³, P = 0.025), and presence of sealing skirt (OR:0.412, P = 0.010). The combination of these predictors had a higher discriminative performance (AUC=0.779) than single predictors (P = 0.036, 0.007, and <0.001, respectively), with significant integrated discrimination improvement (integrated discrimination improvement=5.4-6.7 %, P < 0.001). ROC-derived thresholds (device landing zone calcific volume≥1240 mm³ and aortic annular perimeter≥77 mm) stratified patients into three risk groups with progressively increasing PVR incidence: Group A (neither elevate):8.4 %; Group B (either elevated):23.7 %; and Group C (both elevated):48.7 %. Pairwise comparisons confirming differences between Group A vs. B (P = 0.003) and Group B vs. C (P < 0.001). Sealing skirts significantly reduced PVR in Groups A (P = 0.042) but not in Group B and C (P = 0.082 and 0.342).
The dual-parameter model based on device landing zone calcification and aortic annular perimeter significantly enhances PVR risk stratification after SE-TAVR. The dual-threshold model provides a clinically actionable tool for pre-procedural risk stratification and personalized valve selection."

We aimed to evaluate the prognostic value of this RV-PA coupling in patients after TAVR.
RV-PA coupling was defined as the ratio of RV free wall longitudinal strain (RVFWLS) to pulmonary artery systolic pressure (PASP), measured by echocardiography in AS patients undergoing TAVR between April 2012 and November 2022. The endpoints were all cause death, cardiovascular rehospitalization, stroke, and a composite of these.
At a median follow-up time of 3.4 years, 352 (28.8%) patients in 1221 patients had composite clinical events. Patients with higher RVFWLS/PASP ratio were predominantly male, had lower body mass index, more comorbidities, higher Society of Thoracic Surgeons score, more New York Heart Association IV and worse laboratory data, alongside worse cardiac function compared to those with lower RVFWLS/PASP ratio. The fully adjusted multivariable hazard ratios of RVFWLS/PASP ratio and the tertile 3 of RVFWLS/PASP ratio were 2.228 (95% CI, 1.441-3.446) and 2.571 (95% CI, 1.633-4.047). In addition, Kaplan-Meier analyses revealed robust graded association between the RV-PA coupling and clinical outcomes (P <0.001).
The RV-PA coupling (RVFWLS/PASP ratio) is independently and robustly associated with adverse clinical events in patients undergoing TAVR. These data suggest that the RVFWLS/PASP ratio can serve as a risk stratification tool for patient selection and prognostication following TAVR."

This study aimed to evaluate periprocedural and clinical outcomes in patients with large and extra-large annuli undergoing TAVR and to compare results between balloon-expandable (BEVs) and self-expanding valves (SEVs).
This study included patients with severe aortic stenosis (AS) and extra-large annuli who underwent TAVR with either BEVs or SEVs. The primary endpoints were periprocedural and clinical outcomes, including device success, rates of moderate or greater paravalvular leak (PVL), permanent pacemaker (PPM) implantation, new Left bundle branch block (LBBB), stroke, and in-hospital and 1-year mortality. Secondary endpoints included safety outcomes and subgroup analyses comparing outcomes between patients with large (annular perimeter >90 mm and an area >660 mm²) and extra-large annuli (perimeter >96 mm and an area >730 mm²).
A total of 237 patients underwent TAVR, including 160 with BEVs and 77 with SEVs. The mean annular area and perimeter were 737 ± 76 mm² and 96.1 ± 4.1 mm, respectively, with no significant differences between groups. Overall device success was high, though slightly lower in the SEV group (84% vs. 93%, p=0.034), a difference that was no longer statistically significant after multivariate analysis (p=0.234). Moderate or greater PVL occurred more frequently with SEVs (13% vs. 4%, p = 0.016), particularly in patients with extra-large annuli (26% vs. 4%, p = 0.012). One-year mortality was similar between groups (SEV 13% vs. BEV 12%, p = 0.807), and no significant differences were observed in PPM implantation, new LBBB, stroke, or major vascular and bleeding complications.
TAVR is feasible and safe in patients with large and extra-large annuli, with higher rates of moderate or greater paravalvular leak observed in SEV patients with extra-large annuli."

Cases with additional indications or affected nonfirst-degree relative were excluded. Postnatal transthoracic echocardiography (t-Echo) data were reviewed when available. Significant CHD was defined as requiring catheter or surgical intervention in the first year of life.Sixty-five f-Echos were included (mean gestational age: 26.6 ± 3.7 weeks). No significant CHD was identified prenatally. Postnatal t-Echo was performed in 41 (63%) cases, with no significant CHD detected. Two (5%) infants were diagnosed postnatally with BAV, neither requiring intervention during the study interval. Minor findings included one case each of pulmonary valve stenosis and atrial septal defect.In pregnancies with a first-degree relative with BAV and a normal obstetric ultrasound, f-Echo showed no added diagnostic value for detecting significant CHD. Based on the state's birth rate (approximately 35,000/year), BAV prevalence (1-2%), and an average family size of 3.08, an estimated 733 to 1,466 pregnancies annually in Arkansas could qualify for f-Echo under current guidelines. At a cost of $1,000 to 5,000 per study, this translates to an annual healthcare expenditure ranging from $733,000 to 7.33 million. These findings support more targeted screening and the need for multicenter studies. · No significant CHD detected with f-Echo.. · Postnatal t-Echo remains definitive.. · Routine f-Echo may add limited value.. · Cost implications warrant reconsideration."

Performing left atrial appendage closure (LAAC) during TAVI can reduce the risk of thromboembolism while avoiding the need for prolonged anticoagulation.
This single-center study included 5 consecutive patients with severe aortic stenosis and AF who underwent same-session TAVI and LAAC between October 2024 and March 2025. All had contraindications to OAC or high bleeding risk. Procedural details and early outcomes were recorded. Technical success was defined according to Valve Academic Research Consortium-3 (VARC-3) (TAVI) and Munich/The Society for Cardiovascular Angiography & Interventions (SCAI) and the Heart Rhythm Society criteria (LAAC). Continuous variables are presented as mean ± SD or median interquartile range (IQR), and categorical variables as n (%).
Mean age was 75.6 ± 8.4 years; 40% were male.

Cardiovascular interventions,"Heart failure (HF) remains a significant burden following transcatheter aortic valve replacement, adversely impacting survival and quality of life. Identification of patients who may benefit from closer monitoring or adjunctive medical therapy to reduce the risk of HF is an unmet need. The objective of this study was to develop and internally validate a clinical prediction model to determine the 1-year risk of HF hospitalization or death after transcatheter aortic valve replacement.
Using the Society of Thoracic Surgeons/American College of Cardiology Transcatheter Valve Therapy Registry, we analyzed patients who underwent successful transcatheter aortic valve replacement for aortic stenosis and survived to discharge between 2016 and 2019. Covariates were selected based on expert opinion and prior literature. A hierarchical cumulative odds regression model was used to predict a composite outcome of (1) all-cause death, (2) ≥2 HF readmissions, or (3) 1 HF readmission at 1 year.
Among 78 384 patients (median age, 82 years; 45.6% female), 17.4% experienced the composite outcome, including death (10.9%), ≥2 HF readmissions (1.6%), and 1 HF readmission (4.9%). The model demonstrated good discrimination (C statistic, 0.753 derivation and 0.747 validation) and excellent calibration. Among 1-year survivors, performance in predicting HF readmission as an isolated outcome was similar (C statistic, 0.753). A simplified model, including the top 12 variables from the full model, maintained comparable performance (C statistics, 0.74-0.75).
This prediction model effectively stratifies post-transcatheter aortic valve replacement patients by risk of death or HF readmission, supporting its use to guide clinical surveillance and clinical trial enrollment for adjunctive medical therapies aimed at mitigating this risk."

Cardiovascular imaging,"Accurate aortic stenosis (AS) phenotyping requires multimodality imaging which has limited availability. The digital aortic stenosis severity index (DASSi), an AI biomarker of AS-related remodeling on single-view 2-dimensional echocardiography, predicts AS progression independent of Doppler measurements. We sought to evaluate the ability of DASSi to define personalized AS progression profiles and to validate its performance as a scalable alternative to multimodality imaging features of functional, structural, and biological AS severity.
In the SALTIRE-2 trial (Study Investigating the Effect of Drugs Used to Treat Osteoporosis on the Progression of Calcific Aortic Stenosis 2) of participants with mild or moderate AS, we performed blinded DASSi measurements (probability of severe AS, 0-1) on baseline transthoracic echocardiograms. We evaluated the association between baseline DASSi and (1) disease severity by hemodynamic (peak aortic valve velocity), structural (computed tomography-derived aortic valve calcium score), and biological features ([18F]sodium fluoride uptake on positron emission tomography-computed tomography); (2) longitudinal disease progression (change in peak aortic valve velocity and aortic valve calcium score); and (3) incident aortic valve replacement. We used generalized linear mixed or Cox models adjusted for risk factors and aortic valve area.
We analyzed 134 participants (72 [IQR, 69-78] years; 27 [20.1%] women) with a mean baseline DASSi of 0.51 (SD, 0.19). DASSi was independently associated with cross-sectional disease severity: each SD increase was associated with higher peak aortic valve velocity (+0.21 [95% CI, 0.12-0.30] m/s), aortic valve calcium score (+284 [95% CI, 101-467] Agatston units), and [18F]sodium fluoride target-to-background ratiomax (+0.17 [95% CI, 0.04-0.31]). Higher DASSi was also associated with disease progression by Doppler (peak aortic valve velocity) and computed tomography (aortic valve calcium score) at 24 months (P interaction for DASSi × time<0.001), and future aortic valve replacement (75 events over 5.5 [IQR, 2.4-7.2] years, adjusted HR, 1.42 [95% CI, 1.11-1.84] per SD).
DASSi is associated with functional, structural and biological features of AS severity and predicts disease progression and adverse outcomes.

PubMed,aortic stenosis,Simulation-guided design of leaflet height in bicuspidization of the aortic valve.,Alexander D Kaiser; Perry S Choi; Amit Sharir; Alison L Marsden; Michael R Ma,10.1016/j.xjon.2025.09.038,2025-12,JTCVS open,"Bicuspidization repair is typically applied to severe congenital aortic valve lesions. Increasingly, this repair is recognized as an effective and durable surgical approach. The consequences of postoperative leaflet geometry in this repair are relatively unstudied, especially compared with current understanding of optimal geometry for a trileaflet valve. In this work, a computational approach was systematically applied to study the effect of changes in leaflet geometric height in symmetric bicuspidization repair.
Eight model valves with 4 geometric heights spanning a range of typically observed values were constructed at 2 free-edge lengths. Heights varied when loaded in diastole from approximately one-half the annular diameter to just below the annular diameter. Fluid-structure interaction simulations were performed to study the coupled dynamics of the valve and blood. Models were evaluated for stenosis, regurgitation, hemodynamics, mechanics, and diastolic gross morphology.
Cases with loaded geometric height 0.64 to 0.79 times the annular diameter showed the overall best performance, with a coaptation reserve of 4 to 7 mm. Cases with geometric height approximately one-half the annular diameter showed severe regurgitation. Cases with geometric height 0.86 to 0.95 times the annular diameter showed less ""crisp"" coaptation alignment and the appearance of excessive leaflet material.
The intermediate range of geometric height appeared best, with insufficient height causing regurgitation. More geometric height was not always clearly better, as excessively tall leaflets showed less alignment in the coaptation regions."

We aimed to analyze how age, diagnosis, autograft support, and Konno-incision impact outcome.
Patients (0-18 years) undergoing primary/secondary Ross/Ross-Konno from August 1993 to November 2023 were included. Mortality, autograft replacement rate, and greater than mild autograft regurgitation were analyzed in the full cohort and subgroups (age, diagnosis, primary/secondary Ross, Ross/Ross-Konno, autograft support) using time-to-event methods. Propensity-score matching was performed to adjust for differences in baseline characteristics of patients undergoing supported/nonsupported Ross procedures.
In total, 196 patients underwent Ross/Ross-Konno procedures (N = 117/79; 60/40%) with median age/weight of 9.4 years [interquartile range, 3.4-14.1 years]/31.7 kg [12.9-57 kg] and median follow-up of 8.8 years [1.6-14.8 years]. Twenty-year freedom from death, autograft replacement rate, and rate of greater than mild autograft regurgitation was 88.7% (95% confidence interval, 79.8%-93.8%), 13.2% (7.1%-24.7%), and 17.7% (11.3%-27.8%), respectively. Lowest 20-year freedom from death was observed among neonates/infants 47.6% (7.5%-80.8%)/58.9% (34.5%-76.8%) compared with older patients (97.6%; 90.6%-99.4%, P < .001). In total, 83.3% of all deceased neonates/infants had associated mitral valve disease. Patients with isolated aortic valve stenosis and/or Konno-incision were at greater mortality risk (P = .02). 20-year autograft replacement rate was highest among adolescents (12-18 years): 30.7% (15.5-60.9), without statistical significance (P = .08), and greater in secondary Ross: 23.8% (11.4-49.7, P = .03). Matched pairs (supported vs nonsupported Ross, n = 30 each) did not show differences in primary outcomes.
The Ross procedure in pediatric patients demonstrated good long-term outcomes. Mortality risk is greater in neonates/infants and patients with isolated aortic stenosis. Adolescent patients/patients undergoing secondary Ross procedures were associated with greater autograft replacement rates."

The Osaka Prognostic Score (OPS), incorporating CRP, albumin, and lymphocyte count, may address this gap. We aimed to evaluate the prognostic value of OPS for predicting in-hospital and one-year all-cause mortality after TAVI. Materials and Methods: In this retrospective single-center cohort study, 244 patients who underwent transfemoral TAVI between December 2022 and January 2024 were analyzed. OPS was calculated at baseline (range: 0-3), and its prognostic value for in-hospital and one-year all-cause mortality was evaluated using multivariable Cox regression, ROC analysis, and restricted cubic spline (RCS) modeling. Results: In-hospital and one-year mortality rates were 11.5% and 21.7%, respectively. Higher OPS scores were significantly associated with mortality in both periods. OPS independently predicted in-hospital mortality (HR: 2.018; 95% CI: 1.632-2.521; p = 0.017) and one-year mortality (HR: 2.125; 95% CI: 1.300-3.473; p = 0.003). ROC analysis yielded AUC values of 0.776 and 0.859 for in-hospital and one-year mortality, respectively. Kaplan-Meier curves revealed significantly reduced survival in patients with higher OPS (log-rank p < 0.001), and RCS analysis demonstrated a significant nonlinear association between increasing OPS values and mortality risk (p < 0.001). Conclusions: OPS is a simple, cost-effective, and biologically relevant prognostic index that independently predicts both in-hospital and one-year mortality following TAVI. By integrating markers of inflammation, nutrition, and immune competence, OPS may offer additional value in risk stratification and support clinical decision-making in this high-risk population."

Conventional imaging modalities such as ultrasound and computed tomography angiography (CTA) have limited capacity to identify histopathological features of plaque instability, including fibrous cap rupture, lipid-rich necrotic core, and intraplaque hemorrhage. Artificial intelligence (AI) techniques-particularly deep learning (DL) and radiomics-have recently emerged as valuable adjuncts to standard imaging, achieving AUC values of 0.83-0.99 across modalities in identifying vulnerable plaques. This scoping review summarizes the available evidence on the application of AI in the detection and assessment of vulnerable carotid plaques. Methods: A systematic search of the English-language literature was conducted in MEDLINE, SCOPUS, and CENTRAL from 2000 to 30 June 2025, following the PRISMA-ScR framework. Eligible studies applied AI-based approaches (machine learning, deep learning, or radiomics) to evaluate carotid plaque vulnerability using ultrasound, CTA, or MRI. Extracted outcomes included diagnostic performance, correlation with histopathology or neurological events, and predictive modeling for stroke risk. Results: Of 201 records screened, 12 studies met inclusion criteria (ultrasound = 6; CTA = 4; high-resolution MRI = 2; publication years 2021-2025). All reported receiver operating characteristic area-under-the-curve (ROC-AUC) values for endpoints related to plaque vulnerability (symptomatic versus asymptomatic status, presence of intraplaque hemorrhage or lipid-rich necrotic core, fibrous-cap surrogates, and, less frequently, short-term cerebrovascular events). For ultrasound, contrast-enhanced videomics achieved an AUC of 0.87 (10 centers; n = 205), B-mode texture/radiomics reached 0.87 (n = 150), and segmentation-assisted models 0.827 (n = 202); other ultrasound models reported AUCs of 0.88-0.91. For CTA, a symptomatic-plaque machine-learning model yielded AUC 0.89 ( n = 106); a perivascular-adipose-tissue (PVAT) radiomics nomogram achieved AUC 0.836 on external validation; a histology-referenced pilot attained AUC 0.987; and one mild-stenosis TIA model reported ROC performance. For high-resolution MRI (HR-MRI), radiomics-based models showed AUC 0.835-0.864 in single-modality cohorts and up to 0.984 with multi-contrast inputs. Across modalities, AUC ranges were: ultrasound 0.827-0.91, CTA 0.836-0.987 (external 0.836), and HR-MRI 0.835-0.984. Only two out of twelve studies performed external validation; calibration and decision-curve analyses were rarely provided, and most cohorts were single-center, limiting generalizability. Conclusions: AI demonstrates strong potential as a complementary tool for evaluating carotid plaque vulnerability, with high diagnostic performance across imaging modalities. Reported AUCs ranged from 0.83 to 0.99 based primarily on internal or hold-out validation, representing the upper bound of theoretical rather than real-world performance. Nonetheless, large prospective multicenter studies with standardized protocols, histopathological correlation, and external validation are required before clinical integration into stroke prevention pathways."

This effect is exacerbated in the presence of coronary disease (CAD). Treatment with transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) may promote reversal of these pathophysiological conditions.
We performed multimodality assessment of cardiac physiology in patients with AS and concurrent CAD requiring percutaneous coronary intervention, prior to and 6 months after undergoing TAVI. Techniques include: coronary angiography and bolus thermodilution-derived indices of microvascular function (coronary flow reserve (CFR); index of microcirculatory resistance (IMR)); stress perfusion cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) imaging, which was used to measure changes in global myocardial blood flow (MBF) and left ventricular mass (LVM), and computed resting and hyperaemic vessel specific absolute coronary flow (aCBF) and microvascular resistance (MVR) using a computational model of coronary physiology.
Data were obtained for seven patients (10 vessels). CFR increased from 1.53 (1.2-1.7) to 2.35 (2.0-2.7) (p=0.037) 6 months post-TAVI. There was a 33% reduction in resting aCBF from 218 mL/min to 146 mL/min (p=0.004). On CMR, resting MBF fell 37% from 3.0±0.98 mL/min/g to 1.9±0.7 mL/min/g (p=0.033) and stress MBF fell 25% from 3.6±0.57 mL/min/g to 2.7±0.7 mL/min/g (p=0.004). Indexed LVM regressed from 79±14 g/m2 to 71±16 g/m2 (p=0.006). MVR remained unchanged.
CFR increased following TAVI. The mechanism for this was a significant reduction in resting coronary blood flow measured with CMR and modelled computationally. The unchanged MVR and IMR suggest that resting blood flow reduces due to reduced myocardial demand and myocardial remodelling, rather than changes in resistance."

Tissue-engineered heart valves (TEHVs) offer a potential solution, but reproducing the extracellular matrix architecture and mechanical microenvironment of native leaflets remains a critical challenge. Gelatin methacryloyl (GelMA) hydrogels provide tunable structural and mechanical properties, offering a promising platform. However, their ability to direct lineage-specific tissue reconstruction remains unclear. Here, we investigated the responses of human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HuVECs) and immortalized human aortic valve interstitial cells (iHAVICs) cultured either on the surface (2D) or encapsulated within (3D) GelMA hydrogels. Both cell types maintained high viability across dimensional culture conditions (2D and 3D). In 2D, HuVECs proliferated and assembled into highly interconnected vascular plexuses containing luminal structures, while iHAVICs formed spongy, mesh-like frameworks. In 3D, HuVECs developed complex, spatially interconnected vascular-like networks, and iHAVICs transitioned from spherical to spindle morphologies, aligning into linear and fibrous skeletons. These findings establish that GelMA substrates direct cell-type-specific morphogenesis, yielding vascular networks from HuVECs and valve-like stromal architectures from iHAVICs in a dimensionality-dependent manner. This study demonstrates the feasibility of using GelMA hydrogels to support distinct, tissue-relevant architectures, providing a basis for future strategies in TEHVs."

Quality of care & clinical outcomes,"Wild-type transthyretin cardiac amyloidosis (ATTRwt-CA) is increasingly recognized in older adults. Nonetheless, its true prevalence in unselected subjects is unclear. We performed a systematic screening in 1,000 individuals aged 65-90 years to identify CA and assess the clinical and economic impact of diagnosing both CA and incidental findings.
All participants underwent a cardiology visit, electrocardiogram, echocardiogram, and measurement of cardiac biomarkers. Patients with any red flag proceeded to bone scintigraphy and monoclonal protein testing. We cataloged incidental cardiac or renal abnormalities, referred individuals for further evaluation, and estimated total screening costs. We then incorporated tafamidis therapy for the newly diagnosed patients with CA and conducted two cost-effectiveness analyses: one excluding quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) from incidental diagnoses and another one including them.
Four new cases of ATTRwt-CA were diagnosed (0.46%). Additional findings included moderate-to-severe valvular disease, conduction abnormalities requiring device implantation, and previously unknown stage 3-5 chronic kidney disease in 15.6% of participants. The total non-drug screening cost was around €252,000, while tafamidis (5 years, four patients) added €1,080,000. Excluding incidental benefits, the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) was around €94,000 per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY). With an estimated 15-20 extra QALYs from incidental findings, the ICER fell to €39,000-€46,000 per QALY.
A structured screening program for CA in elderly subjects can uncover important comorbidities but remains expensive, with an incremental cost of approximately €39,000-€94,000 per QALY; the overall value of such a strategy will therefore depend on tafamidis pricing and the willingness-to-pay threshold adopted by individual health systems."

Nevertheless, large cohort studies demonstrated that the prevalence of clinically relevant AR ranges from 1.6% to 4.5% in individuals aged ≥ 65 years. Despite a markedly increased mortality risk, AR was often treated conservatively, especially in patients considered unsuitable for surgery. Early attempts to treat AR patients with conventional transcatheter devices led to unsatisfactory results, mainly due to elevated rates of valve migration or embolization, and relevant paravalvular regurgitation. Recently, dedicated transcatheter heart valves, such as the JenaValve Trilogy System and the J-Valve, have been introduced and indicated high procedural success rates and improved clinical outcomes. However, both interventional and surgical treatment of AR are associated with increased need for pacemaker implantation, follow-up data is scarce, and referring physicians are often unaware of novel dedicated devices. Awareness needs to be spread to provide optimal treatment for AR patients with increased surgical risk."

Improving diagnostic rates allows for the centralization of high-risk cases in hospitals with pediatric cardiac surgery facilities, thereby reducing neonatal mortality and morbidity. This study aims to evaluate new diagnostic protocols to enhance the clinical and outpatient management of suspected CoA cases.
A retrospective analysis was conducted, focusing on various echocardiographic parameters to identify the most predictive indicators for CoA.
A total of 184 cases with a prevalence of right-sided heart sections were identified, with 128 patients meeting the inclusion criteria. Of these, 15 cases of CoA were confirmed postnatally, representing 11.7% of the cohort. Among these, 80% showed early echocardiographic signs of CoA. The ratio of pulmonary valve (PV) to aortic valve (AV) diameters emerged as the most reliable parameter, especially in early gestation, while the z-score of the aortic isthmus was also a strong predictor.
The use of simple, reliable echocardiographic parameters can improve the detection rate of high-risk CoA cases, enabling better clinical management and improved neonatal outcomes in both the short and long term."

This report describes a seven-year-old male Dutch rabbit (Oryctolagus cuniculus) diagnosed with congestive heart failure caused by both mitral and tricuspid regurgitation. Clinical signs included coarse lung crackles, mild tachycardia, and muffled heart sounds. Blood analysis showed moderate leukocytosis with neutrophilia and monocytosis. Echocardiography revealed enlargement of the left atrium, significant valvular regurgitation, and small fluid accumulations in the pleural and pericardial cavities. Treatment with furosemide and enalapril provided brief improvement over 2 weeks before the rabbit's death. The case highlights valvular regurgitation as a frequent cause of heart failure in aging rabbits and emphasizes the value of early detection and timely therapy in improving outcomes and extending quality of life in affected animals."

MMVD is characterized by progressive mitral valve degeneration, volume overload, and eventual development of congestive heart failure (CHF). Given the strong hereditary component in CKCS, considerable research has focused on elucidating the genetic basis of MMVD in this breed. This review article summarizes the current state of knowledge on the phenotypic features, inheritance, and candidate loci potentially responsible for early onset and severe course of the disease. The pathogenesis of the disease, its classification, and the effects of breeding programs aimed at reducing the occurrence of MMVD have been described. Key findings include associations between MMVD severity and polymorphisms in genes such as NEBL, ACE, CDK6, HEPACAM2, COL5A1, and FAH, as well as evidence implicating dysregulated TGF-β signaling, serotonin signaling, and extracellular matrix remodeling pathways. The current state of knowledge on the role of miRNA in the pathogenesis of MMVD was also summarized. Despite these findings, no specific high-penetrating mutation has been identified. MMVD is a complex, polygenic condition shaped by regulatory variants and breed-specific genetic bottlenecks. Comparative studies underscore the translational relevance of canine MMVD to human mitral valve disease, while genomic insights may be basis for the future selective breeding strategies and therapeutic approaches. Further large-scale, integrative studies combining genomics, transcriptomics, and functional validation are needed to clarify disease mechanisms and support targeted treatment in CKCS as well as the development of new breeding strategies and programs."

Surgical aortic valve replacement remains the standard treatment but is often deferred due to perceived high surgical risk and frailty, leaving nearly one‑third of patients with severe AR untreated. Transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) offers a less invasive alternative, but off-label use of transcatheter valves designed for aortic stenosis has been limited by anchoring difficulties, valve embolization, and residual regurgitation. Dedicated devices have addressed these challenges with tailored anchoring mechanisms and demonstrated improved procedural success. This case-based review explores the evolving role of TAVR for AR through three patient vignettes that highlight practical considerations for device selection, anchoring strategies, and complication management. While outcomes with dedicated systems are encouraging, further research should establish TAVR in AR treatment. In parallel, device iterations are required to curtail procedure-induced conduction disturbances and broaden anatomical eligibility."

International normalized ratio (INR) goals for mechanical AVRs can change throughout treatment as risk factors change. Appropriate INR goal selection is crucial as goals that stray from evidence-based recommendations can lead to increased risk of bleeding, thrombosis or unnecessary monitoring.
The purpose of this study was to evaluate the appropriateness of INR goals in patients with mechanical AVRs and identify opportunities for pharmacist-led intervention.
A cross-sectional quality improvement study was conducted at a safety net academic medical center's outpatient anticoagulation clinic. This quality improvement project was not formally supervised by the Institutional Review Board per their policies. Adult patients with isolated mechanical AVR actively managed on warfarin were included. Pharmacists determined whether INR goals were justified by clinical context and American and European valvular heart disease guidelines. When goals lacked clear justification, pharmacists contacted referring providers to recommend INR goal adjustment.
Of 100 identified patients, 81 met eligibility criteria including 24 (29.6%) with On-X valves and 57 (70.4%) with alternative mechanical AVRs. Nearly one-third of patients (23, 29.3%) had INR goals inconsistent with current guidelines. Pharmacist-led outreach resulted in 20 accepted recommendations (87.0%), representing 24.7% of the study population. On-X valve recommendations primarily involved reducing INR targets to 1.5 to 2.0 for patients at least 3 months postsurgery without other risk factors that would constitute a higher INR goal. The most common alternative mechanical valve interventions included increasing INR goals to 2.5 to 3.5 in those with thromboembolic risk factors and decreasing INR goals to 2.0 to 3.0 due to absence of thromboembolic risk factors.
This stewardship initiative highlights the need for periodic INR goal review, as risk factors in patients with mechanical AVRs can change over time."

The objectives of this study were to improve the early diagnosis of TS and to predict the risk of severe cardiovascular diseases in patients with TS by analyzing the main features of cardiovascular diseases in these patients.
This study included 107 patients with TS who underwent echocardiography and were admitted to the Shanghai Children's Medical Center between November 2019 and November 2024. In this study, the height, weight, age, karyotype, cardiac imaging data, and electrocardiograms of the patients were collected. The main features of the cardiovascular diseases in patients with TS were assessed, and the correlations between the height, body mass index (BMI), karyotype, and cardiovascular diseases were analyzed.
Overall, 107 patients with TS were included, with an average age of 9.68 ± 4.23 years at diagnosis. Bicuspid aortic valve (BAV), aortic coarctation (CoA), and persistent left superior vena cava (PLSVC) were the most prevalent cardiovascular diseases, with prevalence rates of 11.2% (12/107), 8.4% (9/107), and 9.3% (10/107), respectively. The partial anomalous pulmonary venous return (PAPVC) was of the 'supra cardiac type' in all cases. Patients with CoA had lower BMI-for-age Z-score (BMIAZ) (-0.81 ± 1.17 vs. 0.61 ± 0.99; P = 0.003) than those without CoA. The best cutoff for predicting CoA was calculated using a sensitivity of 0.857 and specificity of 0.697 with a BMIAZ of 0.115 and an area under the curve of 0.825 (P = 0.004). Moreover, CoA (63.3%, 7/11) was the leading cause for surgical and interventional procedures in children and adolescents with TS. The 45,X karyotype was found to be associated with congenital heart disease (CHD) (47.4% vs. 24.6%; P = 0.016).
Girls with BAV or CoA should undergo karyotyping to facilitate the early diagnosis of TS. CoA is the leading cause for surgical and interventional procedures in children and adolescents with TS. The BMIAZ is a reliable predictor of CoA. Cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) or computed tomography (CT) should be performed at the time of diagnosis for girls with TS, especially those with a 45,X karyotype, BMIAZ < 0.115, or CHD detected by echocardiography."

Appropriate diagnostic workup and management in the inpatient setting can be challenging in this patient population due to the spectrum of disease complexity and the dynamic nature of the field. Therefore, the Paediatric Acute Care Cardiology Collaborative has undertaken the creation of this clinical practice guideline.
A panel of paediatric cardiologists, infectious disease specialists, intensivists, advanced practice practitioners, pharmacists, cardiothoracic surgeons, and a dentist was convened. The literature was systematically reviewed for relevant articles on the management of infective endocarditis in patients with CHD. Using the modified Delphi technique, recommendations were generated and put through iterative Delphi rounds to achieve consensus for inclusion.
Based on 127 articles that met the inclusion criteria, 82 recommendations were generated, 50 of which achieved consensus for inclusion and are included in this guideline. They address risk factors specific to CHD lesion type and prior interventions including implanted material, diagnostic considerations, management strategies, and recommendations on counselling other healthcare providers, patients, and families. Of the 50 consensus recommendations, 36 are strong recommendations, though 20 have low or very low quality of evidence.
A central theme in this guideline is that an individual's specific CHD lesion and prior interventions must be carefully considered for risk stratification, diagnostic approach, and management. While most are strong recommendations, many are supported by low quality of evidence, emphasising the need for further research in this subject."
PubMed,valvular heart disease,Nationwide trends and in-hospital outcomes of surgical versus transcatheter aortic valve replacement in Japan: a real-world analysis using administrative data.,Yoon Kyoung Kim; Eiki Nagaoka; Kiyotoshi Oishi; Mikayo Toba; Kiyohide Fushimi; Tomoyuki Fujita,10.1007/s00380-025-02640-5,2025-12-29,Heart and vessels,"Aortic stenosis (AS) is the most prevalent valvular disease in developed nations. Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement (TAVR) offers a minimally invasive alternative to Surgical Aortic Valve Replacement (SAVR), particularly for high-risk patients. However, TAVR adoption and outcomes in Japan remain understudied due to limited national database analyses and differences in patient demographics compared to major international trials. We conducted a retrospective cohort study of aortic valve replacement (AVR) procedures from 2014 to 2021 using the National Healthcare Reimbursement database. In total, 103,076 cases were analyzed, with 33,881 undergoing TAVR and 31,337 undergoing SAVR for aortic stenosis. TAVR patients were older (median age 85 vs. 76 years, p < 0.0001) and more often female (66.7% vs. 51.4%, p < 0.0001). TAVR was associated with lower in-hospital mortality (0.88% vs. 2.4%, p < 0.0001), shorter hospital stays (14 vs. 24 days, p < 0.0001), but significantly higher medical costs (¥5,303,722 vs. ¥3,945,622, p < 0.0001). Among patients younger than 75 years, no significant difference in mortality was observed. In this nationwide administrative database, TAVR was associated with lower in-hospital mortality and shorter hospital stays compared to SAVR, though at a higher cost. While patient backgrounds and clinical risks could not be fully adjusted due to data limitations, the observed differences in in-hospital outcomes between TAVR and SAVR reflect real-world practice patterns. These findings should be interpreted as descriptive, not causal. The absence of a mortality difference in patients under 75 years highlights the need for further evaluation of TAVR's long-term effectiveness and cost-efficiency in younger populations."
PubMed,valvular heart disease,Iatrogenic atrial septal defect following transcatheter edge-to-edge mitral valve repair: A systematic review and meta-analysis.,Deng Lei; Chunlan Zhou; Junqing Zhou; Chen Luo; Baoshi Zheng,10.1097/MD.0000000000046486,2025-12-26,Medicine,"Transcatheter edge-to-edge mitral valve repair (TEER) requires transseptal access of the left atrium, which usually causes an iatrogenic atrial septal defect (iASD). It is controversial that whether these patients with iASD persistence will progress to a bad prognostic state. So it's worthwhile to evaluate whether the procedure of TEER induced iASD leads to development of a relevant interatrial shunt. This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to identify predictors of iASD persistence in patients with mitral regurgitation (MR) undergoing TEER and assess its effect on in-hospital outcomes and mortality.
In this systematic review and meta-analysis, we conducted a literature search in various databases. Our investigation summarized data from contemporary studies on the incidence of iASD following TEER for MR and its association with clinical outcomes.
10 studies were analyzed, possible predictors of risk factors for the persistence of iASD after TEER seemed to be atrial fibrillation before surgery (OR 1.40; P = .04), residual MR > 2+(OR 2.36; P = .001), residual tricuspid regurgitation > mild(OR 1.52; P = .01), and prolonged fluoroscopic time(MD [in minutes] 5.36; P = .007). Patients with iASD persistence after TEER seemed to have a greater risk to suffer from right heart overload reflecting from the enlarged right ventricle end-diastolic dimension (RVEDD) (MD 3.27; P < .00001) and the enlarged diameter of the right atrium (MD 4.41; P < .00001). Patients with iASD persistence after TEER had a greater risk of heart failure rehospitalization (OR 2.71; P = .003).
This systematic review and meta-analysis identified several related predictors of iASD persistence, possibly leading to right heart volume overload and a higher risk of heart failure rehospitalization. In order to generalize our findings, larger clinical studies in independent patient cohorts are necessary. What's more, there is a need to perform a careful decision for interventional closure of an iASD after TEER."

WNT and JAK/STAT have been highlighted as emerging biomarkers in cardiovascular disease pathogenesis. This study assessed the Wnt/JAK-STAT signaling pathway in relation to SFRP5 and genetic polymorphisms in cardiac patients. This prospective case-control study included 100 patients with various cardiac diseases (IHD, valvular heart disease, HF, cardiomyopathy, and arrhythmia) and 50 matched healthy controls. Clinical and echocardiographic assessments were performed. Plasma SFRP5, Wnt5a, and JAK levels were measured using ELISA; STAT5A expression by flow cytometry; and SFRP5 (rs780369540) gene polymorphism by TaqMan real-time PCR were also performed in all participants. Cardiac patients showed significantly higher median BMI (33 vs. 28.5 kg/m2, p = 0.001) and markedly increased median value of each Wnt5a (16.85 vs. 5.6 pg/mL, p < 0.001), median JAK (9.45 vs. 2.4 pg/mL, p < 0.001), and STAT5A expression (87.55% vs. 33%, p < 0.001), with lower SFRP5 levels (4 vs. 6.7 ng/L, p < 0.001) compared to control. The SFRP5 (rs780369540) T allele was more frequent in patients (51.5% vs. 32%, p = 0.001), and dominant TT + TC genotypes were higher (66% vs. 42%, p = 0.005) compared to the control group. TT carriers showed higher median Wnt5a, lower median SFRP5, and reduced ejection fraction compared to other genotypes (TC, CC) carriers. Multivariate analysis identified elevated Wnt5a, JAK, and decreased SFRP5 as independent predictors of cardiovascular disease (p < 0.05). Cardiac patients showed altered WNT5a, JAK, and SFRP5 levels. SFRP5 polymorphism predicted cardiovascular risk independently."

This study aimed to identify patients with SICD, characterise their clinical and paraclinical features, analyse the different patterns of cardiac dysfunction, and determine prognostic implications. Methods: Patients admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) for sepsis or septic shock who underwent echocardiography on admission were identified retrospectively. Exclusion criteria included acute myocardial infarction, preexisting severe left heart valve disease or systolic dysfunction. Clinical, paraclinical, and echocardiography data were documented. The primary outcome was a composite of in-hospital mortality, prolonged hospital stay, and prolonged ICU stay. Results: A total of 128 septic patients were included, with a median age of 72.5 years and a 55% male proportion. Alcohol abuse, vasopressor therapy and orotracheal intubation on admission were risk factors for developing SICD. More than a third developed SICD (37%). We identified four different types of cardiac dysfunction based on echocardiography. An NT-proBNP level of over 9000 pg/mL was a predictor of SICD, composite outcome and mortality. A total of 56 patients (44%) experienced in-hospital mortality. Even though the occurrence of SICD did not predict mortality, it was a significant predictor of the composite outcome. Conclusions: This study describes the incidence and spectrum of SICD in a group of septic patients admitted to a tertiary care hospital. The occurrence of any type of cardiac dysfunction associated with sepsis and high NT-proBNP levels had strong prognostic implications."

Additionally, we evaluated the role of EFR in predicting the need for aortic valve (AV) surgery during mid-term follow-up.                                                           Methods                     Sixty-six patients (mean age 53 ± 15.0 years, 73% men) underwent echocardiographic assessment, including (semi-)quantitative parameters such as proximal isovelocity surface area (PISA), effective regurgitation orifice area (EROA), AR volume (AR-Vol), vena contracta (VC) and EFR, compared against CMR-derived regurgitant fraction (RF). Multivariable regression analysis was applied evaluating predictors for severe AR and AV surgery.                                                           Results                                            According to CMRI, 13 patients had no, 16 mild, 18 moderate and 19 severe AR. All echocardiographic parameters demonstrated good diagnostic accuracy (AUC: EFR 0.84, VC 0.82, PISA 0.84, EROA 0.83, AR-Vol 0.86; all                       p                        &lt; 0.001). Logistic regression identified EFR (                       p                        = 0.022) and VC (                       p                        = 0. 015) as significant predictors of severe AR. During 62 months follow-up, 16 of 53 patients (24%) underwent AV surgery. All echocardiographic parameters, except PHT, were significantly different between patients receiving AV surgery compared to patients without surgery (PISA, EROA, AR-Vol and VC                       p                        &lt; 0.001, EFR                       p                        = 0.043). However, VC remained the only parameter significantly associated with time to AV surgery (Cox-regression analysis,                       p                        = 0.024).                                                                                Conclusions                     EFR is a robust and reliable parameter for AR assessment, particularly in distinguishing moderate from severe AR, and should be incorporated into comprehensive echocardiographic assessment. However, VC demonstrated stronger prognostic relevance for predicting surgical intervention."

With a focus on the prevalent psychological complications following the onset of this condition, this study aimed to explore the correlation between antenatal depression and Corona disease anxiety, personality traits, and postpartum depression during the COVID-19 pandemic.                                                           Materials and Methods:                     This cross-sectional descriptive-analytical study investigated women receiving care at health centers affiliated with Kerman University of Medical Sciences during the last month of their pregnancy and the postpartum period in 2022. Following the acquisition of informed consent, participants were assessed using various measures, including demographic and obstetric information, the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale, the Corona Disease Anxiety Scale (CDAS), and the NEO Personality Inventory-Revised during their third trimester of pregnancy. The same group of participants completed the Edinburgh Depression Scale and the Corona Disease Anxiety Scale (CDAS) 4-6 weeks after childbirth.                                                           Results and Discussion:                     There was a significant correlation between family income, unwanted pregnancy as perceived by both the mother and father, and antenatal depression. Additionally, marital satisfaction played a significant role in postpartum depression. Furthermore, antenatal depression was significantly associated with neuroticism, agreeableness, and physical symptoms related to Corona disease anxiety. Personality traits, with the exception of extroversion and conscientiousness, and various domains of Corona disease anxiety, excluding psychological symptoms, were also significantly associated with postpartum depression.                                                           Conclusion:                     During pandemics or epidemics, such as the COVID-19 outbreak, experiencing mental distress during pregnancy can contribute to mental health issues during the postpartum period. This risk is particularly true in individuals with unique personality traits, emphasizing the need for increased focus on mental health within prenatal care during these crises."

Method:                     This cross-sectional study was conducted in Kerman, Iran. Data were collected from patients who visited Afzalipour Hospital in Kerman more than twice during the COVID-19 epidemic from the end of February 2020 to March 21, 2021. We conducted two key analyses: 1. Mixed effect logistic regression was used to check the relationship between the variables and COVID-19 severity. 2. Mixed effect linear regression was used to check the relationship between the variables and the length of stay in the hospital.                                                           Results:                     The findings indicated that the most important risk factors for the severity of COVID-19 were heart diseases (OR=1.67,95%CI:1.20-2.30), increasing age (OR=2.23 for age&gt;54, 95%CI:1.70- 2.90), male gender (OR=1.47,95%CI:1.10-1.96), respiratory diseases other than asthma, and frequency of admission (OR=1.60,95%CI:1.20-2.15). All patients who underwent readmission experienced a shorter duration of hospitalization during their subsequent admission (OR=0.94,95%CI:0.91,0.96) and had a higher mortality rate (30% within 14 days, 26.6% between 14-90 days). Patients readmitted at intervals of 14-90 days and greater than 90 days exhibited lower disease severity compared to those readmitted within the 0-14 day period.                                                           Conclusion:                     Examining readmissions, the severity of COVID-19, and the length of hospital stay in affected patients are important factors for planning and allocating resources for COVID-19 management and treatment. These factors can help policymakers develop effective clinical guidelines for hospitalization or outpatient treatment of COVID-19 patients and contribute to reducing the burden of disease in the community."

Kinovea, as an accessible motion-analysis software, provides both visual and quantitative feedback. However, its application in supporting technique development among beginner athletes remains insufficiently explored. Aim: This study aims to describe the use of Kinovea in biomechanics training and examine its contribution to the awareness of kinematic characteristics and movement techniques among beginner athletes. Methods: A descriptive qualitative design involved 72 beginner athletes aged 18–25 years selected through purposive sampling. Data were collected over 16 weeks through interviews, field observations, and motion video recordings analyzed using Kinovea. Kinematic data focused on joint angles, stride behavior, and movement phases during walking, running, and the flight phase. Qualitative data were analyzed using content analysis with NVivo 12, while kinematic results were interpreted descriptively to identify performance patterns and areas for technical refinement. Result: Kinematic analysis showed coordinated joint-angle patterns across all phases. Walking analysis identified arm swing angles of 50.9°–58.8° and leg separation angles of 64.3°–67.2°, indicating a stable gait rhythm. The running analysis revealed knee angles of 68.8°–69.8° and elbow angles of 87.6°–89.1°, indicating efficient propulsive mechanics. The flight phase demonstrated knee angles of 81.2°–87.8° and elbow angles of 80.4°–88.3°, suggesting effective momentum use and postural stability. These measurements supported stride-efficiency assessment and technique evaluation. Qualitative findings revealed that Kinovea enabled athletes to interpret movement phases and identify technical inefficiencies through slow-motion and frame-by-frame visualization. Conclusion: Kinovea supports basic motion analysis by providing clear kinematic information and helping beginner athletes observe and refine their movement techniques. The findings also offer practical value for coaches by enabling more precise identification of inefficient patterns and guiding targeted corrections during early-stage training."

We present a case where an apico-aortic conduit offered a safer alternative. Case presentation A 20-year-old woman with Type IIIc GD (homozygous D409H mutation) presented with New York Heart Association (NYHA) Class III dyspnoea, palpitations, and syncope. She had hypertension, hypothyroidism, and a sibling deceased from the same condition. On enzyme replacement therapy for 6 years, she was found to have severe calcification of the aortic valve, root, and ascending aorta, stenosis of arch vessels, grade II aortic regurgitation, mild mitral stenosis, and proximal left anterior descending artery stenosis. Intraoperatively, extensive calcification precluded root and arch reconstruction. A left ventricular apex–descending thoracic aorta conduit with a mechanical valve was constructed, combined with coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) to the left anterior descending artery and an innominate artery bypass. Recovery was uneventful, and follow-up at 13 months showed the patient in NYHA Class I with patent conduit and grafts. Conclusions An apico–aortic conduit can provide a safe and effective solution in GD with porcelain aorta, avoiding high-risk aortic manipulation. To our knowledge, this is the first reported use of a valved conduit in Gaucher-related calcification, broadening surgical options for this complex patient group."

However, in a significant portion of patients, resting findings do not fully reflect the hemodynamic severity of the condition, particularly in asymptomatic individuals with severe valvular disease or those with nonspecific symptoms. In this context, stress echocardiography emerges as a vital imaging modality, providing a dynamic assessment of valvular, ventricular, and pulmonary function under hemodynamic load (from physical exercise or pharmacological agents). Methods: We conducted a comprehensive synthesis and critical evaluation of the current landscape, recent advancements, and future directions regarding the application of stress echocardiography in valvular heart disease. Results: This comprehensive review explores the incremental role of stress echocardiography in valvular heart disease, analyzing the evolution of its clinical applications, from low-flow, low-gradient aortic stenosis to the evaluation of contractile reserve and exercise-induced pulmonary hypertension in mitral stenosis and regurgitation. We discuss standardized protocols, key parameters to monitor, and the diagnostic and prognostic outcomes from major clinical trials and current guidelines. Attention is given to stress echocardiography’s ability to unmask the true severity of the disease and to identify patients at high risk for adverse events, thereby guiding crucial clinical decisions, such as the optimal timing for surgical or transcatheter intervention. Conclusions: The review evaluates the limitations of modality and outlines future research directions, including its integration with new technologies like 3D echocardiography and speckle tracking techniques, to further optimize the role of stress echocardiography as a decision-making tool in the multidisciplinary management of valvular heart disease."

Ruhparwar; Alina Zubarevich; Alexander Weymann,10.3390/jcm15010354,2026-01-02,Journal of Clinical Medicine,"Background/Objectives: Transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) has become the leading treatment option for patients suffering from aortic valve stenosis aged over 70, except in cases of specific contraindications like bicuspid valves, inappropriate access routes, or endocarditis. Minimally invasive aortic valve replacement (MIAVR) has emerged as a potential way to combine the durability of surgery with reduced procedural trauma. This study aims to assess the safety and feasibility of MIAVR in elderly patients. Methods: A total of 990 patients were included in this retrospective cohort study. Among them, 261 (26%) were aged 70 years or older (elderly cohort), and 729 (74%) were younger than 70 years (younger cohort). All patients were followed for at least 30 days postoperatively, with survival data collected through May 2025. Multivariable logistic regression, linear regression, and Kaplan–Meier survival analyses were performed. Results: Elderly patients were more likely to be female (51% vs. 40%, p = 0.001) and carried a heavier burden of vascular and renal comorbidity: renal impairment 33% vs. 17% and extracardiac arteriopathy 45% vs. 30% (both p &lt; 0.001). Major bleeding occurred more frequently in the elderly cohort (7.7% vs. 4.1%; p = 0.02), as did new permanent pacemaker implantation (10% vs. 5.8%; p = 0.021) and sepsis (3.4% vs. 1.1%; p = 0.012). Rates of stroke, perioperative myocardial infarction, ECMO/right-heart failure, re-thoracotomy, and postoperative dialysis were low and comparable across age groups (all p &gt; 0.20). Overall, 30-day mortality was 2.4% (24/990), with crude mortality approximately threefold higher among patients aged ≥70 years (4.6% vs. 1.6%). Conclusions: Our findings indicate that MIAVR is a feasible and safe surgical option across age groups; Elevated morbidity in elderly patients is primarily due to bleeding, pacemaker implantation, and sepsis, while rates of stroke, renal failure, and myocardial infarction are low."

Timely transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) may reverse these processes. Transfemoral access remains the primary access method for TAVR, but the limited technique restricts early intervention in patients with narrow femoral arteries. This study aimed to evaluate the safety and feasibility of a novel balloon dilation in sheath (BinS) technique designed to facilitate transfemoral TAVR in such patients. Methods This multicenter, prospective, and first-in-human early feasibility study included patients with severe AS and challenging femoral anatomy who underwent TAVR using the BinS technique between February 2023 and August 2024. The primary endpoint was the 30-day rate of major adverse events. The secondary endpoint was the rate of major adverse events at 6 months. The clinical endpoints included major post-procedural complications. Results Fifteen patients (mean age 73.5 ± 7.3 years; 66.7% male) were treated successfully with the BinS technique via transfemoral access. There were no cases of all-cause mortality, stroke/transient ischemic attack, or severe major vascular access site complications defined by Valve Academic Research Consortium (VARC)-3 at both 30 days and 6 months. No myocardial infarction or paravalvular leakage was observed. 12 patients obtained VARC-3 technical success. Two patients experienced postprocedural arterial dissection, and two developed new-onset conduction abnormalities (left bundle branch block or permanent pacemaker implantation). At 30 days, left ventricular ejection fraction improved significantly from 50.8 ± 17.0% pre-procedure to 59.9 ± 14.6% post-procedure ( p &amp;lt; 0.001). Conclusion The BinS technique appears to be a safe and effective method for enlarging the narrow femoral lumens during TAVR. By broadening transfemoral TAVR eligibility, this approach may permit earlier hemodynamic unloading, thereby mitigating adverse cardiac remodeling and potentially improving long-term outcomes. Larger, longer-term studies are warranted to confirm these findings."
OpenAlex,aortic stenosis,Outcomes of Surgical versus Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement: A Clinical Review,"Stang, Grace",,2026-01-01,Digital Commons - Gardner-Webb University (Gardner–Webb University),"Introduction: Surgical aortic valve replacement (SAVR) has been the predominant treatment for aortic stenosis (AS) for decades. However, transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) is becoming increasingly popular. Originally, TAVRs were only performed on patients who were deemed high-risk for surgery and would have died without the valve replacement. The purpose of this paper is to determine if TAVR or SAVR has better health outcomes for all patients no matter their surgical risk. Methods: A search via PubMed database was done using the key words “aortic stenosis”, “surgical aortic valve replacement”, “transcatheter aortic valve replacement”, and “mortality.” Additional search filters were applied for randomized control trials, systematic reviews, and meta- analyses. Dates were restricted to the last 5 years, and restrictions were added for English language and free full text only. This yielded 67 results and 5 were selected. Results: Of the five reviewed articles, all were meta-analyses and one systematic review. There was a total of 52122 patients. Primary endpoints across all articles were that there is no significant difference between TAVR and SAVR in the outcomes studied. Discussion: This review of studies provided supportive evidence that both TAVR and SAVR are valid treatment options or AS. TAVR had better short-term outcomes while SAVR had better long-term outcomes."

Kim; Dhir Gala; Mohammed Ayyad; Manaal Pramanik; Amgad N. Makaryus,10.3390/jcm15010316,2026-01-01,Journal of Clinical Medicine,"Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide, with ischemic and structural heart diseases being key contributors. While the 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) is a common low-cost diagnostic test, its interpretation is limited by human variability. Through machine learning with large diverse ECG data sets and artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms, ECG analysis can be automated for pattern recognition with higher accuracy. AI-augmented ECG algorithms have been demonstrated to be able to detect myocardial infarction with high accuracy and reduce door-to-balloon coronary intervention times. Similar models can be utilized to detect subtle ECG waveforms suggestive of current or future asymptomatic left ventricular dysfunction, aortic stenosis, and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. Despite these promising results, there is concern for generalizability and bias or errors in training data. As AI systems evolve to multimodal integration, AI-augmented ECG has the potential to redefine cardiovascular diagnostics and enable earlier detection, risk stratification, and precision-guided interventions."
OpenAlex,aortic stenosis,Prevalence &amp; Pattern of Coronary Artery Disease in Patients with Valvular Heart Disease Undergoing Pre-Operative Angiography,Muhammad Tariq Sallar; Javed Khurshed Shaikh; Fiyaz Hussain Mallah; Muhammad Hassan Butt; Muhammad Hashim Kalwar; Muhammad Ismail; Waqar Hussain; Jawaid Akbar Sial; Sidratul Muntaha,10.47144/phj.v58i4.3040,2026-01-01,Pakistan Heart Journal,"Objectives: This study aims to evaluate the prevalence and angiographic patterns of coronary artery disease (CAD) in patients diagnosed with valvular heart disease (VHD) undergoing preoperative coronary angiography. Emphasis is placed on the involvement of specific coronary vessels and the occurrence of multivessel disease across different types of valvular lesions. Methodology: A total of 335 patients, aged between 18 and 60 years, who had undergone coronary angiography prior to valve surgery, were retrospectively analyzed. CAD was defined as ≥50% stenosis in at least one major coronary artery. The prevalence and distribution of CAD were assessed in relation to various valvular pathologies, including aortic stenosis (AS), aortic regurgitation (AR), mitral stenosis (MS), and mitral regurgitation (MR). Results: The highest prevalence of CAD was found in patients with MR (85.7%) and AS (56.3%), with the left anterior descending (LAD) artery being the most frequently involved vessel. In contrast, isolated left circumflex (LCx) artery involvement was exclusively observed in patients with AR (100%). Three-vessel CAD (3VCAD) was most common among MR patients (85.7%). Combined LAD + LCx involvement was seen in 33.3% of cases, while MS showed a comparatively lower CAD prevalence. Left main (LM) artery involvement, although rare, was most frequently found in MS patients (16.7%). Conclusion: This study highlights a substantial burden and distinct angiographic patterns of CAD among VHD patients undergoing preoperative evaluation. Given the high prevalence, particularly among those with AS and MR, routine coronary angiography should be considered essential in pre-surgical assessment. Further large-scale studies are warranted to strengthen diagnostic and management protocols in local populations."

OpenAlex,aortic stenosis,Utility of Fetal Echocardiography in First-Degree Relatives with Bicuspid Aortic Valve and Normal Obstetric Ultrasound.,Alaa Ismail; Jena Schmidt; Elijah H. Bolin; Benjamin Ittleman,,2025-12-31,PubMed,"This study aimed to evaluate the diagnostic yield of fetal echocardiography (f-Echo) in detecting significant congenital heart disease (CHD) in pregnancies with a first-degree relative with a history of bicuspid aortic valve (BAV) and a normal level II obstetric ultrasound.A retrospective review was conducted of all f-Echos performed between 2019 and 2023 for the sole indication of family history of BAV. Cases with additional indications or affected nonfirst-degree relative were excluded. Postnatal transthoracic echocardiography (t-Echo) data were reviewed when available. Significant CHD was defined as requiring catheter or surgical intervention in the first year of life.Sixty-five f-Echos were included (mean gestational age: 26.6 ± 3.7 weeks). No significant CHD was identified prenatally. Postnatal t-Echo was performed in 41 (63%) cases, with no significant CHD detected. Two (5%) infants were diagnosed postnatally with BAV, neither requiring intervention during the study interval. Minor findings included one case each of pulmonary valve stenosis and atrial septal defect.In pregnancies with a first-degree relative with BAV and a normal obstetric ultrasound, f-Echo showed no added diagnostic value for detecting significant CHD. Based on the state's birth rate (approximately 35,000/year), BAV prevalence (1-2%), and an average family size of 3.08, an estimated 733 to 1,466 pregnancies annually in Arkansas could qualify for f-Echo under current guidelines. At a cost of $1,000 to 5,000 per study, this translates to an annual healthcare expenditure ranging from $733,000 to 7.33 million. These findings support more targeted screening and the need for multicenter studies. · No significant CHD detected with f-Echo.. · Postnatal t-Echo remains definitive.. · Routine f-Echo may add limited value.. · Cost implications warrant reconsideration."
OpenAlex,aortic stenosis,TAVI vs SAVR in severe aortic stenosis: A systematic review,Gökhan Ceyhun,10.63909/1453034,2025-12-31,Turkish Journal of Clinical Research,"Severe aortic stenosis (AS) represents a major burden among elderly patients, with high mortality once symptoms develop. Transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) has emerged as an alternative to surgical aortic valve replacement (SAVR), expanding from inoperable to low-risk populations. This systematic review compares short- and long-term outcomes between TAVI and SAVR in patients with severe AS. Following PRISMA 2020 guidelines, PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science were searched (2010–2025). Eligible randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and comparative cohorts reporting mortality, stroke, pacemaker, or valve durability were included. Twenty-one studies (16 RCTs, 5 registries; n≈23,000) were analyzed. Thirty-day mortality was similar (RR 0.94, 95% CI 0.82–1.07). TAVI reduced bleeding (RR 0.63) and acute kidney injury (RR 0.71) but increased pacemaker implantation (RR 2.46) and paravalvular leak (RR 3.32). Five-year results (PARTNER 3, NOTION) showed comparable survival and valve durability. TAVI provides equivalent survival and superior early recovery compared to SAVR, although conduction disturbances and leak remain limitations. SAVR remains preferred for younger or bicuspid patients pending longer durability data."
OpenAlex,aortic stenosis,Tuberculous Aortitis Masquerading as Takayasu Arteritis: A Diagnostic Tightrope in a TB-Endemic Region,Tooba Fatima Iram; Yusra Fatima Anam; Haroon Abdullah Shaheed; Rahul Kumar Agarwal; Naazira Begum,10.5195/ijms.2025.3747,2025-12-31,International Journal of Medical Students,"Background: Tuberculous aortitis is an exceptionally rare extrapulmonary manifestation of Mycobacterium tuberculosis, most often seen in TB-endemic areas. It typically presents with nonspecific symptoms and may closely mimic primary large-vessel vasculitis, particularly Takayasu arteritis. Differentiating between infectious and autoimmune causes of aortitis is critical, as the management pathways diverge significantly namely, anti-tubercular therapy (ATT) versus immunosuppression. This case illustrates the diagnostic complexity and clinical decision-making involved in distinguishing between the two in a high-risk patient. Case Presentation: A 50-year-old woman with a background of hypertension, type 2 diabetes mellitus, chronic atherosclerotic disease, and bilateral renal artery stenosis presented with a two-day history of vomiting and blurring of vision. She had no history of fever, claudication, stroke, postprandial pain, or chest discomfort. On examination, she had a striking discrepancy in blood pressure: 160/80 mmHg in the upper limbs and 80/50 mmHg in the lower limbs. Neurological and systemic examinations were otherwise unremarkable. Initial investigations revealed serum sodium of 119 mmol/L, creatinine of 1.5 mg/dL, and CRP of 21.6 mg/L. ANA was positive, while cANCA and pANCA were negative. CT brain showed chronic right parietal lacunar infarct. A CT aortogram revealed severe narrowing of the descending thoracic and abdominal aorta with &gt;90% stenosis of the coeliac artery, moderate superior mesenteric artery stenosis, and one-third occlusion of the left posterior tibial artery. These findings raised strong suspicion for Takayasu arteritis. However, PET-CT demonstrated metabolically active supraclavicular lymphadenopathy, and Mantoux testing was strongly positive. ESR and CRP showed a rising trend. While a lymph node biopsy was planned, general surgery deemed it inaccessible for sampling at the time. The patient had no systemic features suggestive of autoimmune vasculitis but did meet multiple criteria for large-vessel involvement with TB-related inflammatory markers and imaging findings. Given the constellation of features and the TB-endemic context, a presumptive diagnosis of tuberculous aortitis was made. Conclusion: This case highlights the diagnostic challenge of differentiating tuberculous aortitis from Takayasu arteritis, particularly in regions where tuberculosis is endemic. Radiological findings alone may be insufficient, as both conditions can involve extensive aortic and branch vessel narrowing. In such cases, adjunctive investigations—such as Mantoux testing, PET-CT imaging, inflammatory markers, and careful exclusion of systemic autoimmune features—are critical in guiding diagnosis and therapy. Timely recognition of tuberculous aortitis is vital to prevent inappropriate immunosuppression and its complications. Empirical initiation of ATT in clinically suggestive cases, even in the absence of histopathological confirmation, may be justified in high-burden settings when biopsy is not feasible. Clinicians must maintain a high index of suspicion and adopt a multidisciplinary approach to navigate such diagnostic tightropes.

Methodology: A consecutive sample of 212 adults (18–80 years) with echocardiographically confirmed AS was enrolled. Demographic characteristics, cardiovascular comorbidities, and family history were recorded. Valve morphology was assessed using transthoracic and, when required, transesophageal echocardiography, and BAV phenotypes were categorized as Type 1 (right–left), Type 2 (right–non-coronary), or Type 3 (left–non-coronary) cusp fusion. Data were analyzed using SPSS v23.0. Continuous variables were summarized as mean ± SD and categorical variables as n(%). Associations between BAV status and baseline variables were evaluated using Chi-square or Fisher’s exact tests with α = 0.05. Results: The mean age of participants was 49.77 ± 18.82 years, and the mean BMI was 26.14 ± 4.24 kg/m²; 58.0% were male. BAV was present in 75 of 212 patients (35.4%), while 137 (64.6%) had tricuspid valves. Among BAV cases, Type 1 was most frequent (48.0%), followed by Type 2 (38.7%) and Type 3 (13.3%). Hypertension, diabetes, hyperlipidemia, smoking, and family history of ischemic heart disease were reported in 52.8%, 47.2%, 40.6%, 39.6%, and 35.8% of participants, respectively. Socioeconomic and educational distributions were balanced. No demographic or clinical variable demonstrated a statistically significant association with BAV presence. Conclusion: Approximately one-third of AS patients had BAV, with right–left cusp fusion being the predominant subtype. BAV occurrence showed no significant association with demographic factors or conventional cardiovascular risk variables."

The objective of this substudy was to compare echocardiographic findings in women with severe aortic stenosis following surgical aortic valve replacement or TAVI. Methods At 48 European centers, 443 women underwent randomization 1:1, and 420 were treated as randomized. Echocardiograms were available in 356 patients and were analyzed by a core laboratory. Results Rates of or greater moderate paravalvular regurgitation was low (&lt;1%) and similar between groups. At 30 days, TAVI was associated with higher mean transprosthetic gradient and smaller aortic valve area, but the rate of severe patient–prosthesis mismatch (3.0 versus 2.6%; P =1) was low and not different between groups. Valve hemodynamics were stable at 1 year. The rate of residual left ventricular hypertrophy (45.3 versus 28.6%; P =0.004) at 1 year was significantly higher with TAVI, whereas the rate of right ventricular systolic dysfunction (14.5 versus 40.7%; P &lt;0.001) and evolution of cardiac damage stage (improved in 21.8 versus 18.1%; worsened in 16.8 versus 47.0%; P =0.001) were better with TAVI. Conclusions Among women with severe aortic stenosis, both TAVI and surgical aortic valve replacement achieve excellent valve hemodynamic results with low and similar rates of moderate or greater paravalvular regurgitation or severe patient–prosthesis mismatch. Surgical aortic valve replacement was associated with lower gradients and more pronounced regression of left ventricular hypertrophy, whereas TAVI was associated with better right ventricular systolic function and evolution of cardiac damage stage.

Makkar; Aakriti Gupta,10.1161/jaha.125.045417,2025-12-30,Journal of the American Heart Association,"Background Self‐expanding valves (SEVs) have demonstrated superior hemodynamic performance and comparable clinical outcomes to balloon‐expandable valves (BEVs) at 1 year in patients with a small aortic annulus. However, long‐term data are limited. This study aimed to evaluate 5‐year echocardiographic and clinical outcomes of SEVs versus BEVs in patients with small aortic annulus underwent transcatheter aortic valve replacement. Methods We analyzed RESOLVE registry patients who underwent transcatheter aortic valve replacement at Cedars‐Sinai between 2015 and 2020. Patients with a small aortic annulus (&lt;430 mm 2 by computed tomography) were included and followed for up to 5 years. The primary outcome was a composite of all‐cause mortality, stroke, or heart failure hospitalization. Secondary outcomes included myocardial infarction, pacemaker implantation, aortic valve reintervention, and structural bioprosthetic valve dysfunction. Results Among 1392 transcatheter aortic valve replacement recipients, 423 (78 SEVs, 345 BEVs) met the small annulus criteria. SEVs were associated with lower transvalvular gradients and larger indexed effective orifice area at discharge and 1 year ( P &lt;0.001). Moderate‐to‐severe paravalvular leak was more frequent with SEVs at 30 days (7.7% versus 1.5%, P &lt;0.001), as was permanent pacemaker implantation (17.9% versus 6.1%, P &lt;0.001). At 5 years, the primary outcome did not differ significantly (hazard ratio, 1.21; 95% CI, 0.81–1.82; P &lt;0.33). All‐cause mortality, stroke, heart failure hospitalization, structural bioprosthetic valve dysfunction, and reintervention rates were similar between groups. Conclusion Although SEVs provide better hemodynamic performance in patients with severe aortic stenosis and small annuli, this advantage did not translate into improved survival or reduced cardiovascular events at 5 years."
