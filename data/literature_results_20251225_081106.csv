Cardiovascular interventions,"Patients with severe aortic regurgitation (AR) frequently face high surgical risks, rendering them ineligible for surgery. Transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) is now a primary therapy for aortic valve stenosis. However, its application in pure native AR has been relatively limited.
The aim of this study was to evaluate the mid-term efficacy and safety of a novel self-expanding transfemoral TAVR device designed for treating pure native AR.
A prospective, single-arm clinical trial (ChiCTR2300075152) enrolled 110 consecutive patients with severe pure AR from 15 centers. The Pioneer Valve system with a rotatable feature and 3 independently angle-adjustable locators was used. Outcomes up to 1-year follow-up were reported per Valve Academic Research Consortium 3 criteria. The median clinical follow-up duration was 348 days (Q1-Q3: 342-357 days).
The mean age was 73.37 ± 4.21 years, with a median Society of Thoracic Surgeons score of 5.97% (Q1-Q3: 4.04%-8.63%). Technical success was achieved in 109 of 110 cases (99.1%), and valve migration occurred in 1 case. Mean aortic valve gradient and mean effective orifice area at 30 days were 7.88 ± 2.7 mm Hg and 2.2 ± 0.64 cm2, respectively. New permanent pacemaker implantation occurred in 23 of 105 cases (21.9%; 95% CI: 14.3%-29.8%). All-cause mortality was 3 of 110 (2.7%; 95% CI: 0.9%-8.3%) at 1 year. Significant improvements in NYHA functional class, Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire score, and positive left ventricular remodeling were observed up to 1 year.
This study demonstrates that the Pioneer Valve provides a safe and effective alternative for high-risk or inoperable patients with severe pure AR, achieving favorable mid-term outcomes with stable hemodynamic performance."

In this study, we designed a polysaccharide-based carrier (HF-AF) from fucoidan, featuring a dynamic supramolecular structure. A dynamic supramolecular network was established within this carrier via dynamic supramolecular interactions between hydroxypropyl-β-cyclodextrin and adamantane-methylamine. The anti-inflammatory compound tilianin, formulated into nanocrystals (Til NCs), was then encapsulated to create a shear-responsive nanosystem (HF-AF@Til NCs). The system's primary therapeutic strategy is its response to pathological hemodynamic forces: upon encountering high shear stress at a stenosis, the supramolecular network undergoes dissociation, triggering a mechanically-gated release of the encapsulated Til NCs. This shear-triggered function is complemented by the natural P-selectin affinity of the fucoidan backbone, which facilitates the anchoring of the nanocarrier at the inflamed lesion site. This sophisticated ""anchor-and-release"" mechanism enables superior drug accumulation precisely at plaque sites. In ApoE-/- atherosclerotic mice, HF-AF@Til NCs significantly reduced aortic lipid deposition and exerted potent anti-atherosclerotic effects by modulating macrophage polarization, inhibiting the NF-κ-B signaling pathway, and improving lipid profiles. In conclusion, this shear-responsive nanodelivery system, which leverages a targeting polysaccharide, effectively enhances drug accumulation and therapeutic efficacy at atherosclerotic lesions, demonstrating significant potential for the targeted therapy of atherosclerosis."

We perform a meta-analysis of reconstructed individual patient data to compare conservative treatment versus transcatheter or surgical aortic valve replacement (TAVR or SAVR) in asymptomatic AS.
PubMed/MEDLINE, Web of Science, Scopus, and Cochrane CENTRAL were systematically searched, through 25th September 2025, to identify any observational or randomized controlled studies that comply with our inclusion criteria. Our primary outcomes were short cardiovascular and non-cardiovascular mortality as well as long-term mortality. We combined aggregate data meta-analysis for dichotomous outcomes using incidence rate ratio (IRR) with reconstructed time-to-event data derived from published Kaplan-Meier curves using validated algorithms.
Seventeen studies were included. Overall, AVR was associated with a significantly lower risk of all-cause mortality compared with conservative management (IRR = 0.43; 95% CI, 0.32-0.57; p < 0.001). Cardiovascular mortality was also significantly reduced with AVR (IRR = 0.47; 95% CI, 0.29-0.75; p < 0.01; I2 = 62%). The risk of heart failure hospitalization was markedly lower among AVR recipients (IRR = 0.39; 95% CI, 0.22-0.67; p < 0.01), with consistent benefit across study designs. AVR was further associated with a substantial reduction in sudden cardiac death (IRR = 0.13; 95% CI, 0.04-0.48; p < 0.01) and myocardial infarction (IRR = 0.11; 95% CI, 0.04-0.31; p = 0.03). The risk of stroke was not significantly different between groups (IRR = 0.77; 95% CI, 0.58-1.02; p = 0.07). Reconstructed Kaplan-Meier analyses demonstrated durable long-term survival benefit with AVR, consistent across surgical and transcatheter approaches.
Patients with asymptomatic AS, managed with either SAVR or TAVR, were associated with lower short- and long-term mortality compared to conservative management."

This study evaluates the reproducibility of virtual non-contrast (VNC) reconstructions at different slice intervals using photon-counting detector CT (PCD-CT). Methods: In this retrospective study, we included 279 consecutive patients, who underwent PCD-CT for evaluation of native aortic valve between February 2023 and December 2023 with both TNC and VNC images at 3.0 and 1.5 mm slice intervals. Aortic valve calcium score (AVCS) and aortic valve calcium volume (AVCV) were compared between the two methods using paired t-tests. Agreement for continuous variables was assessed using inter-class coefficients (ICCs). Cohen's Kappa (κ) was calculated to evaluate the agreement between different modalities in diagnosing severe AV calcification. Results: Compared to the standard, TNC images at 1.5 mm intervals showed higher AVCS (mean difference: -290 ± 418, p < 0.001), with high reproducibility between techniques (CS: ICC 0.969, [IQR 0.962, 0.975]). Compared with reference, VNC showed no significant differences in AVCS at either slice intervals, with excellent reproducibility (3.0 mm, ICC 0.970 [0.963, 0.976]; 1.5 mm, ICC 0.971 [0.964, 0.977]). Compared to TNC 3.0 mm, strong concordance was observed using other reconstruction techniques in assessing severe AV calcification (κ = 0.81 [95% CI: 0.74-0.88], 0.83 [95% CI: 0.76-0.90], and 0.83 [95% CI: 0.76-0.90] for TNC at 1.5 mm, VNC at 3.0 mm, and 1.5 mm, respectively), with low misclassification rates. Conclusions: Our study highlights high reproducibility in the evaluation of AVCS by VNC reconstruction at 3.0 and 1.5 mm intervals compared with reference offering a reliable alternative with an excellent diagnostic accuracy."

Fatty acids (FAs) play a crucial role in these processes. A treatment option for severe symptomatic AS in elderly and high-risk patients is transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI).
To investigate the change in FA profiles in patients undergoing TAVI.
This single-center prospective study included 25 patients with severe AS qualified for TAVI procedure. Blood samples were collected before TAVI and after six months. FA profiles were analyzed by gas chromatography-electron ionization mass spectrometry.
Notable changes were identified in FA profiles, including a reduction in docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) levels (117 ± 48.0 µM vs. 141 ± 53.0 µM, p = 0.001) and an increase in alpha-linolenic acid (ALA) concentration (32.8 ± 12.3 µM vs. 19.9 ± 6.40 µM, p = 0.003) six months post-TAVI. Additionally, significant elevations were noted in specific medium-chain FAs (C12) and branched-chain fatty acids (iso C16, iso C17 and anteiso C15, anteiso C17) at six months after TAVI. However, total n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (n3 PUFA) levels decreased (p = 0.039), while n-6 polyunsaturated fatty acids (n6 PUFA) levels exhibited no significant overall change at this time point. Decrease in mean pressure gradient (PG) was negatively correlated with eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), DHA, n-3 docosapentaenoic acid (DPA n3) and n3 PUFA levels in a six-month observation.
Our results underscore the complex interplay between cardiac intervention and FA changes, providing novel insights into the metabolic impact of TAVI on FAs serum profile."

Over the past decades, open-heart mitral valve surgery has been the gold-standard intervention for this complex disorder, but in recent years, transcatheter edge-to-edge repair has emerged as a valuable option in selected clinical scenarios. However, a considerable proportion of patients develop recurrent mitral regurgitation during follow-up, leading to a significant increase in morbidity and mortality. In this context, data is limited regarding the optimal approach. This review provides an overview of the current evidence on transcatheter mitral valve intervention therapies for the management of recurrent mitral regurgitation following transcatheter edge-to-edge repair."

Transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) has emerged as a minimally invasive and effective alternative to surgical replacement, especially in elderly or high-risk patients. Objectives: The present study aims to assess the influence of the tricuspid annular plane systolic excursion (TAPSE)/pulmonary systolic arterial pressure (PASP) ratio on clinical outcomes in patients with aortic stenosis undergoing TAVR and offer valuable insights into patient selection and tailored management strategies for individuals undergoing TAVR. Methods: A retrospective analysis was conducted on 100 patients with AS who underwent TAVR, included in two distinct groups based on their median TAPSE/PASP ratio. Results: Patients were divided according to their median TAPSE/PASP ratio into two groups. Those with lower TAPSE/PASP ratios had a higher incidence of post-procedural atrial fibrillation (AF) (48% vs. 28%, p = 0.0404), lower left-ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) (41.06% vs. 49.50%, p < 0.0001), a more pronounced inflammatory and hematologic response, and longer hospitalization. Receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) analysis demonstrated modest but significant discrimination rather than high sensitivity or specificity for postprocedural arrhythmias, particularly atrial fibrillation. Conclusions: TAPSE/PASP should be regarded as a clinically useful risk-stratification marker in patients with AS undergoing TAVR, enabling the identification of high-risk patients and optimizing peri-procedural management."

We aim to determine whether G2 valves reduce these specific complications and thereby improve patient outcomes compared with G1. Methods: From February 2015 to September 2022, 1468 patients underwent TAVR at the university clinic in Kiel. After applying exclusion criteria, a final cohort of 1182 patients were analysed. Among these, 782 patients underwent TAVR with G1, whereas 400 underwent TAVR with G2. The primary study endpoints were the occurrence of new CD and PPMI within 30 days post-procedure. The secondary endpoints included diverse post-TAVR events as defined by the safety criteria of Valve Academic Research Consortium 3 (VARC III). A statistical analysis compared outcomes between the G1 and G2 groups. Results: Out of 1182 patients, 12.1% required PPMI within 30 days. Rates showed no statistical difference between G2 and G1 for PPMI (10.3% vs. 13.0%, IPTW-weighted p = 0.31) or CD (15.3% vs. 21.48%, IPTW-weighted p = 0.08). Among G2, the Sapien 3 Ultra valve had the lowest PPMI rate (4.8%). Overall, G2 and G1 had similar post-procedural and 30-day mortality rates. Conclusion: G2 valves may reduce post-procedure CD, but the difference is not statistically significant. Differences between specific valve types-such as the Sapien 3 Ultra's lower rates-are notable, but overall, PPMI and safety profiles remain similar between G1 and G2. Patient and procedural factors still play a significant role. Careful valve and patient selection is essential, and ongoing research will guide further improvements."
PubMed,aortic stenosis,A myosin hypertrophic cardiomyopathy mutation disrupts the super-relaxed state and boosts contractility by enhanced actin attachment.,Robert C Cail; Bipasha Barua; Faviolla A Báez-Cruz; Donald A Winkelmann; Yale E Goldman; E Michael Ostap,10.1073/pnas.2521561122,2025-12-30,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,"Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is a leading cause of cardiac failure among individuals under 35. Many genetic mutations that cause HCM seem to enhance ventricular systolic function, suggesting that these HCM mutations are hypercontractile. Among the most common causes of HCM are mutations in the gene MYH7, which encodes for β-cardiac myosin, the principal human ventricular myosin. Previous work has demonstrated that, for purified myosins, some MYH7 mutations are gain-of-function while others cause reduced function, so how they lead to enhanced contractility is not clear. Here, we have characterized the mechanics and kinetics of the severe HCM-causing mutation M493I. Motility assays demonstrate a 70% reduction of actin filament gliding velocities on M493I-coated surfaces relative to wild type (WT). This mutation slows ADP release from actomyosin•ADP fivefold without affecting phosphate release or ATP binding. Yet it enhances steady-state ATPase Vmax twofold. Through single-molecule mechanical studies, we find that M493I myosin has a normal working stroke of 5 nm but a significantly prolonged actin attachment duration. Under isometric feedback, M493I myosins produce high, sustained force, with an actin detachment rate that is less sensitive to force than that of WT myosin. We also report direct measurement of the equilibrium state of the super-relaxed to disordered relaxed regulatory transition and show its disruption in M493I, with a concomitant enhancement to actin attachment kinetics. Together, these data demonstrate that enhanced myosin binding from inhibition of myosin's off state, combined with slow ADP release and enhanced force production, underlie the enhanced function and etiology of this HCM mutation."

The triglyceride-glucose (TyG) index, an insulin-resistance marker from routine triglyceride and glucose levels, may flag high-risk patients in Ashkenazi-Jewish and Mediterranean individuals. We examined whether baseline TyG predicts all-cause mortality at 30 days, 1 year, and 3 years post-TAVR.
We retrospectively studied patients with severe symptomatic aortic stenosis who underwent TAVR at a single tertiary center between 2010 and 2024. The TyG index was calculated from baseline triglyceride and glucose values. The primary endpoint was all-cause mortality at 1 year, with secondary endpoints of all-cause mortality at 30 days and 3 years. Cox proportional hazards models evaluated the association between TyG (per 1-unit increase) and mortality, adjusting for major clinical risk factors. Additionally, ROC curves were used to derive cohort-specific TyG thresholds for short-term and long-term mortality.
Results: A total of 821 TAVR patients were included. All-cause mortality was 3.4 % at 30 days, 10.9 % at 1 year, and 19.7 % at 3 years. Higher baseline TyG was associated with significantly increased mortality risk at all time points. After multivariable adjustment, each 1-unit increase in TyG index conferred a higher hazard of 1-year death (adjusted HR 1.62, 95 % CI 1.21-2.16) and remained predictive of mortality at 30 days (HR 1.92, 95 % CI 1.08-3.42) and 3 years (HR 1.42, 95 % CI 1.14-1.77). ROC analysis identified distinct TyG thresholds for short-term and long-term outcomes, with an optimal cut-point of 9.012 for 30-day mortality, 9.15 for 1-year mortality, and 8.700 for 3-year mortality.
Baseline TyG index is an independent predictor of early, short-term, and long-term mortality after TAVR. The identification of cohort-specific TyG cut-points highlights population-specific metabolic risk calibration and supports the use of TyG as a simple and informative biomarker for refining risk stratification and follow-up intensity in TAVR recipients."

However, in vulnerable individuals such as the elderly and immunocompromised, it may result in severe lower respiratory tract involvement, including acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). This report presents a rare case of HCoV-HKU1-induced ARDS with multi-organ complications.
A 70-year-old man with hypertension, type 2 diabetes mellitus, and recent abdominal aortic aneurysm repair presented with progressive dyspnea and intermittent hemoptysis. On examination, he exhibited tachypnea, hypoxemia, and bilateral basilar crackles. Laboratory workup showed leukocytosis, anemia, acute kidney injury, and elevated inflammatory markers. Despite supportive therapy, his condition worsened, requiring intubation for severe ARDS. A nasopharyngeal respiratory PCR panel was positive for HCoV-HKU1. He received empirical broad-spectrum antibiotics, corticosteroids, and Remdesivir. His respiratory status improved, allowing extubation. However, his hospital course was complicated by worsening renal function requiring dialysis and new-onset chest pain with elevated troponin levels. Coronary angiography revealed 60 % proximal left circumflex artery stenosis. After a month-long hospitalization, he was discharged but remained dialysis-dependent.
This case emphasizes that HCoV-HKU1 can cause life-threatening ARDS and systemic complications in elderly patients with comorbidities. Given its potential for severe outcomes, it should be considered in the differential diagnosis of viral pneumonia and ARDS, particularly when other pathogens are excluded. Prompt identification and aggressive supportive management are vital, though long-term sequelae such as dialysis dependence may persist despite clinical recovery."

A 78-year-old hypertensive man, ex-smoker, underwent transfemoral TAVI with an Evolut™ R 34 mm prosthesis for severe symptomatic aortic stenosis. Postprocedural echocardiography revealed moderate-to-severe PVL. A percutaneous closure attempt with 2 Amplatzer™ Vascular Plugs under unfractionated heparinization (maximum ACT 250 s; total dose 8000 IU) failed to resolve the leak. Eighteen hours later, he developed right flank pain. CT (arterial and venous phases; 120 kVp; 1.25 mm slices) revealed a 9.4 × 6.8 cm right perirenal hematoma (52 HU) with retroperitoneal extension and no active extravasation. Despite initial stability, he became hypotensive (88/54 mmHg) with hemoglobin drop (9.0 → 6.0 g/dL). Renal arteriography confirmed no active bleeding. He received 3 units of PRBCs, Hb stabilized at 9.5 g/dL, and creatinine peaked at 1.4 mg/dL before normalization. Conservative management led to full recovery. Follow-up imaging (ultrasound at 6 weeks, CT and angiotomography at 3 months) confirmed hematoma resolution, preserved renal function, and normal blood pressure. This case underscores WS as a rare and atypical complication of structural cardiac intervention under procedural anticoagulation. Vigilant monitoring, multimodal imaging, and multidisciplinary collaboration are vital for successful conservative management and for excluding occult renal lesions."

In addition, Microvascular Resistance Reserve (MRR) is a new index that further permits the characterization of coronary microcirculatory function. It can be calculated from resting and hyperemic absolute coronary flow and resistance, measured during continuous thermodilution. By being independent of both epicardial disease and myocardial mass, MRR is highly specific for the microvascular compartment. Measurement of absolute flow, resistance, and MRR by continuous thermodilution has been shown to be accurate and reproducible, with minimal operator interference. In conjunction with the measurement of absolute flow and resistance, MRR could become the index of reference for the diagnosis of coronary microvascular disease and the evaluation of new therapies.

The association of AS-related cerebral impairment with cardiac remodeling and its prognostic impact remains unclear, prompting exploration of integrated cardio-cerebral assessment preliminarily.
Patients with moderate-to-severe aortic stenosis (AS) undergoing surgery at The First Affiliated Hospital of Guangxi Medical University (June 2021-December 2024) were enrolled (n = 384). Patients were stratified into a cerebral hypoperfusion/embolism group (n = 146) and an event-free group (n = 238) based on the presence or absence of preoperative cerebral impairment due to severe AS-related hemodynamic compromise or embolic events. Preoperative clinical/echocardiographic and surgical data were collected. The composite primary endpoint was major adverse cardiac events (MACE) (malignant arrhythmia, heart failure rehospitalization, or all-cause death). Multivariate regression identified predictors of AS-related cerebral impairment and MACE risk factors. The C-index assessed the cardio-cerebral integrated model's prognostic value.
The cerebral hypoperfusion/embolism group showed more pronounced left atrial (LA) and left ventricular (LV) remodeling. Multivariate logistic regression linked enlarged ascending aorta, left heart remodeling (increased LA size, elevated E/e' ratio, decreased LV global longitudinal strain and LA reservoir strain), reduced cardiac output (CO), and pulmonary artery systolic pressure to AS-related cerebral impairment (all p < 0.05). Over an 18-month median follow-up, 79 MACE occurred. Adjusted multivariate Cox analysis confirmed AS-related cerebral impairment as an independent MACE predictor (hazard ratio, 2.24 [95% CI: 2.13, 3.44]; p < 0.001). The cardio-cerebral integrated model (clinical + echo + ischemia) demonstrated superior MACE prediction (C-index, 0.862; likelihood ratio, 62.12) vs. clinical-only (C-index, 0.631; likelihood ratio, 19.32; both p < 0.001) or clinical + echo models (C-index, 0.757; likelihood ratio, 46.34; both p < 0.001).
AS-related cerebral impairment independently correlates with cardiac remodeling and adverse outcomes. Integrated cardio-cerebral assessment enhances risk stratification."

The difference between the ABI on both sides (∆ABI) was defined as the absolute value of the left ABI minus the right ABI. Lower BAI (L-BAI) was defined as the value of the side with the lowest BAI. We obtained four-limb blood pressure measurement data from 6435 patients. AS and bilateral lower-extremity arterial stenosis (BLEAS) were diagnosed. The performance of combined bilateral ABI decline, ΔABI, and L-BAI in diagnosing AS was evaluated. The control group showed normal bilateral ABI values, whereas the AS and BLEAS groups exhibited a bilateral ABI decline. The BLEAS group had the highest ∆ABI compared to the other groups. L-BAI in the BLEAS and AS groups was higher than that in the control group.

Validation in 1004 patients revealed a sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value, and accuracy of 90.0%, 96.0%, 54.2%, 99.5%, and 95.7%, respectively. In conclusion, combining bilateral ABI ≤0.90, ∆ABI ≤0.10, and L-BAI >1.00 can effectively screen for AS; this is useful in distinguishing AS from BLEAS, especially in cases of bilateral decline in lower-extremity ABI values."

While surgical aortic valve replacement (SAVR) remains the standard of care in low surgical-risk patients, transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) is increasingly used as a treatment alternative with favorable outcomes in well-selected BAV patients. To date, randomized controlled trials comparing TAVI and SAVR have excluded patients with BAV, except the UK TAVI and the more recent The NOrdic Aortic Valve IntervenTION-2 trial. Of note, in The NOrdic Aortic Valve IntervenTION-2 trial, there was a numerical imbalance in the BAV subgroup, with more events observed in the TAVI group than in the SAVR group for the composite outcome (all-cause mortality, stroke, and rehospitalization) at 1- and 3-year follow-up, although the risk estimates were imprecise due to the limited number of events. The upcoming TraNscatheter Aortic Valve Implantation versus surGical AorTic valvE replacement in patients with Bicuspid aortic valve stenosis (NAVIGATE Bicuspid) and Bicuspid aortic valve replacement: EvaLuatIon of transcathetEr VERsus Surgery (BELIEVERS) trials will directly compare TAVI and SAVR in BAV populations. These trials are designed to provide robust, adequately powered estimates of the comparative safety and effectiveness of both interventions over extended follow-up and are expected to inform future guideline recommendations in the setting of BAV anatomy. This review summarizes current data on the use of TAVI in patients with severe BAV stenosis, evaluates anatomical and procedural complexities, and outlines the design and rationale of upcoming randomized controlled trials addressing this critical knowledge gap."

Diseases that were previously considered only with surgical treatment options are now treated percutaneously with high success rates. However, devices used in this fields are referred to being used in an off-labeled fashion, as they were not originally developed for this purpose. This is the result of many factors among which the broad spectrum morphological and clinical expression of CHD.
The aim of this paper is to describe the prevalence, types of procedures and outcomes of the off-label use of implantable devices and stents in the CHD patient's interventional procedure in our center.
A retrospective data involving all patients who were referred to congenital and structural heart disease unit in our institution for catheter based interventional procedures in the last 4 years based on our medical records. Patients' demographic data, diagnosis, procedural data, type of devices used, follow-up data and incidence of major and minor complications were recorded to calculate the success and incidence of complications in this cohort of patient.
A total number of 410 patients underwent a percutaneous interventional procedure with the use of an off-label device or stent, out of a total of 2530 interventional procedure during the last 4 years, accounting for approximately 21.5% of all device and stents implanted during this period. The mean age of patients was 6.70 ± 4.47 years, the mean body weight was 18 0.3 +/- 8.5 kg. The procedures were versatile and included Ventricular septal defect (VSD) closure, Persistent ductus arteriosus (PDA) closure, aorto-pulmonary (AP) collaterals embolization, coronary arteriovenous (AV) fistula closure, veno-venous collaterals closure, pulmonary AV malformation closure, PDA stenting, and right ventricular outflow tract (RVOT) stenting. Implantable devices were used in 360 patients (87.8%) while Stents were implanted off-label in 50 patients (12.2%). Device-related complications were reported in 13 patients: seven major complications (device embolization in 3 cases, stent malposition in 2 and stent embolization in another 2 patients) and 6 minor complications ( mild left pulmonary artery stenosis, mild tricuspid and aortic valve regurgitation, residual VSD with hemolysis, incomplete arteriovenous malformations closure, late onset of arrhythmias and late device related thrombus formation). There were four deaths (0,97%). Overall success rate in this patient's cohort was 96.9% all over a period of 12 months follow up for the patients.
Considerable percentage of patients with CHD undergoing transcatheter interventional percutaneous procedures with off-label implantation of devices or stents. These procedures have high success rate and relatively low incidence of complications. So Longer term follow-up is needed in order to establish safety and effectiveness of these off-label procedures in congenital heart defects."

The Sorin Soprano aortic bioprosthetic valve (Sorin Group/LivaNova, Milan, Italy) lacks reported long-term results. This study aims to establish the long-term durability of this bioprosthetic valve in a nationwide cohort.
All patients having received the Soprano bioprosthesis during aortic valve replacement in Sweden between 2005 and 2013 were included in the study. Patient characteristics, outcomes, and echocardiographic data were collected using national registries and electronic medical records. Standardized guidelines were used to assess echocardiographic data for the presence of severe structural valve deterioration.
A total of 1054 patients (mean age 73.3 years) were included, with 14.0% being ≤65 years at surgery. The Soprano bioprosthesis represented 9.5% of all implanted bioprostheses. During a mean follow-up of 8.6 ± 4.5 years, 206 patients (19.5%) developed severe structural valve deterioration. The cumulative incidence of severe structural valve deterioration at 1-, 5-, 7-, 10-, and 15 years was 0.5%, 3.1%, 7.4%, 13.7%, and 22.1% in the overall population. The cumulative incidence of structural valve deterioration-related reinterventions at 1-, 5-, 7-, 10-, and 15 years was 0%, 0.9%, 3.0%, 7.2%, and 11.5%. The 30-day mortality rate was 3.8%.
The Soprano bioprosthesis demonstrates high long-term rates of severe structural valve deterioration and deterioration-related reinterventions. These findings suggest the need for increased clinical vigilance and for more frequent echocardiographic monitoring in patients having received this bioprosthetic valve."

Medical therapy alone is insufficient, and either TEER (transcatheter edge to edge) or surgery is recommended. Short- and long-term comparative outcomes remain unclear. We aim to address this gap using available data.
We performed a meta-analysis of studies examining the outcomes of surgery and/or transcatheter edge to edge. MEDLINE, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Library were assessed. The incidence rate of late severe MR was the primary outcome. A random model was performed. Leave-one-out, subgroup, and meta-regression analyses were conducted.
Thirty-two studies (1923 patients); 20 in surgery [1166] vs 12 in TEER [757]) were selected. TEER patients were, on average, 10 years older, with twice the rate of NYHA III/IV symptoms and more than double the STS score. At a weighted mean follow-up of 3.2 years, compared to isolated transcatheter, surgery was associated with decreased incidence of late severe mitral regurgitation (2.53 vs 6.66 events per 100 person-years, P-interaction = 0.03), late all-cause mortality (3.00 vs 8.84, P-interaction = 0.024), late heart failure hospitalization (4.44 vs 17.03, P-interaction < 0.01), and late NYHA III/IV (2.98 vs 22.47, P-interaction < 0.01). However, significantly better long-term outcomes associated with surgery showed high heterogeneity. There were no differences in early all-cause mortality, early cardiac-specific mortality, late cardiac-specific mortality, postprocedural morbidities nor atrial diameter. On meta-regression, preprocedural heart failure (Beta = 0.0224, P < 0.01) and coronary artery disease (Beta = 0.0294, P < 0.00001) were linked to increased late severe mitral regurgitation. Older age, hypertension, mitral valve replacement, and associated aortic valve surgery were linked to increased late all-cause mortality.
Surgery and isolated transcatheter edge-to-edge repair showed comparable short-term outcomes, with surgery appearing more effective long-term; however, due to study limitations and heterogeneity, these findings are hypothesis-generating and require validation through prospective studies."

Understanding the mechanism of MR, whether primary, due to intrinsic valve abnormalities, or secondary, resulting from atrial or ventricular remodeling, is essential for optimal management. Echocardiography, particularly advanced modalities such as three-dimensional imaging and strain analysis, plays a central role in this process. It allows accurate quantification of MR severity, detailed characterization of valve and ventricular anatomy, and assessment of remodeling, all of which are critical for determining the optimal timing for intervention. Beyond diagnosis, echocardiography is indispensable in guiding therapy selection: it informs surgical planning by defining leaflet pathology for repair versus replacement strategies, and directs transcatheter interventions by guiding interatrial septal puncture, catheter orientation, and device deployment in real time. While surgery remains the gold standard for primary MR, transcatheter approaches including edge-to-edge repair and emerging mitral valve replacement are increasingly relevant, particularly in patients at high surgical risk or with complex anatomy. This review emphasizes the pivotal role of echocardiography in the pre-procedural assessment of MR, highlighting its ability to integrate anatomical, functional, and hemodynamic information to guide patient-tailored therapeutic strategies and optimize outcomes within a Heart Team framework."

A substantial portion of patients with cardiogenic shock have concomitant severe mitral regurgitation (MR), which exacerbates hemodynamic instability by reducing forward cardiac output and contributes to pulmonary edema and respiratory failure through regurgitant backflow. In this high-risk setting, mitral transcatheter edge-to-edge repair (M-TEER) offers a minimally invasive treatment that can lead to hemodynamic and symptomatic improvement and potential mortality benefit. Initially indicated for patients with severe MR at prohibitive surgical risk, M-TEER is now guideline-supported for both primary and secondary MR in select populations. Emerging data suggest that M-TEER can reduce heart failure hospitalizations and improve patient quality of life. As clinical indications for M-TEER continue to expand, there is growing interest in the role of M-TEER as a stabilizing intervention in patients with cardiogenic shock and severe MR. This review aims to synthesize the current evidence surrounding the use of M-TEER in cardiogenic shock with a focus on patient selection, procedural and clinical considerations, and short- and long-term outcomes."

Several different transcatheter approaches were developed as therapeutic options in high-risk patients. Among them, the Carillon® Mitral Contour System, which offers a minimally invasive, trans- coronary-venous approach to indirect annuloplasty that reduces annular dimensions and improves leaflet coaptation without the need for transseptal access or manipulation of the mitral valve apparatus. A key advantage of Carillon lies in its extracardiac, leaflet-sparing mechanism. By acting from the lumen of coronary sinus and great cardiac vein, the device preserves the possibility of future interventions such as transcatheter edge-to-edge repair, direct annuloplasty, or even valve replacement, while still allowing successful placement of left ventricular pacing leads for cardiac resynchronization therapy. The current article provides the Carillon device characteristics and technical aspects of implantation procedure. The paper is an overview of the clinical studies and real-world registries conducted on the Carillon device, and the effectiveness of this treatment for functional mitral regurgitation. We also discuss possible future perspectives of the Carillon device applications like treating patients with mild FMR, in combination with other treatment modalities, approaches or atrial form of FMR."

This retrospective study included 67 individuals who underwent isolated, elective mitral valve repair with neochordae between 2019 and 2024. Participants were divided into the RAFF (n = 36) and non-RAFF (n = 31) groups. In the RAFF technique, chordal length is determined by referencing the anterior leaflet chordae from the ipsilateral papillary muscle, with loop sets anchored to the frontal head of the papillary muscle. Leaflet resection was not performed in any case. Baseline demographics and lesion characteristics were similar between groups. The RAFF group demonstrated significantly less residual mitral regurgitation at the conclusion of surgery (p = 0.014). Use of the RAFF method was significantly associated with suppression of postoperative leaflet billowing and a lower recurrence rate of moderate or greater mitral regurgitation during follow-up. Frontal fixation of posterior leaflet neochordae, a defining feature of the technique, resulted in a significant increase in coaptation length without inducing systolic anterior motion or elevating transvalvular gradients. The method also significantly reduced aortic cross-clamp time without compromising hemodynamic performance. The RAFF technique offers a standardized and anatomically guided approach to neochordae reconstruction. It minimizes inter-surgeon variability and anatomical inconsistencies, and promotes durable mitral competence by optimizing leaflet coaptation without incurring adverse events."

The high intensity echogenic mobile mass extended from the sub-valvular tissue to the papillary tendon. The differential diagnosis of this mass included a caseous calcification of the mitral annulus (CCMA), and intra-cardiac thrombus or tumor. Computed tomography imaging features were consistent with CCMA. Anticoagulation was administered for one month to rule out thrombus and to prevent systemic thromboembolism. The size of this mobile mass did not change but the severity of mitral regurgitation worsened from mild to moderate during the month. Surgical treatment was performed to prevent thromboembolism and treat mitral regurgitation. A biological mitral valve and tricuspid annular ring were implanted. The histopathologic examination of the excised mobile mass revealed fibrinous material with calcification.

Adults undergoing TV repair/replacement were identified in the 2016-2021 National Inpatient Sample. Patients undergoing heart transplantation, ventricular assist device placement, or with endocarditis were excluded. Study cohorts were stratified based on Isolated vs concomitant TV surgery (TV-Mitral, TV-Aortic, TV-coronary artery bypass grafting [CABG]). Multivariable mixed regressions were developed to evaluate the association of concomitant surgery with major adverse events including mortality and complications, costs, and length of stay.
Of 51,940 patients, 19.2% underwent Isolated TV, 47.2% TV-Mitral, 14.6% TV-Aortic, and 19.0% TV-CABG operations. The volume of Isolated TV procedures significantly increased from 1415 in 2016 to 1830 in 2021 (P = .001). Compared with Isolated TV, patients undergoing concomitant operations were older with greater burden of comorbidities. TV-CABG and TV-Aortic patients experienced higher major adverse event rates of 67.6% and 56.5%, respectively, compared with 46.1% and 50.1% among TV-Mitral and Isolated TV (P < .001). Furthermore, TV-CABG and TV-Aortic cohorts experienced greater length of stay, costs, and nonhome discharge relative to TV-Mitral and Isolated TV, which were comparable. After adjustment, major adverse event rates significantly decreased over time among TV-CABG and remained stable among all other groups.
Utilization of isolated tricuspid surgery is rising, with comparable complications and resource use relative to concomitant mitral operations. Given the lack of improvement in postoperative morbidity over time, further optimization of tricuspid surgical timing is warranted."

A fatal drug interaction of linezolid and warfarin was reported in this case, highlighting the close monitoring of international normalized ratio (INR) when co-administering these drugs.
A 62-year-old female with severe mitral stenosis (MS) and moderate mitral regurgitation (MR) was diagnosed with mitral valve vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus (VRE) infective endocarditis (IE) (the diagnosis was made based on clinical presentation, positive blood cultures, and echocardiographic evidence fulfilling the modified Duke criteria) AF, and acute kidney injury (AKI). The AKI was resolved during the hospital stay. The patient was on the valvular surgery list and was discharged on oral linezolid and warfarin. The patient was on follow-up compliance with restricted diet through INR online services, and INR was also monitored through the well-established INR clinic. Ten days postdischarge, she presented with worsening dyspnea, bruising, hematuria, abdominal distension, and bilateral leg swelling. On admission, she was on rapid AF, severe metabolic acidosis, hyperkalemia, and coagulopathy (INR 12). Given her adherence to warfarin and the absence of other interacting factors, the coagulopathy was suspected to be due to a warfarin-linezolid interaction. Despite management with IV vitamin K and fresh frozen plasma (FFP), she developed refractory AKI, hyperkalemia, and multiorgan failure, leading to death.
This case highlights the potential for severe coagulopathy when warfarin and linezolid are co-administered and underscores the importance of close and frequent INR monitoring."

The sensitivity of handheld parasternal long axis color Doppler imaging for the detection of ≥ moderate MR was poor (38% 95% CI 8.5% − 75.5%). PPV and NPV ranged from 25% to 60% and 91.9%-98.9%, across a range of potential disease prevalence rates. There was poor agreement between handheld ultrasound and TTE derived MR grade (weighted kappa 0.08, 95% CI -0.01–0.17). There was modest correlation between assigned grades by each imaging method (Spearman r = 0.41, p < 0.001).
Limited handheld color Doppler imaging has limited value in screening for significant mitral regurgitation. Routine assessment of handheld imaging protocols proposed for cardiac disease detection are needed.

This study evaluates long-term outcomes of functional TR in TAVR patients.
All patients undergoing TAVR at a single institution from 2011-2022 with complete pre- and post-TAVR echocardiogram follow-up were stratified by pre-procedure TR grade (none, mild, moderate, or severe). Primary outcomes were TR improvement or persistence/progression, and long-term survival. Time-to-event analysis and Cox proportional hazards models were used to compare long-term mortality. Median time to most recent post-TAVR echocardiogram was 12 months, and median clinical follow-up was 24 months.
Of 1,668 TAVR patients in the study cohort, 55% (925) had TR of any severity. TR persisted in 70% of these patients though few ever underwent later TR intervention. Moderate-severe TR was found in 20% (331) patients and persisted or worsened in 47% of cases. Moderate-severe TR was associated with worse unadjusted median survival when compared to patients with no-mild TR (median survival 39 vs. 62 months, p<0.001). Adjusting for age, sex, surgical risk, and other non-cardiac and cardiac comorbidities including mitral regurgitation, moderate-to-severe TR was an independent predictor of worse survival (HR 1.39, p=0.004, Figure 1).
Degree of tricuspid regurgitation is unlikely to improve following TAVR. Moderate-severe TR was a predictor of worse long-term survival. The presence of concurrent moderate or severe TR should be considered when deciding between transcatheter and surgical approaches."

However, limited data is currently available in pediatric population, partially due to increased technical challenges in this subgroup of patients.
From December 2018 through December 2024, 63 patients with oHCM aged 5 to 18 years underwent conventional septal myectomy (CSM, n=28) or transapical beating-heart septal myectomy (TA-BSM, n=35). All patients had clinical and multimodality imaging evaluations before operation and at follow-up.
Two groups of patients had largely similar baseline clinical characteristics. The median age of patients was 14 (IQR: 11-16) years, and 18 of them (28.6%) were female. The median preoperative left ventricular outflow tract (LVOT) gradient was 58 (IQR: 32-85) mmHg. Around 55.6% of the patients had more than moderate mitral regurgitation (MR, CSM n=12, TA-BSM n=23). Both approaches demonstrated equivalent efficacy for eliminating LVOT obstruction, with a median postoperative LVOT gradient of 8 and 10 mmHg (p=0.852) in the CSM and TA-BSM groups, respectively. The degree of MR decreased to ≤ mild upon follow-up in 9 (75% of 12) in the CSM group, and 20 (87% of 23) in the TA-BSM group (p=0.223). Compared to those in the CSM group, patients in the TA-BSM group experienced shorter durations of surgery (1.0 vs 5.5 hours, p<0.001), mechanical ventilation (3.6 vs 20.5 hours, p<0.001), and ICU stay (23.2 vs 56.5 hours, p=0.001), with less 24-hour drain outputs (100 vs 250 mL, p<0.001). The median weight of resected myocardium was much greater following TA-BSM than that in the CSM group (p=0.013). Two post-CSM patients received permanent pacemaker implantation due to atrioventricular block. One patient required intraoperative thoracoscopic mitral repair due to mitral chordae tendineae fracture during TA-BSM and was discharged from hospital in normal condition. No 30-day mortality or septal perforation occurred in either group of patients.
TA-BSM is a simple, safe, and effective septal reduction treatment for pediatrics with oHCM. Compared with CSM, reduced surgical trauma in the TA-BSM group led to quicker postoperative rehabilitation and recovery. More importantly, with real-time transesophageal echocardiographic guidance and evaluation, the TA-BSM approach can help to overcome the technical difficulties posed by a narrowed transaortic exposure in CSM in pediatric patients."

Currently, there is no established, evidence-based medical therapy specifically designed for SRV failure, and treatment approaches are largely extrapolated from left ventricular heart failure (HF) guidelines. This therapeutic gap highlights the need for tailored pharmacologic strategies and optimized perioperative management in this unique population. The optimal timing of surgical intervention and the role of modern HF therapy are still under active investigation. (2) Methods: We present a case series of four patients (three adults and one child) with SRV dysfunction and severe TR, who underwent staged treatment consisting of optimized medical therapy followed by surgical tricuspid valve (TV) replacement. Medical therapy included positive inotropes, sacubitril/valsartan, sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 inhibitors (iSGLT2), beta-blockers, mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists (MRAs), and loop diuretics. (3) Results: All patients demonstrated clinical and hemodynamic improvement prior to surgery, with an increase in systemic ventricular ejection fraction (SVEF > 40%) and cardiac index. TV replacement was performed with favorable early postoperative outcomes and preserved ventricular function at mid-term follow-up. No mortality or major adverse events occurred during follow-up. One case of acute cystitis was associated with dapagliflozin. In all patients, postoperative SVEF remained >40%, and no recurrence of significant TR was observed. (4) Conclusions: A stepwise approach combining modern heart failure therapy and elective TV replacement in patients with SRV dysfunction and TR is safe and effective. Preoperative optimization leads to improved ventricular function and may enhance surgical outcomes. These findings support the integration of contemporary pharmacotherapy in the management strategy for SRV failure."

This study was aimed at investigating the impact of hyperhomocysteinemia on rheumatic mitral valve calcification and prognosis in patients undergoing surgery.
This study included 672 patients with severe rheumatic mitral valve stenosis who underwent surgery between January 2016 and December 2022. Patients were stratified by preoperative homocysteine levels. Mitral valve pathology was assessed by echocardiography and coronary CTA, with all-cause mortality as the primary mid-term endpoint.
Among this surgical cohort of 672 patients with severe rheumatic mitral stenosis, 208 (31.0%) patients were identified with hyperhomocysteinemia. Imaging assessment revealed that these patients had a higher Agatston score for mitral valve calcification (37.47 vs. 17.19, p = 0.038) after adjusting baseline data. Restricted cubic splines revealed a significant dose-response relationship, with mitral valve calcification increasing progressively with higher homocysteine levels (p < 0.001). The Kaplan-Meier survival analysis showed that patients with hyperhomocysteinemia had significantly lower mid-term survival rates (log-rank p = 0.004). Through univariate and multivariate COX regression analyses, it was found that hyperhomocysteinemia was an independent risk factor affecting mid-term postoperative survival (HR, 2.257; p = 0.048).
In patients undergoing surgery for rheumatic heart disease, hyperhomocysteinemia was associated with the formation of rheumatic mitral valve calcification and increased mid-term postoperative mortality. Trial Registration: Chinese Clinical Trial Registry identifier ChiCTR2200067151."

Delayed diagnosis, limited awareness, and inadequate access to specialized cardiac care, contribute to advance disease presentation and poor outcome. Despite the availability of early detection tools and effective antibiotic prophylaxis, many Indian women are diagnosed at the late stages, necessitating complex surgical interventions such as balloon valvuloplasty, valve repair, or valve replacement. Surgical management presents unique challenges particularly regarding the choice between the mechanical and bioprosthetic valves, as the former requires lifelong anticoagulation therapy which poses risk during pregnancy. Socioeconomic impacts of RHD on women include not only financial constraints and loss of productivity but also significant disparities in healthcare access which further hinder timely and effective treatment. This narrative review will provide the comprehensive overview of the current state of research in a specific field and would explore the multifaceted surgical implications of RHD in Indian woman, and would also address demographic consideration, including the age of onset; clinical, reproductive, and hormonal factors; and socio-economic dimensions which influence disease progression and surgical outcomes. It also emphasizes the importance of early screening programs, tailored surgical strategies, and a multidisciplinary approach to care including preconception counselling and postoperative follow-up to improve outcomes. Addressing these gaps is essential to reduce the morbidity and mortality, and enhancing the overall quality of life for woman affected with RHD in India.

In Indonesia, the most prevalent form of VHD is rheumatic heart disease, which is associated with a hospital mortality rate of 6.5% following valve surgery. Previous studies have shown that, post-surgery, morbidity rates remain high: 30.8% of patients experience prolonged intensive care unit stays (>96 hours), 30.67% require extended mechanical ventilation (>24 hours), and 52% need prolonged use of inotropic agents (≥14 days). Right ventricular (RV) dysfunction is closely associated with these three morbidity parameters, as well as with 30-day postoperative mortality. However, limited research in Indonesia has explored the most effective parameters for evaluating RV function as a predictor of postoperative morbidity and mortality following heart valve surgery. This prospective cohort study was conducted at the Department of Cardiology and Vascular Medicine, Universitas Indonesia, and the National Cardiovascular Center Harapan Kita (NCCHK) from October 2023 to July 2024. During this period, 174 patients with VHD who underwent surgical valve replacement were enrolled. After applying exclusion criteria, 26 patients were excluded, resulting in a final study population of 148 patients. All participants underwent preoperative echocardiographic assessment of RV function, performed by two operators within 1 week prior to surgery. Among the 148 subjects, females comprised the majority (60.1%). Atrial fibrillation (AF) was the most common comorbidity, affecting 62.8% of the cohort. The most frequent morbidity outcome was prolonged mechanical ventilation, observed in 27.7% of cases. Of the total mortality events, 70% were cardiac-related, while the remaining 30% were due to non-cardiac causes. Multivariate analysis revealed that a preoperative S'<10 cm/s was significantly associated with cardiac-related mortality [odds ratio (OR) 3.46; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.01-11.87; p=0.049]. Additionally, a preoperative S'<11 cm/s was significantly associated with overall clinical outcomes, including both morbidity and all-cause mortality (OR 3.08; 95% CI 1.43-6.65; p=0.004). In conclusion, S', an echocardiographic parameter reflecting RV function, demonstrates potential as a predictive marker for postoperative morbidity and mortality in patients undergoing heart valve surgery."

Memory deficits have been reported in posterior cortical atrophy (PCA), and logopenic variant primary progressive aphasia (lvPPA), despite these groups being referred to as ""non-amnestic"". The shared and dissociable patterns of memory impairment across atypical syndromes have not yet been clearly delineated.
We tested 16 early-onset (EOAD), 9 lvPPA, 21 PCA, and 29 cognitively normal (CN) participants with a novel object-location memory test (OLMT) designed to foster deep learning and interrogate associative memory between objects and locations without lexical retrieval demands. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) and post-hoc t-tests were conducted to characterize between group performance. General linear models interrogated the association of atrophy in the default mode network with different stages of memory.
All atypical AD variants demonstrated impaired encoding over three learning trials compared to CNs, with a positive learning curve. EOAD demonstrated greater storage loss compared to the other groups at 3-minute delayed recognition (vs. PCA: t = 3.2, p = 0.002; vs. lvPPA: t = 3.1, p = 0.005) but comparable levels of impairment at 30-minute delayed recognition (EOAD: z=-4.4 ± 6.1; PCA: z=-2.2 ± 3.6; lvPPA: z=-1.2 ± 2.1). While the lvPPA group was able to effectively associate locations with objects and retain this association over time, other variants struggled with both encoding (EOAD: z=-4.4 ± 6.1; PCA: z=-2.2 ± 3.6) and retention (EOAD: z=-4.4 ± 6.1; PCA: z=-2.2 ± 3.6) of spatial locations over time. Medial temporal lobe atrophy was uniquely associated with object-location associative binding and storage over time, but not object encoding alone.
All atypical AD syndromes demonstrated poor encoding and storage loss, adding to the characterization of memory impairment in atypical ""non-amnestic"" AD. EOAD participants demonstrated faster storage loss compared to the other variants, potentially reflecting multidomain impairment. While PCA and lvPPA performed comparably on object memory, these groups were differentiated by location memory binding. Understanding the varied presentation of memory deficits in atypical syndromes can help inform accurate diagnosis and cognitive skills training to cope with neurodegenerative decline."

Performance was also reduced in the outpatient setting (72.2%), where subtle hemorrhages were more common, while remaining consistent across demographic subgroups. These findings show that the model performs reliably for acute and extensive ICH but is less sensitive to subtle or localized presentations, underscoring the need for ongoing real-world evaluation and targeted improvements to support safe clinical triage."

This study examines hourly rainfall patterns in the Northwest Himalayan (NWH) region of India, enhancing forecasting accuracy using spatial correlations. The region shows a significant decline in hourly rainfall trends over the period 2019-2024, with approximately 50% of the area exhibiting statistically significant decreasing trends. The analysis reveals that high-elevation regions exhibit stronger initial 1-hour lag correlation (>0.8) and a rapid temporal decay over 9 hours. In contrast, lower-altitude areas (below 600 m) display a more gradual decrease in correlation, suggesting broader spatial influence with less intense propagation. Across all locations, rainfall variability as defined by statistically significant correlations, typically dissipates within 6 to 7 hours. Our analysis further identifies a prominent belt of high rainfall coherence aligned along the central Himalayan zone, highlighting pronounced spatial homogeneity. To improve predictive performance, this study proposes an attention-guided spatial correlation mechanism integrated within a Deformable Convolutional Long Short-Term Memory (DConvLSTM) framework. The proposed model, termed SARITA, processes hourly rainfall and spatial correlations, with the attention mechanism dynamically using spatial dependencies. This integration enhances the model's ability to generalize across spatial-temporal patterns. Model evaluation using statistical metrics demonstrates that SARITA consistently outperforms baseline models such as ConvLSTM and standard DConvLSTM, achieving a 25% improvement in hourly rainfall forecasts. Furthermore, the model also improves anomaly detection by 3.5% over the standard DConvLSTM model."
PubMed,deep learning,An efficient hybrid artificial intelligence framework for lung cancer classification using CT images.,L Kamala; K G Mohan,10.1038/s41598-025-31432-0,2025-12-24,Scientific reports,"Lung cancer is the most dangerous type of cancer, and its affected rate increases gradually. The survival rate of lung cancer is very low compared to other cancers. Early prediction of lung cancer can help increase the survival rate by ensuring sufficient oxygen supply and eliminating carbon dioxide in the human body. Computed Tomography (CT) imaging is widely used by physicians for lung disease identification because it provides detailed cross-sectional views of the lungs and helps in detecting small nodules that may be missed by other imaging techniques. Manual visualization is time-consuming and sometimes leads to classification errors, making it difficult to identify lung cancer at an early stage. This limitation can be addressed through automated lung cancer prediction using Artificial Intelligence (AI). This research proposes a hybrid AI model to classify lung CT images as normal, benign, or malignant. Images from the Iraq-Oncology Teaching Hospital/National Center for Cancer Diseases (IQ-OTH/NCCD) dataset are used. These images undergo various pre-processing techniques, and features are extracted using both traditional methods such as Gray-Level Co-occurrence Matrix (GLCM) and Scale-Invariant Feature Transform (SIFT), and Deep Learning (DL) methods such as Visual Geometry Group (VGG-16) and MobileNet. The extracted features from both approaches are fused and processed through a Fully Connected Layer (FCL) for classification. Six combinations of feature extraction modules are evaluated for lung cancer prediction: GLCM + MobileNet, GLCM + VGG-16, SIFT + MobileNet, SIFT + VGG-16, GLCM + SIFT + MobileNet, and GLCM + SIFT + VGG-16. Among these combinations, the integration of GLCM and SIFT with MobileNet demonstrates superior performance compared to other AI combinations, achieving the highest accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and specificity. The proposed methodology is also compared with state-of-the-art methods, and the results indicate that the hybrid AI model surpasses existing approaches. The experimental findings confirm that the proposed model provides reliable results for lung cancer prediction from CT images and is suitable for real-time deployment."

However, fluorescence live-cell images of cell membranes frequently suffer from a low signal-to-noise ratio, especially during long-duration imaging with high spatiotemporal resolutions. The low ratio is caused by a tradeoff between embryo viability and phototoxicity and photobleaching of fluorescent markers, which hinders effective cell shape reconstruction, particularly in rapidly developing embryos. Here, we devise an integrative computational framework, EmbSAM, that incorporates a deep-learning-based cell boundary localization algorithm and the Segment Anything Model. EmbSAM enables accurate segmentation of three-dimensional cell membrane images for roundworm Caenorhabditis elegans embryos imaged with exceptional temporal resolution, i.e., every 10 seconds per stack. The resolved cell shapes prior to gastrulation quantitatively characterize a series of cell-division-coupled morphodynamics associated with cell position, cell division phase duration, cell division axis reorientation, cell identity, lineage, fate, among others, which can be accessed locally and online."

SentXFormer is based on the hybrid SentiConGRU-Net architecture, which consists of CNN and GRU layers, and contextual embeddings of BERT, RoBERTa, and Domain-Adaptive BERT (DABERT). A domain adaptation module based on an adversarial training with a Gradient Reversal Layer (GRL) also encourages domain-invariant representations to be learned.

SentXFormer performed well in in-domain, reaching 98.7% (Amazon), 97.67% (Yelp) and 98.8% (IMDB) accuracies. The model is stable in terms of transferability in cross-domain settings with an accuracy of 91-93% on all train-test combinations. The comparative analysis with LSTM, CNN, GRU, and latest transformer-based adaptation models demonstrates that SentXFormer is always better than the current baselines. The findings indicate that SentXFormer is an efficient, strong and scalable tool to sentiment analysis in heterogeneous and real-life customer review contexts."

However, precise forecasting of GWL fluctuations faces significant challenges due to the complex nonlinear coupling effects of hydrogeological conditions and hydro-meteorological factors. In recent years, research on GWL prediction based on deep learning models has become a cutting-edge topic in the field of hydrogeology. This study focused on Jinan City, China, and constructed a novel hybrid deep learning model that integrates graph neural networks to capture spatial relationships and recurrent neural networks to model temporal dynamics, effectively learning the complex spatio-temporal patterns in the data, namely the Spatio-Temporal Graph Prediction Model (STGPM). Our approach uniquely captures both hydrological connectivity between monitoring wells and multi-scale temporal dependencies, overcoming key limitations of conventional time-series models. Comparative experiments demonstrate that STGPM outperforms the benchmark models on the test set, achieving the lowest prediction errors (MAE = 0.039, RMSE = 0.052) and the highest coefficient of determination (R2=0.988). Notably, for the monitoring well data not involved in model training, the STGPM still maintains excellent predictive accuracy (MAE = 0.062, RMSE = 0.087, R2=0.980), demonstrating the model's strong generalization ability to unmonitored locations. This study provides water resource managers with a reliable decision-support tool for sustainable groundwater management and spring conservation strategies. The proposed methodological framework also offers a transferable solution for addressing various environmental forecasting challenges characterized by spatial heterogeneity."

Traditional microwave-based techniques often depend on handcrafted features or manual interpretation of measurement data, which limits their robustness and accuracy in complex or cluttered environments. To address these challenges, this study presents a deep neural network model trained on experimental multi-frequency microwave S-parameter data for the automated detection and classification of buried objects. The proposed framework processes 21×21 S-parameter matrices to capture the electromagnetic response of the subsurface medium. It classifies each sample into three distinct categories: safe, plastic-based threat, and metal-based threat. The model achieves an accuracy of 0.9647, precision of 0.9677, recall of 0.9647, and an F1 score of 0.9635, demonstrating consistent performance across all evaluation metrics. By learning directly from real, experimentally measured data, the network effectively models the complex relationship between microwave responses and object characteristics, eliminating the need for simulation-based data or handcrafted features. These findings represent a substantial step toward the realization of practical, data-driven microwave detection systems, offering improved reliability, scalability, and operational potential for future security and defense applications."

Recent advances in peptide therapy have highlighted anti-aging peptides (AAPs) as a promising therapeutic strategy, owing to their low immunogenicity and ease of synthesis. However, the lack of computational tools for AAP identification has hindered systematic research in this field.
In this study, we provided a benchmark dataset of anti-aging peptides (AAPs) based on their annotated biological functions and AgingBase database. Subsequently, we proposed three novel predictive models, including 1) Antiaging-FL, which integrates feature representation learning with machine learning algorithms; 2) ESM_GAN, which utilizes a generative adversarial network (GAN) for data augmentation to enhance prediction robustness; and 3) ESM_CNN, which combines a data augmentation strategy based on conservative amino acid substitutions with a convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture for improved feature extraction. Comprehensive evaluations demonstrated that all three models achieved high predictive performance. Specifically, Antiaging-FL achieved an AUC of 1.00 on the AAP400 dataset and 0.99 on an independent test set, while ESM_GAN yielded AUCs of 0.99 and 0.95, and ESM_CNN obtained AUCs of 0.96 and 0.94, respectively.
Our study presents three high-performance models for AAP prediction, accelerating the discovery of novel anti-aging peptides. These models not only provide a valuable resource for researchers but also offer insights into the functional mechanisms of AAPs, paving the way for targeted drug development in aging-related therapeutics."

However, the role of the proportions between head and body remains understudied, with the genetic basis of HBRs remaining largely unexplored. By applying deep learning models to 38,202 whole-body dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry images from the UK Biobank, we generated 10 distinct HBR phenotypes based on head (length/width) and various body dimensions. Our genome-wide association analyses identify 245 significant loci, with SNP-based heritability estimates ranging from 25% to 43%. Functional annotations show that genes prioritized for HBRs are enriched in chondrocytes in skeletal tissues and oligodendrocytes across multiple brain regions. Polygenic risk scores and mendelian randomization analyses further showed that HBRs are significantly associated with risks for cardiovascular, metabolic, musculoskeletal, and neuropsychiatric diseases, underscoring their potential value as health-related biomarkers. Evolutionary analyses show that HBR-associated variants are enriched in conserved genomic regions and human accelerated regions, particularly those influencing brain development. Overall, our study provides insights into the genetic architectures of HBRs, establishes their relevance to major human diseases, and offers evolutionary context for their biological significance."

While computed tomography perfusion (CTP) and diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) are commonly used to determine irreversible tissue injury (core), their high costs and limited availability present challenges. An alternative is quantitative net water uptake (NWU) derived from non-contrast-enhanced CT (NCCT), a validated biomarker for predicting patient outcomes. However, current NWU measurements require time-consuming manual postprocessing, and automating this process remains challenging.
This retrospective study introduces a fully automated method for NWU quantification using only NCCT images. The proposed image processing pipeline is based on expert-defined heuristics and voxel-wise NWU calculations, without employing deep learning-based components. The method was developed and validated on an in-house dataset of 185 patients (155 after exclusions) and externally tested on 51 patients (46 after exclusions). Performance was assessed by comparing computed lesion masks with expert-annotated core lesion masks from CTP (in-house) and DWI (external), using lesion detection rate, mean absolute NWU error, Dice similarity coefficient, and mean average precision.
Results demonstrated a high lesion detection rate of 94% (in-house) and 100% (external). The mean absolute NWU estimation error was 1.0% for in-house data and 1.5% for external data. Segmentation accuracy was moderate, with Dice similarity coefficients of 0.48 (in-house) and 0.47 (external).
This method provides a practical and interpretable solution for NWU quantification, allowing stroke assessment directly from NCCT without reliance on additional imaging modalities.
Question Current approaches for quantifying early lesion progression in ischemic stroke rely on manual imaging-based NWU estimation, underscoring the need for an automated and reproducible method. Findings The method achieved high lesion detection accuracy and reliable net water uptake estimation, demonstrating its potential as a tool for automated stroke assessment. Clinical relevance This study presents an automated NCCT-based method for stroke assessment that enables net water uptake estimation directly from routinely acquired scans.

However, in typical complex landforms such as urban canyons and mountainous forest areas, the single-sensor data acquisition methods (such as UAV oblique images and lidar) has inherent information blind spots and accuracy bottlenecks. Traditional data fusion approaches predominantly focus on shallow geometric alignment and splicing at the geometric level, ignoring the heterogeneity of different data sources in semantic connotations, leads to common problems such as geometric distortion, detail loss, and semantic inconsistency in the fusion products. To break through this dilemma, this paper proposes an adaptive fusion framework for multi-source data of complex landforms (SAAF-Net) with deeply coupled semantic information. Centered on computer vision, this framework constructs a full-link technical process from raw data to high-precision semantic 3D models: Two-stream parallel semantic parsing: A two-stream deep semantic segmentation network for images and point clouds (based on SegFormer and PointNeXt) is designed to achieve fine-grained classification of scene features (the average intersection over union mIoU exceeds 90%), providing high-dimensional semantic priors for fusion. Semantic-guided cross-source registration: A semantic weighted iterative closest point algorithm (SW-ICP) is proposed. By constraining the corresponding point search space through cross-source semantic consistency and combining with the significance weighting of local geometric structures, the robustness problem of heterogeneous data registration is solved. Neural adaptive fusion modeling: A multi-factor driven neural network model is constructed to dynamically evaluate the confidence of data sources under different semantic categories and observation conditions, achieving the optimal fusion of pixel-level elevation and texture. Experiments in the city center and mountainous forest areas show that compared with mainstream methods, the root mean square error (RMSE) of SAAF-Net is reduced by 35% - 48%, and the completeness is improved to over 99%. Especially, the reconstruction quality in building edges, vegetation-covered areas, and light-shadow areas is significantly improved.with a substantial enhancement in visual realism. This research provides theoretical and technical support for the construction of a high-precision 3D base for digital twin cities."

Early-stage tumors are especially challenging to detect with standard CT and MRI imaging, leading to treatment delays and poor outcomes. While deep learning offers promise, centralized training in healthcare raises serious privacy and data-sharing concerns. This study introduces a federated learning framework that integrates RegNetZ and the Swin-Transformer for automated detection, subtype classification, and prognosis prediction from multimodal inputs, including CT, MRI, histology, genomic, and clinical records. The Swin-Transformer models long-range dependencies, whereas the lightweight RegNetZ backbone ensures efficient local feature extraction. A Hybrid Aquila-Grey Wolf Optimizer (HA-GWO) is incorporated to balance exploration and exploitation during hyperparameter tuning, providing faster convergence and reduced computational cost compared to conventional search strategies. The proposed framework, evaluated across 5-7 simulated client institutions, achieves 99.2% accuracy, 98.9% sensitivity, 99.0% precision, and 99.4% AUC, outperforming both CNN-only and transformer-only baselines. It further minimizes false positives and false negatives, improving both subtype classification (adenocarcinoma, neuroendocrine, cystic neoplasms) and prognosis risk prediction (high vs. low risk). Hyperparameter sensitivity analysis identifies a learning rate of 0.003 with a batch size of 64 as optimal. By enabling decentralized model training without raw data exchange, the system enhances diagnostic accuracy while preserving privacy, offering a practical solution for real-time pancreatic cancer detection in federated healthcare environments. The framework is scalable across medical institutions and supports precision oncology by enabling early and reliable diagnosis at low computational cost."

Traditional routing protocols are battling with security threats such as wormhole attacks that disrupt routing and degrade network performance. To address these challenges, this study outlines a state-of-the-art technique, the Reinforcement Learning-Based Secure Routing Protocol (RLSRP), which leverages adaptive k-hop clustering and deep Q-Networks (DQN) to fine-tune routing decisions dynamically while mitigating security risks. RLSRP unwaveringly measures network condition by evaluating latency variations and anomalies to spot suspicious nodes, thereby enhancing route stability. The protocol implements zone-related clustering where nodes within each zone collaborate to optimise routing paths based on real-time conditions, ensuring energy-efficient communication. Current research investigated deep reinforcement learning methodologies to improve security in zone-related MANETs and ensure efficient data routing in large-scale environments. A detailed simulation-based evaluation depicts the potency of the proposed RLSRP model when compared with other reinforcement learning-based routing protocols. Using a large-scale setup-scaling up to 10 million nodes-with Dask and TensorFlow, the results show that RLSRP consistently outperforms FSSAM, Cluster-RL, and Reputation-based Q-learning in terms of Packet Delivery Ratio (exceeding 99%), reduced latency, and improved energy efficiency.

With a focus on the prevalent psychological complications following the onset of this condition, this study aimed to explore the correlation between antenatal depression and Corona disease anxiety, personality traits, and postpartum depression during the COVID-19 pandemic.                                                           Materials and Methods:                     This cross-sectional descriptive-analytical study investigated women receiving care at health centers affiliated with Kerman University of Medical Sciences during the last month of their pregnancy and the postpartum period in 2022. Following the acquisition of informed consent, participants were assessed using various measures, including demographic and obstetric information, the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale, the Corona Disease Anxiety Scale (CDAS), and the NEO Personality Inventory-Revised during their third trimester of pregnancy. The same group of participants completed the Edinburgh Depression Scale and the Corona Disease Anxiety Scale (CDAS) 4-6 weeks after childbirth.                                                           Results and Discussion:                     There was a significant correlation between family income, unwanted pregnancy as perceived by both the mother and father, and antenatal depression. Additionally, marital satisfaction played a significant role in postpartum depression. Furthermore, antenatal depression was significantly associated with neuroticism, agreeableness, and physical symptoms related to Corona disease anxiety. Personality traits, with the exception of extroversion and conscientiousness, and various domains of Corona disease anxiety, excluding psychological symptoms, were also significantly associated with postpartum depression.                                                           Conclusion:                     During pandemics or epidemics, such as the COVID-19 outbreak, experiencing mental distress during pregnancy can contribute to mental health issues during the postpartum period. This risk is particularly true in individuals with unique personality traits, emphasizing the need for increased focus on mental health within prenatal care during these crises."

Method:                     This cross-sectional study was conducted in Kerman, Iran. Data were collected from patients who visited Afzalipour Hospital in Kerman more than twice during the COVID-19 epidemic from the end of February 2020 to March 21, 2021. We conducted two key analyses: 1. Mixed effect logistic regression was used to check the relationship between the variables and COVID-19 severity. 2. Mixed effect linear regression was used to check the relationship between the variables and the length of stay in the hospital.                                                           Results:                     The findings indicated that the most important risk factors for the severity of COVID-19 were heart diseases (OR=1.67,95%CI:1.20-2.30), increasing age (OR=2.23 for age&gt;54, 95%CI:1.70- 2.90), male gender (OR=1.47,95%CI:1.10-1.96), respiratory diseases other than asthma, and frequency of admission (OR=1.60,95%CI:1.20-2.15). All patients who underwent readmission experienced a shorter duration of hospitalization during their subsequent admission (OR=0.94,95%CI:0.91,0.96) and had a higher mortality rate (30% within 14 days, 26.6% between 14-90 days). Patients readmitted at intervals of 14-90 days and greater than 90 days exhibited lower disease severity compared to those readmitted within the 0-14 day period.                                                           Conclusion:                     Examining readmissions, the severity of COVID-19, and the length of hospital stay in affected patients are important factors for planning and allocating resources for COVID-19 management and treatment. These factors can help policymakers develop effective clinical guidelines for hospitalization or outpatient treatment of COVID-19 patients and contribute to reducing the burden of disease in the community."

Kinovea, as an accessible motion-analysis software, provides both visual and quantitative feedback. However, its application in supporting technique development among beginner athletes remains insufficiently explored. Aim: This study aims to describe the use of Kinovea in biomechanics training and examine its contribution to the awareness of kinematic characteristics and movement techniques among beginner athletes. Methods: A descriptive qualitative design involved 72 beginner athletes aged 18–25 years selected through purposive sampling. Data were collected over 16 weeks through interviews, field observations, and motion video recordings analyzed using Kinovea. Kinematic data focused on joint angles, stride behavior, and movement phases during walking, running, and the flight phase. Qualitative data were analyzed using content analysis with NVivo 12, while kinematic results were interpreted descriptively to identify performance patterns and areas for technical refinement. Result: Kinematic analysis showed coordinated joint-angle patterns across all phases. Walking analysis identified arm swing angles of 50.9°–58.8° and leg separation angles of 64.3°–67.2°, indicating a stable gait rhythm. The running analysis revealed knee angles of 68.8°–69.8° and elbow angles of 87.6°–89.1°, indicating efficient propulsive mechanics. The flight phase demonstrated knee angles of 81.2°–87.8° and elbow angles of 80.4°–88.3°, suggesting effective momentum use and postural stability. These measurements supported stride-efficiency assessment and technique evaluation. Qualitative findings revealed that Kinovea enabled athletes to interpret movement phases and identify technical inefficiencies through slow-motion and frame-by-frame visualization. Conclusion: Kinovea supports basic motion analysis by providing clear kinematic information and helping beginner athletes observe and refine their movement techniques. The findings also offer practical value for coaches by enabling more precise identification of inefficient patterns and guiding targeted corrections during early-stage training."

OpenAlex,mitral regurgitation,Temporal trends in characteristics and outcomes of patients undergoing percutaneous mitral valve repair,Rasha Kaddoura; Zainab Atiyah Dakhil; Daoud Al-Badriyeh; Dina Abushanab; Ihsan Rafie; Mohammed Al‐Hijji,10.4330/wjc.v17.i12.110450,2025-12-24,World Journal of Cardiology,"BACKGROUND Observational studies reported characteristics and outcomes of patients with secondary mitral valve regurgitation (MR) who underwent transcatheter edge-to-edge repair of the mitral valve. No study investigated the temporal trend of patient characteristics and outcomes in comparison with the published randomized trials. AIM To investigate the temporal trend in baseline characteristics and outcomes of patients with secondary MR who underwent transcatheter edge-to-edge repair of the mitral valve in the real world compared with those from the published landmark trials. METHODS A comprehensive systematic literature search was conducted using MEDLINE, EMBASE, and CENTRAL databases, and the identified observational studies were divided into two five-year recruitment periods. The first period included 36 studies that enrolled patients between 2008 and 2012, and the second period included 25 studies that recruited patients between 2013 and 2017-2018. Pooled variables of each five-year recruitment period were compared with those of the landmark trials. A random-effects model was used for statistical comparisons. RStudio and RevMan software were used for the analysis. RESULTS Overall, there were no major variations in the findings between the first and the second five-year recruitment periods. EVEREST program vs observational studies: Patients in the EVEREST program were more likely to have non-ischemic MR etiology [odds ratio (OR) = 3.59, 95% confidence interval (CI): 2.92-4.42] and atrial fibrillation (OR = 1.71, 95%CI: 1.42-2.06). They were less likely to receive angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors/angiotensin II receptor blockers (OR = 0.72, 95%CI: 0.58-0.90) and implantable cardiac device (OR = 0.41, 95%CI: 0.33-0.49) as well as less likely to be symptomatic at hospital presentation without a difference in MR grade ≤ 2+ or mortality at 12-month follow-up. COAPT trial vs observational studies: COAPT patients were more likely to have prior myocardial infarction (OR = 1.62, 95%CI: 1.27-2.06) and renal insufficiency (OR = 2.66, 95%CI: 2.05-3.45). They were more likely to receive beta-blockers (OR = 2.54, 95%CI: 1.68-3.85) and an implanted cardiac device (OR = 2.20, 95%CI: 1.71-2.84). There was no difference in procedure success or mortality. MITRA-FR trial vs observational studies: MITRA-FR patients were less likely to have atrial fibrillation (OR = 0.49, 95%CI: 0.34-0.69) and renal insufficiency (OR = 0.18, 95%CI: 0.11-0.28) but more likely to have a history of myocardial infarction (OR = 1.48, 95%CI: 1.06-2.05) and to receive diuretics (OR = 19.81, 95%CI: 2.75-142.48) and implantable cardiac devices (OR = 1.69, 95%CI: 1.21-2.37). At hospital presentation, they were less likely to be symptomatic (OR = 0.25, 95%CI: 0.18-0.35) without a difference in MR grades 3+ and 4+. There was no difference in terms of MR grade or mortality at 12-month follow-up. CONCLUSION Patients in the landmark studies may have favourable or unfavourable characteristics when compared to those in the observational studies, but this did not translate into different outcomes over time."
OpenAlex,mitral regurgitation,Mitral Annular Disjunction: Where Is the Cut-Off Value? Case Series and Literature Review,Giovanni Balestrucci; Vitaliano Buffa; Maria Teresa Del Canto; Maria Chiara Brunese; Salvatore Cappabianca; Alfonso Reginelli,10.3390/hearts7010002,2025-12-22,Hearts,"Mitral annular disjunction (MAD) is a structural abnormality of the mitral valve increasingly detected with advanced cardiac imaging, particularly cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR). However, the clinical impact of different degrees of disjunction and the lack of standardized measurement criteria remain controversial. This study aimed to describe a series of patients with MAD assessed by CMR and to discuss, in the context of current literature, potential cut-off values that may distinguish physiological from pathological MAD. We retrospectively identified all CMR examinations performed at our institution over a 6-month period in which MAD was visible in at least two cine steady-state free precession (SSFP) projections. For each patient, we recorded MAD extent, presence of mitral valve prolapse/regurgitation, late gadolinium enhancement (LGE) pattern, and main clinical presentation. Nine patients (mean age 57 years; 5 men) were included. Larger MAD distances (&gt;4 mm) were frequently associated with non-ischemic LGE in the basal lateral wall and with valvular abnormalities, whereas smaller disjunctions (≤3 mm) were often observed in patients without significant structural disease. Non-ischemic LGE was present in 6/9 patients, all with MAD &gt; 5 mm. These observations, together with published data, support the hypothesis that small degrees of MAD may represent a frequent anatomical variant, while more extensive disjunction, especially when associated with fibrosis, may indicate a pathological substrate for arrhythmias. Standardized CMR-based criteria and validated MAD cut-off values are needed to improve risk stratification and to incorporate MAD assessment into routine clinical practice."

Shaposhnikova,10.14412/2074-2711-2025-6-26-30,2025-12-20,Neurology neuropsychiatry Psychosomatics,"Aortic stenosis (AS), the prevalence of which increases with age, raises the risk of developing ischaemic stroke (IS), but the risk factors for cerebral ischemic events have not been fully established. Objective: to evaluate IS predictors in patients with moderate or severe AS, which will help identify high-risk groups and optimise stroke prevention. Material and methods . A retrospective review of data from the hospital information system for case-control analysis was conducted at one of the Federal Centers for Cardiovascular Surgery. Inclusion criteria: moderate or severe AS, patient age ≥18 years. Exclusion criteria: moderate or severe mitral stenosis, moderate or severe mitral regurgitation. Logistic regression was used to determine IS predictors. Odds ratio (OR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated for each of the significant risk factors. Results . The study included 208 patients with AS (the main group consisted of 51 patients with a history of IS or transient ischemic attack). The median age of patients was 68 [62.0; 72.0] years, the proportion of men was 53.8%. According to the multivariate analysis, the following predictors of cerebral ischemic events were identified: male gender (OR 2.739; 95% CI 1.048–7.156, p=0.040), extra-, intracranial stenosis &gt;50% (OR 2.488; 95% CI 1.089–5.686, p=0.031), aortic arch atheromas (OR 5.947; 95% CI 1.179–29.994, p=0.031), the result of the CHA2DS2VASc scale with an increase of 1 point (OR 4.030; 95% CI 1.912–8.499, p&lt;0.001). Conclusion. Supra-cardiac atherosclerosis (extraand intracranial atherosclerosis, aortic atheromas) is the main predictor of IS in patients with AS, which determines the need for its assessment in order to optimise patient treatment."
OpenAlex,mitral regurgitation,Retained fragmented Raytec gauze eluding an alleged correct postoperative count following cardiothoracic surgery: case report of a rare “never event”,Marco Lizwan; Philip Y. K. Pang,10.1186/s13037-025-00472-w,2025-12-20,Patient Safety in Surgery,"Abstract Introduction Retained surgical items are rare yet serious complications that may occur despite correct instrument and sponge counts. Surgical sponges remain the most frequently retained items, with gauze marker strand retention being an uncommon mechanism. Case presentation A 69-year-old male with severe mitral regurgitation and triple-vessel coronary artery disease underwent mitral valve replacement with coronary artery bypass grafting. All surgical counts were verified as correct at the conclusion of surgery. Postoperative chest radiography, however, revealed two linear radio-opaque foreign bodies near the left lower sternum. Mediastinal re-exploration identified two radio-opaque strands, measuring 3.0 cm and 2.0 cm, attached to the left lower chest wall near the internal mammary artery stump. These were confirmed to be detached marker strands from Raytec gauzes. The patient’s recovery was uneventful and he was discharged well. Conclusion This case illustrates that retained gauze fragments can occur despite correct counts due to fragmentation of radiopaque markers. Surgeons and operating room nurses should inspect gauzes for integrity, maintain vigilance when manipulating sponges in confined operative fields, and consider adjunct technologies such as radiofrequency or barcode tracking. In high-risk surgeries, postoperative imaging may be warranted even with accurate counts to ensure patient safety."
OpenAlex,mitral regurgitation,Suicide left ventricle triggered by accelerated junctional rhythm after TAVI: A case report of rhythm-dependent dynamic LVOT obstruction,Naoki Hoshino; Chihiro Nakashima;  Takashi Muramatsu; Akira Yamada; Hideo Izawa,10.1093/ehjcr/ytaf665,2025-12-19,European Heart Journal - Case Reports,"Abstract Background Suicide left ventricle (LV) is a rare, potentially fatal complication after transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI). It is typically caused by dynamic left ventricular outflow tract obstruction (LVOTO) following abrupt afterload reduction. Accelerated junctional rhythm (AJR) is an uncommon peri-procedural arrhythmia, and its role in precipitating suicide LV has not been reported. Case Summary An 87-year-old woman with extremely severe aortic stenosis was admitted for transfemoral TAVI. Concentric LV hypertrophy with a sigmoid septum and preserved systolic function was observed on baseline transthoracic echocardiography. She developed profound hypotension immediately after valve deployment. Transoesophageal echocardiography (TOE) revealed severe LVOTO and marked mitral regurgitation (MR) due to systolic anterior motion (SAM) of the mitral valve. The simultaneous appearance of AJR abolished atrial contraction, further reducing LV preload. LVOTO and SAM resolved during sinus rhythm, but recurred during AJR. Haemodynamics improved with rapid volume loading, vasoconstrictor administration and continuous right ventricular pacing, thereby reducing obstruction via induced ventricular dyssynchrony. AJR resolved spontaneously following emergence from anaesthesia, and a stable sinus rhythm was maintained. The patient was discharged on postoperative day 12 without recurrence. Discussion This case reports AJR as a novel trigger for suicide LV after TAVI, leading to preload reduction and promoting SAM, LVOTO and MR. Intraoperative TOE provided clear rhythm-dependent imaging of LVOT dynamics. Vigilant rhythm monitoring and prompt, targeted haemodynamic management, including pacing to induce ventricular dyssynchrony, are crucial for prevention and treatment in predisposed patients with small, hypertrophied ventricles with a sigmoid septum."

As such, this study aimed to further evaluate the diagnostic utility of ePLAR in a large cohort of patients with PHTN. Methods and Results All RHCs between 2018-2023 across three tertiary centers were retrospectively reviewed. Patients with PHTN were characterized as pre-capillary or post-capillary (isolated or combined). Concurrent ePLAR was calculated. ROC analysis evaluated the accuracy of ePLAR in detecting pre-capillary PHTN. Overall, 2235 patients had PHTN by RHC, mean age 63.5 ± 14.7 years, 53.5% male. Of these, 43.3% had pre-capillary PHTN. ROC analysis demonstrated ePLAR to have good accuracy in detection of pre-capillary PHTN (AUC 0.760), with a cutoff of 0.20m/s demonstrating a sensitivity and specificity of 77% and 60% respectively. This persisted on sensitivity analysis for contemporaneous investigations and for right ventricular function. Conclusions In this large cohort, ePLAR was validated as an accurate tool for identifying patients with pre-capillary PHTN. This widely available, non-invasive, and reproducible parameter can have an important role in the work up of PHTN and may guide the need for invasive testing."

Abboud,10.3324/haematol.2025.288573,2025-12-18,Haematologica,"Sickle cell disease (SCD) is associated with cardiovascular complications. Speckle-tracking echocardiography enables early detection of myocardial dysfunction before abnormalities appear in conventional echocardiographic parameters. This study evaluated left ventricular (LV) global longitudinal strain (GLS) in pediatric SCD patients, and its relationship with traditional LV function indices, disease complications, hemolysis markers, and diseasemodifying therapy. We retrospectively analyzed 278 echocardiograms from 185 participants (118 SCD patients, mean age 12.2 years; 67 age- and sex-matched controls, mean age 11.8 years) obtained between 2015 and 2023. Among the SCD cohort, 66.1% had the HbSS genotype, 9.3% had HbSβ°-thalassemia, and 17.8% had HbSβ⁺-thalassemia; the majority (83.9%) were on hydroxyurea. Compared to controls, SCD patients had significantly lower, but still normal, GLS (–21.5% vs. –22.3%; p &lt; 0.001), along with significantly larger chamber diameters, elevated mitral valve E velocity, E/A ratio, and tricuspid regurgitation maximal velocity. Prior stroke (β = 0.9) and avascular necrosis (β = 1.51) were independently associated with worse GLS. The different genotypes did not exhibit significant difference in GLS. The strain values did not correlate with hemolysis markers, suggesting that other mechanisms may underlie myocardial impairment. A significant age-related decline in GLS was detected, with an inflection point at approximately 9.9 years. Longitudinal analysis of LV strain in the SCD cohort demonstrated a small decline from –21.6% to –21.2% over a 3.7-year follow-up period. Finally, pediatric SCD patients exhibit significant cardiac remodeling and diastolic dysfunction with preserved, yet lower, LV GLS, underscoring the need for further research in this population."
OpenAlex,mitral regurgitation,A massive left atrium in the context of severe mitral regurgitation: a case report,Ryaan EL‐Andari; Zachary Davidson; Jeevan Nagendran,10.1080/14796678.2025.2605920,2025-12-18,Future Cardiology,"Mitral regurgitation (MR) is among the most common heart conditions. Untreated, severe MR may result in adverse cardiac remodeling, atrial fibrillation (AF), and heart failure. A 45-year-old male with a history of AF presented with heart failure symptoms. Transesophageal echocardiogram revealed a myxomatous mitral valve with anterior leaflet prolapse, severe MR, and massively dilated left atrium (LA). A computerized tomography scan found severe LA dilation up to 17.8 cm. The patient underwent mitral valve replacement, tricuspid valve repair, and LA reduction. MR is known to result in LA dilation due to increased LA volume and pressure. While large LA sizes have been reported, they are often related to congenital conditions and rarely grow to the size identified in this case. AF and LA dilation both predict adverse outcomes, increasing the risk of thrombus formation in such a large chamber."

Pashimov; R Tuleutayev; Elmira Kultanova,10.3390/jcm14248938,2025-12-18,Journal of Clinical Medicine,"Objective: In this study, we aimed to determine the most significant risk factors for 5-year mortality in patients with paroxysmal and persistent drug-refractory tachysystolic atrial fibrillation after undergoing atrioventricular node ablation (AVNA) in combination with the implantation of a permanent three-chamber pacemaker with an implantable cardioverter–defibrillator function (CRT-D). Methods: This prospective single-center cohort study included 101 patients with chronic heart failure (mean age 62 ± 15.5 years; 70.3% male) with paroxysmal or persistent drug-refractory atrial fibrillation who underwent atrioventricular node ablation and CRT-D implantation. All patients received optimal medical therapy before and after undergoing the procedure. Predictors of 5-year mortality were assessed using exploratory machine-learning methods, including random forest and Shapley additive explanations. Results: During 5-year follow-up, 13 cardiovascular deaths were recorded. Five key predictors of mortality were identified: left ventricular ejection fraction, 6 min walk distance, mean pulmonary artery pressure, systolic relaxation coefficient, and degree of mitral regurgitation. The exploratory predictive model showed high accuracy (92%) in terms of classifying the outcomes. Conclusions: Atrioventricular node ablation (AVNA) combined with CRT-D was associated with the observed long-term clinical outcomes observed in patients with drug-refractory tachysystolic atrial fibrillation. The exploratory machine learning analysis identified key mortality-associated factors, which may support future efforts in personalized risk stratification and hypothesis generation. The combination of AVNA and CRT-D was associated with the observed long-term outcomes in this real-world cohort."

Hoopes; Vakhtang Tchantchaleishvili,10.1111/aor.70056,2025-12-18,Artificial Organs,"ABSTRACT Background Microaxial devices provide effective short‐term hemodynamic support in patients with cardiogenic shock or during high‐risk procedures. However, there is a paucity of data regarding device‐associated valvular complications. We sought to pool existing data to understand its incidence, management, and outcomes. Methods An electronic search was conducted in October 2024 to identify studies reporting microaxial device–associated valvular complications that did not resolve with device explantation. A total of 26 case reports and case series, representing 27 patients, were included. Patient‐level data were extracted for analysis. Results The median age was 50 years [IQR 34–65], and 78% (21/27) were male. The indications for microaxial support were cardiogenic shock (85.2%, 23/27), coronary bypass grafting (7.4%, 2/27), and high‐risk percutaneous coronary intervention (7.4%, 2/27). The most commonly used devices were the Impella 5.0 (41%, 11/27) and Impella CP (22%, 6/27). Aortic regurgitation (AR) developed in 67% of patients (18/27). Mitral regurgitation (MR) developed in 33% (9/27) of patients, all of which were severe. The median duration of microaxial support was 10 [3–15] days. Overall, 74% (20/27) of patients underwent surgical management, 11% (3/27) underwent transcatheter treatment, and 15% (4/27) were managed nonoperatively. In‐hospital/30‐day mortality was 11% (3/27), including two deaths among patients with MR (22%) and one in a patient with AR (5.6%) with a pre‐existing bioprosthetic aortic valve ( p = 0.19). When considering the patients with only native valves and excluding the bioprosthetic aortic valve, mortality was significantly higher among MR patients compared to those with AR (MR: 22%; AR: 0%, p = 0.04). At a median follow‐up of 183 [30–365] days, overall survival was 89% (24/27). Conclusion AR was more common than MR; however, all MR cases were severe. MR may be associated with worse outcomes. Surgical management appears to be the most frequently employed strategy for valvular injury."

Cavalcante; Jyothy Puthumana; Akhil Narang; Judy Hung; James D. Thomas; Lauren S. Ranard; Vera H. Rigolin,10.1001/jamacardio.2025.4561,2025-12-17,JAMA Cardiology,"Importance Primary mitral regurgitation (MR) is a prevalent valvular lesion. Current American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association guidelines include class I recommendations for intervention for severe primary MR at the onset of symptoms, significant left ventricular (LV) enlargement (end-systolic dimension ≥40 mm), or dysfunction (ejection fraction ≤60%), with a class IIA recommendation for mitral valve repair when performed at an experienced surgical center. Recent data suggest a survival penalty when waiting for class I surgical guideline indications, and novel markers of decompensation are under investigation. Observations Comprehensive assessment of MR severity using echocardiography is critical, and when warranted, cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) is complementary. Assessment of LV size and function, as well as serial changes in both, is crucial for determining timing of surgery. New-onset atrial fibrillation, left atrial enlargement, pulmonary hypertension, and exercise-induced changes in LV function should also be considered in borderline scenarios. The roles of LV volumes, global longitudinal strain, CMR-derived measures of myocardial dysfunction, and cardiac biomarkers are worthy of further investigation regarding consideration for early surgical intervention. Conclusions and Relevance A more refined approach incorporating assessment of extravalvular cardiac injury, novel imaging markers, and biomarkers is needed to optimize surgical timing in primary MR. Further research is warranted to validate these emerging parameters and refine guidelines to improve patient outcomes."

However, some patients with severe aortic stenosis exhibit eccentric remodeling with enlarged left ventricular cavities, enabling a normal flow, low ejection fraction ( NF ‐ LEF ) phenotype. We assessed the prevalence, hemodynamic characteristics, and post‐transcatheter aortic valve implantation outcomes of NF ‐ LEF . Methods In this substudy of the COMPARE‐TAVI 1 trial, 979 patients undergoing transfemoral transcatheter aortic valve implantation were stratified by left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) (&lt; or ≥50%) and stroke volume index (&lt; or ≥35 mL/m 2 ) into 4 groups: normal flow, normal LVEF, NF‐LEF, low flow, normal ejection fraction, and low flow, low ejection fraction. Results NF‐LEF was observed in 10.7% of patients. Reduced LVEF was associated with previous myocardial infarction, pacemakers, New York Heart Association class &gt;2, atrial fibrillation, moderate or worse mitral regurgitation, and larger left ventricular cavities ( P &lt;0.001) with eccentric hypertrophy ( P =0.004). Compared with low‐flow, low‐ejection fraction, patients with NF‐LEF more frequently had moderate or worse aortic regurgitation ( P =0.007), whereas low flow, low ejection fraction showed poorer diastolic indices, suggesting diastolic dysfunction with high left ventricular filling pressures. Patients with low flow, normal ejection fraction were the most symptomatic and showed less improvement in 6‐minute walk distance at 1 year compared with normal flow, normal ejection fraction. During follow‐up, both low‐flow groups demonstrated significant increases in stroke volume index ( P &lt;0.001), whereas LVEF also improved among patients with reduced LVEF ( P &lt;0.001). Conclusions NF‐LEF is a prevalent aortic stenosis phenotype characterized by preserved flow despite reduced LVEF, likely driven by eccentric remodeling with moderate or worse aortic regurgitation and more favorable diastolic properties, with similar survival and time‐to‐event outcomes across phenotypes after transcatheter aortic valve implantation at long‐term follow‐up. Despite higher comorbidity burdens, patients with NF‐LEF showed functional and clinical improvements comparable with normal flow, normal ejection fraction, indicating a severe aortic stenosis phenotype."

Klautz; Michele De Bonis; Michael A. Borger; Patrick Perier,10.1093/ejcts/ezaf461,2025-12-17,European Journal of Cardio-Thoracic Surgery,"Abstract OBJECTIVES Mitral annular disjunction (MAD) is a structural abnormality of the mitral annulus fibrosus, associated with myxomatous leaflet degeneration, mitral valve prolapse (MVP), and ventricular arrhythmias. The combination of annular dilatation and abnormal annular motion increases mechanical stress on the mitral leaflets, triggering the degenerative process. METHODS This review summarizes the major pathophysiologic, diagnostic and therapeutic measures for the treatment of patients with MAD and an indication for mitral surgery. RESULTS The diagnosis is primarily based on non-invasive imaging techniques. Echocardiography is the first choice due to its ability to assess real-time mitral valve function. Cardiac Computed tomography and Magnetic Resonance Imaging provide more comprehensive information on the extend of MAD and the presence of calcifications. Indications for surgical mitral valve treatment are based on current recommendations. In cases with MAD and moderate mitral regurgitation, early intervention may be advocated in the presence of arrhythmogenic MVP. Long-term outcomes after treatment are assessed through multimodal imaging and electrocardiogram monitoring. A ring annuloplasty is an important cornerstone of treatment. Stabilization of the mitral annulus abolishes functional prolapse and increases the antiarrhythmic effect of mitral surgery. However, postoperative arrhythmic burden may persist in some cases, requiring continuous monitoring and sometimes an additional device therapy. CONCLUSIONS MAD represents a complex anatomical and functional entity associated with diagnostic challenges and rhythm abnormalities. Although the current indications for surgical treatment follow the recommendations for treatment of primary mitral regurgitation, early treatment may be important especially in patients with arrhythmias."
