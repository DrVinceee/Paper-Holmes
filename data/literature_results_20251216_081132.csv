PubMed,aortic stenosis,Percutaneous axillary vs femoral access for transcatheter aortic valve replacement: Insights from a 2164-patient study.,Nicola Corcione; Salvatore Giordano; Paolo Ferraro; Alberto Morello; Michele Cimmino; Michele Albanese; Raffaella Avellino; Giuseppe Biondi-Zoccai; Martino Pepe; Arturo Giordano,10.1016/j.ijcard.2025.134093,2025-12-13,International journal of cardiology,"Transaxillary (TAx) access is increasingly adopted for transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVR) in patients with challenging iliofemoral anatomy. We aimed at evaluating the early clinical outcomes of TAx vs transfemoral (TF) access for TAVR.
We conducted a retrospective observational study stemming from the prospective RISPEVA registry, including all consecutive patients undergoing TAVR since 2013 at our Institution, where TAx is the only alternative access site whenever TF is contraindicated.
A total of 2164 patients were included: 60 (2.8 %) in the TAx group, and 2104 (97.2 %) in the TF group. Notably, no patient required alternative accesses or was referred for surgical aortic valve replacement. Baseline characteristics, including surgical risk scores such as EuroScore II (TAx = 5.3 ± 5.7, TF = 3.6 ± 3.7, p < 0.001) and comorbidities such as prior myocardial infarction (TAx = 10 [17.2 %], TF = 157 [8.1 %], p = 0.025), were clearly disfavoring the TAx group. Despite higher procedural times in the TAx group (69 ± 24 vs 59 ± 13 min, p < 0.001), procedural success rates were high in both groups (TAx = 58 [96.7 %], TF = 2077 [98.7 %], p = 0.191). Similarly, at 1-month follow-up there were no significant differences in all-cause mortality (TAx = 1 [1.7 %], TF = 26 [1.2 %], p = 0.534), stroke (TAx = 1 [1.7 %], TF = 11 [0.5 %], p = 0.287), myocardial infarction (TAx = 1 [1.7 %], TF = 8 [0.4 %], p = 0.224), major vascular complication (TAx = 4 [6.7 %], TF = 90 [4.3 %], p = 0.329), or major bleeding (TAx = 1 [1.7 %], TF = 36 [1.7 %], p = 1), as well as their composite (TAx = 7 [11.7 %], TF = 155 [7.4 %], risk difference = 4.3 % [95 % confidence interval - 3.9 % to 12.5 %], p = 0.210). Similar findings were obtained at multivariable adjusted analyses and those based on inverse probability of treatment weighting, despite their limited reliability given low event-per-variable ratios and instability.
In this single-center retrospective study, TAx TAVR was feasible whenever TF was not envisionable, and yielded quite favorable short-term clinical outcomes. While promising, these findings remain descriptive and hypothesis-generating, thus requiring additional prospective and randomized validation."

The aim of this study was to compare the 1-year clinical outcomes, including valve performance, in patients undergoing TAVR with the S3UR compared to the SAPIEN 3 or SAPIEN 3 Ultra (S3/S3U). Patients with severe native aortic stenosis who underwent TAVR with either the S3UR or the S3/S3U valve were matched using propensity scores. Predictors of 1-year outcomes were identified. A subgroup analysis of patients who underwent post-TAVR CT was conducted. Among 4,908 patients, 312 matched pairs were assessed. At 1-year, compared to the S3/S3U group, the S3UR group exhibited lower all-cause mortality (HR: 0.42; 95% CI: 0.18-0.96; p = 0.041). The S3UR group demonstrated superior hemodynamic performance, including lower transvalvular gradients, larger effective orifice areas, and decreased incidence of severe prosthesis-patient mismatch and paravalvular leak. In patients who underwent post-TAVR CT (n = 280), prevalence of hypoattenuated leaflet thickening (HALT) at 30-day was lower in the S3UR group compared to S3/S3U (5.7% vs 16.2%; p = 0.006). In multivariate analysis, the S3UR group was independently associated with lower 1-year mortality and reduced HALT. In this propensity score-matched cohort, compared with the S3/S3U group, the S3UR group demonstrated favorable clinical outcomes and superior hemodynamic performance. In subgroup analysis, S3UR was also associated with a lower HALT incidence."
PubMed,aortic stenosis,Impact of clonal hematopoiesis of indeterminate potential on prognosis in patients with severe aortic valve stenosis: a meta-analysis.,Huang Sun; Ruijie Li; Xingyu Cao; Huawei Wang; Peng Ding; Yan Ang; Xiying Guo,10.1007/s00392-025-02823-0,2025-12-15,Clinical research in cardiology : official journal of the German Cardiac Society,"Clonal hematopoiesis of indeterminate potential (CHIP), commonly involving TET2 and DNMT3A mutations, is increasingly recognized as a cardiovascular risk factor, but its prognostic role in severe aortic valve stenosis (AVS) remains unclear. This study aimed to systematically evaluate the impact of CHIP on survival in AVS patients undergoing valve replacement.
A systematic search of PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, and Scopus through May 2025 identified observational studies of CHIP in AVS patients undergoing valve replacement. Eligible studies used validated genomic sequencing methods to identify CHIP and reported mortality outcomes. Two reviewers independently extracted study characteristics, outcomes, and related variables. Pooled hazard ratios (HRs) were calculated, with subgroup analyses by mutation type and geographic region, and meta-regression to assess effect modifiers. Risk of bias was assessed using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale, and sensitivity and publication bias analyses were also assessed.
Five studies with 1,175 patients were included. CHIP showed a non-significant trend toward increased all-cause mortality (HR = 1.58; 95% CI: 0.97-2.57; P = 0.0687; I2 = 64.8%). When defined by TET2 mutations, CHIP was significantly associated with worse survival (HR = 1.91; 95% CI: 1.43-2.56; P < 0.001, I2 = 0%), whereas DNMT3A mutations were not. In Western cohorts, CHIP was significantly associated with increased mortality (HR = 1.65; 95% CI: 1.28-2.12; P < 0.0001; I2 = 38.7%). Meta-regression identified body mass index (BMI) as a significant modifier of the CHIP-mortality association (P = 0.0069).
CHIP, particularly TET2-related mutations, is associated with poorer survival in patients with severe AVS undergoing valve replacement. In Western populations, CHIP was significantly associated with increased mortality. Higher BMI further strengthened this association across all patients. These findings indicate that CHIP may be a potential marker for risk stratification and preventive strategies, but confirmation in larger and more diverse cohorts is required."

Case reports,"Anomalous coronary artery from the opposite sinus is a rare congenital anomaly with potentially fatal outcomes. Anomalous right coronary artery (ARCA) with a malignant interarterial course is strongly linked to sudden cardiac death Beyond description of anatomy, optimal management requires careful diagnostic evaluation and individualized decision-making.
We present 3 cases of ARCA with malignant interarterial course: 1) an 80-year-old man with severe aortic stenosis, 2) a 61-year-old woman with exertional angina and interarterial narrowing, and 3) a 25-year-old asymptomatic woman with ventricular ectopy and significant proximal narrowing. Each case highlights unique diagnostic challenges and therapeutic considerations.
Coronary computed tomography angiography is the gold standard for defining anatomy, whereas functional testing, cardiac magnetic resonance, and invasive imaging refine risk stratification. Management ranges from surveillance with lifestyle modification in low-risk, asymptomatic patients to surgical correction (unroofing, reimplantation, or coronary artery bypass grafting) in young or high-risk individuals. We summarize these principles in a practical flowchart to guide clinicians.
Early recognition, structured diagnostic work-up, and risk-based individualized management are essential to prevent adverse outcomes in ARCA. This case series provides both illustrative clinical examples and an evidence-based framework for evaluation and management."

We studied predictors of progression and clinical outcomes in moderate AS to improve risk stratification and add to the existing literature.
Data collected through the Tempus Next care pathway intelligence platform at our tertiary referral center were retrospectively analyzed. The reports of echocardiograms performed from October 2017 to January 2020 were screened for descriptive or quantitative evidence of moderate AS. Follow-up extended until January 2022. Clinical data were extracted following manual chart review. Socioeconomic variables were collected based on zip-code-aggregated United States census data. The endpoints were progression from moderate to severe valvular AS, all-cause mortality, all-cause hospitalization, and heart failure (HF) hospitalization. The final multivariable model was selected using a variable selection algorithm inspired by greedy causal discovery algorithms.
A total of 34 450 echocardiograms (N = 25 204 patients) were screened during the inclusion period; 367 patients met inclusion criteria and were included in the final analysis. Progression to severe AS was noted in 172 patients (median time to progression 16 months). The final predictive models after variable selection exhibited modest predictive power: progression to severe AS, AUC = 0.68; all-cause mortality, 0.797; all-cause hospitalization, 0.629; heart failure hospitalization, 0.744. Variables predictive for the endpoints included comorbidities, echocardiographic variables, and demographics.
Our findings support further work and exploration of a paradigm shift in the assessment and management of AS, moving beyond traditional measures to a multiparametric model incorporating a broader spectrum of clinical, echocardiographic, and socioeconomic variables."

Simple biomarkers to predict mid-term mortality are still needed. This study evaluated the prognostic value of the preprocedural neutrophil percentage-to-albumin ratio (NPAR) for 2-year all-cause mortality after TAVR.
A total of 618 patients undergoing TAVR between 2013 and 2023 were retrospectively analyzed. NPAR was calculated as neutrophil percentage × 100 / albumin (g/dL), and patients were classified into tertiles. The prognostic role of NPAR was assessed using Cox regression, Kaplan-Meier survival analysis, and receiver operating characteristic curves.
Baseline characteristics were similar across tertiles, but higher NPAR was associated with elevated inflammation and lower albumin levels. In multivariable Cox analysis, high NPAR independently predicted 2-year mortality (T3 vs. T1: hazard ratio [HR] 2.75, 95% CI 1.77-4.28; P < .001). In a model including both categorical NPAR and Society of Thoracic Surgeons Predicted Risk of Mortality (STS-PROM), tertile 3 of NPAR (HR 2.49, 95% CI 1.61-3.85; P < .001) and STS-PROM (HR 1.31, 95% CI 1.12-1.53; P = .001) remained independent predictors, indicating incremental prognostic value of NPAR beyond established surgical risk scores. Kaplan-Meier curves showed the lowest survival in the highest tertile (35.9% mortality at 2 years). Receiver operating characteristic analysis confirmed NPAR had the best discriminatory ability (area under the curve = 0.703).
Preprocedural NPAR is an independent, low-cost, and readily available biomarker for predicting mid-term mortality after TAVR. Its integration into risk models may improve prediction accuracy and help guide patient management."

We report a 12-day-old male neonate presenting with respiratory distress, edema, and oliguria. Physical examination revealed a grade 2/6 systolic murmur at the left sternal border. Echocardiography identified PFAA with coarctation, IAA, PDA, and an atrial septal defect (ASD), confirmed by cardiac CT. Surgical intervention included aortic arch repair, fifth arch excision, and ASD closure. The postoperative recovery was smooth, and the patient remained clinically well with normal cardiac function during the 1-year follow-up period. This case underscores the critical role of echocardiography in early diagnosis and surgical planning for complex congenital heart disease."

To compare the long-term outcomes between the BE-THV and SE-THV.
We retrospectively analyzed 1054 patients undergoing transfemoral transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) for tricuspid aortic valve stenosis with LAA, defined as an annulus area > 430 mm2, using either a BE-THV (SAPIEN 3, Edwards Life Sciences) or SE-THV (Evolut R/PRO, Medtronic). The 7-year cumulative incidences of all-cause mortality and bioprosthetic valve failure (BVF) were evaluated in the overall cohort and the propensity score (PS)-matched cohort.
Among the 1054 patients with LAA, 829 (78.7 %) received a BE-THV. The PS-matched population resulted in 218 pairs. The cumulative incidence of all-cause mortality 7 years after TAVI was comparable between the BE-THV and SE-THV groups in the overall cohort (58.6 % vs. 67.6 %, log-rank P = 0.848) and the PS-matched cohort (53.2 % vs. 69.9 %, log-rank P = 0.173). In the overall cohort, the BE-THV group demonstrated a lower exposure-adjusted BVF rate as compared with the SE-THV, although the difference was not significant (6.1 vs. 9.6 events per 1000 patient-years, P = 0.258). This trend became pronounced after PS matching (3.3 vs. 9.9 events per 1000 patient-years, P = 0.017), which was also confirmed by Gray's test (P = 0.032).
In the current analysis focusing on patients with LAA, the BE-THV and SE-THV groups had a comparable long-term prognosis, but the BE-THV group had a lower BVF rate than did the SE-THV group.

This study aimed to characterize the specific causes of LF, their prevalence, and prognostic significance.
In 408 patients with severe LFAS included, the aetiology of LF was identified. The primary endpoint was the composite of all-cause death and hospitalizations for heart failure (HF) up to 36 months. Secondary endpoints included individual components of the primary endpoint and cardiovascular mortality.
The most common LF cause was reduced LVEF (n = 228, 55.9%), while preserved LVEF included five aetiologies: (1)mixed aetiologies (n = 65, 36.1%), (2)small LV cavity (n = 58, 32.2%), (3)significant isolated mitral regurgitation (n = 39, 21.7%), (4)significant isolated tricuspid regurgitation (n = 13, 7.2%), (5)significant isolated mitral stenosis (n = 5, 2.8%). Over a median follow-up of 15 (IQR 6 - 36) months obtained in 302 patients, 159 (52.6%) reached the primary composite endpoint, 108 (35.8%) died and 91 (30.8%) were hospitalized due to HF. LF aetiology was not associated with outcomes. Independent predictors of the primary endpoint were severe MR (adj.HR 1.71, p = 0.04) and TR (adj.HR 1.47, p = 0.04). Aortic valve replacement (adj.HR 0.76, p < 0.001) and mean transvalvular gradient ≥ 40 mmHg (adj.HR 0.39, p < 0.001) were protective.
The main cause of LFAS is reduced LVEF, while in preserved LVEF mixed causes and small LV volume prevailed, without association with the outcome. Severe mitral and tricuspid regurgitation were strongly associated with worse outcomes, while valve replacement and mean transvalvular gradient ≥ 40 mmHg emerged as protective factors."

However, temporal trends in mortality remains poorly understood. This study aimed to compare survival after urgent versus elective TAVR using a reconstructed individual patient data (IPD) meta-analysis.
PubMed, Embase, and Scopus were searched through August 2025. Studies reporting Kaplan-Meier (KM) survival curves for urgent versus elective TAVR were included. Survival data were digitally extracted from published KM curves, and IPD were reconstructed algorithmically using a two-stage approach. Kaplan-Meier curves and Cox frailty models estimated survival and hazard ratios (HRs). Landmark analysis at one-year post-procedure and restricted mean survival time (RMST) were also employed to compare survival.
Eleven studies including 77,108 patients were identified. Kaplan-Meier curves were available for 76,108 patients (urgent: 5,683; elective: 71,425) and used for reconstructed IPD analysis. Urgent TAVR was associated with higher early mortality (HR 1.83, 95% CI: 1.73-1.93; p < 0.001), with convergence beyond one year (HR 1.01, 95% CI: 0.84-1.22; p = 0.83). RMST analysis demonstrated a 6.5-month overall survival advantage in favor of elective TAVR (p = 0.001).
Urgent TAVR is associated with significantly increased early mortality compared with elective TAVR. These findings highlight the prognostic implications of procedural timing and support early referral for elective intervention in patients with severe AS."

As indications expand toward younger, low-risk and asymptomatic patients, the clinical paradigm is shifting from isolated valvular intervention to lifetime valve management. This requires balancing procedural planning to optimize the index procedure with long-term considerations, including prosthesis durability, coronary re-accessibility, need for TAVI-in-TAVI, and risk of patient-prosthesis mismatch and conduction abnormalities. Prosthesis and patient-related challenges remain central. Bicuspid aortic valve and small aortic annulus are anatomical features associated with an increased post-TAVI risk of paravalvular leak, patient-prosthesis mismatch, and conduction disturbances, though outcomes have improved with new-generation devices and meticulous preprocedural planning. Durability concerns are particularly relevant in younger patients, with TAVI-in-TAVI offering a feasible reintervention strategy yet raising issues of coronary re-access and potential patient-prosthesis mismatch. Conduction disturbances and permanent pacemaker implantation remain frequent after TAVI, underscoring the importance of implantation techniques and physiologic pacing strategies. Furthermore, concomitant coronary artery disease requires individualized revascularization strategies, with an increasing role of invasive physiological assessment. Beyond device-related factors, medical therapy may favourably influence clinical outcomes in patients undergoing TAVI, both in pre- and post-procedural setting. In this era of expanding indications, achieving durable, favourable outcomes requires a comprehensive approach that integrates anatomical and clinical considerations, individualized device selection, careful lifetime planning, and optimization of pharmacologic therapy."

Left atrial (LA) dysfunction is an established prognostic marker in various clinical settings. This study aimed to evaluate the correlation between LA function, assessed by strain parameters, and the incidence of permanent pacemaker (PPM) implantation or major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) in patients with SAS undergoing TAVI. A total of 157 patients with SAS treated with TAVI between January 2019 and April 2021 were screened. Patients with pre-existing cardiac implanted devices or permanent atrial fibrillation were excluded. The mean follow-up was 24 ± 13 months. LA function was assessed using transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) by measuring three strain parameters: LA reservoir strain (LASr), LA conduit strain (LASct), and LA contractile strain (LAScd). The study endpoints were the association between these strain parameters and the occurrence of PPM implantation or MACE during follow-up. Ninety-nine patients were included in the analysis. During follow-up, 43 patients experienced MACE. Mean values for LASr, LASct, and LAScd were 29.5 ± 12.7%, -18.7 ± 11.0%, and - 18.5 ± 7.3%, respectively. Patients requiring PPM implantation showed significantly reduced LA strain values compared to those who did not (LASr: 13.1% vs. 33.2%; LASct: -10.1% vs. -21.0%; LAScd: -6.7% vs. -21.6%, p < 0.001). Similarly, patients who developed MACE had reduced strain values compared to those without events (LASr: 21.9% vs. 35.4%; LASct: -14.3% vs. -21.8%; LAScd: -9.9% vs. -25.5%, p < 0.001). Pre-TAVI LA dysfunction, assessed through LA strain, is closely associated with increased risk of PPM implantation and MACE."

This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to quantify the peri-operative risks in patients with aortic stenosis undergoing non-cardiac surgery.
Following the development of our search strategy, we searched databases for relevant studies. The primary endpoint was all-cause in-hospital or 30-day mortality associated with aortic stenosis in patients undergoing non-cardiac surgery. Secondary endpoints included: myocardial infarction; heart failure; stroke; delirium; venous thromboembolism; and acute kidney injury.
Nineteen studies involving 100,486 patients were included. The estimated all-cause mortality was 3.8% (95%CI 3.7-3.9%) for patients with any degree of aortic stenosis and 9.6% (95%CI 7.7-12.1%) for those with severe aortic stenosis. A meta-analysis of 14 comparative studies involving 2,885,254 patients revealed significantly increased mortality in patients with aortic stenosis compared with those without aortic stenosis (relative risk 1.58, 95%CI 1.18-2.12, p < 0.001). Aortic stenosis was also associated with an elevated risk of postoperative myocardial infarction (relative risk 1.79, 95%CI 1.2-2.67, p < 0.001) and heart failure (relative risk 2.06, 95%CI 1.19-3.59, p < 0.001).
Aortic stenosis in patients undergoing non-cardiac surgery is associated with a three-fold relative increase in the risk of mortality. These results highlight the need for further delineation of which surgical procedures are associated with the greatest risk of poor peri-operative outcomes to guide heightened surveillance protocols, optimised peri-operative management and thresholds for pre-operative intervention."

We report a rare case of a ruptured dissecting aneurysm involving the anterior radiculomedullary artery of the cervical spinal cord, precipitated by angiography of a hypoplastic vertebral artery.
Cerebral computed tomography angiography (CTA) revealed severe stenosis of the M1 segment of the right middle cerebral artery in a 70-year-old woman who presented with paroxysmal weakness affecting the left upper and lower limbs. Dual antiplatelet therapy with aspirin and clopidogrel was initiated. On day 3, cerebral digital subtraction angiography (DSA) was performed. During continuous contrast injection into the right hypoplastic vertebral artery, the anterior radiculomedullary artery-a branch of the vertebral artery at the C6 vertebral level-underwent luminal dilation and subsequently ruptured, resulting in extensive extravasation of contrast medium into the spinal subarachnoid space. Non-contrast head CT confirmed widespread subarachnoid hemorrhage. Following 10 days of conservative medical management, follow-up head CT demonstrated complete resolution of the hemorrhage. The patient was discharged without significant neurological deficits and remained free of recurrent subarachnoid hemorrhage during a 3-year clinical follow-up period.
The occurrence of a ruptured dissecting aneurysm of the anterior radiculomedullary artery induced by vertebral angiography is exceedingly rare. We hypothesize that the sustained high-pressure and high-volume injection of contrast medium was responsible for the arterial dissection and subsequent rupture.

The role of angiographic lesion characteristics in predicting this discordance remains unclear.
To identify angiographic predictors of FFR/iFR discordance and define distinct angiographic phenotypes using unsupervised machine learning.
This prospective, single-center registry evaluated 401 intermediate coronary lesions from 221 patients with severe AS (aortic valve area < 1.0 cm2, mean gradient >40 mmHg) using FFR and iFR. Quantitative coronary angiography measured percent diameter stenosis (%DS), lesion length (LL), and other parameters. The primary outcome was FFR/iFR discordance. Receiver operating characteristic and decision curve analyses evaluated %DS predictive utility. K-means clustering was applied to %DS and LL to identify lesion phenotypes.
FFR/iFR discordance occurred in 30 lesions (7.5 %), exclusively as FFR-negative/iFR-positive pattern. Higher %DS was the only independent angiographic predictor of discordance (adjusted OR 1.35 per 10 % increase; 95 % CI 1.12-1.64; p = 0.002), with modest discriminative ability (AUC = 0.69). Cluster analysis identified three phenotypes: Cluster 0 (High %DS [median 75.0 %]/Intermediate LL [median 15.0 mm], n = 103); Cluster 1 (Low %DS [median 49.0 %]/Short-Intermediate LL [median 13.6 mm], n = 220); and Cluster 2 (Intermediate %DS [median 63.5 %]/Long LL [median 32.4 mm], n = 78). Discordance incidence was highest in Cluster 0 (16.5 %) versus Clusters 1 (2.7 %) and 2 (9.0 %) (p < 0.001).
In severe AS, FFR/iFR discordance manifests solely as FFR-negative/iFR-positive pattern. While %DS modestly predicts this mismatch, unsupervised clustering reveals that ""High %DS / Intermediate Length"" lesions primarily drive physiological discordance, identifying cases where iFR may overestimate severity due to AS-related hemodynamics."

Case reports,"Balloon entrapment during transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) is a rare but serious complication, especially in patients with severe valve calcification.
A 78-year-old woman with symptomatic severe aortic stenosis (peak velocity 7.23 m/s, preserved left ventricular ejection fraction 70%) underwent TAVR. After valve deployment, the balloon became entrapped within the prosthesis. Controlled postdilation was performed to disrupt the valve frame mesh, successfully releasing the balloon. The patient recovered well; at nearly 3 years of follow-up, she remains asymptomatic without rehospitalization for heart failure or neurologic events.
This case highlights the role of controlled postdilation as a safe and effective bailout strategy for balloon entrapment during TAVR. Reviewing the literature, balloon entrapment is rare but potentially life-threatening, and prompt recognition with appropriate technical solutions is critical for favorable outcomes.
Balloon entrapment during TAVR is rare but can be effectively managed with controlled postdilation, particularly in patients with severe calcification. Ensuring correct guidewire position in the left ventricle, confirmed by multiple fluoroscopic views, helps prevent balloon entrapment by avoiding passage through the stent mesh."

Transcatheter edge-to-edge repair (TEER) is an established treatment for MR in high surgical risk patients. The combined impact of AF and MR mechanisms on TEER outcomes is not yet investigated.
Patients who underwent TEER were classified by MR mechanism: degenerative (DMR), atrial functional (aFMR) or ventricular functional (vFMR). The cohort was further stratified by combination of MR mechanism and baseline AF status. The primary endpoint was event-free survival (freedom from HF hospitalization or all-cause mortality), estimated by Kaplan-Meier. Multivariate Cox regression adjusted for confounders.
This study included 221 consecutive TEER procedures; AF was present in 50.2 % of patients. TEER achieved reduction in MR severity and immediate left-atrial unloading across mechanisms. One-year survival and event-free survival were 87.8 % and 74.7 %, respectively. Event-free survival was lower with AF than with sinus rhythm (P = 0.027), and higher in DMR than with FMR (P = 0.016). In multivariable analysis, AF remained independently associated with the composite outcome. When mechanism and rhythm were combined, aFMR and vFMR with AF carried ~3-fold higher adjusted hazards versus DMR without AF (adjHR∼2.7-3.0).
AF, more than MR mechanism, was strongly associated with HF hospitalization or death after TEER; the poorest clinical outcomes were observed in aFMR and in vFMR with AF despite similar acute MR reduction and left-atrial unloading. These findings support the hypothesis that in significant MR without AF, earlier TEER may improve outcome before AF develops."

The risk of iatrogenic mitral stenosis (MS) remains a concern, particularly in patients requiring multiple clips, since the mitral valve orifice area (MVA) is reduced. The value of conventional flow-based echocardiographic methods to rule out MS is limited by intraprocedural and general anesthesia (GA)-induced hemodynamic variability. This retrospective study introduces the novel adaptation of a 3-dimensional (3D) Orifice Area (3DOA) technique to evaluate post-TEER MVA. We evaluated the degree of agreement between MVAs derived via TEE 3DOA, TEE pressure half-time (PHT), and postprocedure transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) PHT with patients awake.
TEE and TTE images from 20 adult patients with severe mitral regurgitation undergoing a TEER (MitraClip, Abbott) procedure were retrospectively reviewed. MVAs obtained by MTEE 3DOA and TEE PHT under GA were compared to those acquired with TTE PHT with patients awake. Agreement was assessed via calculation of Bland-Altman 95% limits of agreement and Lin's concordance correlation coefficients, both with 95% confidence intervals (CIs).
There was good agreement between TEE 3DOA-derived MVA measurements under GA and TTE PHT-derived MVA measurements in awake patients, as reflected by Bland-Altman (lower limit of agreement: -.0.45 [95% CI, -.58 to -.31] and upper limit of agreement: 0.26 [95% CI, 0.12-0.4]), and an excellent concordance correlation coefficient value (0.95 [95% CI, 0.86-0.98]). In contrast, agreement between TEE PHT-derived MVA and TTE PHT-derived MVA was weak, with much broader limits of agreement (lower limit of agreement: -1.6 [95% CI, -2.19 to -1.02] and upper limit of agreement: 1.43 [95% CI, 0.84-2.01]) and a weak concordance correlation coefficient value (0.46 [95% CI, 0.02-0.75]).
In this retrospective cohort study, we demonstrated excellent agreement between TEE-3DOA-derived MVA under GA and TTE PHT-derived MVA in awake patients, but not between TEE versus TTE PHT. These findings warrant further validation in larger patient datasets to assess the utility of 3D echocardiographic approaches in evaluating MVA after TEER."

Sex-specific analyses were performed using Cox proportional hazards analysis, adjusted for significant covariates. A total of 1245 patients with SMR (43% female) were included. Females more often had atrial SMR (233 (29%) females vs. 200 (21%) males, p < 0.01), males more often ischemic SMR (100 females (12%) vs. 245 males (25%), p < 0.01), and there were no significant differences between sexes in the proportion of non-ischemic SMR (199 (25%) females vs. 268 (28%) males, p = 0.99). The estimated 5-year survival was 70% (CI = 68%, 73%). Median follow-up was 4.3 years [2.7-6.2], 236 males and 128 females died during follow-up. Females had a better survival than males in a multivariable Cox model (HR = 0.67, p < 0.01).
Overall survival in patients with SMR was low with an estimated 5-year survival of 70%. Females had a better survival in patients with SMR than males. The lower survival in males with SMR might be due to a larger proportion of atrial SMR in females, fewer patients with ischemic SMR, and lower ejection fractions in males with non-ischemic SMR. The current focus on rapid heart failure medication optimization may improve the prognosis of the most vulnerable group; future studies can be directed to see whether this will be the case."

However, adequate management of cardiotoxicity in this setting remains unclear. A 55-year-old female patient with metastatic breast cancer was admitted due to heart failure after finishing chemotherapy with palbociclib. Transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) showed a left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) of 30% and severe mitral regurgitation (MR). Under the suspicion of cardiomyopathy temporally associated with prior palbociclib treatment, quadruple therapy with angiotensin receptor-neprilysin inhibitor (ARNI), betablockers, mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist (MRA), and sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitor (iSLGT2) was initiated. Three months after medical therapy, the patient recovered LVEF up to 56%, and there was not MR on control TTE. This case illustrates that quadruple therapy for heart failure may be a viable option to achieve complete LVEF recovery in a case of cardiomyopathy occurring after palbociclib exposure."

Here, we seek to compare the energetic phenotype of volume-overload pathological hypertrophy with athletic hypertrophy and with the normal heart under catecholamine stress.
Nineteen severe-MR patients underwent cardiac magnetic resonance and 31P-spectroscopy for energetics, including phosphocreatine to adenosine triphosphate ratio (PCr/ATP), the pseudo-first-order forward rate constant of the creatine kinase reaction (k f) and CK flux (k f × [PCr]). When compared with 20 healthy controls, severe MR was associated with lower PCr/ATP (1.58 ± 0.32 vs. 2.08 ± 0.28, P < 0.001). This is related to the severity of regurgitation (r -0.59, P < 0.001) but not to LVEF (r -0.20, P = 0.23) or LV systolic strain (P = 0.18). When compared to 17 athletes with similarly increased end-diastolic volume (athletes 107 ± 10 mL/m2 vs. 114 ± 22, P = 0.29), severe MR had greater total cardiac output (by 42%, P < 0.001), and lower PCr/ATP (by 28%, P < 0.001) and CK flux (by 41%, P = 0.04). When compared to normal hearts during dobutamine stress at matched cardiac output levels, median k f (by 45%, P = 0.08) and CK flux (by 53%, P = 0.02) were lower in severe MR. PCr/ATP increased (by 17%, P = 0.04) following mitral valve repair (MVR) in a subset of patients (n = 14, median 7 months). Seven patients during MVR and six patients without volume loading donated LV biopsy, revealing that creatine was not lower in severe MR.
Even with normal LVEF, severe MR is associated with reduced PCr/ATP, CK k f, and CK flux. PCr/ATP reduction resolved with MVR. Thus, targeting CK capacity and/or flux may be a therapeutic strategy to prevent/treat systolic failure in MR."

Additionally, we assessed the RV reverse remodelling (RVRR) based on 3D volumes and ejection fraction six months after the procedure.
Data from 74 patients treated with TEER for FMR were prospectively collected. Pre-procedural RVD, defined as 3D RVEF ≤45%, was observed in 47 patients (63.5%).

We aimed to investigate how remodelling of the left ventricle and left atrium impacts the mitral annulus size and function in patients with transmural myocardial infarction.
In this prospective observational study, patients with ST-elevation myocardial infarction were examined with 3D echocardiography at admission and at 1-year follow-up (n = 87). Size and function of the left cardiac chambers and the mitral annulus was analysed. The cohort was divided into groups with (n = 16) or without (n = 71) mitral annular remodelling, defined as an area increase of 15% or more, from baseline to follow-up. During follow-up, the group without mitral annular remodelling had stable volumes and improved function for both the left ventricle and the left atrium. Although the group with mitral annular remodelling also exhibited improved left ventricular function, both left ventricular volume and left atrial volume increased, and no improvement was seen in left atrial emptying fraction or left atrial reservoir or contractile strain. In linear regression analysis, increased mitral annular area at follow-up was associated with change in both left atrial [β = 0.025 (0.007, 0.043), P = 0.006] and left ventricular volume [β = 0.014 (0.003, 0.025), P = 0.012].
Mitral annular remodelling after transmural myocardial infarction is associated with increased volumes of the left ventricle and the left atrium, and absence of atrial functional improvement. Both increasing left atrial and left ventricular volume are associated with mitral annular dilatation, but left atrial volume is the strongest factor."
PubMed,mitral regurgitation,Early and mid-term outcomes of mitral annular calcification and transcatheter mitral therapy: a systematic review.,Yosuke Sakurai; Ashton McDonald; Tsuyoshi Kaneko,10.21037/acs-2025-mac-0128,2025-11-30,Annals of cardiothoracic surgery,"Mitral annular calcification (MAC) poses technical and clinical challenges in patients undergoing mitral valve intervention. Patients with severe MAC were excluded from major previous randomized controlled trials evaluating mitral therapies. Consequently, outcomes following mitral transcatheter edge-to-edge repair (M-TEER) in this population remain controversial.
MEDLINE and EMBASE were searched through June 2025 to identify studies reporting outcomes after M-TEER in patients with MAC. This systematic review assessed the difference in MAC grading and M-TEER eligibility across studies. The definition of procedural success was documented to highlight inconsistencies. The primary endpoint was all-cause mortality during follow-up. Secondary endpoints included procedural success, heart failure rehospitalization, mitral valve reintervention, residual mitral regurgitation (MR), and mean mitral gradient.
Six studies met inclusion criteria, including 2,808 patients undergoing M-TEER, of whom 363 (12.9%) had moderate-to-severe MAC. Most studies defined procedural success as MR reduction to grade ≤2, though only one incorporated a mean transmitral gradient <5 mmHg. MR reduction to ≤2 rates were comparable between patients with none-mild MAC and moderate-severe MAC. However, device success (MR reduction ≤2 and mean gradient <5 mmHg) was significantly lower in MAC patients (56.1% versus 81.3%). Post-procedural mitral valve gradient >5 mmHg occurred in 18.5-48.3% of MAC cases. Two studies reported increased all-cause mortality in patients with moderate-severe MAC during follow-up, with a mean follow-up of 20.4 months. Residual MR and reintervention rates were generally similar between groups, though mitral valve gradients tended to be higher in MAC patients.
M-TEER is feasible in well-selected patients with moderate-to-severe MAC; however, elevated post-procedural gradients remain a concern and may impact long-term outcomes.

We reviewed adult patients undergoing MV surgery at our Clinic between January 2000 and December 2024. MAC was identified on preoperative imaging, and operative strategy prioritized repair when feasible and employed conservative debridement when necessary. Patients with MAC were matched 1:1 with patients without MAC using a propensity score.
Among 11,350 MV operations with or without concomitant procedures, 1,603 patients (14.1%) had MAC, the median age was 72.6 years [interquartile range (IQR), 65.3-78.6 years], 54.8% were female. In the MAC cohort, 21% of patients had a prior sternotomy. Concomitant aortic valve replacement (AVR) and coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) were performed in 32% and 24% of cases, respectively. Compared with propensity-matched controls, MAC patients did not exhibit significantly prolonged cardiopulmonary bypass times (115 vs. 112 minutes, P=0.485) or aortic cross-clamp durations (86 vs. 81 minutes, P=0.273). The 30-day hospital readmission rate was significantly higher among MAC patients (15.9% vs. 9.9%, P<0.001). Although 30-day mortality was elevated in the MAC group (5.8% vs. 4.2%), the difference was not statistically significant (P=0.171). In a subgroup analysis of matched groups undergoing primary isolated MV surgery, early mortality was 2.7% in patients with MAC and 0.5% in patients without MAC (P=0.111). Long-term, 10-year survival was significantly lower in MAC patients (43.6%) compared to matched controls (49.6%, P<0.001).
In this large single-center series, patients with MAC often had associated aortic valve and coronary artery disease, and 21% of them were undergoing a second procedure. Compared to matched patients without MAC, long-term survival was reduced in patients with MAC. This experience highlights the importance of accurate preoperative assessment and tailored surgical strategy to achieve acceptable outcomes of MV surgery in the presence of MAC."

This study evaluates the early outcomes of ultrasonic emulsification and aspiration using a novel device to facilitate mitral valve repair.
We conducted a prospective, single-centre, single-surgeon series of 27 consecutive patients with moderate-to-severe MAC and degenerative mitral regurgitation (MR) undergoing Sonopet-assisted decalcification between June 2023 and July 2025. Procedures were performed via median sternotomy or endoscopic mini-thoracotomy. Ultrasonic aspiration was used to remove and sculpt MAC, enabling annular remodelling and secure repair. The primary outcome was repair success and residual regurgitation; secondary outcomes included mortality and perioperative complications.
Mitral repair was successfully performed in 26 patients (96.3%), with one conversion to replacement. There were no in-hospital deaths, strokes, atrioventricular (AV) groove disruptions, or reoperations. At discharge, 96.3% had none or mild residual MR; one patient (3.7%) had moderate MR. Mean coaptation length was 10.3±3.2 mm. Postoperative complications included new-onset atrial fibrillation in five patients (18.5%) and permanent pacemaker implantation in two (7.4%). Sternotomy approach was used in 63% and endoscopic mini-thoracotomy in 37%. Mean cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) and cross-clamp times were 159.6±46.8 and 116.9±46.5 min, respectively. Most mitral repairs addressed isolated posterior leaflet prolapse (66.7%) or bileaflet prolapse (22.2%). Primary repair strategies included leaflet resection (51.9%), isolated neochords (25.9%), or resection with neochords (22.2%). MAC decalcification was primarily performed in the posterior annulus.
Ultrasonic emulsification is a safe, effective adjunct for mitral valve repair in moderate-to-severe MAC, enabling precise decalcification and high repair rates with minimal complications. This approach may expand repair candidacy and merits further comparative studies with long-term follow-up."

Case reports,"Transcatheter aortic valve implantation is technically challenging in patients with predominant aortic regurgitation and preexisting mitral prosthetic heart valve.
To the best of our knowledge, this is the first reported case in which transcatheter aortic valve implantation was successfully performed for predominant severe aortic regurgitation with a history of 3 prior sternotomies: successively for mitral valve replacement with a Starr-Edwards valve, tricuspid valve repair, and subsequently tricuspid valve replacement.
This patient had large aortic annulus dimensions. Noticing predominant aortic regurgitation and mild valvular calcium, we were aiming at 15% to 20% oversizing of the transcatheter valve, which was achievable by overfilling the largest balloon-expandable valve. Having an incomplete understanding of potential aortomitral interaction based on computed tomography and echocardiography, we inflated a balloon at the aortic valve, which revealed significant interaction, leading us to use a self-expanding valve that had limited oversizing.
Identifying the aortomitral interaction in such cases can potentially avoid transcatheter aortic valve embolization."

In contrast, infections related to prosthetic valves (PVE), transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI), aortic vascular grafts and endografts (VGEI), cardiac implantable electronic devices (CIED), and ventricular assist devices (VAD) are increasing. This trend reflects an ageing population with complex devices, multiple comorbidities, and greater frailty, all of which contribute to higher susceptibility to device infection and bacteremia from other sources. In cardiovascular device carriers, bacteremia must be assessed for potential device infection. Key indicators include correlation within isolated microorganism, and type of device, interval between device implantation and bacteremia, peri-procedural complications in early infections, persistence of bacteremia, metastatic infection, absence of alternative focus, and time-to-positivity of blood cultures as a marker of bacterial load. Patient comorbidities, procedural complexity, and device-related factors further define risk. Risk scores validated for Gram-positive bacteremia assist in stratification and guide echocardiography, although none is specific for device carriers. Echocardiography remains central but has limited sensitivity in VGEI, CIED, and VAD infections. Diagnostic accuracy increases substantially when combining echocardiography, PET/CT, and multidetector CT angiography: in PVE, sensitivity improves from 75-83% to nearly 100%; in CIED, increase from 34% to 56%; and in VAD, pooled sensitivity and specificity are 95% and 91%. In daily practice, bacteremia in a device carrier should always trigger systematic risk assessment, multimodal imaging, and multidisciplinary discussion within a Cardiovascular Infection Team, expanding the traditional Endocarditis Team to address the rising burden of cardiovascular device-related bloodstream infections."

PM-AR-T is a semi-rigid annuloplasty ring based on a nickel-titanium alloy which has made progress in animal models, however, studies on PM-AR-T's performance in patients with tricuspid regurgitation (TR) are lacking. This study aimed to compare the efficacy and safety of the PM-AR-T with the Edwards MC3 ring for the TR treatment.
A non-inferiority, randomized controlled trial was conducted in 20 centers across China, enrolling patients with tricuspid valve disease requiring surgical repair. Patients were randomized to receive either PM-AR-T or Edwards MC3 ring. The primary endpoint was the success rate of valve repair at 6 months.
A total of 164 patients underwent valve annuloplasty, 83 and 81 in the PM-AR-T and Edwards MC3 groups. Valve repair success rates were 92.8% and 93.8% in the PM-AR-T and Edwards MC3 groups, demonstrating non-inferiority with a difference of -1.1% (95% confidence interval [CI]: -9.5 to 7.4), which was less than the pre-specified non-inferiority margin of -10%. No significant intergroup differences were found in valve regurgitation, echocardiographic parameters, and New York Heart Association (NYHA) functional classification at any postoperative time point. At 12 months, the proportions of patients without regurgitation were comparable, 30.4% and 27.8% in the PM-AR-T and Edwards MC3 groups (P = 0.705). Improvement to NYHA functional class I status was detected in 46.2% and 45.6% of the two groups by 12 months (P = 0.893). Both rings exhibited comparable safety profiles, with no device-related serious adverse events, cardiovascular deaths, major bleeding events, severe structural damage, infective endocarditis, or thromboembolic events.
The PM-AR-T tricuspid valve semi-rigid ring is effective in improving TR, demonstrating non-inferiority to the Edwards MC3 ring, with a favorable safety profile. Clinical Trial Registration: This study was registered at Chinese Clinical Trial Registry (ChiCTR2100043007)."

This study aimed to evaluate the prevalence, clinical profiles, and outcomes of heart disease (HD) among pregnant women referred to the Joint Clinic of Pregnancy and Heart Disease at Al-Zahra Hospital and assess the utility and limitations of the modified World Health Organization (mWHO) risk classification system.
We analyzed a retrospective cohort of 389 pregnant women with confirmed heart disease managed at the Joint Clinic of Pregnancy and Heart Disease, a tertiary referral center, Al-Zahra Hospital (Isfahan, Iran), between March 2017 and March 2023. Participants were followed until hospital discharge after delivery or pregnancy termination. Patients were stratified into mWHO risk classes and categorized by disease type, including congenital heart disease (CHD), valvular heart disease (VHD), cardiomyopathy, and other conditions. Clinical outcomes, including maternal mortality, abortion and delivery methods were examined.
VHD was the most prevalent condition (35.99%), followed by CHD (20.82%). Severe mitral stenosis and prosthetic heart valves were the most common VHD subtypes. Among CHD cases, atrial septal defect was predominant. Class IV mWHO patients comprised 21.85%, highlighting the high-risk population. Cesarean deliveries were common (53%). Maternal mortality was 1.0%, with four deaths mostly due to pulmonary hypertension.
The observed outcomes in this high-risk cohort compare favorably to those reported in similar LMIC settings, suggesting that structured multidisciplinary care and mWHO-based risk assessment may contribute to improved maternal and fetal management. However, overlapping and unclassified conditions highlight the need to refine current risk stratification frameworks for pregnancy in cardiac patients."

Suboptimal valve seating can elevate the transvalvular pressure gradient, while valve orientation and size may produce flow jets that impinge on the ascending aorta, potentially weakening the vessel wall. Such hemodynamic complications can compromise valve performance and patient outcomes. This study presents a computational fluid dynamics framework, derived from medical CT images, for preprocedural hemodynamic assessment of aortic valve replacement. The framework minimizes user input and delivers rapid results, enabling efficient evaluation of valve types, orientations, and their hemodynamic impact. The results demonstrate that non-optimal implantation angles substantially increase pressure drop across the valve, thereby imposing higher workload on the heart. This automated and efficient simulation framework demonstrates strong potential for clinical application, supporting precise planning and execution of valve implantation procedures to improve patient care."

Commonly used therapeutics include diuretics for CHF and antithrombotics 2 to reduce the risk of arterial thromboembolism (ATE), which do not directly affect myocardial function. This review summarizes the evidence for the use of pimobendan, a phosphodiesterase III inhibitor and calcium channel sensitizer, in feline cardiomyopathies. Potential benefits of pimobendan in cats include improved left ventricular systolic and diastolic function, reduced platelet aggregation, reduction in left atrial size, and improved left atrial and auricular systolic function.Drug details:Pimobendan is indicated for the treatment of CHF in conditions associated with systolic dysfunction (including dilated cardiomyopathy, restrictive cardiomyopathy, arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy and some cases with non-specific phenotypes) and has been used in the treatment of CHF secondary to hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. A dosage of pimobendan of 0.25 mg/kg PO q12h is generally well tolerated, and an approved oral solution is now available in the UK, EU, USA, Japan and Australia, which may facilitate administration in some cats; it should be noted, however, that pimobendan is not licensed for use in cats and marketing authorizations may vary between countries. Adverse events are uncommon with pimobendan but include gastrointestinal upset (anorexia, vomiting), transient changes in heart rate and possible worsening arrhythmias at higher doses. The use of pimobendan is contraindicated in cats with fixed obstructions of the left or right ventricular outflow tract (ie, congenital heart disease - pulmonic or aortic valvular stenosis).

This study aims to elucidate the relationship between VAPB and aortic valve calcification at both tissue and cellular molecular levels, exploring potential regulatory mechanisms.
The expression levels of VAPB in calcified valve tissues were assessed using immunohistochemical analysis. Osteogenic differentiation and calcification levels of valve interstitial cells (VICs) were evaluated by alizarin red staining, calcium content quantification, and the detection of the osteogenic markers. Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) was used to identify downstream pathways regulated by VAPB, immunoblotting was used to detect the expression of key molecules of SMAD signaling, and immunoprecipitation was performed to detect interactions between VAPB and SMAD1/5/9.
VAPB expression was significantly upregulated in the aortic valve leaflets of patients with CAVD. VICs with VAPB overexpression exhibited a significant increase in calcium content (p < 0.001) and upregulation of osteogenic markers RUNX2, osteocalcin, and osteopontin (p <0. 01). Conversely, VAPB knockdown reduced osteogenic differentiation in VICs. Furthermore, VAPB overexpression led to the enhanced expression of p-SMAD1/5/9 through activation of the SMAD signaling pathway (p < 0.05), while inhibition of the SMAD pathway abrogated the pro-calcification effects of VAPB. Dual immunofluorescence staining demonstrated colocalization of VAPB with SMAD1/5/9, and immunoprecipitation confirmed an interaction between VAPB and SMAD1/5/9.
The findings indicate that VAPB promotes osteogenic differentiation in aortic valve interstitial cells by activating the SMAD signaling pathway."

This is a 10-year retrospective analysis of 172 patients with MAC. Sixty-seven patients underwent MAC severity scoring using a 10-point system based on computed tomography (CT). The primary outcome was 30-day mortality, readmission, reoperation, stroke, prolonged ventilation, renal failure and deep sternal infection. Secondary analyses stratified MAC by underlying mitral disease type as well as evaluated outcomes by CT severity score. Patients without MAC undergoing mitral valve replacement surgery during the same time period served as controls.
The 30-day mortality was significantly higher in MAC patients compared with non-MAC (9.9% vs. 4.2%, P<0.001), as were rates of stroke (4.7% vs. 1.6%, P=0.036), prolonged ventilation (33.1% vs. 21.1%, P<0.001), and renal failure (8.7% vs. 4.3%, P=0.008).

It is associated with known cardiovascular risk factors, as well as a variety of chronic inflammatory, infective, or connective tissue diseases. Surgically, patients are at specific operative risk for atrioventricular dehiscence or rupture and/or injury to the circumflex artery. To mitigate these risks, a broad portfolio of surgical options exists to safely anchor annular sutures. This can be performed after the calcium bar has been removed and the posterior annulus reconstructed with a patch, or even when the calcium bar is left in place. Knowledge of these techniques will help surgeons manage MAC and implant a properly sized valve. Even in the presence of severe MAC with additional involvement of the mitral valve leaflets, transatrial transcatheter heart valve (THV) implantation may be a viable option. An individualized decision-making process to determine the applicable technique should be used for patients with MAC, leading to adequate treatment for this high-risk patient group."

Transaortic constriction (TAC) in C57BL/6J and BALB/c mice modeled chronic pressure -overload-induced cardiac hypertrophy and HF, respectively. Cardiac lymphatic (LEC) and blood vascular endothelial cells (BEC) were analyzed by scRNAseq, and targets validated by immunohistochemistry and human LEC cultures. While LEC profiles were comparable between strains in healthy mice, we found expansion of lymphatic capillaries and loss of valves post-TAC only in BALB/c. Differentially expressed gene (DEG) analysis revealed a reduction post-TAC only in BALB/c of lymphatic junctional components. Conversely, LEC expression of immune cell cross-talk mediators was mostly preserved post-TAC. Interestingly, around 35% of DEGs identified in cardiac LECs post-TAC were similarly altered in interleukin (IL)1β-stimulated human LECs. In conclusion, loss of lymphatic valves and dysregulated lymphatic barrier may underlie poor drainage capacity during pressure-overload-induced HF, despite potent lymphangiogenesis and preserved LEC immune attraction. Our work provides tractable targets to restore lymphatic health in CVDs."

Clinical data were reviewed, including symptoms, echocardiography, electrocardiography, genetic testing, and follow-up outcomes. Comparisons were made between patients with primary and secondary hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.ResultsAmong the 41 patients, 27 were men and 14 were women, with a median age at onset of 4 years and 3 months. Genetic testing was performed in 24 cases, identifying 13 cases of primary hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and 11 cases of secondary hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, most commonly associated with Noonan syndrome. The most frequent symptoms were fatigue (28.95%) and dyspnea (23.68%). Common pathogenic genes in primary hypertrophic cardiomyopathy included MYH7 and MYBPC3. Echocardiography revealed asymmetric interventricular septal hypertrophy in 61.0% of cases and left ventricular outflow tract obstruction in 22.0%. No statistically significant differences were observed between primary and secondary hypertrophic cardiomyopathy groups in clinical manifestations or imaging findings. During follow-up, seven patients died. Kaplan-Meier analysis showed a median survival time of 61.4 months, with no significant difference in survival between the two groups.ConclusionPediatric hypertrophic cardiomyopathy demonstrates substantial heterogeneity in clinical presentation and genetic background. Enhanced early screening and genetic testing may improve diagnostic accuracy and facilitate individualized management strategies."

Cardiothoracic imaging,"Purpose To compare the performance of cardiac CT-derived hybrid aortic valve area (AVA) and planimetry, in combination with aortic valve calcium (AVC) or AVC density (AVCd), for assessing low-gradient aortic stenosis (LGAS). Materials and Methods This retrospective analysis included patients with LGAS (mean gradient < 40 mm Hg) who underwent echocardiography and cardiac CT from November 2018 to March 2022. The performance of absolute and indexed hybrid AVA and planimetry, combined with either absolute AVC or AVCd, was compared by time-to-event analysis and outcome classification ability. Results A total of 215 patients (mean age, 79.2 years ± 8.4 [SD]; 118 male patients) were included in the study. Of these, 74.4% (160 of 215) experienced a composite outcome of valve intervention or all-cause mortality during follow-up. Specifically, 11% (23 of 215) underwent surgical aortic valve replacement, 59% (126 of 215) underwent transcatheter aortic valve replacement, and 15% (32 of 215) died. The median follow-up duration was 478 days (IQR, 283-716 days). Indexed AVA measures performed better than absolute AVA. All models showed comparable discrimination, as measured by Harrell C statistic. The highest performing model was indexed AVA calculated using left ventricular outflow tract area derived from minimum CT diameter combined with absolute AVC (hazard ratio, 2.29; 95% CI: 1.66, 3.15; P < .001; C statistic, 0.60). The lowest performing model was absolute AVA planimetry with AVCd (hazard ratio, 1.62; 95% CI: 1.19, 2.22; P = .002; C statistic, 0.55). Conclusion Diagnostic strategies involving hybrid AVA and AVC or AVCd demonstrated comparable performance in LGAS assessment. Indexed hybrid AVA measures performed better alone or in combination with AVC compared with the absolute AVA measures.

PubMed,deep learning,ELDGG: an end-to-end LiDAR-dynamic-guided GAN for hyperspectral image hierarchical reconstruction and classification.,Xingyue Zhang; Mingju Chen; Senyuan Li; Xiao Hu; Zhengxu Duan; Yangming Luo; Chen Xie; Xingzhong Xiong,10.1038/s41598-025-30660-8,2025-12-15,Scientific reports,"To address the prevalent issues in the classification of hyperspectral image (HSI) and light detection and ranging (LiDAR) data fusion, such as insufficient dynamic adaptive interaction of cross-modal features, and difficulties in high-fidelity spatial detail reconstruction, this paper proposes an end-to-end LiDAR-dynamic-guided GAN for hyperspectral image hierarchical reconstruction and classification (ELDGG). The core framework of the network consists of a guided hierarchical reconstruction generator (GHR-Generator) and a perception-enhanced spectral regularization discriminator (PSR-Discriminator). First, we propose the cross-modal parameter-adaptive fusion module (CPAF-Module), which leverages the global context of LiDAR data to generate dynamic convolutional operators tailored for HSI features, addressing the limitations of static fusion methods. Second, to enhance the reconstruction quality of spatial details, we design the LiDAR-guided neural implicit field reconstruction unit (L-GNIF Unit). By learning a continuous mapping from coordinates to features, it achieves high-fidelity and artifact-free feature space reconstruction. Furthermore, we innovatively integrate spectral normalization constraints with a multi-level feature matching mechanism to construct the PSR-Discriminator. This discriminator provides more comprehensive perceptual signals across three scales: shallow textures, mid-level structures, and deep semantics. The entire framework is optimized through end-to-end training and a joint multi-task optimization loss function, ensuring that the generated fused features exhibit both authenticity and class discriminability. On this basis, we further design a spatial-spectral refinement classifier (SSR-Classifier) to accurately decode the deeply optimized feature maps, ultimately producing high-precision land cover classification results. Experiments demonstrate ELDGG's superiority over state-of-the-art methods in both fusion quality and classification accuracy."

This study proposes NeuroFusionNet, a hybrid deep learning framework for accurate, explainable, and efficient EEG-based classification of Alzheimer's Disease and related dementias. The model fuses handcrafted spectral, statistical, wavelet, and entropy features with latent temporal embeddings extracted from a customized one-dimensional convolutional neural network (1D-CNN). Feature selection is performed using Pearson Correlation Coefficient (PCC) and Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), Principal Component Analysis (PCA)-based dimensionality reduction, and SMOTE-based class balancing has been performed to enhance discriminative learning. Comprehensive preprocessing including bandpass filtering, Artifact Subspace Reconstruction (ASR), and Independent Component Analysis (ICA) improves signal quality prior to classification through a five-layer deep neural network optimized via adaptive learning rate scheduling. Proposed method has been validated on three public EEG datasets including OpenNeuro ds004504 (eyes-closed), ds006036 (eyes-open), and the independent OSF dataset. Our method demonstrates state-of-the-art accuracy and macro F-1 score of 94.27% and 0.94 respectively. Cross-validation yielded minimal variance (SD <0.3%) that confirms the robustness and reproducibility. Model interpretability was ensured using Shapley Additive Explanations (SHAP) and Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping (Grad-CAM), which revealed physiologically consistent biomarkers such as posterior alpha attenuation and frontal-theta enhancement patterns well aligned with established AD pathophysiology. Demographic fairness analysis showed negligible bias (<0.6% difference) across gender and age subgroups. Despite its high accuracy, NeuroFusionNet remains lightweight (0.94M parameters, 4.1 MB footprint) and computationally efficient (6.5 ms inference per sample), enabling real-time deployment on standard clinical CPUs without GPU support."

To estimate the diagnostic accuracy of DL applied to NCCT for patient-level AIS detection and to examine prespecified sources of between-study heterogeneity.
We searched MEDLINE, Embase, and Web of Science (January 2010-May 2025). Eligible prospective or retrospective diagnostic studies evaluated DL on NCCT against an appropriate reference standard and reported (or allowed reconstruction of) patient-level 2 × 2 data. Two-gate case-control and lesion-only reports were excluded. Dual reviewers screened/extracted data; risk of bias was assessed with QUADAS-2, and AI-reporting against items adapted from STARD-AI/CLAIM/CONSORT-AI. Bivariate random-effects/HSROC models summarized sensitivity and specificity. Prespecified moderators were posterior-fossa inclusion, reference-standard robustness, and validation type. Sensitivity analyses included external-only cohorts, robust standards, posterior-fossa inclusion, and a ""Direct AIS"" construct subset.
Of 1,899 records, 16 studies met inclusion; 13 contributed patient-level data to meta-analysis. Summary sensitivity was 0.91 (95% CI, 0.81-0.96) and specificity 0.90 (0.85-0.94). Sensitivity was lower for externally validated models than internally validated ones (0.82 [0.67-0.91] vs. 0.95 [0.89-0.98]) with similar specificity (0.88 [0.83-0.92] vs. 0.93 [0.82-0.97]). Findings were directionally robust across sensitivity analyses. QUADAS-2 frequently indicated concerns in patient selection and index-test domains; AI-reporting quality was mostly moderate, and explicit external validation remained uncommon.
DL applied to NCCT shows high accuracy for patient-level AIS detection. However, generalizability is the principal gap; broader external validation and guideline-concordant reporting are needed to support safe clinical adoption."

We introduce a Multi-Modal Attention-based Spatio-Temporal Network (MAST-Net) designed to jointly analyse satellite imagery, meteorological variables and ground observations for predicting concentrations of PM2.5, PM10, NO₂, and O₃. The framework leverages data from Sentinel-5P, MODIS, and Landsat-8 satellites, integrates a dynamic feature selection strategy, and incorporates uncertainty quantification to enhance reliability. When compared to conventional approaches, experimental validation over metropolitan areas demonstrates higher performance with RMSE improvements of 23-31%, reaching correlation coefficients of 0.91-0.94 for various contaminants. With its strong prediction capabilities across a range of geographic and seasonal situations, the suggested architecture has great promise for real-time air quality control systems."

DL models for five disease sites were trained separately using datasets from a single institution and were tested retrospectively for clinical application among three institutions, with tailored prioritized clinical goals. We find that over 80% of the 250 auto-plans met clinical criteria, and 60% were preferred over manual plans in blinded reviews. Dosimetric analyses show that the auto-plans quantitatively matched or exceeded the quality of human-driven plans. This study highlights ATP's potential to transform radiotherapy practice, with ongoing efforts aimed at refining its versatility and adoption across diverse clinical settings."

A large-scale and high-quality training dataset is an essential component for accurate deep learning, but such dataset has been absent for RM detection, resulting in low accuracies. We developed DeepRM (Deep learning for RNA Modification), a sophisticated deep learning framework powered by Nanopore sequencing. DeepRM dataset is a massive-scale, three orders of magnitude larger than the comparable previous ones, and unprecedentedly high-quality dataset that closely mirrors endogenous transcript environments. Accordingly, DeepRM detects RM sites and measures their modification stoichiometries with a near-perfect accuracy. Using DeepRM, we constructed a comprehensive, human m6A atlas at single-molecule resolution that reveals a large number of previously underappreciated non-canonical m6A sites and differentially modified transcripts, highlighting the complexity and dynamic nature of the human epitranscriptome. DeepRM is freely available, providing a unique, powerful opportunity for understanding the biological functions of RMs. DeepRM can also be expanded to various other RMs and organisms, potentially becoming a future standard for investigating the epitranscriptome."

We aimed to develop and validate a deep learning-based simultaneous, automatic WMH segmentation and classification model in patients with cognitive impairment.
This retrospective study included images from consecutive patients with cognitive impairment from a tertiary hospital. A segmentation model was trained and tuned on 448 and 149 subjects. A classification compartment inherited from the segmentation model, utilizing the multi-task multiple instance learning framework (MTMIL), was trained and tuned on 1186 and 394 subjects. Tests of segmentation and classification tasks were performed on 149 and 394 subjects in the internal testing dataset and 100 subjects in the external dataset. We evaluated five different models to select the segmentation branch. Classification according to the Fazekas scale used three categories (normal/mild, moderate, severe), and locations were separately reported as periventricular and deep WMH. For classification evaluation, three experienced neuroradiologists evaluated test datasets.
Between January 2016 and December 2019, 1974 consecutive patients (mean age 71.1 ± 9.7) were included. Dice score performance of the UNet with Resnet-34 encoder model on internal and external testing datasets was 0.88 (95% CI: 0.88-0.89) and 0.85 (95% CI: 0.84-0.86) for single-class segmentation, and 0.77 (95% CI: 0.76-0.79) and 0.72 (95% CI: 0.71-0.74) for multi-class segmentation. The accuracy of the Fazekas scale classification model was 0.88 and 0.87 at periventricular and deep WMH with internal datasets and 0.68 and 0.75 with external datasets.
These results demonstrate the high segmentation and classification performance of our models and their potential for deployment as accurate diagnostic support tools for quantified evaluation of WMH.

Additionally, the Radon SPI algorithm can further enhance imaging speed by reducing the sampling rate, enabling better tracking and capturing of fast-moving aerial objects. However, low sampling rates also significantly degrade imaging quality, posing challenges for content recognition. For computational simplicity, most current SPI classification algorithms rely on shallow and small networks with limited discriminative power. However, with the rapid development of GPU hardware and deep learning techniques, using advanced deep models for ultra-low-sampling-rate Radon SPI classification has become a promising solution. This paper builds upon state-of-the-art (SOTA) lightweight classification models and fully leverage prior knowledge of Radon SPI characteristics. By integrating traditional texture operators and line-filtering operators into differentiable modules, an efficient classification model is specifically designed and optimized for Radon SPI. Experiments on a built Radon SPI flying target classification dataset demonstrate that the proposed model achieves the highest Top-1 accuracy compared to SOTA lightweight classification models.

American journal of neuroradiology,"Enlarged perivascular spaces (PVS) are fluid-filled spaces surrounding small cerebral vessels. Current PVS research has been limited by the absence of efficient and scalable quantification tools. We compared visual ratings versus AI-based quantification in identifying associations of PVS with vascular risk factors and cognitive performance.
This cross-sectional study included 235 participants from the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis who had undergone brain MRI and had available both visual ratings and AI-derived PVS quantification. Visual ratings were performed by an expert neuroradiologist (KDH) using a semiquantitative scale. AI-derived counts were based on a fully-automated deep learning algorithm. Visual and AI-derived counts were grouped into four a priori-defined anatomic locations: basal ganglia, frontoparietal cerebrum, midbrain, and cerebellum. The relationships of PVS counts with demographic characteristics, vascular risk factors, and global and domain-specific cognitive scores were examined using ordinal logistic regression (for ordinal categorical outcomes) and linear regression (for continuous outcomes) models.
Mean age (standard deviation) was 72.1 (6.8) years; 95 (40%) participants were men; and 126 (54%) self-reported as Black. Means (SD) of AIderived regional PVS counts were 63.7 (24.6) for basal ganglia, 414.9 (167.5) for frontoparietal cerebrum, and 9.8 (4.4) for midbrain. On visual ratings, the most prevalent count category for each region was 11-20 for basal ganglia (40%), 21-40 (31%) for frontoparietal cerebrum, and 1-5 (83%) for midbrain. For basal ganglia PVS, while both methods were associated with older age and White race/ethnicity, AI-derived counts exhibited additional associations with higher systolic blood pressure (β, 0.20; 95% CI, 0.05-0.36) and diabetes (β, 11.51; 95% CI, 3.48-19.55), as well as poorer global cognition (β, -0.012; 95% CI, -0.023 to -0.0004), delayed memory (β, -0.005; 95% CI, -0.010 to -0.0005) and attention/processing speed (β, -0.005; 95% CI, -0.009 to -0.001) cognitive performance.
In this cross-sectional study, AI-derived PVS quantification was more sensitive in detecting associations with vascular risk factors and cognitive outcomes than traditional visual ratings. AI-based quantification may aid in the analysis of large-scale epidemiological data, advancing PVS research.

We evaluate four signal decomposition methods: fast Fourier transform (FFT), least squares (LSQ), cross-correlation (XCorr), and a deep learning (DL) approach based on a convolutional neural network (CNN) coupled with an autoencoder architecture. These methods are tested against ground truth PA signals generated separately at 532 and 558 nm wavelengths from the mouse brain. Results show that the FFT method consistently outperforms the others in terms of accuracy, while LSQ, XCorr, and DL's performance exhibits greater variability, especially at longer time delays. Finally, the performance of oxygen saturation estimation is evaluated using the best method (FFT)."

Deep unrolling architectures have recently emerged as effective solutions by integrating physics-based data consistency with learned priors. However, their ability to exploit temporal relationships remains limited, as many approaches rely on independent stage-wise processing with only final-stage outputs propagated across iterations, which restricts feature interaction and often leads to performance degradation when acceleration factors increase. To enhance temporal prior learning, we introduce a bidirectional recurrent convolutional unit within the sparse prior update module. Our approach strengthens temporal dependency modeling by recurrently aggregating contextual information from both past and future frames, thereby improving stability and representation capacity under highly undersampled conditions. Furthermore, we incorporate inter-stage feature transmission that forwards intermediate representations instead of only single-stage outputs. This design substantially improves multi-stage collaboration, enabling more effective refinement across iterations. Experimental results on accelerated dynamic MRI datasets (6×, 12×, and 24×) demonstrate that the proposed method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art unrolling and deep learning strategies in reconstruction accuracy and temporal fidelity. Ablation studies further validate the contributions of recurrent temporal learning and inter-stage feature transmission."

The lack of rigorous external validation and restricted access to AI models and datasets limits AI's widespread adoption. To bridge this gap, stronger collaboration across disciplines, greater transparency in model development, and a concerted effort to ensure that validated models are made publicly accessible are needed."
PubMed,deep learning,Clinical pilot study of ionizing radiation acoustic imaging (iRAI) for real-time visualization of radiation therapy dose delivery in cancer patients.,Kyle C Cuneo; Wei Zhang; Dale Litzenberg; Yaocai Huang; Scott Hadley; Ibrahim Oraiqat; Kai-Wei Chang; Glebys Gonzalez; Sarah Dykstra; Man Zhang; Eduardo G Moros; Paul L Carson; Issam El Naqa; Xueding Wang,10.1016/j.ijrobp.2025.12.006,2025-12-13,"International journal of radiation oncology, biology, physics","This study aimed to evaluate the feasibility of using ionizing radiation acoustic imaging (iRAI) to map the delivered dose in patients receiving radiation therapy (RT) with various treatment techniques, including 3D-comformal RT (3D CRT), Intensity Modulated RT (IMRT), and Volumetric Modulated Arc RT (VMAT).
Patients with intra-abdominal cancer were enrolled in a prospective clinical trial after providing informed consent. Patients were treated with stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) using standard clinical techniques with the addition of volumetric iRAI for real-time mapping of three-dimensional radiation dose deposition.
The minimal detectable dose was approximately 10 cGy. The overall shape of the dose distribution and the location of dose deposition, as determined by iRAI, matched the corresponding treatment plan. A gamma passing rate of 75.97 ± 11.12% and 90.99 ± 6.61% with a 10 mm/10% distance to agreement/dose difference suggests good agreement between the iRAI measurement and the treatment plan in both the liver volume and the planning target volume under the current system resolution. A structural similarity (SSIM) value of 0.6284 ± 0.1678 demonstrates that the iRAI measurements have shown structural pattern agreement with the treatment plan within the planning target volume (PTV).
This study demonstrates the clinical feasibility of iRAI to monitor radiation dose delivery to deep targets in real-time during treatment. This information can be integrated into treatment delivery systems to improve safety and facilitate the adaptation of radiation therapy. Despite the promising results achieved with the current form of technology, limitations in detection sensitivity, reconstruction accuracy and acoustic coupling still need to be addressed."
PubMed,deep learning,PiperNet: a hybrid deep learning approach for monitoring papaya seed adulteration in black pepper using hyperspectral imaging.,Sathya Bama Balakrishnan; Padmasri Padmanaban; Lakshita Malvannan,10.1080/19440049.2025.2598389,2025-12-15,"Food additives & contaminants. Part A, Chemistry, analysis, control, exposure & risk assessment","Adulteration of spices is a growing concern, compromising food quality, consumer safety, and industry trust. Black pepper (Piper nigrum), a high-value spice, is frequently adulterated with dried papaya seeds, which closely resemble pepper but lack nutritional value and may cause digestive issues. Conventional inspection methods often fail to detect such visually similar adulterants, highlighting the need for advanced alternatives. This study proposes a hyperspectral imaging (HSI)-based deep learning framework for detecting papaya seed adulteration in black pepper. Hyperspectral images were acquired using a Resonon Pika L camera (400-1000 nm), resulting in a dataset of 600 samples across three categories: pure pepper, pure papaya seeds, and adulterated mixtures. Pre-processing involved normalisation and conversion into 100 × 100 × 300 spectral-spatial patches, followed by one-hot encoding for classification. A 2D Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) integrated with Squeeze-and-Excitation (SE) module and Bidirectional Gated Recurrent Unit (Bi-GRU) layers was designed to jointly capture spatial textures, emphasise informative spectral channels, and model sequential wavelength dependencies. The proposed model achieved 97.5% classification accuracy, outperforming conventional imaging approaches. These findings demonstrate the potential of HSI combined with deep learning for non-destructive, automated spice authentication, supporting food quality assurance, regulatory compliance, and consumer protection."
PubMed,deep learning,Double XCSF on Target?,Connor Schönberner; Sven Tomforde,10.1162/EVCO.a.377,2025-12-15,Evolutionary computation,"The XCS Classifier System (XCS), the most prominent Learning Classifier System (LCS), originally focused on Reinforcement Learning (RL) problems. Over time, emphasis shifted heavily to supervised learning, with some applications in unsupervised learning. Following rekindled interest in LCSs for RL domains, we intend to capitalise on the close relationship between Q-learning and XCS. Except for Experience Replay, hardly any advances built on Q-learning have been investigated in XCS variants such as XCSF. Recognising this, we introduce three extensions inspired by Q-learning derivates: Target prediction inspired by DQN's target networks to improve the learning stability and double target prediction inspired by Double DQN as well as a Double Q-learning mechanism as countermeasures against overestimation. Addressing these two issues, aims to improve the performance of XCSF and the high variance between runs. We apply them to the Maze Problem, Frozen Lake, and Cart Pole. Our observations indicate mixed results: The Double Q-learning mechanism leads to no improvement. Target and double target prediction can lead to observable and also significantly improved performance and can provide variance reduction. This underscores that improving the RL capabilities of XCSF is non-trivial but indicates that adapting Deep Reinforcement Learning mechanisms for XCSF can be advantageous."
PubMed,deep learning,Hybrid machine learning models for enhanced arrhythmia detection from ECG signals using autoencoder and convolution features.,Subir Biswas; Prabodh Kumar Sahoo; Brajesh Kumar; Adyasha Rath; Prince Jain; Ganpati Panda; Haipeng Liu; Xinhong Wang,10.1371/journal.pone.0334607,2025,PloS one,"Automated arrhythmia detection from electrocardiogram (ECG) signals is crucial and important for the early treatment of cardiac disease (CD). In this investigation, eight machine-learning models have been developed to identify improved ECG arrhythmia detection using two standard datasets (MIT-BIH Arrhythmia and the ECG 5000). In the first phase, two types of feature extraction schemes (autoencoder) and (Convolution) are used to obtain relevant features from ECG samples and subsequently, eight ML models are successfully trained and tested to find various performance matrices through simulation-based experiments. Then, the TOPSIS and mRMR ranking schemes are used to rank the ML models and identify the three best-performing models recommended for real-time arrhythmia detection. In this study, it is observed that for the same number of input features, models based on autoencoder features offer enhanced performance compared to those based on convolutional features. It is generally observed that the top identified hybrid model, Autoencoder Features with Neural Network (AEFNN) on the MIT-BIH dataset, achieves an accuracy of 97.96% and on the ECG5000 dataset, the hybrid model achieves an accuracy of 99.20%. This proposed model can be utilized for the early detection of arrhythmia, particularly in large-scale healthcare screening programs, thereby aiding in timely diagnosis and intervention. In this study, two types of features are used to model development in future work. Other relevant important features can be extracted from ECG samples, and those features can be used to develop accurate models to identify Heart disease."
PubMed,deep learning,MAGNET: Multi-view graph autoencoder with cell-gene attention for cell interaction network reconstruction from spatial transcriptomics.,Chengxu Han; Zhangdi Song; Zimu Xu; Jiaxing Chen,10.1371/journal.pcbi.1013810,2025-12-15,PLoS computational biology,"Accurately inferring cell-cell interactions from spatial transcriptomics data remains challenging due to tissue complexity and spatial heterogeneity. Recent deep learning models have started to combine different types of cellular information, such as spatial proximity, gene expression similarity, ligand-receptor signaling, and in some cases, gene regulatory networks. However, they often treat a cell's external interactions and internal gene regulation separately, merging them at the final step using simple concatenation or addition. This limits the model's ability to capture how cell-cell communication and internal molecular states are connected. In this paper, we present MAGNET (Multi-view Graph Autoencoder with Cell-Gene Attention Network), a framework that reconstructs cell-cell interaction networks by building multiple biological graphs and developing a Cell-Gene attention module to link a cell's environment with its internal gene activity in a unified representation. On benchmark datasets (seqFISH, MERFISH, STARMAP), MAGNET demonstrates superior performance in reconstructing cell-cell interaction networks, achieving an Average Precision(AP) of 0.901 on the seqFISH dataset and outperforming TENET by 0.185. The Cell-Gene Attention module is critical to MAGNET's performance, as its removal alone caused the AP on the seqFISH dataset to drop from 0.901 to 0.521. Applied to a breast cancer dataset, MAGNET found functional heterogeneity among cancer cells, distinguishing clusters with molecular signatures for either immune evasion or autonomous tumor growth."

With a focus on the prevalent psychological complications following the onset of this condition, this study aimed to explore the correlation between antenatal depression and Corona disease anxiety, personality traits, and postpartum depression during the COVID-19 pandemic.                                                           Materials and Methods:                     This cross-sectional descriptive-analytical study investigated women receiving care at health centers affiliated with Kerman University of Medical Sciences during the last month of their pregnancy and the postpartum period in 2022. Following the acquisition of informed consent, participants were assessed using various measures, including demographic and obstetric information, the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale, the Corona Disease Anxiety Scale (CDAS), and the NEO Personality Inventory-Revised during their third trimester of pregnancy. The same group of participants completed the Edinburgh Depression Scale and the Corona Disease Anxiety Scale (CDAS) 4-6 weeks after childbirth.                                                           Results and Discussion:                     There was a significant correlation between family income, unwanted pregnancy as perceived by both the mother and father, and antenatal depression. Additionally, marital satisfaction played a significant role in postpartum depression. Furthermore, antenatal depression was significantly associated with neuroticism, agreeableness, and physical symptoms related to Corona disease anxiety. Personality traits, with the exception of extroversion and conscientiousness, and various domains of Corona disease anxiety, excluding psychological symptoms, were also significantly associated with postpartum depression.                                                           Conclusion:                     During pandemics or epidemics, such as the COVID-19 outbreak, experiencing mental distress during pregnancy can contribute to mental health issues during the postpartum period. This risk is particularly true in individuals with unique personality traits, emphasizing the need for increased focus on mental health within prenatal care during these crises."
Crossref,valvular heart disease,The Severity of Disease and Hospital Length of Stay for the First and Second Admission of COVID-19 Patients: An Observational Study from Southeastern Iran,Milad Ahmadi Gohari; Mohammad Hossein Mehrolhassani; Shoboo Rahmati; Elham Sharifpoor; Hossein Mirzaei; Yunes Jahani,10.2174/0126667975341163241129050027,2026-10,Coronaviruses,"Background:                     This study aimed to investigate the severity of disease and length of hospital stay for COVID-19 patients admitted to a hospital in southeastern Iran.                                                           Method:                     This cross-sectional study was conducted in Kerman, Iran. Data were collected from patients who visited Afzalipour Hospital in Kerman more than twice during the COVID-19 epidemic from the end of February 2020 to March 21, 2021. We conducted two key analyses: 1. Mixed effect logistic regression was used to check the relationship between the variables and COVID-19 severity. 2. Mixed effect linear regression was used to check the relationship between the variables and the length of stay in the hospital.                                                           Results:                     The findings indicated that the most important risk factors for the severity of COVID-19 were heart diseases (OR=1.67,95%CI:1.20-2.30), increasing age (OR=2.23 for age&gt;54, 95%CI:1.70- 2.90), male gender (OR=1.47,95%CI:1.10-1.96), respiratory diseases other than asthma, and frequency of admission (OR=1.60,95%CI:1.20-2.15). All patients who underwent readmission experienced a shorter duration of hospitalization during their subsequent admission (OR=0.94,95%CI:0.91,0.96) and had a higher mortality rate (30% within 14 days, 26.6% between 14-90 days). Patients readmitted at intervals of 14-90 days and greater than 90 days exhibited lower disease severity compared to those readmitted within the 0-14 day period.                                                           Conclusion:                     Examining readmissions, the severity of COVID-19, and the length of hospital stay in affected patients are important factors for planning and allocating resources for COVID-19 management and treatment. These factors can help policymakers develop effective clinical guidelines for hospitalization or outpatient treatment of COVID-19 patients and contribute to reducing the burden of disease in the community."

Kinovea, as an accessible motion-analysis software, provides both visual and quantitative feedback. However, its application in supporting technique development among beginner athletes remains insufficiently explored. Aim: This study aims to describe the use of Kinovea in biomechanics training and examine its contribution to the awareness of kinematic characteristics and movement techniques among beginner athletes. Methods: A descriptive qualitative design involved 72 beginner athletes aged 18–25 years selected through purposive sampling. Data were collected over 16 weeks through interviews, field observations, and motion video recordings analyzed using Kinovea. Kinematic data focused on joint angles, stride behavior, and movement phases during walking, running, and the flight phase. Qualitative data were analyzed using content analysis with NVivo 12, while kinematic results were interpreted descriptively to identify performance patterns and areas for technical refinement. Result: Kinematic analysis showed coordinated joint-angle patterns across all phases. Walking analysis identified arm swing angles of 50.9°–58.8° and leg separation angles of 64.3°–67.2°, indicating a stable gait rhythm. The running analysis revealed knee angles of 68.8°–69.8° and elbow angles of 87.6°–89.1°, indicating efficient propulsive mechanics. The flight phase demonstrated knee angles of 81.2°–87.8° and elbow angles of 80.4°–88.3°, suggesting effective momentum use and postural stability. These measurements supported stride-efficiency assessment and technique evaluation. Qualitative findings revealed that Kinovea enabled athletes to interpret movement phases and identify technical inefficiencies through slow-motion and frame-by-frame visualization. Conclusion: Kinovea supports basic motion analysis by providing clear kinematic information and helping beginner athletes observe and refine their movement techniques. The findings also offer practical value for coaches by enabling more precise identification of inefficient patterns and guiding targeted corrections during early-stage training."
