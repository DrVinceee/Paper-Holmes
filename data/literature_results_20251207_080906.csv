PubMed,aortic stenosis,The prognostic value of N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide in patients with severe aortic stenosis and preserved ejection fraction.,Akiva Rosenzveig; Shivabalan Kathavarayan Ramu; Ankit Agrawal; Rohan Prasad; Akhilesh Khuttan; Tamari Lomaia; Besir Besir; Judah Rajendran; Osamah Badwan; James Yun; Zoran Popovic; Grant Reed; Rishi Puri; Amar Krishnaswamy; Serge Harb; Samir R Kapadia,10.1016/j.pcad.2025.11.008,2025-12-04,Progress in cardiovascular diseases,"Transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) is increasingly utilized for severe aortic stenosis (AS), yet optimal risk stratification remains challenging, particularly in patients with preserved ejection fraction (EF). Diastolic dysfunction (DD) has been reported in up to 54.4 % of TAVR patients (predominantly grade 1) and severe (grade 3) DD in ~13.4 % in prior cohorts and predicts poor outcomes. N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-pro-BNP), a marker of ventricular stress, shows promise in enhancing risk assessment. This study evaluates NT-pro-BNP's utility in detecting DD and predicting outcomes in severe AS patients with preserved EF undergoing TAVR.
This retrospective study included 1594 patients with severe AS (aortic valve area < 1 cm2) and EF ≥50 % undergoing TAVR at Cleveland Clinic (2016-2020). Of these, 784 had complete echocardiographic DD data. Pre- and post-TAVR NT-pro-BNP levels, clinical, and echocardiographic parameters were analyzed. DD was classified using Mitral valve (MV) E/e', tricuspid regurgitation (TR) velocity, and left atrial volume index (LAVi). The Youden Index determined the optimal NT-pro-BNP cut-off, with outcomes assessed via Kaplan-Meier and Cox regression analyses.
NT-pro-BNP correlated with DD severity, with a cut-off of 802 pg/mL (sensitivity 62.3 %, specificity 54.1 %) identified. Higher NT-pro-BNP tertiles were linked to worse baseline characteristics (e.g., NYHA III/IV 65.7 %-82.5 %, p = 0.02) and echocardiographic DD markers (e.g., LAVi 37.61-50.14 mL/m2, p < 0.001). Post-TAVR, NT-pro-BNP >802 pg/mL predicted increased mortality, heart failure hospitalizations, and prolonged length of stay (p < 0.001), with Cox regression confirming NT-pro-BNP as an independent predictor (OR 1.645, 95 % CI: 1.244-2.174).
NT-proBNP should be considered a complementary biomarker of DD and predicts adverse outcomes in severe AS patients with preserved EF undergoing TAVR, supporting its integration into pre-procedural risk stratification to optimize management."

Currently available lipid-lowering pharmacotherapies have limited effects on elevated levels of Lp(a) and several new therapies are in development to lower Lp(a).
This article reviews the novel therapies in development to reduce Lp(a) in patients with elevated levels. These were identified by a PubMed search and mainly focus on the drugs that are at an advanced stage of development.
The N-acetylgalactosamine (GalNAc)-conjugated antisense oligonucleotide (ASO) pelacarsen and the small-interfering RNA (siRNA) agents olpasiran, lepodisiran and zerlasiran have all been shown to be safe and effective in lowering Lp(a) levels between 80% and almost 100%. Pelacarsen, olpasiran, and lepodisiran are being tested in phase 3 cardiovascular outcome studies and the first results may be available in 2026. Muvalaplin is a small molecule given orally once daily and reduces Lp(a) by up to 65%. It is also being assessed in a cardiovascular outcome study. It will be essential to identify what baseline level of Lp(a) is needed and what degree of Lp(a) lowering is required to produce a cardiovascular benefit and whether aggressive lowering of Lp(a) has any adverse effects."

Publicly available trial information (ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT06861361) was reviewed, and the design was benchmarked against the minimum expected methodological standards for generating practice-changing evidence in patients with very long life expectancy (LE) following SAVR. The appraisal domains included objectives and study endpoints; selected non-inferiority (NI) margins; adequacy of follow-up for late events; statistical analysis plans and handling of crossovers/missing data; consistency of surgical comparators; and prespecified sub-groups.
Several major concerns were identified: (1) co-primary safety/efficacy composites mix hard adverse events (death, stroke) with softer outcomes, with rehospitalization likely to dominate; (2) limited duration primary follow-up (30 days/1 year), with only optional survaillance beyond 5 years, inadequate for durability and late hazards; (3) wide NI margins (7%-8%) that could accept clinically meaningful inferiority; (4) an unclear statistical analysis plan; (5) a device-specific TAVI arm versus heterogeneous SAVR comparator; and (6) up to 25% bicuspid anatomy without stratified randomization or powered analyses. Collectively, these choices markedly increase the risks of type I error, and misinterpretation in a population with likely crossing hazard curves and a long median LE comparable to that of the age-matched general population after SAVR.
In order to generate guideline-informing evidence for extending TAVI to younger patients with severe AS, the trial should prioritise hard adverse endpoints, tighten NI margins, mandate extended follow-up, standardise the surgical comparator, and adequately power the bicuspid subgroup. Without these revisions, continuing the study under the current protocol risks yielding biased, non-guideline informative results."
PubMed,aortic stenosis,Early comparison of one-year outcomes after aortic mechanical vs. biological valve replacement in Chinese patients with small aortic annulus.,Yu Sun; Yang Gao; Wen Xiao; Zimo Wang; Yonglei Liu; Xiao Wang; Laichun Song,10.1186/s13019-025-03614-4,2025-12-05,Journal of cardiothoracic surgery,"This study compares short-term clinical and hemodynamic outcomes of AVR using mechanical versus bovine pericardial valves in patients with a small aortic annulus (≤ 21 mm) and evaluates the feasibility and safety of AVR in this population.
Between November 2020 and November 2022, 142 patients with a small aortic valve annulus underwent AVR at Wuhan Asia Heart Hospital, with 73 patients in mechanical group and 69 in biological group. All patients met the surgical criteria for AVR. Baseline data, historical diseases, preoperative and follow-up echocardiographic results, and surgical-related data were shown in this study.
All patients successfully underwent surgery. In the mechanical valve group, four perioperative deaths occurred due to multiple organ failure, respiratory and cardiac arrest and circulatory failure. After one-year follow-up, hemodynamic parameters improved in both groups compared with preoperative values. Although the mechanical valve group demonstrated lower peak pressure gradients and maximum velocity compared with the bioprosthetic valve group in the follow-up period (P < 0.05), the bioprosthetic valve group exhibited shorter Intensive Care Unit (ICU) stay(3.6 ± 2.5d vs. 5.3 ± 7.9d, P < 0.001 ) and cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) times (178.1 ± 89.0 min vs. 192.4 ± 124.3 min, P = 0.032), and fewer postoperative complications at the one-year follow-up (4.3% vs. 14.9%, P = 0.026). No cerebrovascular events, valve dysfunction, or structural valve degeneration were observed in either group during the follow-up period.
Both mechanical and bioprosthetic valves showed excellent short-term outcomes in small aortic annulus patients. Bioprosthetic valves were comparable to mechanical valves, with potential benefits in reducing ICU stay, CPB time, and complications. For elderly patients, bioprosthetic valves are a safe and effective alternative in small aortic annulus AVR."

Epilepsy incurs a higher risk for developing CVD with an odds ratio of 2.25. CVDs can influence the function of the brain, and many brain diseases are linked with CV dysfunction, in a resiprocal relationship (neurocardiac axis). In patients with epilepsy, interactions along this neuro-cardiac axis appear to be involved in CVDs, such as hypertension and cardiac arrhythmias including atrial fibrillation, long QT syndrome, catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia, and sudden cardiac death (SCD) in epilepsy. Heart-brain interactions may comprise 2 wide categories: CV effects of neurological disease and neurological effects of CVD. The pathogenesis of neurogenic CV effects may involve a neurogenic cascade where sudden shifts in autonomic balance lead to an exaggerated catecholamine release. This can occur in acute neurological conditions such as ischemic stroke, intracranial hemorrhage, and epilepsy. Cardiovascular complications comprise the stroke-heart syndrome, neurogenic pulmonary edema and cardiomyopathy, Takotsubo syndrome, cardiac arrhythmias, and SCD. Specific areas of the brain, such as the insular cortex, play key roles in cardiac autonomic regulation, and disorders involving these areas have greater effects on the CV system. On the other hand, CV conditions can adversely influence the neurological system. Atrial fibrillation and intracardiac thrombus can cause cardioembolic strokes, whereas heart failure and severe aortic stenosis might account for cognitive impairment. This neuro-cardiac axis is herein detailed and the heart-lung-brain interactions in patients with epilepsy are pictorially illustrated. The epileptogenic and anti-epileptogenic medications and the results of reports of meta-analyses on the CV outcomes of patients with epilepsy are tabulated."

This meta-analysis aims to compare the clinical outcomes of TAVR in IC versus non-IC patients. A comprehensive search was conducted across PubMed, EMBASE, and Cochrane Central for randomized controlled trials and observational studies that compared outcomes between IC and non-IC patients undergoing TAVR. Primary outcomes included 1-year all-cause, cardiovascular (CV) and non-CV mortality. Secondary outcomes included new permanent pacemaker implantation (PPI) and major periprocedural complications. 4,478 patients in seven studies (mean age 80.5 years, 7.64% IC) were included in the analysis. As compared with non-IC patients, IC patients exhibited a similar 30-day death rate (Odds Ratio (OR) 1.62; 95% Confidence Interval (CI) 0.68 - 3.98; p=0.297), but significantly higher 1-year all-cause mortality (OR 2.39; 95% CI 1.55 - 3.70; p < 0.001). Notably, IC patients demonstrated a lower risk of CV death (OR 0.24; 95% CI 0.10 - 0.59; p = 0.002) but a higher risk of non-CV death (OR 4.16; 95% CI 1.70 - 10.18; p = 0.002). There was no difference in the rate of new PPI or major periprocedural complications. In conclusion, TAVR is a safe and effective treatment strategy in IC patients, with similar short-term mortality and increased medium-term mortality risk as compared with non-IC patients.

Cardiovascular imaging,"Chronic aortic regurgitation (AR) is associated with significant cardiac remodeling, but the prevalence and prognostic impact of extravalvular cardiac damage remain unexplored.
Adults with moderate or greater chronic AR identified on echocardiogram between January 2008 and July 2024 were included. Exclusion criteria were acute AR, hypertrophic and infiltrative cardiomyopathies, prior cardiac surgery, and valve stenosis. Cardiac damage was classified into hierarchical stages: no cardiac damage (stage 0), left ventricular damage (stage 1), moderate or greater mitral regurgitation or left atrial damage (stage 2), pulmonary hypertension or moderate or greater tricuspid regurgitation (stage 3), and significant right ventricular dysfunction (stage 4). The primary outcome was the association between cardiac damage stages and all-cause mortality under medical surveillance.
Of 4026 patients (median age, 72 [61-80] years), 78% had moderate AR, 11% had moderate-severe, and 11% had severe AR. Cardiac damage was present in 87% of patients: 14% in stage 1, 53% in stage 2, 18% in stage 3, and 2% in stage 4. In a multivariable model, including age, sex, AR severity, and Charlson Comorbidity Index, cardiac damage stages were associated with mortality. Adjusted hazard ratios were 1.42 (95% CI, 1.04-1.96) for stage 1, 1.58 (95% CI, 1.21-2.06) for stage 2, 2.78 (95% CI, 2.10-3.67) for stage 3, and 5.34 (95% CI, 3.67-7.76) for stage 4. Adding cardiac damage staging to multivariable models improved predictive accuracy for mortality, increasing the concordance statistics from 0.73 (95% CI, 0.71-0.75) to 0.76 (95% CI, 0.74-0.77).
Cardiac damage is present in nearly 90% of patients with moderate or greater AR and is associated with increased mortality, highlighting the need for a more comprehensive evaluation of cardiac structure and function beyond the aortic valve and left ventricle."
PubMed,aortic stenosis,"A ""Watchful Surgery"" Approach: Timing and Valve Choice for Mildly Symptomatic Mitral and Aortic Valve Disease.",Shaanali Mukadam; Chang Kon Kim; Devendra K Agrawal,10.26502/jsr.10020472,2025,Journal of surgery and research,"The timing of surgical intervention and prosthesis selection in mildly symptomatic aortic and mitral valve disease remain an area of clinical uncertainty. Symptom-based referral often occurs after the onset of adverse ventricular remodeling, whereas earlier surgery may improve long-term outcomes but introduces procedural risk. This article synthesized contemporary evidence to delineate optimal strategies in this intermediate-risk population. In aortic stenosis, randomized trials including RECOVERY and AVATAR demonstrate that early surgical aortic valve replacement reduces heart failure events and may improve survival. In aortic and mitral regurgitation, observational data associate early intervention, triggered by mild symptoms or subclinical ventricular dysfunction, with improved survival and preservation of cardiac function. Emerging modalities such as global longitudinal strain and natriuretic peptide biomarkers enhance risk stratification in asymptomatic individuals. Prosthesis selection is primarily informed by patient age, comorbidity burden, and anticoagulation tolerance. Mechanical valves confer superior durability and lower reoperation risk in younger patients. Bioprosthetic valves are increasingly favored in older adults due to compatibility with transcatheter valve-in-valve reintervention and avoidance of lifelong anticoagulation. Comparative cohort studies and meta-analyses suggest a survival benefit for mechanical valves up to approximately 65-to-70 years of age, beyond which the benefit diminishes due to competing mortality risks. Evidence supports timely surgical referral in mildly symptomatic patients, particularly in the presence of early imaging or biomarker evidence of ventricular dysfunction. Individualized decision-making through multidisciplinary heart team evaluation remains essential. Further investigations are warranted to define long-term prosthetic durability and the role of early surgery in valvular regurgitation."

To delineate a comprehensive bibliometric panorama of artificial intelligence applications in cardiovascular medicine over the past decade, and to furnish evidence-based, actionable, decision-making references for researchers, policymakers and clinicians in this domain.
We conducted a bibliometric analysis of publications on artificial intelligence applications in cardiovascular medicine from 2015 to 2024, sourced from the Web of Science Core Collection database. Visualization and analysis were performed using VOSviewer, CiteSpace and the R package ""bibliometrix"".
A total of 914 articles from 76 countries were analysed, revealing significant growth in research output. The USA and China led in publication volume, Harvard University was the most prolific institution and Frontiers in Cardiovascular Medicine emerged as the leading journal. Johnson et al. (2018), published in the Journal of the American College of Cardiology, was the most cited article, and ""prediction"" and ""classification"" were identified as primary research hotspots. Emerging research directions included cardiomyopathy and aortic stenosis, with an emphasis on predictive analytics, disease classification, healthcare modelling and coronary artery disease.
This bibliometric analysis highlights robust growth and global collaboration in artificial intelligence applications within cardiovascular medicine. Current research emphasizes predictive analytics and disease classification, focusing increasingly on cardiomyopathy and aortic stenosis. This study provides insights into current trends, identifies research gaps and suggests potential avenues for future studies, facilitating further innovation and clinical translation in cardiovascular medicine."

Case reports,"Patients with cardiogenic shock secondary to severe aortic stenosis represent a population at exceedingly high surgical risk. In this setting, the use of a left atrial-to-femoral arterial bypass percutaneous ventricular assist device (LA-FA pVAD) as temporary mechanical circulatory support (tMCS), followed by transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR), may offer a viable, potentially lifesaving alternative.
A 73-year-old man with known aortic stenosis was admitted with cardiogenic shock. Given the hemodynamic compromise associated with low-flow, low-gradient severe aortic stenosis, tMCS was initiated to stabilize end-organ perfusion. Subsequent TAVR was successfully performed, resulting in rapid clinical recovery.
This case highlights the feasibility of performing TAVR in severe aortic stenosis-related cardiogenic shock under tMCS. LA-FA pVAD provides effective unloading and systemic perfusion, bridging unstable patients to definitive valve intervention.
An LA-FA pVAD can safely support TAVR in severe aortic stenosis-related cardiogenic shock."

Case reports,"Coarctation of the aorta is associated with long-term cardiovascular complications, including hypertension and early onset atherosclerosis.
A 36-year-old woman with persistent hypertension after preeclampsia presented with chest pain. Electrocardiogram showed left ventricular hypertrophy with signs of ischemia. Echocardiography revealed a bicuspid aortic valve; however, the aortic arch was poorly seen. Coronary computed tomography identified severe left anterior descending artery stenosis with thoracic collaterals. During angioplasty, guidewire misdirection uncovered nearly atretic aortic coarctation, successfully stented a few days later.
This case illustrates how aortic coarctation can remain undetected until adulthood. It causes long-term cardiovascular complications through chronic hypertension and vascular dysfunction, promoting early coronary artery disease. Besides classical risk factors, Turner syndrome, the shape of the aortic arch, as well as the timing and method of repair, also appear to be additional risk factors.
Aortic coarctation is an aortopathy that leads to early atherosclerosis and coronary artery disease. Comprehensive evaluation is essential for timely diagnosis and optimal management."

Case reports,"Stent dislodgement with systemic embolization is a rare but serious complication of percutaneous coronary intervention.
During intravascular ultrasound-guided percutaneous coronary intervention for aorto-ostial left main artery stenosis, a fully expanded 4.0-mm drug-eluting stent dislodged upon balloon withdrawal. Angiography showed the stent partially floating in the aortic root, with its distal struts still anchored at the ostium, before its complete embolization. After securing the left main artery with a second stent, the dislodged stent was identified following systemic embolization to the left renal artery. Given the high risk of retrieval, it was managed in situ with balloon expansion to achieve full apposition against the vessel wall.
This report describes the rare event of systemic embolization of a fully expanded stent. Our experience indicates that in situ expansion may represent a practical alternative when retrieval poses significant hazards, offering a potential pathway to stabilize the complication.
Fully expanded coronary stents can in rare cases dislodge and embolize systemically. When retrieval is high risk, intentional in situ deployment at the embolization site provides a safe and definitive management option."

We carried out a retrospective analysis of patient characteristics, periprocedural complications, and 30-day mortality after 33 079 TAVI procedures that were carried out in seven German cardiac care centers.
TAVI case numbers rose from 1605 in 2013 to 4459 in 2023. The mean age of the patients remained constant at 81 years, while the operative risk (STS score) fell from 5.9% to 4.1%. The percentage of low-risk patients (STS < 4%) rose from 47% to 66%. From 2013 to 2023, there was a steady decline in periprocedural complications including severe bleeding of VARC types 3 and 4 (8.5% to 2.9%), vascular complications (17.2% to 4.9%), stroke (4.2% to 2.1%), and pacemaker implantations (15.5% to 11.4%). Over the same period, the risk-adjusted 30-day mortality fell from 3.8% to 3.2%.
The improved short-term results of TAVI from 2013 to 2023 are attributable to a change in patients' risk profiles as well as the increasing experience of the interventionists and refinements of the procedure. The mortality rate, which has remained unchanged in recent years, indicates that TAVI for older patients has been largely optimized."

From 2015 to 2023, a total of 303 patients with aortic stenosis (AS) who underwent TAVI at Kumamoto University Hospital were screened, and excluding 4 patients with in-hospital deaths, 299 were analyzed. The median follow-up period after TAVI was 693 days (interquartile range, 435-1189 days), during which 63 deaths occurred. Pre-TAVI echocardiographic findings showed that apical LS was significantly higher in the survival group compared to the all-cause death group (15.1 ± 4.7％ vs. 13.7 ± 4.4 %, p = 0.02). Multivariable Cox proportional hazards analysis, adjusted for body mass index, aortic valve peak velocity, atrial fibrillation, high-sensitivity troponin T, tricuspid regurgitation, demonstrated that apical LS was independently associated with all-cause mortality (hazard ratio: 0.91, 95 % confidence interval: 0.88-0.99, p = 0.02). Time-dependent receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis identified apical LS to discriminate all-cause mortality (area under the curve, 0.69), with the predictive ability peaking within the first two years after TAVI. Kaplan-Meier analysis revealed significantly higher mortality rates in patients with low apical LS group (<15.4 %) (p = 0.01).
measurement of apical LS in patients with AS provides valuable associational prognostic information, even after adjusting for multiple clinical and echocardiographic factors, highlighting its value in enhancing risk stratification for patients undergoing TAVI."

The urinary Legionella antigen test serves as a rapid, first-line diagnostic tool; however, early results may be negative, and antigen shedding can be intermittent. In these situations, timely retesting is essential, especially in postoperative or high-risk patients. We report the case of a 74-year-old man, a former smoker with diabetes and moderate aortic stenosis, who underwent thoracoscopic left lower lobectomy and was discharged on postoperative day (POD) six. He developed a fever on POD 27, accompanied by right upper lobe pneumonia. Outpatient urinary antigen tests for pneumococcus and Legionella were negative, and oral garenoxacin was initiated. However, hypoxemia and inflammation worsened, resulting in urgent admission on POD 30. Broad-spectrum β-lactams (sulbactam/ampicillin, followed by piperacillin/tazobactam) were ineffective. Chest CT revealed enlarging infiltrates and a parapneumonic effusion requiring drainage, despite negative pleural fluid cultures. Given the persistent deterioration of the patient's condition, levofloxacin was added, and the urinary Legionella antigen test (R70829, MIZUHO MEDY Co., Ltd., Tosu, Japan) was repeated on hospital day five (POD 35), which returned positive, confirming Legionella pneumonia. Subsequent targeted therapy with azithromycin (days 6-8 and 13-15), alongside levofloxacin, resulted in clinical improvement. Despite complications during the clinical course, including acute kidney injury necessitating two hemodialysis sessions and a creatine kinase peak of 1,563 U/L, the chest drain was removed on day 21, oxygen was discontinued by day 31, and the patient was transferred to long-term care on day 54. The sequence of renal failure preceding creatine kinase elevation suggests direct renal involvement by L. pneumophila rather than primary rhabdomyolysis. Vigilant retesting enabled timely pathogen-directed therapy and a favorable outcome. This case report highlights that a single negative urinary antigen test does not rule out Legionella infection. We accordingly recommend early repeat antigen testing, ideally within one week, for postoperative pneumonia unresponsive to β-lactams, together with prompt macrolide or fluoroquinolone therapy."

Morbidity is related to severe congenital heart defects, aortic hypoplasia, airway stenosis, constrictive pericarditis, and restrictive cardiomyopathy. We report two detailed autopsies: the first of an 8-year-old female who succumbed to congenital mitral valve disease and restrictive cardiopulmonary complications. Autopsy documented chronic pericarditis and fibrosing pleuritis, diffuse interstitial pulmonary fibrosis, extensive submucosal interstitial fibrosis of the bladder, and nodular medial hypertrophy of the aorta. The second patient was a 20-year-old female with progressive laryngo-tracheal stenosis, interstitial lung disease, pericardial and peritoneal adhesions, and dermal fibrosis. Both patients had ovarian fibrosis with reduced oocytes. Neuropathologic examination revealed brains below expected weight with hypoxic-ischemic injury. The first patient also had scattered intraparenchymal microcalcifications and a known Chiari I malformation, and the second had a thickened calvarium and dura mater and rounded cerebrum (shortened frontal and occipital lobes). These two patients demonstrate the value of postmortem examination to confirm suspected pathology and elucidate new features. The pleiotropy of Myhre syndrome was demonstrated by complex comorbidities and the devastating impact of indiscriminate fibrosis. Counseling regarding the role of postmortem examination should be considered in the palliative care of Myhre syndrome patients and their families."

Although typically asymptomatic and often discovered incidentally, persistent left superior vena cava may complicate central venous catheter placement and transesophageal echocardiography confirmation during cardiac surgery. Unrecognized persistent left superior vena cava can lead to misinterpretation of guidewire position, unnecessary catheter manipulation, and procedural delays.
A 65-year-old white woman (body mass index 26 kg/m2; American Society of Anesthesiologists physical status III) with severe degenerative mitral regurgitation, hypertension, and well-controlled type 2 diabetes mellitus presented for elective mitral valve repair. After uneventful induction of general anesthesia, a right internal jugular central venous catheter was placed under ultrasound guidance without resistance, arrhythmia, or abnormal waveform. Intraoperative transesophageal echocardiography-using standard bicaval, midesophageal four-chamber, and midesophageal long-axis views-failed to visualize the guidewire or catheter tip within the superior vena cava or right atrium despite correct placement technique and a normal central venous pressure waveform. Given stable hemodynamics and appropriate venous return, the catheter was secured in place, and mitral valve repair proceeded without incident. Postoperative contrast-enhanced computed tomography identified a persistent left superior vena cava draining into an enlarged coronary sinus, accounting for the atypical guidewire trajectory. The central line remained functional throughout, and the patient was extubated on postoperative day 1. She experienced an uncomplicated recovery and was discharged home on postoperative day 4.
When transesophageal echocardiography fails to confirm central venous catheter position despite proper technique, rare anatomical variants such as persistent left superior vena cava should be considered. Employing targeted transesophageal echocardiography interrogation of the coronary sinus and adjunctive imaging modalities can facilitate prompt recognition. Awareness of persistent left superior vena cava prevents unnecessary catheter manipulation, reduces procedural delays, and enhances patient safety during cardiac surgery."

A retrospective observational cohort study.
Academic tertiary care medical center.
Nine children underwent robot-assisted cardiac surgery from 2022 to 2024. Indications for operation included atrial septal defect (n = 8) and mitral valve regurgitation with concomitant Marfan syndrome (n = 1).
Eight patients underwent atrial septal defect closure; 1 patient underwent mitral valve repair.
Mean (SD) age was 13.1 (2.5) years, mean (SD) weight was 48.5 (20.3) kg, and mean (SD) body mass index was 21.7 (5.4) kg/m2. Mean (SD) operative time was 388.2 (40.7) minutes, fibrillation time was 92.4 (25.8) minutes, and cardiopulmonary bypass time was 192.1 (31.3) minutes. None of the patients required 1-lung ventilation based on surgeon preference, and most patients (77.8%) were extubated in the operating room. The median (IQR) intensive care unit length of stay was 45 (26) hours, and the median (IQR) hospital stay was 3 (2.5) days. One patient required conversion to median sternotomy due to aortic insufficiency in the setting of Marfan syndrome and aortic root dilation. One patient required a reoperation due to bleeding following an emesis episode in the intensive care unit. There were no mortality events.
Robot-assisted cardiac surgery is well tolerated in appropriately selected pediatric patients, including children as small as 24 kg. Our experience suggests that the success of this approach is predicated upon a center with institutional experience and multidisciplinary collaboration. Furthermore, it is critical that the anesthesiologist understands the unique anatomic, airway, monitoring, positioning, and surgical considerations that are unique for this patient population."

Quantification of MR has not been widely adopted in dogs. Mitral regurgitant fraction (MR%) has not been systematically reported in relation to other echocardiographic variables in myxomatous mitral valve disease (MMVD).
Echocardiograms from 237 small-breed dogs with MMVD that included calculation of MR% were identified retrospectively. Mitral regurgitant fraction, monodimensional and bidimensional variables, estimates of filling pressure, forward flow, left ventricular early inflow outflow index (LVEIO), tricuspid regurgitant velocity, and systolic blood pressure are reported in preclinical MMVD and at the onset of American College of Veterinary Internal Medicine stage C congestive heart failure (C-CHF). The relationship of MR% to other variables is described and correlations determined. The discriminatory ability of variables in diagnosing stage C-CHF was evaluated with receiver operating characteristic analysis.
All echocardiographic variables correlated to MR% by univariable analysis (all P values<0.0001). The LVEIO (ρ = 0.81), left atrial volume indexed to body weight (ρ = 0.76), and left ventricular end-diastolic volume indexed to body weight (ρ = 0.76) showed the strongest correlations. Patients with stage C- CHF had a median MR% of 83% (interquartile range: 79-85%). Mitral regurgitant fraction (area under the curve [AUC]: 0.97, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.95-0.99, P<0.0001), LVEIO (AUC: 0.96, 95% CI: 0.93-0.99, P<0.0001), and left atrial volume indexed to body weight (AUC: 0.96, 95% CI: 0.93-0.98, P<0.0001) had the highest AUCs.
This is a single-operator retrospective study.
Mitral regurgitant fraction is strongly correlated with echocardiographic variables used in assessment of MMVD. Integration of MR% may help stage disease, clarify equivocal signs, and guide management."

Advances,"Transcatheter edge-to-edge repair (TEER) has become an established treatment for symptomatic atrioventricular valve regurgitation (AVVR). In congenital heart disease (CHD), AVVR is a major determinant of clinical outcomes. For these patients, surgery often poses high risk, underscoring the importance of percutaneous therapy. However, data supporting TEER in patients with CHD remain limited.
The objectives of the study were to examine the outcomes of TEER in CHD patients across several centers and to discuss the procedural considerations.
We conducted a retrospective review of atrioventricular TEER procedures performed on CHD patients across 5 medical centers. We analyzed patient demographics, procedural details, immediate (30 days), and intermediate (6-month) outcomes.
A total of 20 patients with various CHD diagnoses underwent TEER, of which 18 reached the 6-month follow-up. The median age was 49.3 (Q1-Q3: 37.0-59.8) years and 40.0% were females. All cases were performed on the systemic circulation, 60.0% were tricuspid valves. All patients presented with symptomatic 3+ or 4+ degree AVVR at baseline, which was reduced to mild-to-moderate (1+ to 2+) in 19 patients (95.0%) at 30 days (P < 0.001). One death (5.0%) occurred in the first 30 days due to intractable heart failure; rates of NYHA functional class III-IV were reduced from 18 (90.0%) of the patients at baseline to 10.5% at 30 days.
TEER for carefully selected patients with CHD and severe AVVR was safe and effective with notable improvements in regurgitation and clinical symptoms. Our findings highlight important considerations for planning and implementation of TEER in this patient population."

Primary mitral regurgitation (MR) results from structural abnormalities of the valve apparatus (e.g., leaflet prolapse, chordae rupture), often due to myxomatous degeneration or congenital defects. Secondary MR arises from left ventricular remodeling (e.g., after myocardial infarction or heart failure), leading to functional valve incompetence despite normal valve structure. The choice of treatment depends on the degree of valve regurgitation and the severity of the patient's clinical symptoms. The focus herein is on discussing the anatomy of the mitral valve, the pathophysiology of regurgitation, and diagnostic methods. The qualification process is then outlined for invasive treatment and various methods of mitral valve repair, including new minimally invasive techniques. Transcatheter mitral valve repair methods are discussed, among other methods, ""edge-to-edge"" repair and transcatheter mitral valve replacement. Publicly available data confirms that the latter is a widely available and safe treatment method, that represents a promising alternative to surgical treatment."

However, MVP may also present with ventricular arrhythmias (VA) or sudden cardiac death (SCD). The arrhythmic form of MVP and the complicated course of this condition are closely associated with mitral annular disjunction (MAD). MAD alters the anatomical integrity of the mitral annulus and is thought to contribute to leaflet degeneration and myocardial fibrosis, creating a substrate for malignant arrhythmias. The most common complications associated with MVP and MAD include progressive mitral valve regurgitation, left ventricular hypertrophy and an increased risk of SCD. Cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) imaging is the most sensitive modality for detecting MAD and myocardial fibrosis and is thus essential for early diagnosis and risk stratification. This review aims to enhance recognition of MAD, summarize current diagnostic and risk assessment strategies, and provide clinical context through two cases of patients with arrhythmic MVP and MAD."

Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) is frequently used in biomedical engineering to simulate blood flow patterns under various conditions.
We developed a standardized workflow for individualized CFD analyses to predict postinterventional mitral valve gradients and residual regurgitation following TEER.
Twenty patients with severe mitral regurgitation (MR) from two high-volume centers underwent full-cycle cardiac computed tomography before intervention. Based on the specific valve morphology, individualized CFD simulations were performed to calculate MR volumes prior to intervention and estimate hemodynamics after M-TEER.
CFD analyses (mean age 80 ± 4 years, 55% male) showed excellent correlation between baseline proximal isovelocity surface area (PISA)-based MR volumes, median 40 ml [interquartile range (IQR): 30-49 ml], and CFD-based calculation, median 30 ml (IQR: 27-54 ml; R = 0.917; P < 0.001), as well as between baseline effective regurgitant orifice area (EROA) assessed in transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) and CFD-measured EROA (R = 0.869; P < 0.001). After device implantation, the correlation between intraprocedural TEE-measured and CFD-estimated residual MR (R = 0.949; P < 0.001) and EROA (R = 0.841; P < 0.001) remained robust. Median postinterventional diastolic pressure gradient (TEE) was 2.8 mmHg (IQR: 1.7-4.0), which closely correlated with the CFD-estimated gradient of 1.4 mmHg (IQR: 2.3-4.5, R = 0.905; P < 0.001).

Edema often precedes fibrosis in many clinical conditions, and both edema and myocardial fibrosis are detectable in vivo using cardiac magnetic resonance imaging. In cases of mild or chronic edema (subclinical edema), standard T2-weighted sequences may not be sufficient for identification; however, T2 mapping sequences can detect such edema. This study aimed to assess whether subclinical myocardial edema identified through T2 mapping is related to arrhythmic burden in patients with mitral valve prolapse and mitral annular disjunction, even in the absence of fibrosis. Thirty-four patients underwent cardiac magnetic resonance imaging and were classified into low and high arrhythmic burden groups based on the Lown grading system. Inclusion criteria were normal myocardial signal intensity on conventional T2-weighted imaging, non-hemodynamically significant mitral regurgitation, presence of mitral annular disjunction, and absence of fibrosis. The analysis was twofold: segmental, comparing native T2 times between corresponding myocardial segments of the groups; and regional, contrasting basal segments of the lateral, inferolateral, and inferior walls, typically more affected by mitral valve prolapse, with remote myocardium within each group. Patients with higher arrhythmic burdens showed elevated native T2 times, indicating subclinical myocardial edema in the basal myocardial segments. This suggests that even without fibrosis, early myocardial alterations related to mitral valve prolapse may be related to arrhythmic risks. The clinical implications are significant, advocating the integration of T2 mapping into routine evaluations to enhance therapeutic decision making and patient outcomes. The early detection of myocardial changes may allow timely intervention and potentially modify the disease course. Further research is needed to confirm these findings and explore the utility of T2 mapping in managing mitral valve prolapse, even in patients without mitral annular disjunction."

Emerging evidence of transcatheter edge-to-edge repair (TEER) use for treating acute mitral regurgitation has promoted TEER as a promising alternative to mitral valve surgery, owing to reduced mortality and complications. CASE REPORT A 66-year-old female patient with a history of thyroid nodules presented with dyspnea and hemoptysis. Imaging confirmed bilateral pleural effusions, with opacities suggestive of diffuse alveolar hemorrhage, and echocardiography revealed acute severe mitral valve regurgitation. The patient chose TEER over surgical valve replacement. After discharge on apixaban for new-onset atrial fibrillation, she returned a week later with melena and worsening dyspnea. Echocardiography demonstrated recurrent mitral valve regurgitation, and bronchoscopy confirmed diffuse alveolar hemorrhage. Despite aggressive management, the patient died. CONCLUSIONS This case highlights the complexity of managing acute severe mitral regurgitation complicated by diffuse alveolar hemorrhage in a patient requiring anticoagulation. Although a TEER procedure using the Pascal device was performed, the patient's condition continued to deteriorate, underscoring the importance of individualized treatment strategies, as surgical mitral valve replacement may offer more definitive hemodynamic correction in selected cases."

We sought to explore the prevalence of, and correlates and postprocedural outcomes associated with, severe PH in patients undergoing mitral TEER.
We retrospectively evaluated a single-center registry of isolated, first-time interventions as a function of severe PH presence at baseline. Outcomes included all-cause mortality, heart failure (HF) hospitalizations, and the persistence of significant mitral regurgitation (MR) and functional impairment during the first postprocedural year.
A total of 1,182 individuals qualified for analysis. Of them, 100 (8.5%) had severe PH, demonstrating a median PASP of 78 (interquartile range, 75-85) mmHg. Compared to subjects free of severe PH, the former exhibited a higher interventional risk, a greater burden of comorbidities, and more severe MR and cardiac dysfunction, and were more likely to undergo an urgent procedure. General interventional features were unaffected by severe PH status, leading in both groups to a high (> 97%) technical success rate and, ultimately, significant improvements in PASP, MR grade and functional capacity. Severe PH was associated with worse residual MR in the total cohort - but not within a 187-patient, propensity score matched sub-cohort. In either, it did not correlate with the rate, cumulative incidence, and risk of mortality and/or HF hospitalizations.
In our experience, severe PH preceding mitral TEER identified higher-risk patients but was unrelated to procedural feasibility, safety, or efficacy."

This study aimed to compare the clinical outcomes of single antiplatelet therapy (SAPT) vs. dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) following transcatheter edge-to-edge repair (TEER) using the MitraClip system. The objective was to evaluate their relative safety and efficacy in a real-world cohort, offering preliminary evidence to inform future prospective studies.
The study retrospectively analysed patients who underwent MitraClip implantation at a high-volume tertiary care centre in Rome, Italy. Patients treated with oral anticoagulant therapy (OAC) were excluded. The primary outcome was to determine SAPT vs. DAPT in terms of all-cause mortality, cardiac mortality, hospitalization for heart failure, myocardial infarction, and bleeding complications.
Among 199 patients, 114 met the inclusion criteria. Baseline mitral regurgitation was 3+ or 4+ in both groups. The acute success of the procedure was 100%. All patients were monitored for 12 months following treatment. Complications were uncommon and, in most cases, unrelated to antiplatelet therapy. Patients in the DAPT group had significantly poorer outcomes than those in the SAPT group, with 12-month survival freedom from all-cause mortality of 78.7% and 94% (P = 0.014) and survival freedom from cardiac mortality of 89.4% and 98.5% (P = 0.031).We observed no significant difference in major and minor bleeding between the two groups, although the incidence was higher in the DAPT group.
SAPT was associated with improved 12-month survival and a lower rate of bleeding events compared with DAPT in patients undergoing TEER. While individual rates of major and minor bleeding were not significantly different, the overall bleeding burden was reduced in the SAPT group. These findings suggest a potential association between SAPT and lower mortality rates and support its consideration in patients at high bleeding risk. Further prospective studies are warranted to confirm these observations."

We present a case of a middle-aged man with a history of metastatic neuroendocrine tumor receiving biweekly octreotide therapy. He presented with constitutional syndrome and right-sided heart failure signs. Cardiac imaging revealed significant tricuspid and pulmonary regurgitation. The patient was a poor surgical candidate; consequently, after multimodal cardiac imaging assessment, alternative 1-stop transcatheter pulmonary and tricuspid replacement was planned and performed.
Patients with symptomatic carcinoid heart disease require comprehensive multidisciplinary evaluation. For high-risk patients with multivalvular disease, transcatheter valve replacements provide a feasible and less invasive alternative to standard surgical replacement.

A retrospective observational analysis. Place and Duration of the Study: Department of Nephrology, Hangzhou First People's Hospital, Hangzhou, China, from May 2022 to August 2023.
Patients undergoing MHD were classified into two groups based on the echocardiographic results: CVC group and Non-CVC group. The former had CVC, and the latter was without calcified valves. The differences in baseline data between the two groups were compared, and logistic regression analysis was employed to investigate the impact of plasma Hcy on the CVC.
Of the total 98 patients undergoing MHD, 64 (65.3%) had CVC, and 79 (80.6%) had hyperhomocysteinaemia. The proportion of hyperhomocysteinaemia was greater in the CVC group than in the Non-CVC group (90.6% vs. 61.8%, p = 0.001). Multivariate logistic regression indicated that, after adjusting for age, duration of dialysis, serum calcium levels, diabetes, and other variables, elevated plasma Hcy levels were independently linked to an increased risk of CVC, irrespective of whether Hcy was considered as a continuous variable (OR = 1.121, 95% CI 1.051-1.195; p <0.001) or a binary variable (OR = 5.191, 95% CI 1.379-19.54; p = 0.015).
Elevated plasma Hcy levels are independently linked to a greater risk of CVC in patients undergoing MHD.

Consecutive patients treated with the EVOQUE system (Edwards Lifesciences) at our centre between January 2024 and May 2025 were included in this retrospective single centre analysis. Successful implantation of a valve sparing PM and feasibility of PM implantation were assessed.
This analysis included 39 patients (mean age 77.3 years, 74.4% women, 8 patients with pre-existing PM). High-degree AV-Block requiring PM implantation occurred in 28.2% in our cohort (11/39 patients), the de-novo PM implantation rate was 35.5% (11/31 patients). Complete or incomplete right bundle branch block (RBBB) was the most frequent conduction system disorder after TTVR (11/31 patients). Median time from TTVR to PM implantation was six days [IQR: 2.5-13]. PM implantation was feasible in 11/11 patients (100%), no surgical lead placement was necessary. Implantation of a valve sparing PM was successful in 10/11 patients (90.9%). Leadless PM were implanted in 3/11, coronary sinus lead PM in 7/11 patients. In one patient both interventional valve sparing PM approaches failed and a standard RV lead across the EVOQUE system was implanted.
High-degree AV-Block after TTVR is a frequent complication and PM implantation in these patients demands careful consideration. Valve sparing PM approaches appear feasible and were achieved with reasonable success rates in our cohort."

A 70-year-old woman presented with severe symptomatic iatrogenic TR due to chordal rupture and flail septal leaflet 30 years after HTx. The heart team opted for transcatheter tricuspid valve replacement (TTVR), and a 44-mm Evoque valve (Edwards Lifesciences) was implanted without complications. The patient's symptoms improved, with reduced diuretic dose and echocardiography showing a well-functioning prosthesis.
TTVR represents a novel therapy for patients with severe symptomatic TR. We present to our knowledge the first device success of TTVR in an HTx recipient, suggesting that TTVR is a viable option in these patients, who often present contraindications for redo cardiac surgery and transcatheter edge-to-edge repair.
Severe TR is a common complication after HTx, and high-risk surgery is rarely performed. Various transcatheter treatment options are available, but TTVR could become the treatment of choice pending more studies."

However, physical deterioration and declining autopsy rates limit ongoing acquisition and use. While micro-CT scanning has been used to digitally archive wax-infiltrated specimens, most cardiac specimens in our collection are wet formalin-preserved hearts, for which micro-CT is suboptimal.
This study evaluates photogrammetry as a practical, high-fidelity digital archiving technique for wet cardiac specimens.
Ninety wet cardiac specimens representing a broad spectrum of CHD and other cardiac diseases were digitized using a handheld Artec Space Spider 3D scanner. Specimens were suspended via a custom apparatus to optimize surface coverage. Scan data were processed with Artec Studio and refined in Blender to generate anatomically accurate, textured 3D models. Two experienced cardiac morphologists validated the digital reconstructions against the physical specimens.
Photogrammetry produced high-resolution, color-accurate 3D models closely replicating anatomical details, including complex internal structures. The custom suspension device enhanced visualization, particularly of internal chambers. Challenges included scanning smaller, darker hearts and delicate valve structures, which required manual post-processing. The digital models are accessible via a cloud-based platform for research and education.
Photogrammetry is a practical and effective method for digitally archiving wet cardiac specimens, preserving valuable anatomical data, and mitigating loss due to specimen degradation. This technique facilitates broader accessibility and enhances educational and clinical applications in the study of CHDs and other cardiac diseases."

So far, no reliable electrocardiogram (ECG) biomarkers have been presented for risk assessment, but ECG in HCM patients are often abnormal due to structural and electrical abnormalities. This study aimed to extract morphological ECG biomarkers to differentiate HCM patients based on their arrhythmic risk levels (15 HCM patients with arrhythmic events vs. 40 HCM control). We extracted ECG features including width, amplitudes, slopes between fiducial points, Hermite transform coefficients, and variational mode decomposition features. Following feature selection using combined metrics, the study population was divided into two groups for each ECG biomarker, with the median value serving as the cutoff point to distinguish between the groups. QRS and T waverelated features effectively separated patients into high and low arrhythmic risk categories. Notably, univariate Cox regression analysis showed that patients having more local QRS optima or highest percentage of negative QRS present the highest risk (p< 0.01 and p< 0.05 respectively). In conclusion, we proposed automatic ECG extracted features that can be used to stratify the risk for arrhythmic events in HCM patients.Clinical Relevance-This study provides novel insights into ECG-based risk stratification for HCM patients, offering potential tools for early identification of individuals at higher risk of cardiac events."

IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society. Annual International Conference,"Coronary artery disease (CAD) and valvular heart disorder (VHD) are major categories of cardiovascular disease (CVD), the leading cause of mortality and morbidity worldwide. CAD occurs due to plaque accumulation on the inner walls of the coronary arteries, restricting blood flow to the myocardium and potentially leading to heart attack or stroke. VHD refers to dysfunction in one or more heart valves, impairing blood flow between the heart's chambers or to other systemic organs. Due to the prevalence of CVD, there is a global need for an effective screening tool capable of detecting various CVDs on a mass scale. Both CAD and VHD alter the acoustic signature of phonocardiogram (PCG) signals, offering a non-invasive detection method. This study implements a multiclass classification model to differentiate between CAD, VHD, and normal heartbeats, collected from subjects using an innovative wearable multichannel PCG vest. Linear frequency cepstral coefficients (LFCCs), coupled with a support vector machine (SVM) using a radial basis function (RBF) kernel, achieved the highest multiclass subject-level accuracy of 81.53%, with a sensitivity of 85.20% for VHD and 81.47% for CAD. Additionally, a binary classification task between normal and abnormal (CAD and VHD together) heartbeats reported an accuracy of 82.01%. This is the first study to apply multiclass classification across different CVD categories using PCG signals collected with the same hardware."

Ischemia seems to result from microcirculatory abnormalities that appear to be modulated by left ventricular outflow tract (LVOT) obstruction. This paper proposes a model-based approach for the analysis of physiological mechanisms that affects coronary circulation in HCM. A novel integrated cardiovascular model, including LVOT obstruction and coronary circulation, was proposed. A sensitivity analysis was applied to identify the most influential parameters on coronary flow both at the macro- and micro- circulatory level. Finally, the proposed model was adapted to two HCM patients (obstructive / non-obstructive) from previous works of the team. Results show that the level of obstruction had a strong influence on coronary flow and the adaptation of the model to HCM patients confirmed the important influence of LVOT obstruction at the microcirculatory level. Despite the difficulty of having direct measures of coronary microcirculation, this works shows that computational models can help in studying the effect of a pathophysiological feature on coronary circulation in the context of HCM."

Video-based seismocardiography (SCG) based on the defocused speckle imaging emerged recently, but signals extracted from speckle motions on the camera 2D imaging plane often contain coupled SCG and gyrocardiography (GCG) components. This study aims to investigate the feasibility of using two cameras with different defocus levels to measure speckle motion signals and reconstruct a pure cardiac Z-axis vibration signal (i.e. true SCG). Using chest-mounted accelerometer as the reference, we assessed the reconstructed SCG signals and raw speckle motion signals from two cameras with different focal lengths, from the aspects of the waveform similarity w.r.t. the reference and the accuracy of biomarker detection (including aortic valve opening/closure (AO/AC), mitral valve opening/closure (MO/MC), and isovolumic movement (IM)). The results obtained from an experiment involving 10 subjects with ice pack stimulation protocol showed that the reconstructed SCG signals have higher Pearson correlation with the reference signal (r=0.822) and better accuracies of biomarker detection (with a 6 ms allowable error range, accuracies are 99.43%, 71.83%, 69.49%, 69.30% and 81.50%).

This study examines expert assessment ambiguity in canine auscultation data, highlights the negative impact of label noise on classification performance, and introduces methods for label noise reduction. To evaluate whether label noise can be minimized by incorporating multiple expert opinions, a dataset of 140 heart sound recordings (HSR) was annotated regarding the intensity of holosystolic heart murmurs caused by Myxomatous Mitral Valve Disease (MMVD). The expert opinions facilitated the selection of 70 high-quality HSR, resulting in a noise-reduced dataset. By leveraging individual heart cycles, the training data was expanded and classification robustness was enhanced. The investigation encompassed training and evaluating three classification algorithms: AdaBoost, XGBoost, and Random Forest. All of them showed significant improvements in classifi-cation accuracy due to the applied label noise reduction, most notably XGBoost. Specifically, for the detection of mild heart murmurs, sensitivity increased from 37.71% to 90.98% and specificity from 76.70% to 93.69%. For the moderate category, sensitivity rose from 30.23% to 55.81% and specificity from 64.56% to 97.19%. In the loud/thrilling category, sensitivity and specificity increased from 58.28% to 95.09% and from 84.84% to 89.69%, respectively.

Among pathogenetic mechanisms associated with DM, increased oxidative stress plays a key role in the valvular degeneration progression. This study aimed to evaluate whether DM coexistence with severe AS is associated with parallel enhancement of oxidative stress in both circulating blood and stenotic valves. We enrolled 70 severe AS patients scheduled for aortic valve replacement, including 40 (57%) with concomitant type 2 DM (AS-DM) and 30 AS patients without type 2 DM (AS-nonDM). We assessed circulating oxidized phospholipids (oxPL), myeloperoxidase (MPO), advanced glycation end products (AGEs), and their soluble receptors (sRAGE). Valvular expression of oxPL and AGEs was determined using immunostaining of aortic valve samples. In the whole group of AS patients (n=70) oxPL, MPO and AGEs levels correlated with HbA1c concentration (r=0.79, p<0.001; r=0.60, p<0.001 and r=0.85, p<0.001, respectively). Similarly, oxPL and MPO were associated with plasma AGEs (r=0.66, p<0.001 and r=0.53, p<0.001). Moreover, serum MPO and oxPL correlated with aortic valve area (AVA; r= -0.49, p<0.001 and r= -0.45, p<0.001). Among 40 AS-DM patients we observed 2.55-fold higher serum oxPL, 1.38-fold higher serum MPO, 2.07-fold higher plasma AGEs and 2.22-fold higher plasma sRAGE compared to AS-nonDM (all p<0.001). In AS-DM group, valvular oxPL and AGEs expression was 1.8-fold and 1.6-fold higher when compared to AS-nonDM patients (all p<0.001). Of major importance, valvular expression of oxPL correlated both with serum oxPL and MPO levels (r=0.72 and r=0.63, respectively; both p<0.001). This study is the first to show that in severe AS patients with concomitant DM, valvular expression of oxPL is markedly higher compared to non-DM patients and associates with their circulating levels. Moreover, enhanced valvular oxidative stress was linked with glycemic status and more severe AS."

Automation of this process with machine learning via a custom built CNN model aims to reduce the difficulty in obtaining this position factor. Increasing the number of training epochs will improve accuracy. Our study aims to develop a validated CNN for ICPI calculation, which may improve surgical electrode positioning.
Custom built CNN model and pre-trained ResNet 50 model trained and validated on 34 images, and tested on eight CT images of temporal bones with cochlear implants. The ground truth was manually established by calculating the distance from modiolus to electrode (DE) and lateral wall (DL), and applied to derive the ICPI.

However, integrating molecular graph structures with sequence information continues to present a significant challenge. In this paper, we introduce Multi-MoleScale, a novel multi-scale framework designed to address this challenge. By combining Graph Contrastive Learning (GCL) with sequence-based models like BERT, Multi-MoleScale enhances the prediction of molecular properties by capturing both structural and contextual representations of molecules. Specifically, the model leverages GCL to effectively capture the intrinsic graph-based features of molecules while utilizing BERT's pretraining capabilities to learn the contextual relationships within molecular sequences. The contrastive learning component enables Multi-MoleScale to distinguish between relevant and irrelevant molecular features, thereby enhancing its predictive accuracy across diverse molecular types. To assess the performance of our method, we conducted experiments on several widely used public datasets, including 12 molecular property datasets, the ADMET dataset, and 14 breast cancer cell line datasets. The results show that Multi-MoleScale consistently outperforms existing deep learning and self-supervised learning approaches. Notably, the model does not require handcrafted features, making it highly adaptable and versatile for a variety of molecular discovery tasks.

These extracted features may serve as the input for complex models enabling automated classification tasks, slide searching, and other various medical inferences. Subtle variations in morphology observed in distinct cross sections of the same tissue sample may introduce variability that may be of little to no clinical relevance. The reproducibility of features derived from DL models and FMs on ostensibly identical tissue cross sections remains largely unexplored. In this study, we aimed to characterize the reproducibility of features extracted from three sequential cross sections of 50 independent normal prostate samples. Slides were sectioned at approximately 50 μm intervals and we extracted cell-type specific counts, proportions, and spatial features per slide using DL models, along with feature embeddings from popular digital pathology FMs. Reproducibility of the features across sequential cross sections of tissues was assessed using intra-class correlation coefficient (ICC) for DL model features, while extracted FM embedding distributions were evaluated via maximum mean discrepancy (MMD), and Wasserstein's distance. The median [IQR] ICC estimates for cell-type specific proportion and spatial features from the cross sections was 0.838 [0.764, 0.897], and 0.873 [0.809, 0.923] respectively. The bootstrapped mean differences of ICC estimates for the features were significantly lower (p-value < 0.05) for distant cross sections compared to the two neighboring cross sections. The feature embeddings derived from state-of-the-art digital pathology FMs showed an overall high agreement with the median [IQR] MMD of 0.06 [0.016, 0.169], and median [IQR] Wasserstein's distance of 0.021 [0.011, 0.038]. These findings demonstrate that the features derived from multiple cross sections of the same tissue exhibit overall high reproducibility, while also illustrating the expected increase in intra-sample variability as a function of physical distance between sections."
PubMed,deep learning,Discriminative biomarker selection using hybrid multi-population evolutionary computation.,Alok Kumar Shukla; Shubhra Dwivedi; Aishwarya Mishra,10.1038/s41598-025-29921-3,2025-12-06,Scientific reports,"The rapid advancement of Deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) sequencing technology has gained more attention, especially in interpreting high-dimensional, low-sample-size microarray data for disease identification. However, conventional gene selection techniques struggle to identify optimal biomarker subsets from gene data within a feasible time. To address this, we propose a novel hybrid method for robust cancer classification and biomarker discovery. To reduce the dimensionality of gene data while preserving biologically meaningful patterns, in the first stage of our approach, Kernel Principal Component Analysis (KPCA) is utilized. The refined gene subsets are then processed by the Multi-Population Gravitational Search Algorithm (GSA) known as MPKGSA with Opposition-Based Learning (OBL). The hybridization mechanism involves using OBL to generate a set of opposite solutions for each population, which is then integrated into the GSA update process. This process provides a more diverse exploration of the search space, preventing premature convergence on suboptimal gene subsets. The effectiveness of MPKGSA was evaluated on six microarray cancer datasets and a breast cancer single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) dataset from the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO). Numerical results demonstrate that MPKGSA excels at balancing convergence and diversity, achieving high prediction accuracy with minimal biomarker subsets. Furthermore, it outperformed existing meta-heuristic methods, selecting a small number of gene biomarkers strongly correlated with the biological response class, confirming its utility for precise cancer identification and classification."

Traditional methods rely on visual inspection by experts using optical microscopes, which are inherently subjective, experience-dependent, and time-consuming. Here, we introduce RoImAI, a vision foundation model specifically designed for rock thin-section microscopy images, enabling rapid and precise rock segmentation, identification, and lithology report generation. A large-scale dataset of rock thin-section microscopy images comprising 30,336 images and approximately two million rock particles from 17 different regions was constructed to develop and validate RoImAI. RoImAI leverages Transformer-based deep learning techniques to achieve high-precision segmentation across multi-center datasets from diverse geological regions. RoImAI employs a hierarchical classification strategy to identify rock particles accurately. Furthermore, RoImAI outperforms human experts in efficiency and accuracy when generating structured lithology reports. The intelligent analytical capabilities and high accuracy of RoImAI strongly enable the automated processing of the rapidly expanding volume of rock thin-section images."

In other applications, DL models have exhibited performance bias by protected attributes such as race. To investigate possible race bias in prostate MRI segmentation, DL models were trained on five clinical T2-weighted MRI datasets with varying White/Black race imbalance, plus one public dataset with unknown races, and evaluated on 32 White/Black matched clinical subjects. For the models trained with differing levels of race imbalance, the best performance for both races was when the training set was race-balanced. A linear mixed-effects model analysis showed that Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC) differences between Black and White subjects depended on race representation in the training data, with a slight reduction in White-Black performance gap as Black representation increased (p < 0.05). The model trained on public data showed no difference in performance between races for DSC. The findings reveal the potential for race bias in DL prostate MRI segmentation performance when training sets are highly imbalanced. We argue for transparency in race reporting in DL prostate segmentation training data and reporting of test performance across demographic groups, with appropriate ethical/legal safeguards."

In this retrospective study, data from 1023 patients (ages 8-90 years) who underwent cardiac MRI were analyzed, including coronal, sagittal, axial localizers, and short-axis (SAX) and long-axis cine images. Experts manually annotated landmarks, serving as the ground truth for developing deep learning models. The models were assessed using 5-fold cross-validation. Performance metrics included median landmark distances and plane angle differences.
The model achieved robust performance in landmark localization across all cardiac MRI planes. For localizer images, median distances were 5.1 mm (superior) and 7.2 mm (inferior) on coronal views, and 5.6 mm (superior) and 7.5 mm (inferior) on sagittal views. Median distances for axial, 2-chamber, and 4-chamber landmarks were 5.2 mm, 5.2 mm, and 5.6 mm, respectively. In short-axis mid slices, annotations based on the left ventricular center, right ventricular insertion points, and right ventricle obtuse angle had a median error of 5.2 mm, while basal slice valve-based annotations had 4.6 mm error. Angular deviations for SAX planning were 2.0° (2CH) and 1.5° (4CH). For long-axis views, angulation errors were lower using SAX mid slices (3.3° for 2CH, 2.6° for 4CH) compared to SAX base (4.0° and 3.9°, respectively).
A deep learning-based automated workflow for cardiac MRI planning is feasible with improved precision."

MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this PRISMA‑compliant review (PROSPERO CRD42024523301), five databases were searched to February 2025 for English‑language studies reporting accuracy metrics. Risk of bias was assessed with QUADAS‑AI. Hierarchical summary ROC models pooled sensitivity, specificity, and AUC for each analytical level; subgroup analysis and meta‑regression explored heterogeneity by test‑set origin, imaging modality, and scanner vendor.
36 studies (96,956 patients; 171,552 images) were eligible; 28 provided 113 contingency tables. Pooled subject‑level sensitivity/specificity was 84%/91% (AUC 0.94); vertebra‑level 80%/97% (AUC 0.96). Subject-level models prioritized sensitivity, whereas vertebra-level models achieved higher specificity with precise localization. External validation lowered sensitivity, yet retained high specificity. Radiographs favored subject‑level screening, whereas CT supported vertebra‑level precision. Multi‑vendor datasets improved subject‑level sensitivity, and single‑vendor datasets enhanced vertebra‑level specificity. Methodological quality varied across studies; QUADAS-AI identified high risk of patient selection bias-the most commonly identified bias source-in 61% of studies.
Deep learning models demonstrate high accuracy for vertebral fracture detection; subject-level approaches are suited to screening/triage due to higher sensitivity, whereas vertebra-level approaches offer higher specificity and precise localization for confirmatory diagnosis and treatment planning. Given performance variability across imaging modality and data sources, clinical use should align model granularity with the intended task and context."

The main difficulty lies in acquiring balanced training spectral data and creation of diverse annotated image dataset for robust DL model training. Therefore, efficient methods for spectral data collection and creation of annotated image datasets are necessary for accurately identifying analytes and mixtures, facilitating intelligent spectroscopic solutions.
This study introduces the YOLO (You Only Look Once) model for analysis of diverse spectra of pharmaceutical mixtures, trace pesticides and dyes, prepared with a cost-effective, simple-to-use surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy technique combined with a portable spectrometer towards affordable customized applications. A novel scalable vector graphics (SVG) approach is presented for automated production of large-scale annotated spectral image datasets, accommodating various spectrometer display settings. The YOLOv8m model showed exceptional mean average precision (mAP50) of 0.992 and mAP50-95 over 0.991 for classification of 90 different spectra classes comprising of open-source solvents dataset and experimentally generated Raman/SERS dataset including different composition varied mixtures. These metrics were robust against diverse variations of spectral shifts, intensities, noise, fluorescence background, and spectral range, surpassing 1D CNN analysis. YOLOv8m performance is benchmarked against a smaller YOLOv8n model and its wide applicability is shown with precise identification of FTIR spectra with eight different representations. With the model training complemented by albumentations such as skew and rotation, we demonstrated precise spectra detection and classification via smartphone by capturing the images from computer screen or printed paper.
For spectroscopy, the YOLO method provides an alternative approach for spectra classification with several aspects: 1) data length or spectral range independent quick analysis with spectra visuals, 2) on-spot identification of multiple spectra in a single image, and 3) simplified analysis procedure from a trained model on analytes of interest. Moreover, YOLO has demonstrated reliable identification of compound mixtures of fixed compositions from spectra of closely varied features that fulfill the main aim of spectroscopy for wide range of applications."

Traditional cytological analysis methods, such as manual interpretation of Pap smears, are often labor-intensive and susceptible to human error. Recent advances in deep learning offer promising solutions, yet many existing models lack generalization across datasets and struggle with multi-class classification challenges.
To address these limitations, this work introduces a Modified High-Dimensional Feature Fusion (HDFF) framework. The proposed method integrates normalized feature vectors extracted from seven diverse pre-trained CNN architectures-VGG16, VGG19, ResNet50, XceptionNet, InceptionV3, DenseNet121, and a Lightweight Feature extractor. These features are concatenated to form a unified representation, which is then processed by a fully connected classifier with dropout and batch normalization to enhance generalization and reduce redundancy.
The model is evaluated on four benchmark datasets: Herlev, SIPaKMeD, Mendeley LBC, and Malhari. It achieves an accuracy of up to 99.85 % in binary classification tasks and maintains high precision, recall, F1-score, specificity, and AUC in more complex multi-class settings. On the Herlev dataset, for example, it attains a precision of 0.995, recall of 0.987, and F1-score of 0.985. Compared to existing approaches, the Modified HDFF demonstrates lower misclassification rates and stable performance across class imbalances and dataset variations.
The results confirm the robustness and adaptability of the Modified HDFF framework, making it a reliable candidate for real-world cervical cancer screening. Its ability to generalize across datasets underscores its clinical relevance and diagnostic value."

The traditional screening methods for scoliosis have the disadvantages of unnecessary radiation exposure, the dependence on equipment, and the high demand on operators. Although the advent of deep learning techniques provides a new perspective for rapid and convenient screening of scoliosis, the existing related research faces challenges caused by issues such as image background diversity, image size inconsistency, and class imbalance. In order to solve the about problems, a method based on BAEN-SKCNN is proposed for early screening and severity diagnosis of scoliosis using back images. Specifically, BAEN is constructed to extract the back region to improve the diagnostic accuracy and model universality. Spatial pyramid pooling and selective kernel network are used to construct SKCNN for early screening and severity diagnosis of scoliosis. On a self-made scoliosis dataset, the proposed method achieves 98 % accuracy for early screening and 73 % accuracy for severity diagnosis, respectively. Combined with the APP software developed, the proposed method can easily and quickly complete the diagnosis of scoliosis without the limitation of venues, equipment and personnel. It has a certain application prospect in the large-scale screening of scoliosis, and has certain clinical significance for improving the diagnostic rate of scoliosis."

While many models predict the binding affinity between small molecules and proteins, they often overemphasize molecular features while overlooking important protein characteristics, leading to biased predictions. Traditional deep learning models, such as transformerCPI, show limited performance in tasks like label inversion on G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) datasets. To address this, this study proposes an enhanced transformer-based model that integrates both molecular and protein information. By leveraging Molr and ProtTrans networks for feature extraction, and incorporating a transposed attention mechanism with a triple-loss self-supervised learning approach, the model improves prediction accuracy. Experimental results show that the proposed model achieved observed Area Under the Curve (AUC) of 0.81 on the GPCR label-inversion dataset and 0.92 on a human target dataset, which are numerically higher than those reported for TransformerCPI and several baseline methods in our experiments. These observations indicate improved performance in our experimental setting, offering promising prospects for advancing virtual drug screening and drug discovery."

Despite its growing use, its full potential remains underutilized in equine medicine, an area of both high economic and clinical importance. Accurate survival prediction in horses with colic is crucial for timely intervention and improved clinical outcomes.
This study aimed to predict survival outcomes in horse colic cases by developing models that combine traditional machine-learning algorithms (XGBoost, Light Gradient Boosting Machine [LightGBM], and Categorical Boosting [CatBoost]) with advanced deep-learning architectures (TabNet, Feature Tokenizer Transformer [FT_Transformer], and Neural Oblivious Decision Ensemble [NODE]). Missing clinical data were imputed using deep-learning-based approaches-Generative Adversarial Imputation Networks (GAIN-OneHot, GAIN-Emb) and Missing Data Imputation via Denoising Autoencoder (MIDAS). Class imbalance was addressed through Conditional Tabular Generative Adversarial Network (CTGAN) and Tabular Variational Autoencoder (TVAE). Model interpretability was assessed using the SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP)-based Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) framework to identify the most influential features contributing to survival prediction.
Among the tested combinations, the TVAE-GAIN-OneHot-LightGBM pipeline achieved the highest classification performance, with an area under the curve (AUC) value of 0.928, outperforming conventional statistical and machine-learning baselines. SHAP analysis revealed that total_protein, abdomo_appearance, mucous_membrane, packed_cell_volume, and temp_of_extremities were the most decisive clinical variables influencing the model's predictions.
The findings demonstrate that ensuring data integrity, optimizing model complexity, and integrating XAI-based interpretability substantially enhance the reliability and clinical applicability of AI-driven models in veterinary medicine. The proposed framework provides a pioneering and explainable approach for developing accurate prognostic systems in equine colic, paving the way for broader AI adoption in clinical veterinary practice."

Kinovea, as an accessible motion-analysis software, provides both visual and quantitative feedback. However, its application in supporting technique development among beginner athletes remains insufficiently explored. Aim: This study aims to describe the use of Kinovea in biomechanics training and examine its contribution to the awareness of kinematic characteristics and movement techniques among beginner athletes. Methods: A descriptive qualitative design involved 72 beginner athletes aged 18–25 years selected through purposive sampling. Data were collected over 16 weeks through interviews, field observations, and motion video recordings analyzed using Kinovea. Kinematic data focused on joint angles, stride behavior, and movement phases during walking, running, and the flight phase. Qualitative data were analyzed using content analysis with NVivo 12, while kinematic results were interpreted descriptively to identify performance patterns and areas for technical refinement. Result: Kinematic analysis showed coordinated joint-angle patterns across all phases. Walking analysis identified arm swing angles of 50.9°–58.8° and leg separation angles of 64.3°–67.2°, indicating a stable gait rhythm. The running analysis revealed knee angles of 68.8°–69.8° and elbow angles of 87.6°–89.1°, indicating efficient propulsive mechanics. The flight phase demonstrated knee angles of 81.2°–87.8° and elbow angles of 80.4°–88.3°, suggesting effective momentum use and postural stability. These measurements supported stride-efficiency assessment and technique evaluation. Qualitative findings revealed that Kinovea enabled athletes to interpret movement phases and identify technical inefficiencies through slow-motion and frame-by-frame visualization. Conclusion: Kinovea supports basic motion analysis by providing clear kinematic information and helping beginner athletes observe and refine their movement techniques. The findings also offer practical value for coaches by enabling more precise identification of inefficient patterns and guiding targeted corrections during early-stage training."

Тодуров,10.31928/3083-7111-2025.3.714,2025-12-03,Cardiac Surgery and Interventional Cardiology,"The aim – to evaluate the clinical outcomes of surgical treatment in patients with combined aortic and mitral valve disease in the setting of concomitant coronary artery disease (CAD), who underwent simultaneous valve replacement and coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG), with analysis of preoperative, intraoperative, and postoperative parameters. Materials and methods. A retrospective analysis of 35 cases of combined surgical interventions (AVR + MVR + CABG), performed at the Heart Institute of the Ministry of Health of Ukraine between 2019 and 2023, was conducted. The study assessed clinical characteristics, echocardiographic findings, intraoperative data, postoperative course, complications, and mortality rates. Risk stratification was performed using EuroSCORE II and the STS Risk Calculator.Results. In patients with severe multivalvular disease (n = 35), mitral regurgitation (100 %) and concomitant heart failure (94.3 %) were predominant. Postoperative improvement of NYHA class was observed in 74.3 % of cases. Mortality rate was 14.3 %, with infectious (51 %) and neurological (39 %) complications being common. Atrial fibrillation was associated with higher mortality. Postoperative echocardiography showed improved hemodynamics. These findings confirm the effectiveness of combined surgical intervention when careful patient selection is ensured.Conclusions. Simultaneous aortic and mitral valve replacement combined with coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) represents a clinically justified surgical strategy for patients with combined valvular pathology and coronary artery disease, including those at intermediate and high risk according to the EuroSCORE II and STS scales. Despite acceptable survival rates, the incidence of postoperative complications remains significant, due to acute kidney injury, stroke, infections, ventricular fibrillation, and the need for reinterventions)."

Beat-to-beat cardiac output monitoring using the MostCare™ PRAM (Pressure Recording Analytical Method) system guided vasopressor titration with phenylephrine, maintaining hemodynamic stability. The patient remained hemodynamically stable throughout the intraoperative and postoperative periods, with no pulmonary edema or arrhythmias, and was discharged on postoperative day four. This case demonstrates that graded epidural anesthesia, when combined with advanced hemodynamic monitoring and collaborative care, represents a safe and effective alternative to general anesthesia in parturients with severe valvular heart disease."

It is a significant cause of sudden cardiac death, particularly in young individuals, often remaining undiagnosed until autopsy. Methods: A systematic review of the literature was conducted following PRISMA guidelines to revisit the main postmortem findings (gross, microscopic, and genetic) useful to perform the postmortem diagnosis of DCM. Scientific databases (PubMed and Scopus) were searched for articles published up to February 2025 describing postmortem findings in individuals diagnosed with DCM. Inclusion criteria were focused on studies reporting macroscopic cardiac findings, and microscopic and genetic variants identified postmortem or in related familial studies. Data were extracted and categorized to identify consistent diagnostic markers and to assess the frequency and relevance of genetic findings in autopsy-confirmed DCM cases. From 2081 initial records, 30 studies met inclusion criteria. Two reviewers independently performed study selection and data extraction, and methodological limitations of the included studies were considered qualitatively to inform the synthesis. Results: Common macroscopic features included increased heart weight (often &gt; 350 g), dilated left or biventricular chambers, and thinning of the ventricular walls. Histologically, the most consistent findings were diffuse interstitial fibrosis, myocyte hypertrophy, and nuclear atypia. Particular attention was given to morphological features essential to distinguish between genetic and nongenetic forms of DCM and, thus, useful to perform a differential diagnosis with disease having a DCM-like pattern. Notably, truncating variants in genes such as TTN, FLNC, DSP, PKP2, and MYH7 were frequently reported, particularly in young decedents with no significant history of cardiac disease. However, only about half of reviewed studies included any form of genetic analysis, reflecting a significant gap in current practice for forensic pathologists. Conclusions: DCM may cause sudden death without prior symptoms, making genetic testing essential to uncover the diagnosis, especially in cases with a negative phenotype. Therefore, molecular autopsy combined with careful macroscopic and microscopic analysis can strengthen the forensic assessment."

Over the past decades, open-heart mitral valve surgery has been the gold-standard intervention for this complex disorder, but in recent years, transcatheter edge-to-edge repair has emerged as a valuable option in selected clinical scenarios. However, a considerable proportion of patients develop recurrent mitral regurgitation during follow-up, leading to a significant increase in morbidity and mortality. In this context, data is limited regarding the optimal approach. This review provides an overview of the current evidence on transcatheter mitral valve intervention therapies for the management of recurrent mitral regurgitation following transcatheter edge-to-edge repair."
OpenAlex,valvular heart disease,Fatal Aortic Regurgitation in Behçet's Disease: A Case Report Highlighting Pitfalls and Lessons in Preoperative Diagnosis,Juan Wu; Xiao-feng Wang; Fang Nie,10.2174/0115734056421966251114111950,2025-11-29,Current Medical Imaging Formerly Current Medical Imaging Reviews,"Introduction: Behçet's disease (BD), a chronic multisystem inflammatory disorder, rarely involves the heart. Aortic regurgitation (AR) is the predominant valvular lesion. When AR precedes characteristic mucocutaneous symptoms, misdiagnosis and treatment delays often occur. Case Presentation: We, herein, report the case of a 37-year-old male presenting with isolated aortic regurgitation (AR) as the initial manifestation of Behçet's disease (BD). Initial echocardiography revealed severe eccentric AR with left coronary cusp prolapse and a vegetation-like lesion, raising suspicion of infective endocarditis; however, relapsed oral ulcers developed postoperatively, ultimately confirming BD diagnosis. Despite successful aortic valve replacement, delayed diagnosis due to absent early mucocutaneous symptoms contributed to catastrophic prosthetic valve dehiscence with severe paravalvular leak. The patient underwent an emergency Bentall procedure with venoarterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (VAECMO) support but succumbed to cardiogenic shock and multiorgan failure. Pathological analysis demonstrated tissue necrosis with minimal inflammation. Conclusion: Isolated AR may be BD's initial manifestation, preceding classic symptoms by months. Echocardiographic features, including valve prolapse and perivalvular lesions, despite their non-specificity, should prompt screening for BD. Inherent tissue fragility in BD significantly elevates postoperative risks of paravalvular leak and prosthetic valve dehiscence. Early identification, optimal surgical procedure, and timely immunosuppressive therapy are essential to improve the prognosis of cardiac BD."

Al-Shammari; Yahya Alansari; Raja Dashti; FS ROOMI,10.4103/accj.accj_24_24,2025-11-29,Annals of Clinical Cardiology,"Abstract This study compared the recommendations for the diagnosis and management of mitral stenosis (MS), a leading cause of valvular heart disease, as outlined in the 2021 European Society of Cardiology/European Association for Cardio-Thoracic Surgery guidelines and the 2020 American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association guidelines. A systematic review of the guidelines was conducted to inform clinical judgment. The preferred approach for diagnosing and grading MS involves a multimodal strategy that encompasses transthoracic and transesophageal echocardiography, assessment of evolving symptoms, hemodynamic evaluation via cardiac catheterization, and exercise testing. Both guidelines converge on the use of anticoagulation therapy, which has demonstrated efficacy in reducing thromboembolic events associated with rheumatic MS. However, a nuanced difference exists between the guidelines in terms of the criteria for assessing MS severity."

Buriman; Daniel Lighezan,10.3390/jcdd12120468,2025-11-29,Journal of Cardiovascular Development and Disease,"Aortic stenosis (AS), a progressive valvular disease that results in increasing left ventricular (LV) afterload, leads to ventricular dysfunction and heart failure if left untreated. Transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) has emerged as a minimally invasive and effective alternative to surgical replacement, especially in elderly or high-risk patients. Objectives: The present study aims to assess the influence of the tricuspid annular plane systolic excursion (TAPSE)/pulmonary systolic arterial pressure (PASP) ratio on clinical outcomes in patients with aortic stenosis undergoing TAVR and offer valuable insights into patient selection and tailored management strategies for individuals undergoing TAVR. Methods: A retrospective analysis was conducted on 100 patients with AS who underwent TAVR, included in two distinct groups based on their median TAPSE/PASP ratio. Results: Patients were divided according to their median TAPSE/PASP ratio into two groups. Those with lower TAPSE/PASP ratios had a higher incidence of post-procedural atrial fibrillation (AF) (48% vs. 28%, p = 0.0404), lower left-ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) (41.06% vs. 49.50%, p &lt; 0.0001), a more pronounced inflammatory and hematologic response, and longer hospitalization. Receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) analysis demonstrated modest but significant discrimination rather than high sensitivity or specificity for postprocedural arrhythmias, particularly atrial fibrillation. Conclusions: TAPSE/PASP should be regarded as a clinically useful risk-stratification marker in patients with AS undergoing TAVR, enabling the identification of high-risk patients and optimizing peri-procedural management."

According to current ESC guidelines, cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) is a class I recommendation for the initial evaluation of patients with suspected cardiomyopathy, given its ability to provide comprehensive morphological and tissue characterization. CMR, however, may be precluded in patients owing to device incompatibility, claustrophobia, or arrhythmia- and motion-related image degradation. In this context, cardiac computed tomography (CCT), traditionally used for assessing coronary artery disease, has emerged as a valuable alternative. Technological advancements have enabled CCT to deliver not only detailed anatomical information but also functional and tissue-specific insights. The recent consensus document from the European Association of Cardiovascular Imaging underscore the expanding clinical applications of CCT, highlighting its potential role in the diagnostic work-up and phenotypic classification of cardiomyopathies. In this review, we summarize the current evidence supporting the use of CCT in patients with suspected cardiomyopathy, outline its clinical strengths and limitations, and discuss emerging developments such as artificial intelligence and radiomics, which could further enhance its diagnostic and prognostic value.
