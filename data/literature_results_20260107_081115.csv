PubMed,aortic stenosis,Early and intermediate outcomes of cavitron ultrasonic surgical aspiration to treat mitral annular calcification.,Wendy Jin; Sabet W Hashim; Raymond G Mckay; Jeff Mather; Susan Collazo; David W Yaffee,10.1093/ejcts/ezag016,2026-01-06,European journal of cardio-thoracic surgery : official journal of the European Association for Cardio-thoracic Surgery,"Severe mitral annular calcification (MAC) carries an increased risk of perioperative complications in patients undergoing mitral valve surgery and may be considered a prohibitive surgical risk. Cavitron ultrasonic surgical aspiration (CUSA) has been reported as a method for controlled debridement of severe MAC during mitral valve surgery, however experience in the literature is limited.
We assessed 30-day and intermediate-term outcomes in 67 consecutive patients (mean age: 72 (SD 9) years; female sex: 65.7% (44/67)) with severe MAC who underwent mitral valve repair or replacement for mitral stenosis and/or regurgitation using CUSA between 3/2021 and 12/2024. Operations included isolated mitral valve replacement (41.8% (28/67)), isolated mitral valve repair (4.5% (3/67)), mitral and aortic valve replacement (37.3% (25/67), mitral valve replacement with coronary bypass (6.0% (4/67)), and mitral and aortic valve replacement with coronary bypass (10.4% (7/67)). Intermediate survival was estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method.
Mortality rate was 6.0% (4/67), stroke was 3.0% (2/67), and new postoperative atrial fibrillation was 29.0% (20/67). There were no atrioventricular groove ruptures. At a median echocardiographic follow-up time of 361 days (IQR 112, 671) moderate paravalvular leak occurred in 3.0% (1/67). Mid-term all-cause mortality was 9.0% at a mean follow-up time of 42.5 (95% CI 39.0, 46.0) months.
The use of CUSA to debride severe mitral annular calcification in patients undergoing mitral valve surgery is associated with acceptable short-term morbidity and mortality and durable intermediate-term results. This technique allows surgical intervention in patients who may otherwise be deemed prohibitive surgical risk."

This study aims to delineate the prenatal phenotypes, inheritance patterns, and outcomes of 7q11.23 copy number variations (CNVs).
A retrospective study of 20 prenatal cases with 7q11.23 CNVs diagnosed by SNP array or CNV sequencing (CNV-seq) was conducted. Clinical data, including ultrasound findings, genetic results, and pregnancy outcomes, were analyzed.
Classic 7q11.23 deletions (1.42 Mb median size) were associated with ultrasound anomalies in 100% of cases (11/11), predominantly cardiovascular defects (36.4%, 4/11) and growth restriction (18.2%, 2/11). While 7q11.23 duplications (1.42-3.03 Mb) were associated with anomalies in 50% of cases (3/6), including cleft palate and ventriculomegaly. Inheritance pattern analysis revealed 50% of deletions (6/12) and 42.9% of duplications (3/7) were inherited, either from phenotypically normal or abnormal parents. Termination of pregnancy (TOP) occurred in 76.5% (13/17) of ongoing pregnancies, primarily for de novo CNVs. Four live births involved inherited CNVs.
7q11.23 CNVs exhibit significant prenatal phenotypic variability and inheritance heterogeneity. Advanced genomic testing and inheritance pattern analysis are critical for accurate diagnosis and counseling."

Here we demonstrate that sphingosine kinase 1 (SPHK1) is a key node in these contexts. Sphk1 is the most upregulated transcript in Eln(-/-) aortic SMCs at embryonic day 15.5 when these cells are initially hyperproliferative. The aorta of humans with SVAS also upregulates SPHK1. Reduced ELN increases levels of transcription factor early growth response 1, resulting in increased SPHK1 levels. SMC-specific Sphk1 deletion or pharmacological inhibition of SPHK1 attenuates SMC proliferation and mitigates aortic disease. Furthermore, treatment with a SPHK1 inhibitor reduces DA SMC accumulation, leading to DA patency in wild-type mice. These findings indicate that inhibiting SPHK1 may be a therapeutic strategy for SVAS and select congenital heart diseases in which patent DA maintains circulation."

This review examines AI applications in VIR procedures that utilize imaging modalities as input across preprocedural, intraprocedural, and post-procedural stages. A comprehensive literature search across PubMed, Embase, and Web of Science identified studies employing AI models with direct patient care impact, categorized by imaging modality (CT, MRI, fluoroscopy/DSA, ultrasound, X-ray, and multimodal) and task type (segmentation, detection, prediction, and miscellaneous). AI demonstrated substantial promise across multiple VIR domains. Deep learning models achieved high Dice similarity coefficients (0.82-0.962) for anatomical structure segmentation including aortic dissections and abdominal aortic aneurysms. Detection tasks showed excellent performance with accuracies up to 95% for endoleak detection and AUCs reaching 0.97 for vessel stenosis identification. Prediction models frequently outperformed traditional clinical assessments, with AUCs exceeding 0.90 for outcomes after EVAR, TEVAR, TACE, and TARE procedures. Radiomics-based approaches combined with machine learning proved particularly effective for treatment response prediction and risk stratification. Despite challenges including limited dataset sizes, potential bias, and interpretability concerns, AI shows transformative potential in VIR. Continued clinician AI expert collaboration will be crucial for responsible deployment and optimization of patient care in interventional radiology."

The purpose of this study was to improve the accuracy of PGAV measurements by echocardiography in small annuli and to evaluate the influence of PGAV on prognosis. The internal derivation cohort included 273 consecutive patients with aortic stenosis and a small annulus (computed tomographic scan showing an annulus circumference < 72 mm or area < 400 mm2) who underwent TAVR. Patients completed transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) and LHC measurements during TAVR, and an extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost) algorithm was trained. The primary outcome was a composite end point of all-cause mortality and readmission for heart failure. The mean PGAV level measured by TTE was overestimated compared to the LHC measurement {52.5 [interquartile range: 47.5-57.0] mmHg vs. 42.5 (interquartile range: 38.0-46.0) mmHg, P < 0.001}. After adjustments to the XGBoost, the mean PGAV measured by TTE could be significantly improved [Pearson correlation coefficient = 0.94, P < 0.001]. Importantly, patients with a predicted mean PGAV ≥ 68.6 mmHg showed a significantly increased incidence of composite end points at 2 years after the procedures (40.7% vs. 16.0%, P < 0.001). The XGBoost model could effectively improve the accuracy of the mean PGAV measured by TTE during TAVR, and the predicted mean increase in the PGAV level may lead to a worse prognosis.Clinical Trial Registration: ClinicalTrials.gov Protocol Registration System (NCT05044338)."

Procedural factors associated with THV deformation remain incompletely understood.
We aimed to investigate procedural factors associated with valve underexpansion, mainly derived from preprocedural computed tomography angiography (CTA) imaging.
A single-centre, retrospective, observational study was carried out, including patients who underwent TAVI with an ACURATE THV between January 2014 and December 2022, with available CTA and procedural fluoroscopy. Aortic calcium volume was quantified using 3mensio software. Fluoroscopy was used to determine valve frame underexpansion.
Of 3,027 patients, 480 were eligible (74 [15.4%] with an underexpanded and 406 [84.6%] with an expanded ACURATE THV). There were no differences regarding baseline clinical and procedural characteristics. Preprocedural CTA assessment showed more calcium at the annulus level in underexpanded versus expanded THVs (60.3 [interquartile range [IQR] 21.3; 135.2] mm3 vs 45.3 [IQR 15.8; 96.1] mm3, respectively; p=0.042), while post-dilatation was less frequently performed in underexpanded compared to expanded THVs (44.6% vs 64.8%, respectively; p=0.001). Multivariable regression analysis revealed that annulus calcium volume (odds ratio [OR] 2.333, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.331-4.089; p=0.003) and post-dilatation (OR 0.350, 95% CI: 0.203-0.602; p<0.001) were significantly associated with underexpanded THVs. Sensitivity analysis using annulus calcium volume as a dichotomised variable (>54 mm3) confirmed the significant association with valve frame underexpansion (OR 2.38, 95% CI: 1.37-4.19; p=0.002).
Annular calcium volume was shown to be associated with underexpanded ACURATE THVs, while post-dilatation may reduce valve deformation."

The Lp(a) particle is enriched with oxidized phospholipids (OxPLs), which confer enhanced atherogenic and pro-inflammatory properties compared with low-density lipoprotein (LDL). Robust genetic and epidemiologic evidence demonstrates that elevated Lp(a) levels are independently associated with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease and calcific aortic valve stenosis. However, no pharmacologic therapy has yet been approved that specifically lower Lp(a) or to demonstrate a reduction in cardiovascular events. Antisense oligonucleotides (e.g., pelacarsen), small-interfering RNAs (e.g., olpasiran, lepodisiran, and zerlasiran), and oral small-molecule Lp(a) inhibitors (e.g., muvalaplin) have demonstrated profound reductions in circulating Lp(a) concentrations, typically achieving decreases of 80-90%. In some studies, the reductions approached or achieved a near-complete suppression. Current genetic and modeling evidence suggests that an absolute reduction of at least 50 mg/dL in Lp(a) levels is required to achieve meaningful cardiovascular benefits. Large-scale outcome trials are now underway to assess the effects of these emerging therapies on cardiovascular and valvular outcomes. Early findings indicate favorable effects on oxidized phospholipids and vascular inflammation, suggesting broader anti-atherogenic potential. As these agents progress toward clinical use, routine Lp(a) measurement and risk stratification will become increasingly essential for personalized cardiovascular prevention. This review summarizes the molecular biology of Lp(a), highlights the limitations of current therapies, and discusses emerging RNA-based and small-molecule approaches with the potential to redefine the management of residual cardiovascular risk."

She presented with progressive heart failure; echocardiography showed severe mitral stenosis (mitral valve area 0.96 cm2) and moderate aortic stenosis with moderate paravalvular leak. To avert patient-prosthesis mismatch (PPM), both annuli were enlarged with bovine pericardium, permitting implantation of an Epic 27 mm mitral and an Inspiris 23 mm aortic bioprosthesis. Postoperative echocardiography demonstrated excellent hemodynamics (aortic effective orifice area 1.76 cm2, mean gradient 6 mmHg; mitral mean gradient 3 mmHg).

Despite widespread use, optimal periprocedural anaesthetic management remains highly variable, and evidence-based guidance is lacking.
An interdisciplinary panel of Italian experts in anaesthesiology, cardiology, and cardiac surgery conducted a systematic review of the literature and used the RAND/UCLA Appropriateness Method to evaluate 1032 clinical scenarios across a range of risk profiles and comorbid conditions. Ratings were conducted over three rounds, including a moderated in-person meeting to refine and discuss appropriateness scores.
A minimally invasive approach, local anaesthesia alone, and conscious sedation were judged appropriate across most clinical scenarios. Invasive monitoring, such as placement of an additional arterial catheter or a central venous catheter, was recommended only in selected high-risk patients. Several approaches or interventions were consistently rated inappropriate across all evaluated scenarios, including nurse-administered anaesthesia, pulmonary artery catheterisation, and cardiac output monitoring using pulse wave analysis. Other approaches, such as general anaesthesia and deep sedation, were considered inappropriate in most cases but retained uncertainty in select clinical contexts. Several recommendations were rated as necessary to define a minimum standard of care.
This Italian consensus statement provides practical, expert-driven recommendations to standardise anaesthetic care for transfemoral TAVI. While many recommendations reached strong consensus, areas of uncertainty remain, underscoring the need for further clinical research. Patient-centred, individualised decision-making remains essential, guided by institutional experience and procedural complexity."

We evaluated short- and long-term mortality following TAVR in patients with active or prior cancer using a large single-center registry.
We conducted a retrospective cohort study of 1511 patients who underwent TAVR at a tertiary center between 2013 and 2022, categorized by cancer status: no cancer, past cancer, or active cancer (defined as diagnosis within 12 months, metastatic disease, or ongoing oncologic treatment). Mortality outcomes were assessed using Kaplan-Meier curves and Cox proportional hazards models, with multivariable adjustment for clinical risk factors.
Among 1511 patients, 1336 (88.4 %) had no cancer, 123 (8.1 %) had past cancer and 52 (3.5 %) had active cancer. Patients with active cancer had similar 30-day (HR 0.82; 95 % CI 0.11-6.01; p = 0.845) and 1-year mortality (HR 1.73; 95 % CI 0.80-3.72; p = 0.160) compared with those without cancer. At 3 years, active cancer was independently associated with increased mortality (HR 2.04; 95 % CI 1.24-3.34; p = 0.004), with the highest risk seen in gastrointestinal and hematologic malignancies. Patients with breast or prostate cancer had more favorable outcomes.
TAVR in patients with active cancer is associated with comparable short- and mid-term outcomes relative to those without patients, supporting its feasibility in selected individuals. Long-term mortality varies by cancer type, highlighting the need for multidisciplinary, individualized decision-making when evaluating procedural candidacy."

However, the long-term prognostic impact of MVHD in this population remains poorly characterized. The aim of this study was to evaluate the long-term clinical outcomes and echocardiographic evolution of MVHD in TAVR recipients.
A total of 1,918 consecutive patients with severe symptomatic aortic stenosis (AS) undergoing TAVR were included. MVHD was defined as the presence of moderate or greater mitral (MR) and/or tricuspid regurgitation (TR) prior to the procedure. Baseline, procedural, and follow-up data (median of 4.0 [2.8-5.2] years) were prospectively collected. Changes in MR and/or TR severity were assessed from baseline to the last available echocardiography RESULTS: A total of 450 (23.5%) patients had MVHD at baseline. The presence of MVHD was associated with an increased all-cause mortality (adjusted HR: 1.21, 95% CI: 1.04-1.40; p=0.011) and cardiovascular mortality (adjusted HR: 1.29, 95% CI: 1.04-1.61; p=0.018) at follow-up. After adjustment, only baseline moderate or greater TR remained independently associated with all-cause mortality (HR: 1.38; CI: 1.04-1.84; p=0.027). At discharge, MR improved in 181 patients (51.7%) with similar rates across MR mechanism (p = 0.582), while those with TR improved in 71 (40.5%). MVHD improvement was sustained over time, whereas the absence of recovery was associated with a higher risk of all-cause mortality and cardiovascular mortality up to 6 years.
Patients with MVHD exhibit worse long-term outcomes after TAVR. While TAVR provides sustained improvement of concomitant valvular lesions in about half of patients, lack of recovery at discharge, predicted poorer long-term survival, highlighting the need for comprehensive baseline assessment and close echocardiographic follow-up in this high-risk population."

The advent of artificial intelligence-enabled electrocardiograms (AI-ECG) and point-of-care cardiac-ultrasonography (POCCUS) offers promising new approaches for patient screening. We explored the feasibility and potential of integrating these innovative technologies into a practical SHD screening framework.
Outpatients undergoing ECG at the Mayo Clinic ECG laboratory between November 2023 and February 2024 were pragmatically offered POCCUS, performed by novice operators and reviewed by expert echocardiographers. AI-ECG and POCCUS findings were integrated to assess SHD, including reduced left ventricular systolic function (ejection-fraction<50%), aortic stenosis, and increased left ventricular wall thickness suggestive of cardiac amyloidosis or hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. Operators were blinded to patients' comorbidities and formal echocardiogram results.
Of 486 patients (median-age 64 years;49% women), 286 had available formal echocardiography, with 17.5% having SHD. AI-ECG had a 32% positive predictive value (PPV) and a 94% negative predictive value (NPV) to detect any SHD. Adding POCCUS increased the overall PPV to 64% with an NPV of 93%, with an increase in diagnostic accuracy from 67% to 88%. Notably, 89.5% (17/19) of the ""false positives"" by AI-ECG+POCCUS had less-than-moderate-SHD. Applying the AI-ECG+POCCUS screening workflow on the entire cohort resulted in a number-needed-to-screen of eight to identify one patient requiring formal echocardiography.
The integration of AI-ECG and POCCUS holds promise as a potentially effective screening method for SHD, facilitating improved patient selection for formal echocardiography."

Cardiovascular interventions,"Cardiac conduction disturbances remain the most frequent complication of transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR), but the clinical implications of new left bundle branch block (LBBB) after TAVR remain controversial. Here, we aim to assess the impact of new LBBB after TAVR on patient outcomes in a large, real-world registry.
The study population consisted of patients in the TVT registry (Society of Thoracic Surgery and American College of Cardiology Transcatheter Valve Therapy Registry) who underwent TAVR for aortic stenosis between 2016 and 2022 and were discharged alive from the index hospitalization. Key exclusion criteria included preexisting conduction defects and a permanent pacemaker before TAVR or during the index hospitalization. Clinical outcomes were compared between patients with and without new LBBB using Cox proportional hazards models adjusted for baseline demographic, clinical, and echocardiographic variables.
Among 202 533 TAVR recipients, 32 933 (16.3%) developed new LBBB after TAVR. Over the study period, there was a significant decrease in the incidence of new LBBB from 19.9% in the first quarter of 2016 to 14.4% in the third quarter of 2022. Patients with new LBBB after TAVR, compared with those without LBBB, had significantly greater 1-year all-cause mortality (adjusted hazard ratio, 1.19 [95% CI, 1.13-1.25]; P<0.001), hospital readmission (adjusted hazard ratio, 1.23 [95% CI, 1.19-1.28]; P<0.001), and new pacemaker requirement (adjusted hazard ratio, 3.50 [95% CI, 3.26-3.76]; P<0.001). Patients with new LBBB also had lower Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire Overall Summary scores (adjusted difference, -1.7 points [95% CI, -2.1 to -1.3]; P<0.001) and left ventricular ejection fraction (adjusted difference, -2.8% [95% CI, -3.4% to -2.2%]; P<0.001).
New LBBB after TAVR is associated with worse 1-year outcomes, including death, rehospitalization, and permanent pacemaker, as well as worse health status and lower left ventricular ejection fraction. These findings suggest that continued efforts to limit the development of conduction disturbance after TAVR are warranted."

Multivariate logistic regression identified independent predictors of mild/moderate PVR, optimal cutoff values for significant anatomical parameters were determined using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis. Patients were subsequently stratified into three risk groups based on these thresholds.
Mild/moderate PVR occurred in 24.0 % of patients. Independent predictors included aortic annular perimeter (OR:1.067, P = 0.015), device landing zone calcific volume (OR:1.006 per 10 mm³, P = 0.025), and presence of sealing skirt (OR:0.412, P = 0.010). The combination of these predictors had a higher discriminative performance (AUC=0.779) than single predictors (P = 0.036, 0.007, and <0.001, respectively), with significant integrated discrimination improvement (integrated discrimination improvement=5.4-6.7 %, P < 0.001). ROC-derived thresholds (device landing zone calcific volume≥1240 mm³ and aortic annular perimeter≥77 mm) stratified patients into three risk groups with progressively increasing PVR incidence: Group A (neither elevate):8.4 %; Group B (either elevated):23.7 %; and Group C (both elevated):48.7 %. Pairwise comparisons confirming differences between Group A vs. B (P = 0.003) and Group B vs. C (P < 0.001). Sealing skirts significantly reduced PVR in Groups A (P = 0.042) but not in Group B and C (P = 0.082 and 0.342).
The dual-parameter model based on device landing zone calcification and aortic annular perimeter significantly enhances PVR risk stratification after SE-TAVR. The dual-threshold model provides a clinically actionable tool for pre-procedural risk stratification and personalized valve selection."

We aimed to evaluate the prognostic value of this RV-PA coupling in patients after TAVR.
RV-PA coupling was defined as the ratio of RV free wall longitudinal strain (RVFWLS) to pulmonary artery systolic pressure (PASP), measured by echocardiography in AS patients undergoing TAVR between April 2012 and November 2022. The endpoints were all cause death, cardiovascular rehospitalization, stroke, and a composite of these.
At a median follow-up time of 3.4 years, 352 (28.8%) patients in 1221 patients had composite clinical events. Patients with higher RVFWLS/PASP ratio were predominantly male, had lower body mass index, more comorbidities, higher Society of Thoracic Surgeons score, more New York Heart Association IV and worse laboratory data, alongside worse cardiac function compared to those with lower RVFWLS/PASP ratio. The fully adjusted multivariable hazard ratios of RVFWLS/PASP ratio and the tertile 3 of RVFWLS/PASP ratio were 2.228 (95% CI, 1.441-3.446) and 2.571 (95% CI, 1.633-4.047). In addition, Kaplan-Meier analyses revealed robust graded association between the RV-PA coupling and clinical outcomes (P <0.001).
The RV-PA coupling (RVFWLS/PASP ratio) is independently and robustly associated with adverse clinical events in patients undergoing TAVR. These data suggest that the RVFWLS/PASP ratio can serve as a risk stratification tool for patient selection and prognostication following TAVR."

This study aimed to evaluate periprocedural and clinical outcomes in patients with large and extra-large annuli undergoing TAVR and to compare results between balloon-expandable (BEVs) and self-expanding valves (SEVs).
This study included patients with severe aortic stenosis (AS) and extra-large annuli who underwent TAVR with either BEVs or SEVs. The primary endpoints were periprocedural and clinical outcomes, including device success, rates of moderate or greater paravalvular leak (PVL), permanent pacemaker (PPM) implantation, new Left bundle branch block (LBBB), stroke, and in-hospital and 1-year mortality. Secondary endpoints included safety outcomes and subgroup analyses comparing outcomes between patients with large (annular perimeter >90 mm and an area >660 mm²) and extra-large annuli (perimeter >96 mm and an area >730 mm²).
A total of 237 patients underwent TAVR, including 160 with BEVs and 77 with SEVs. The mean annular area and perimeter were 737 ± 76 mm² and 96.1 ± 4.1 mm, respectively, with no significant differences between groups. Overall device success was high, though slightly lower in the SEV group (84% vs. 93%, p=0.034), a difference that was no longer statistically significant after multivariate analysis (p=0.234). Moderate or greater PVL occurred more frequently with SEVs (13% vs. 4%, p = 0.016), particularly in patients with extra-large annuli (26% vs. 4%, p = 0.012). One-year mortality was similar between groups (SEV 13% vs. BEV 12%, p = 0.807), and no significant differences were observed in PPM implantation, new LBBB, stroke, or major vascular and bleeding complications.
TAVR is feasible and safe in patients with large and extra-large annuli, with higher rates of moderate or greater paravalvular leak observed in SEV patients with extra-large annuli."

The same group of participants completed the Edinburgh Depression Scale and the Corona Disease Anxiety Scale (CDAS) 4-6 weeks after childbirth.                                                           Results and Discussion:                     There was a significant correlation between family income, unwanted pregnancy as perceived by both the mother and father, and antenatal depression. Additionally, marital satisfaction played a significant role in postpartum depression. Furthermore, antenatal depression was significantly associated with neuroticism, agreeableness, and physical symptoms related to Corona disease anxiety. Personality traits, with the exception of extroversion and conscientiousness, and various domains of Corona disease anxiety, excluding psychological symptoms, were also significantly associated with postpartum depression.                                                           Conclusion:                     During pandemics or epidemics, such as the COVID-19 outbreak, experiencing mental distress during pregnancy can contribute to mental health issues during the postpartum period. This risk is particularly true in individuals with unique personality traits, emphasizing the need for increased focus on mental health within prenatal care during these crises."
Crossref,valvular heart disease,The Severity of Disease and Hospital Length of Stay for the First and Second Admission of COVID-19 Patients: An Observational Study from Southeastern Iran,Milad Ahmadi Gohari; Mohammad Hossein Mehrolhassani; Shoboo Rahmati; Elham Sharifpoor; Hossein Mirzaei; Yunes Jahani,10.2174/0126667975341163241129050027,2026-10,Coronaviruses,"Background:                     This study aimed to investigate the severity of disease and length of hospital stay for COVID-19 patients admitted to a hospital in southeastern Iran.                                                           Method:                     This cross-sectional study was conducted in Kerman, Iran. Data were collected from patients who visited Afzalipour Hospital in Kerman more than twice during the COVID-19 epidemic from the end of February 2020 to March 21, 2021. We conducted two key analyses: 1. Mixed effect logistic regression was used to check the relationship between the variables and COVID-19 severity. 2. Mixed effect linear regression was used to check the relationship between the variables and the length of stay in the hospital.                                                           Results:                     The findings indicated that the most important risk factors for the severity of COVID-19 were heart diseases (OR=1.67,95%CI:1.20-2.30), increasing age (OR=2.23 for age&gt;54, 95%CI:1.70- 2.90), male gender (OR=1.47,95%CI:1.10-1.96), respiratory diseases other than asthma, and frequency of admission (OR=1.60,95%CI:1.20-2.15). All patients who underwent readmission experienced a shorter duration of hospitalization during their subsequent admission (OR=0.94,95%CI:0.91,0.96) and had a higher mortality rate (30% within 14 days, 26.6% between 14-90 days). Patients readmitted at intervals of 14-90 days and greater than 90 days exhibited lower disease severity compared to those readmitted within the 0-14 day period.                                                           Conclusion:                     Examining readmissions, the severity of COVID-19, and the length of hospital stay in affected patients are important factors for planning and allocating resources for COVID-19 management and treatment. These factors can help policymakers develop effective clinical guidelines for hospitalization or outpatient treatment of COVID-19 patients and contribute to reducing the burden of disease in the community."

Kinovea, as an accessible motion-analysis software, provides both visual and quantitative feedback. However, its application in supporting technique development among beginner athletes remains insufficiently explored. Aim: This study aims to describe the use of Kinovea in biomechanics training and examine its contribution to the awareness of kinematic characteristics and movement techniques among beginner athletes. Methods: A descriptive qualitative design involved 72 beginner athletes aged 18–25 years selected through purposive sampling. Data were collected over 16 weeks through interviews, field observations, and motion video recordings analyzed using Kinovea. Kinematic data focused on joint angles, stride behavior, and movement phases during walking, running, and the flight phase. Qualitative data were analyzed using content analysis with NVivo 12, while kinematic results were interpreted descriptively to identify performance patterns and areas for technical refinement. Result: Kinematic analysis showed coordinated joint-angle patterns across all phases. Walking analysis identified arm swing angles of 50.9°–58.8° and leg separation angles of 64.3°–67.2°, indicating a stable gait rhythm. The running analysis revealed knee angles of 68.8°–69.8° and elbow angles of 87.6°–89.1°, indicating efficient propulsive mechanics. The flight phase demonstrated knee angles of 81.2°–87.8° and elbow angles of 80.4°–88.3°, suggesting effective momentum use and postural stability. These measurements supported stride-efficiency assessment and technique evaluation. Qualitative findings revealed that Kinovea enabled athletes to interpret movement phases and identify technical inefficiencies through slow-motion and frame-by-frame visualization. Conclusion: Kinovea supports basic motion analysis by providing clear kinematic information and helping beginner athletes observe and refine their movement techniques. The findings also offer practical value for coaches by enabling more precise identification of inefficient patterns and guiding targeted corrections during early-stage training."

In particular, aortic stenosis (AS) is an independent risk factor for heart failure-related mortality in patients undergoing HD. Recently, the analysis of digitized heart sounds using artificial intelligence (AI) has promoted the automation of cardiac disease detection and technological advances in diagnostic algorithms. Methods: We retrospectively investigated the 203 consecutive patients receiving HD who had undergone visualized phonocardiography using a regulatory-approved medical device (Japan) between January and May 2025 to detect AS. The usefulness of this phonocardiogram device, which utilizes acoustic analysis and an AI-based automatic diagnostic algorithm named the “Super Stethoscope”, was evaluated for the screening of AS in patients undergoing HD based on comparisons with findings obtained from echocardiography. Results: The results showed a significant correlation between the severity of systolic murmurs determined by the AI-based approach and the peak aortic jet velocity measured in 19 patients diagnosed with AS using transthoracic echocardiography (r = 0.578, p &lt; 0.05). Additionally, for the AI-based diagnosis of AS based on systolic murmurs, the sensitivity and specificity in detecting moderate or severe AS were 0.90 and 0.70, respectively, among the patients undergoing HD. Conclusions: The AI-based diagnostic approach using the ECG-gated phonocardiogram “Super Stethoscope” could be a promising tool for AS screening. Transthoracic echocardiography is recommended in cases classified as grade B or higher by AI-based assessment."

We present a case where an apico-aortic conduit offered a safer alternative. Case presentation A 20-year-old woman with Type IIIc GD (homozygous D409H mutation) presented with New York Heart Association (NYHA) Class III dyspnoea, palpitations, and syncope. She had hypertension, hypothyroidism, and a sibling deceased from the same condition. On enzyme replacement therapy for 6 years, she was found to have severe calcification of the aortic valve, root, and ascending aorta, stenosis of arch vessels, grade II aortic regurgitation, mild mitral stenosis, and proximal left anterior descending artery stenosis. Intraoperatively, extensive calcification precluded root and arch reconstruction. A left ventricular apex–descending thoracic aorta conduit with a mechanical valve was constructed, combined with coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) to the left anterior descending artery and an innominate artery bypass. Recovery was uneventful, and follow-up at 13 months showed the patient in NYHA Class I with patent conduit and grafts. Conclusions An apico–aortic conduit can provide a safe and effective solution in GD with porcelain aorta, avoiding high-risk aortic manipulation. To our knowledge, this is the first reported use of a valved conduit in Gaucher-related calcification, broadening surgical options for this complex patient group."

However, in a significant portion of patients, resting findings do not fully reflect the hemodynamic severity of the condition, particularly in asymptomatic individuals with severe valvular disease or those with nonspecific symptoms. In this context, stress echocardiography emerges as a vital imaging modality, providing a dynamic assessment of valvular, ventricular, and pulmonary function under hemodynamic load (from physical exercise or pharmacological agents). Methods: We conducted a comprehensive synthesis and critical evaluation of the current landscape, recent advancements, and future directions regarding the application of stress echocardiography in valvular heart disease. Results: This comprehensive review explores the incremental role of stress echocardiography in valvular heart disease, analyzing the evolution of its clinical applications, from low-flow, low-gradient aortic stenosis to the evaluation of contractile reserve and exercise-induced pulmonary hypertension in mitral stenosis and regurgitation. We discuss standardized protocols, key parameters to monitor, and the diagnostic and prognostic outcomes from major clinical trials and current guidelines. Attention is given to stress echocardiography’s ability to unmask the true severity of the disease and to identify patients at high risk for adverse events, thereby guiding crucial clinical decisions, such as the optimal timing for surgical or transcatheter intervention. Conclusions: The review evaluates the limitations of modality and outlines future research directions, including its integration with new technologies like 3D echocardiography and speckle tracking techniques, to further optimize the role of stress echocardiography as a decision-making tool in the multidisciplinary management of valvular heart disease."

Ruhparwar; Alina Zubarevich; Alexander Weymann,10.3390/jcm15010354,2026-01-02,Journal of Clinical Medicine,"Background/Objectives: Transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) has become the leading treatment option for patients suffering from aortic valve stenosis aged over 70, except in cases of specific contraindications like bicuspid valves, inappropriate access routes, or endocarditis. Minimally invasive aortic valve replacement (MIAVR) has emerged as a potential way to combine the durability of surgery with reduced procedural trauma. This study aims to assess the safety and feasibility of MIAVR in elderly patients. Methods: A total of 990 patients were included in this retrospective cohort study. Among them, 261 (26%) were aged 70 years or older (elderly cohort), and 729 (74%) were younger than 70 years (younger cohort). All patients were followed for at least 30 days postoperatively, with survival data collected through May 2025. Multivariable logistic regression, linear regression, and Kaplan–Meier survival analyses were performed. Results: Elderly patients were more likely to be female (51% vs. 40%, p = 0.001) and carried a heavier burden of vascular and renal comorbidity: renal impairment 33% vs. 17% and extracardiac arteriopathy 45% vs. 30% (both p &lt; 0.001). Major bleeding occurred more frequently in the elderly cohort (7.7% vs. 4.1%; p = 0.02), as did new permanent pacemaker implantation (10% vs. 5.8%; p = 0.021) and sepsis (3.4% vs. 1.1%; p = 0.012). Rates of stroke, perioperative myocardial infarction, ECMO/right-heart failure, re-thoracotomy, and postoperative dialysis were low and comparable across age groups (all p &gt; 0.20). Overall, 30-day mortality was 2.4% (24/990), with crude mortality approximately threefold higher among patients aged ≥70 years (4.6% vs. 1.6%). Conclusions: Our findings indicate that MIAVR is a feasible and safe surgical option across age groups; Elevated morbidity in elderly patients is primarily due to bleeding, pacemaker implantation, and sepsis, while rates of stroke, renal failure, and myocardial infarction are low."

Liu; Luyao An; Liangyi Qie; Lianyue Ma; Xiao Meng; Huixia Lu; Guihua Yao; Mei Dong; Guipeng An,10.3389/fmed.2025.1732507,2026-01-02,Frontiers in Medicine,"Background Severe aortic stenosis (AS) imposes sustained pressure overload on the left ventricle, leading to hypertrophy and myocardial fibrosis, which are key features of adverse cardiac remodeling. Timely transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) may reverse these processes. Transfemoral access remains the primary access method for TAVR, but the limited technique restricts early intervention in patients with narrow femoral arteries. This study aimed to evaluate the safety and feasibility of a novel balloon dilation in sheath (BinS) technique designed to facilitate transfemoral TAVR in such patients. Methods This multicenter, prospective, and first-in-human early feasibility study included patients with severe AS and challenging femoral anatomy who underwent TAVR using the BinS technique between February 2023 and August 2024. The primary endpoint was the 30-day rate of major adverse events. The secondary endpoint was the rate of major adverse events at 6 months. The clinical endpoints included major post-procedural complications. Results Fifteen patients (mean age 73.5 ± 7.3 years; 66.7% male) were treated successfully with the BinS technique via transfemoral access. There were no cases of all-cause mortality, stroke/transient ischemic attack, or severe major vascular access site complications defined by Valve Academic Research Consortium (VARC)-3 at both 30 days and 6 months. No myocardial infarction or paravalvular leakage was observed. 12 patients obtained VARC-3 technical success. Two patients experienced postprocedural arterial dissection, and two developed new-onset conduction abnormalities (left bundle branch block or permanent pacemaker implantation). At 30 days, left ventricular ejection fraction improved significantly from 50.8 ± 17.0% pre-procedure to 59.9 ± 14.6% post-procedure ( p &amp;lt; 0.001). Conclusion The BinS technique appears to be a safe and effective method for enlarging the narrow femoral lumens during TAVR. By broadening transfemoral TAVR eligibility, this approach may permit earlier hemodynamic unloading, thereby mitigating adverse cardiac remodeling and potentially improving long-term outcomes. Larger, longer-term studies are warranted to confirm these findings."
OpenAlex,aortic stenosis,Outcomes of Surgical versus Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement: A Clinical Review,"Stang, Grace",,2026-01-01,Digital Commons - Gardner-Webb University (Gardner–Webb University),"Introduction: Surgical aortic valve replacement (SAVR) has been the predominant treatment for aortic stenosis (AS) for decades. However, transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) is becoming increasingly popular. Originally, TAVRs were only performed on patients who were deemed high-risk for surgery and would have died without the valve replacement. The purpose of this paper is to determine if TAVR or SAVR has better health outcomes for all patients no matter their surgical risk. Methods: A search via PubMed database was done using the key words “aortic stenosis”, “surgical aortic valve replacement”, “transcatheter aortic valve replacement”, and “mortality.” Additional search filters were applied for randomized control trials, systematic reviews, and meta- analyses. Dates were restricted to the last 5 years, and restrictions were added for English language and free full text only. This yielded 67 results and 5 were selected. Results: Of the five reviewed articles, all were meta-analyses and one systematic review. There was a total of 52122 patients. Primary endpoints across all articles were that there is no significant difference between TAVR and SAVR in the outcomes studied. Discussion: This review of studies provided supportive evidence that both TAVR and SAVR are valid treatment options or AS. TAVR had better short-term outcomes while SAVR had better long-term outcomes."

Kim; Dhir Gala; Mohammed Ayyad; Manaal Pramanik; Amgad N. Makaryus,10.3390/jcm15010316,2026-01-01,Journal of Clinical Medicine,"Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide, with ischemic and structural heart diseases being key contributors. While the 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) is a common low-cost diagnostic test, its interpretation is limited by human variability. Through machine learning with large diverse ECG data sets and artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms, ECG analysis can be automated for pattern recognition with higher accuracy. AI-augmented ECG algorithms have been demonstrated to be able to detect myocardial infarction with high accuracy and reduce door-to-balloon coronary intervention times. Similar models can be utilized to detect subtle ECG waveforms suggestive of current or future asymptomatic left ventricular dysfunction, aortic stenosis, and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. Despite these promising results, there is concern for generalizability and bias or errors in training data. As AI systems evolve to multimodal integration, AI-augmented ECG has the potential to redefine cardiovascular diagnostics and enable earlier detection, risk stratification, and precision-guided interventions."

Emphasis is placed on the involvement of specific coronary vessels and the occurrence of multivessel disease across different types of valvular lesions. Methodology: A total of 335 patients, aged between 18 and 60 years, who had undergone coronary angiography prior to valve surgery, were retrospectively analyzed. CAD was defined as ≥50% stenosis in at least one major coronary artery. The prevalence and distribution of CAD were assessed in relation to various valvular pathologies, including aortic stenosis (AS), aortic regurgitation (AR), mitral stenosis (MS), and mitral regurgitation (MR). Results: The highest prevalence of CAD was found in patients with MR (85.7%) and AS (56.3%), with the left anterior descending (LAD) artery being the most frequently involved vessel. In contrast, isolated left circumflex (LCx) artery involvement was exclusively observed in patients with AR (100%). Three-vessel CAD (3VCAD) was most common among MR patients (85.7%). Combined LAD + LCx involvement was seen in 33.3% of cases, while MS showed a comparatively lower CAD prevalence. Left main (LM) artery involvement, although rare, was most frequently found in MS patients (16.7%). Conclusion: This study highlights a substantial burden and distinct angiographic patterns of CAD among VHD patients undergoing preoperative evaluation. Given the high prevalence, particularly among those with AS and MR, routine coronary angiography should be considered essential in pre-surgical assessment. Further large-scale studies are warranted to strengthen diagnostic and management protocols in local populations."

No significant CHD was identified prenatally. Postnatal t-Echo was performed in 41 (63%) cases, with no significant CHD detected. Two (5%) infants were diagnosed postnatally with BAV, neither requiring intervention during the study interval. Minor findings included one case each of pulmonary valve stenosis and atrial septal defect.In pregnancies with a first-degree relative with BAV and a normal obstetric ultrasound, f-Echo showed no added diagnostic value for detecting significant CHD. Based on the state's birth rate (approximately 35,000/year), BAV prevalence (1-2%), and an average family size of 3.08, an estimated 733 to 1,466 pregnancies annually in Arkansas could qualify for f-Echo under current guidelines. At a cost of $1,000 to 5,000 per study, this translates to an annual healthcare expenditure ranging from $733,000 to 7.33 million. These findings support more targeted screening and the need for multicenter studies. · No significant CHD detected with f-Echo.. · Postnatal t-Echo remains definitive.. · Routine f-Echo may add limited value.. · Cost implications warrant reconsideration."

Literature focusing on pediatric population especially in Nepal is scarce. We aimed to describe echocardiographic characteristics and complications in children newly diagnosed with RHD and to assess associations with age and sex.Methods: We conducted a retrospective review of echocardiographic records at Shahid Gangalal National Heart Center from January to December 2018 in children aged ≤15 years with RHD. Data on valve involvement, lesion severity, and complications were extracted and analyzed.Results: Among 9,482 echocardiograms, 133 new pediatric RHD cases (1.4%) were identified. Age ranged from 5–15 years (mean 11.4 ± 2.5 years); 78.9% were aged ≥10 years. Mitral valve involvement occurred in 99.2% of cases; aortic valve was involved in nearly all those with mitral lesions. Combined mitral regurgitation (MR) and aortic regurgitation (AR) was the most common pattern (60.1%), followed by isolated MR (26.3%). Isolated MR (with or without mitral stenosis) was more frequent among females, while AR (with or without MR) occurred more often in males. Severe MR was the predominant severe lesion (57.9%), mainly in older children. Complications included severe pulmonary hypertension (11.3%), pericardial effusion (6%), and infective endocarditis (5.3%).Conclusion: Newly diagnosed pediatric RHD in Nepal nearly always involves the mitral valve, with combined MR and AR being most prevalent. Severity increases with age, and lesion patterns differ by sex. These findings underscore the importance of early detection and tailored management strategies."
OpenAlex,aortic stenosis,TAVI vs SAVR in severe aortic stenosis: A systematic review,Gökhan Ceyhun,10.63909/1453034,2025-12-31,Turkish Journal of Clinical Research,"Severe aortic stenosis (AS) represents a major burden among elderly patients, with high mortality once symptoms develop. Transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) has emerged as an alternative to surgical aortic valve replacement (SAVR), expanding from inoperable to low-risk populations. This systematic review compares short- and long-term outcomes between TAVI and SAVR in patients with severe AS. Following PRISMA 2020 guidelines, PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science were searched (2010–2025). Eligible randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and comparative cohorts reporting mortality, stroke, pacemaker, or valve durability were included. Twenty-one studies (16 RCTs, 5 registries; n≈23,000) were analyzed. Thirty-day mortality was similar (RR 0.94, 95% CI 0.82–1.07). TAVI reduced bleeding (RR 0.63) and acute kidney injury (RR 0.71) but increased pacemaker implantation (RR 2.46) and paravalvular leak (RR 3.32). Five-year results (PARTNER 3, NOTION) showed comparable survival and valve durability. TAVI provides equivalent survival and superior early recovery compared to SAVR, although conduction disturbances and leak remain limitations. SAVR remains preferred for younger or bicuspid patients pending longer durability data."

While her preoperative transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) did not reveal a discrete mass, it showed a mean mitral gradient of 7 mmHg; intraoperative transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) identified a 2 cm × 1.2 cm thrombus on the bioprosthetic MV. Given these findings, the surgical team decided to replace the mitral valve concurrently with LVAD implantation. Although this approach is not routine, the goal was to improve her quality of life and reduce postoperative complications. Post-procedure TEE showed an improved MV mean gradient of 3 mmHg with no evidence of paravalvular leak. The patient was subsequently discharged home in stable condition without any thromboembolic events. This case highlights the challenges of managing complex valvular pathology in patients undergoing LVAD placement."
OpenAlex,mitral regurgitation,NF1 with Multiple Cardiac Structural Abnormalities Leading to Cerebral Infarction,J. Ye; Yiyi Jiang; Hanmin Wang; Dan Wang,10.3390/diagnostics16010163,2026-01-04,Diagnostics,"Background/Objectives: Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is an autosomal dominant disorder driven by mutations in the NF1 gene, whose pathogenesis centers on the loss of neurofibromin function and subsequent hyperactivation of the RAS/MAPK pathway. Notably, to the best of our knowledge and following a systematic literature search conducted by our research team, no cases of NF1 complicated by severe cardiac structural abnormalities that ultimately lead to cerebral infarction have been reported to date. Thus, it is of paramount importance to avoid missed diagnosis by performing comprehensive cardiac-related examinations in patients with NF1. Case Presentation: A 20-year-old male patient diagnosed with NF1 presented with right-sided limb weakness and was initially identified with cerebral infarction. To clarify the underlying etiology, a comprehensive clinical evaluation was performed, including cardiac imaging assessments (to characterize cardiac structural changes) and whole-exome sequencing (to identify the presence of procoagulant gene mutations). Comprehensive evaluation revealed a spectrum of cardiac structural abnormalities in the patient: aortic valve prolapse with severe regurgitation, non-infective vegetations on the aortic valve leaflets, mild-to-moderate mitral regurgitation, left ventricular hypertrophy and dilation, and left atrial dilation. Whole-exome sequencing detected exclusively a pathogenic variant in the NF1 gene, with no other pathogenic/likely pathogenic variants or thrombophilia-associated polymorphisms being found. Laboratory investigations ruled out infectious etiologies, supporting the notion that NF1-mediated cardiac structural and developmental anomalies are the primary driver of cardiac vegetation formation, given the absence of other identified contributing factors; embolization of one such vegetation ultimately led to both splenic and cerebral infarction. Conclusions: This case emphasizes the necessity of implementing early and proactive cardiac evaluations in patients with NF1. Additionally, for NF1 individuals—particularly those presenting with suggestive vascular or cardiac symptoms—a comprehensive multifactorial assessment of thrombotic risk is critical. Collectively, maintaining clinical vigilance for cardiac abnormalities in NF1 patients and avoiding diagnostic oversight is essential to reduce life-threatening risks."

This leads to myocardial ischemia via a coronary steal phenomenon. While typically fatal in infancy, a small proportion of patients survive into adulthood due to the development of extensive collateral circulation from the right coronary artery (RCA). Prompt surgical correction is essential to prevent fatal outcomes. Case Presentation: We report the case of a 36-year-old male who presented with a one-year history of exertional angina (CCS Class II) and dyspnea (NYHA Class III). Investigations revealed ALCAPA with a dilated, super-dominant RCA, and associated partial anomalous pulmonary venous return (PAPVR) and moderate mitral regurgitation. Surgical correction was performed using the Takeuchi procedure with simultaneous mitral valve repair and PAPVR correction. The patient had an uneventful recovery. Results: The patient demonstrated marked postoperative improvement and was discharged in stable condition on postoperative day four. At two-year follow-up, cardiac CT confirmed a patent intrapulmonary baffle with no ischemic changes or mitral regurgitation. The patient remained asymptomatic and resumed normal daily activities, indicating excellent long-term functional recovery. Conclusion: This case highlights the importance of early recognition and individualized surgical planning in adult ALCAPA, particularly when associated with structural defects such as mitral regurgitation and PAPVR. The Takeuchi procedure, when appropriately applied, offers sustainable long-term outcomes and should be considered a viable option in anatomically challenging adult presentations."

Thrombocytosis may increase thromboembolic risk, and severe functional mitral regurgitation (MR) from left-ventricular dilation further worsens clinical status. A 38-year-old woman, three months postpartum, presented with worsening dyspnea, orthopnea, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, and leg edema. She had hypertension and dyslipidemia. Examination revealed fluid overload and elevated jugular venous pressure. ECG showed sinus tachycardia with ST-T changes, and chest X-ray demonstrated cardiomegaly with pulmonary congestion. Laboratory testing identified thrombocytosis (platelets 627,000/µL). Echocardiography revealed severe LV dilation (LVEDD 63 mm), markedly reduced ejection fraction (21%), grade 3 diastolic dysfunction, severe functional MR, and spontaneous echo contrast. This case illustrates the interaction of PPCM, reactive thrombocytosis, and severe MR, emphasizing the need for thorough cardiac–hematologic evaluation and multidisciplinary management to optimize outcomes."

From late 2022 onwards the Infection Unit in Ninewells Hospital, Dundee, has adopted the use of oral antibiotic therapy in the treatment of selected patients with infective endocarditis. Objectives We aimed to review the clinical efficacy and outcomes in patients treated with oral antimicrobial therapy for infective endocarditis in our unit. Methods We retrospectively reviewed patients treated with oral antimicrobial therapy for infective endocarditis. Patient records were reviewed for basic demographics, endocarditis characteristics and treatment (both IV and oral). Adverse outcomes (defined as all-cause mortality, unplanned cardiac surgery, recurrence of bacteraemia or embolic events) were assessed for within 6 months of completion of therapy. Results In total 29 patients were identified, of which 21 (72%) were male. Mean age was 67 (range 36-94). Of the patients included, 20 were classed as ‘definite’ endocarditis by Duke-ISCVID 2023 criteria, with the remaining 9 meeting ‘possible’ Duke-ISCVID 2023 criteria. Structures involved included aortic valve (15 patients), mitral valve (11 patients), ICED (2 patients) and tricuspid valve (1 patient), with 9 of the 27 valve infections occurring in prosthetic valves. In total, 15 of 29 (52%) patients had moderate to severe valvular regurgitation, 5 (17%) patients had a vegetation of 10mm or greater and 4 patients underwent surgery during the course of their illness. With regards to microbiology, our cohort included 14 patients with Streptococcus spp., 12 patients with Staphylococcus aureus (all MSSA), 2 patients with Enterococcus faecalis and one patient with coagulase-negative Staphylococcus spp. Mean peak C-reactive protein was 163 mg/L (range 17–400) with mean C-reactive protein at transition to oral therapy of 21 mg/L (range 3–98). In total, 22 patients (76%) met the criteria used in the POET trial. Mean duration of IV therapy was 15 days (range 6–30). Mean duration of oral therapy was 26 days (range 14–42). Mean total duration of therapy was 41 days (range 28-56). The final oral antibiotic regimens used included linezolid in 19 patients (65%), amoxicillin in 5 patients (17%), co-trimoxazole in 3 patients (10%) and amoxicillin with rifampicin in 2 patients (7%). Change of oral agent due to adverse drug effects was required in 6 patients, all occurring in patients prescribed linezolid. Adverse outcomes occurred in three patients (embolic events in two patients and one death 4 months after treatment completion due to cardiac failure), with 5 patients yet to complete the full 6 month follow-up period. Conclusions Oral antimicrobial therapy can be used in appropriate patients with infective endocarditis, with good efficacy and relatively low rates of adverse effects despite significant complexity of illness. Alteration of oral regimen was frequently required when linezolid was used."

Methodology: A descriptive, observational study was conducted at the Pediatric Cardiology Department of Faisalabad Institute of Cardiology (FIC), Pakistan, from February to July 2023. Patients aged ≥10 years with unoperated VSD were enrolled, and the diagnosis was confirmed via transthoracic echocardiography. The clinical presentation, type of VSD, associated cardiac conditions, and complications were analyzed. Results: A total of 128 patients were included, with 60.9% aged 10–18 years and 39.1% aged over 18 years. Males accounted for 55.5% of the cohort. Most patients (89.1%) presented at the outpatient department. Perimembranous VSD was the most common type (58.6%), followed by sub-arterial (23.4%), inlet (7.8%), and muscular (7.8%) defects. Pulmonary hypertension (21.9%), aortic valve prolapse (12.5%), and mitral regurgitation (10.2%) were the most frequent associations. Eisenmenger syndrome (31.3%) was the most common complication. Older patients were significantly more likely to have pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) (p = 0.0006) and Eisenmenger syndrome (p = 0.0002). A significant association was found between VSD type and aortic valve prolapse (p &lt; 0.0001). A p-value &lt; 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Conclusion: Perimembranous VSD is the most prevalent defect in adolescents and adults. Many patients experience worsening functional status, with Eisenmenger syndrome emerging as a major complication. Early screening and timely intervention are crucial in preventing disease progression. Serial echocardiography should be incorporated into follow-up care for all unrepaired VSD patients. Establishing specialized adult congenital heart disease (ACHD) clinics in tertiary hospitals is essential for long-term management and improving patient outcomes."

Examination revealed a holosystolic murmur and right costovertebral angle tenderness. Investigations showed raised inflammatory markers and a positive rheumatoid factor, while repeated blood cultures were negative. Echocardiography showed severe mitral regurgitation without visiblevegetations, and computed tomography angiography confirmed right renal infarction. Using modified Duke criteria, the diagnosis was made and empiric intravenous vancomycin and ceftriaxone were started. Despite intensive care and aggressive therapy, she deteriorated and died from refractory heart failure due to severe valvular dysfunction.

These patients are refractory to routine treatment, but the timely diagnosis of the underlying etiology and correction of calcium promptly restores myocardial function. The Case A 55-year-old non-alcoholic and non-smoker female, previously diagnosed as a case of dilated cardiomyopathy, presented with complaints of progressive dyspnoea on exertion from NYHA-II to NYHA-IV over a span of 1 week. At admission the patient was conscious, afebrile; having respiratory distress, peripheral oxygen saturation of 93% at room air, blood pressure of 92/56 mmHg equal in both arms, regular pulse rate of 100 beats per minute, audible left ventricular S3, mild peripheral edema, and bilateral basal crepitations. She was diagnosed to have decompensated heart failure. Chest X-Ray revealed cardiomegaly. Electrocardiogram showed sinus tachycardia (90 beats/minute), QRS axis of -20o, prolonged QTc of 574 milliseconds. Laboratory analysis at admission revealed minimally deranged liver and renal functions, and highly elevated BNP. Relevant biochemical parameters are shown in the given table. Transthoracic echocardiogram revealed dilated left chambers (left ventricle end-diastolic diameter: 61 mm, left ventricle end-systolic diameter: 52 mm), left ventricle (LV) severe global systolic dysfunction (LVEF=22%) due to diffuse hypokinesia, restrictive type of diastolic dysfunction with elevated filling pressure indexes (E/E’=19), mild functional mitral regurgitation, mild tricuspid regurgitation, moderate pulmonary hypertension (systolic pulmonary artery pressure of 50 mmHg). Normal coronary angiography ruled out underlying ischemia. Patient was initially started on furosemide as decongestive therapy. Subsequent investigations conducted due to prolonged QTc revealed severe hypocalcaemia (corrected calcium of 4.38 mg/dL), inappropriately normal PTH, and presence of basal ganglia calcification on CT head was highly suggestive of primary hypoparathyroidism. Parenteral treatment with Gluconic Calcium was started: 950 mg of calcium (1 ampoule) at 6 hours, followed by oral treatment- high dose of calcium (1g TDS) and alfacalcidol (0.25µg TDS) along with management of heart failure. The patient had progressive clinical improvement and was discharged in NYHA class II on Day 10. Patient’s serum calcium progressively improved during course of stay and was within normal limits at the time of discharge. Treatment at discharge included loop diuretic, ACE inhibitor, Calcium, alfacalcidol. Patient was followed up regularly; and NYHA class, renal functions, serum calcium level, and ECG were assessed. At follow up after 3 months, patients had significant improvement in LV function and normalised LV function after 6 months. Conclusion: Considering the rarity of hypocalcemia induced dilated cardiomyopathy in adults, this etiology must be suspected in a cardiac patient with ECG changes suggestive of hypocalcaemia (as in our case). Early calcium supplementation, usually along with vitamin D, reduces and even reverses ventricular hypertrophy and dilatation as well as conduction abnormalities, as it was in our case."

Ravi Kumar; Lachham Kataria; Ali Ammar; Jawaid Akbar Sial; Rizwan Aziz Memon,10.47144/phj.v58is3.2806,2025-12-30,Pakistan Heart Journal,"Objectives: This study aimed to evaluate early postoperative changes in right ventricular (RV) functional parameters and to determine their association with operative characteristics in patients undergoing mitral valve replacement (MVR) for rheumatic mitral valve disease. Methods: A prospective observational study was conducted among 50 patients undergoing MVR at a tertiary cardiac center. Preoperative and early postoperative (within 48 hours) echocardiographic parameters—including tricuspid annular plane systolic excursion (TAPSE), fractional area change (FAC), pulmonary artery systolic pressure (PASP), ejection fraction (EF), and tricuspid regurgitation (TR)—were compared. RV dysfunction (RVD) was defined as FAC &lt; 35%. Changes in RV function were correlated with operative variables, and predictors of postoperative RVD were identified using multivariable logistic regression. Results: The mean age of the cohort was 38.7 ± 12 years, with 60% female participants. Preoperatively, 36% (18/50) had RVD, of which 33.3% improved after surgery, while 66.7% exhibited persistent dysfunction. New-onset RVD occurred in 20% of patients. Significant postoperative reductions were observed in TAPSE (p = 0.013) and EF (p = 0.020), whereas PASP showed significant improvement (p = 0.005). No significant correlations were found between operative times and delta FAC. Preoperative RVD emerged as the only independent predictor of postoperative RVD (adjusted OR 4.06, 95% CI 1.16–14.21; p = 0.028). Conclusions: Early postoperative RV dysfunction is common following MVR, particularly among patients with pre-existing impairment. Operative times did not significantly influence postoperative RV performance, suggesting a multifactorial trajectory of RV recovery. Early identification and closer follow-up of high-risk patients may help improve postoperative outcomes."

The etiology of this lesion is unknown, and diagnosis of mild cases may be difficult at an early age. Although, the severity of regurgitation and valve thickening tend to show a progressive course over time. This case report presents the clinical presentation and a critical surgical challenge treatment of a 26-year-old female patient diagnosed with mitral cleft in conjunction with a partial atrioventricular canal defect, representing an advanced example of this rare association."

Methodology: A prospective interventional before–after design was conducted at the pediatric cardiology department of a major tertiary cardiac center in Pakistan from March 2024 to September 2025. Forty-eight patients under 18 years with severe RMS (mitral valve area ≤1.0 cm²) were enrolled through consecutive sampling. All underwent PBMV using the Inoue balloon technique. Echocardiographic parameters—including mitral valve area (MVA), transmitral gradient, pulmonary artery pressure (PAP), and mitral regurgitation (MR)—were assessed before and immediately after the procedure. Statistical analysis was performed using paired tests, with p&lt;0.05 considered significant. Results: The median age was 15 years (IQR 14–16), and 56.3% were male. PBMV resulted in a significant increase in MVA from 0.7 cm² to 1.6 cm² (p&lt;0.001) and a substantial reduction in transmitral gradient (23 to 7.5 mmHg, p&lt;0.001) and PAP (52 to 35 mmHg, p&lt;0.001). Mild MR developed in 35.4% and moderate MR in 8.3% of patients, with no cases of severe MR. Procedural success was achieved in 83.3% of the cohort. No mortality, cardiac tamponade, or major complications occurred. Mean hospital stay was 2.2±0.5 days. Conclusion: PBMV using the Inoue balloon is a safe, effective, and practical therapeutic option for relieving severe RMS in children and adolescents. The technique provides rapid hemodynamic improvement, low complication rates, and short hospitalization, making it particularly valuable in low-resource regions where rheumatic heart disease remains highly prevalent."
