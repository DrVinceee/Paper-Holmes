In addition, Microvascular Resistance Reserve (MRR) is a new index that further permits the characterization of coronary microcirculatory function. It can be calculated from resting and hyperemic absolute coronary flow and resistance, measured during continuous thermodilution. By being independent of both epicardial disease and myocardial mass, MRR is highly specific for the microvascular compartment. Measurement of absolute flow, resistance, and MRR by continuous thermodilution has been shown to be accurate and reproducible, with minimal operator interference. In conjunction with the measurement of absolute flow and resistance, MRR could become the index of reference for the diagnosis of coronary microvascular disease and the evaluation of new therapies. In this paper, the basis and practicalities of these measurements are shortly reviewed and its characteristics, its advantages over existing indices, its limitations, and future perspectives are discussed.

The association of AS-related cerebral impairment with cardiac remodeling and its prognostic impact remains unclear, prompting exploration of integrated cardio-cerebral assessment preliminarily.
Patients with moderate-to-severe aortic stenosis (AS) undergoing surgery at The First Affiliated Hospital of Guangxi Medical University (June 2021-December 2024) were enrolled (n = 384). Patients were stratified into a cerebral hypoperfusion/embolism group (n = 146) and an event-free group (n = 238) based on the presence or absence of preoperative cerebral impairment due to severe AS-related hemodynamic compromise or embolic events. Preoperative clinical/echocardiographic and surgical data were collected. The composite primary endpoint was major adverse cardiac events (MACE) (malignant arrhythmia, heart failure rehospitalization, or all-cause death). Multivariate regression identified predictors of AS-related cerebral impairment and MACE risk factors. The C-index assessed the cardio-cerebral integrated model's prognostic value.
The cerebral hypoperfusion/embolism group showed more pronounced left atrial (LA) and left ventricular (LV) remodeling. Multivariate logistic regression linked enlarged ascending aorta, left heart remodeling (increased LA size, elevated E/e' ratio, decreased LV global longitudinal strain and LA reservoir strain), reduced cardiac output (CO), and pulmonary artery systolic pressure to AS-related cerebral impairment (all p < 0.05). Over an 18-month median follow-up, 79 MACE occurred. Adjusted multivariate Cox analysis confirmed AS-related cerebral impairment as an independent MACE predictor (hazard ratio, 2.24 [95% CI: 2.13, 3.44]; p < 0.001). The cardio-cerebral integrated model (clinical + echo + ischemia) demonstrated superior MACE prediction (C-index, 0.862; likelihood ratio, 62.12) vs. clinical-only (C-index, 0.631; likelihood ratio, 19.32; both p < 0.001) or clinical + echo models (C-index, 0.757; likelihood ratio, 46.34; both p < 0.001).
AS-related cerebral impairment independently correlates with cardiac remodeling and adverse outcomes. Integrated cardio-cerebral assessment enhances risk stratification."

The difference between the ABI on both sides (∆ABI) was defined as the absolute value of the left ABI minus the right ABI. Lower BAI (L-BAI) was defined as the value of the side with the lowest BAI. We obtained four-limb blood pressure measurement data from 6435 patients. AS and bilateral lower-extremity arterial stenosis (BLEAS) were diagnosed. The performance of combined bilateral ABI decline, ΔABI, and L-BAI in diagnosing AS was evaluated. The control group showed normal bilateral ABI values, whereas the AS and BLEAS groups exhibited a bilateral ABI decline. The BLEAS group had the highest ∆ABI compared to the other groups. L-BAI in the BLEAS and AS groups was higher than that in the control group. AS screening using bilateral ABI ≤0.90 combined with ΔABI ≤0.10 and L-BAI >1.00 yielded an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.873 and a Youden index, sensitivity, and specificity of 0.724, 85.2%, and 87.2%, respectively. Validation in 1004 patients revealed a sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value, and accuracy of 90.0%, 96.0%, 54.2%, 99.5%, and 95.7%, respectively. In conclusion, combining bilateral ABI ≤0.90, ∆ABI ≤0.10, and L-BAI >1.00 can effectively screen for AS; this is useful in distinguishing AS from BLEAS, especially in cases of bilateral decline in lower-extremity ABI values."

While surgical aortic valve replacement (SAVR) remains the standard of care in low surgical-risk patients, transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) is increasingly used as a treatment alternative with favorable outcomes in well-selected BAV patients. To date, randomized controlled trials comparing TAVI and SAVR have excluded patients with BAV, except the UK TAVI and the more recent The NOrdic Aortic Valve IntervenTION-2 trial. Of note, in The NOrdic Aortic Valve IntervenTION-2 trial, there was a numerical imbalance in the BAV subgroup, with more events observed in the TAVI group than in the SAVR group for the composite outcome (all-cause mortality, stroke, and rehospitalization) at 1- and 3-year follow-up, although the risk estimates were imprecise due to the limited number of events. The upcoming TraNscatheter Aortic Valve Implantation versus surGical AorTic valvE replacement in patients with Bicuspid aortic valve stenosis (NAVIGATE Bicuspid) and Bicuspid aortic valve replacement: EvaLuatIon of transcathetEr VERsus Surgery (BELIEVERS) trials will directly compare TAVI and SAVR in BAV populations. These trials are designed to provide robust, adequately powered estimates of the comparative safety and effectiveness of both interventions over extended follow-up and are expected to inform future guideline recommendations in the setting of BAV anatomy. This review summarizes current data on the use of TAVI in patients with severe BAV stenosis, evaluates anatomical and procedural complexities, and outlines the design and rationale of upcoming randomized controlled trials addressing this critical knowledge gap."

Diseases that were previously considered only with surgical treatment options are now treated percutaneously with high success rates. However, devices used in this fields are referred to being used in an off-labeled fashion, as they were not originally developed for this purpose. This is the result of many factors among which the broad spectrum morphological and clinical expression of CHD.
The aim of this paper is to describe the prevalence, types of procedures and outcomes of the off-label use of implantable devices and stents in the CHD patient's interventional procedure in our center.
A retrospective data involving all patients who were referred to congenital and structural heart disease unit in our institution for catheter based interventional procedures in the last 4 years based on our medical records. Patients' demographic data, diagnosis, procedural data, type of devices used, follow-up data and incidence of major and minor complications were recorded to calculate the success and incidence of complications in this cohort of patient.
A total number of 410 patients underwent a percutaneous interventional procedure with the use of an off-label device or stent, out of a total of 2530 interventional procedure during the last 4 years, accounting for approximately 21.5% of all device and stents implanted during this period. The mean age of patients was 6.70 ± 4.47 years, the mean body weight was 18 0.3 +/- 8.5 kg. The procedures were versatile and included Ventricular septal defect (VSD) closure, Persistent ductus arteriosus (PDA) closure, aorto-pulmonary (AP) collaterals embolization, coronary arteriovenous (AV) fistula closure, veno-venous collaterals closure, pulmonary AV malformation closure, PDA stenting, and right ventricular outflow tract (RVOT) stenting. Implantable devices were used in 360 patients (87.8%) while Stents were implanted off-label in 50 patients (12.2%). Device-related complications were reported in 13 patients: seven major complications (device embolization in 3 cases, stent malposition in 2 and stent embolization in another 2 patients) and 6 minor complications ( mild left pulmonary artery stenosis, mild tricuspid and aortic valve regurgitation, residual VSD with hemolysis, incomplete arteriovenous malformations closure, late onset of arrhythmias and late device related thrombus formation). There were four deaths (0,97%). Overall success rate in this patient's cohort was 96.9% all over a period of 12 months follow up for the patients.
Considerable percentage of patients with CHD undergoing transcatheter interventional percutaneous procedures with off-label implantation of devices or stents. These procedures have high success rate and relatively low incidence of complications. So Longer term follow-up is needed in order to establish safety and effectiveness of these off-label procedures in congenital heart defects."

The Sorin Soprano aortic bioprosthetic valve (Sorin Group/LivaNova, Milan, Italy) lacks reported long-term results. This study aims to establish the long-term durability of this bioprosthetic valve in a nationwide cohort.
All patients having received the Soprano bioprosthesis during aortic valve replacement in Sweden between 2005 and 2013 were included in the study. Patient characteristics, outcomes, and echocardiographic data were collected using national registries and electronic medical records. Standardized guidelines were used to assess echocardiographic data for the presence of severe structural valve deterioration.
A total of 1054 patients (mean age 73.3 years) were included, with 14.0% being ≤65 years at surgery. The Soprano bioprosthesis represented 9.5% of all implanted bioprostheses. During a mean follow-up of 8.6 ± 4.5 years, 206 patients (19.5%) developed severe structural valve deterioration. The cumulative incidence of severe structural valve deterioration at 1-, 5-, 7-, 10-, and 15 years was 0.5%, 3.1%, 7.4%, 13.7%, and 22.1% in the overall population. The cumulative incidence of structural valve deterioration-related reinterventions at 1-, 5-, 7-, 10-, and 15 years was 0%, 0.9%, 3.0%, 7.2%, and 11.5%. The 30-day mortality rate was 3.8%.
The Soprano bioprosthesis demonstrates high long-term rates of severe structural valve deterioration and deterioration-related reinterventions. These findings suggest the need for increased clinical vigilance and for more frequent echocardiographic monitoring in patients having received this bioprosthetic valve."

Echocardiography at the initial visit incidentally revealed mitral annular calcification (MAC) involving the posterior mitral leaflet and mobile mass attached to this MAC. The high intensity echogenic mobile mass extended from the sub-valvular tissue to the papillary tendon. The differential diagnosis of this mass included a caseous calcification of the mitral annulus (CCMA), and intra-cardiac thrombus or tumor. Computed tomography imaging features were consistent with CCMA. Anticoagulation was administered for one month to rule out thrombus and to prevent systemic thromboembolism. The size of this mobile mass did not change but the severity of mitral regurgitation worsened from mild to moderate during the month. Surgical treatment was performed to prevent thromboembolism and treat mitral regurgitation. A biological mitral valve and tricuspid annular ring were implanted. The histopathologic examination of the excised mobile mass revealed fibrinous material with calcification. We report a case of CCMA that appeared in a short period of time, and the attached mobile mass was suggested to be the contents of CCMA.

Transthoracic echocardiography revealed generalised left ventricular hypertrophy with maximal thickness in the infero-lateral wall with mid-cavity obstruction. The symptoms necessitated bisoprolol and disopyramide treatment. As there was an increased risk of sudden cardiac death due to left ventricular wall thickness of more than 30 mm and presence of excessive scarring on magnetic resonance imaging, an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator was placed. Failure of medical therapy led to a myectomy referral. Genetic testing identified a rare Titin gene mutation linked to her cardiomyopathy."

Previous studies in a mouse model of BTHS, secondary to knockdown of Tafazzin (TazKD mice), also observed perturbations in mitochondrial substrate metabolism and a hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. BTHS may be characterized by increased cardiac ketone metabolism, as myocardial protein expression of the ketolytic enzyme, β-hydroxybutyrate dehydrogenase 1 (BDH1), was markedly increased in TazKD mice. We therefore determined whether increasing ketone supply in TazKD mice may have therapeutic utility against their cardiac abnormalities.
We treated TazKD mice and their wild-type littermates with either the sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitor, empagliflozin (10 mg/kg), or a ketone ester (KE; 1719 mg/kg) once daily for 7-week, and performed ultrasound echocardiography to assess cardiac structure and function.
Treatment of TazKD mice with either empagliflozin or a KE increased circulating ketone levels. However, neither approach proved capable of alleviating the cardiac hypertrophy present in TazKD mice, as their increased left ventricular wall thickness and decreased left ventricular diameter remained comparable to that observed in vehicle control treated animals. We also observed that empagliflozin and KE treatment did not impact key markers of cardiac hypertrophy in TazKD mice.
Increasing circulating ketone levels did not alleviate the cardiac hypertrophy in TazKD mice, suggesting that such an approach would not improve outcomes in BTHS."

3PASSPORT(ACTRN12622000447752) will be a prospective, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial investigating if nutritional supplementation with 10 mg of vitamin K1 can reduce the rate of valvular calcification and haemodynamic progression in CAS. Patients identified to have mild or moderate CAS based on standard echocardiographic criteria will be randomized 1:1 to vitamin K1 10 mg per day or matched placebo, and followed-up for a mean period of 16 months, ranging from 12 to 21 months. The primary endpoint will be the difference in aortic valve calcification volume, measured by computed tomography aortic valve calcium score, from baseline to follow-up, and secondary endpoints will include the change in echocardiographic progression of CAS, including peak flow velocity, mean pressure gradient, and aortic valve area. The trial is registered with the Australian New Zealand. Clinical Trials Registry (ACTRN12622000447752). The trial has met its recruitment target of 108 participants.

Since its inception in 2002, TAVR has significantly transformed the management of aortic stenosis. The treatment for TAVR procedural and device failures varies depending on the specific cause of failure. As the number of TAVR procedures increases, particularly in individuals aged 70 or younger, it is likely that we will see a rise in the number of patients needing further treatment due to degeneration of the transcatheter heart valve. Although TAVR has proved to be safe and effective, structural valve deterioration is inevitable. Even though TAVR has shown promising data of low structural valve deterioration rates up to 6 years from various clinical trials and up to 10 years in isolated series, the majority of these patients were older. But, reintervention after TAVR seems unavoidable. It may need reintervention with a second TAVR valve, or it may require surgical TAVR-explant and subsequent surgical aortic valve replacement. Also, a third option in the form of a hybrid technique, is available now. Thus, the selection of patients is crucial in choosing the appropriate initial management as it can have long-term repercussions."

This study evaluates long-term outcomes of functional TR in TAVR patients.
All patients undergoing TAVR at a single institution from 2011-2022 with complete pre- and post-TAVR echocardiogram follow-up were stratified by pre-procedure TR grade (none, mild, moderate, or severe). Primary outcomes were TR improvement or persistence/progression, and long-term survival. Time-to-event analysis and Cox proportional hazards models were used to compare long-term mortality. Median time to most recent post-TAVR echocardiogram was 12 months, and median clinical follow-up was 24 months.
Of 1,668 TAVR patients in the study cohort, 55% (925) had TR of any severity. TR persisted in 70% of these patients though few ever underwent later TR intervention. Moderate-severe TR was found in 20% (331) patients and persisted or worsened in 47% of cases. Moderate-severe TR was associated with worse unadjusted median survival when compared to patients with no-mild TR (median survival 39 vs. 62 months, p<0.001). Adjusting for age, sex, surgical risk, and other non-cardiac and cardiac comorbidities including mitral regurgitation, moderate-to-severe TR was an independent predictor of worse survival (HR 1.39, p=0.004, Figure 1).
Degree of tricuspid regurgitation is unlikely to improve following TAVR. Moderate-severe TR was a predictor of worse long-term survival. The presence of concurrent moderate or severe TR should be considered when deciding between transcatheter and surgical approaches."

The CAPRI score previously showed promising results in predicting 1-year all-cause mortality, by combining manually measured thoracic aortic calcium (TAC) volume with clinical risk factors. This study introduces an enhanced CAPRI score (eCAPRI), which automates TAC volume measurement and incorporates additional automatically extracted biomarkers from pre-operative CT scans.
TAC volume extraction was automated using a deep learning model trained on 66 patients and evaluated on 1111 CT scans. Additional automatically extracted imaging biomarkers were incorporated into the eCAPRI score, following the original methodology for biomarker selection. The eCAPRI score was trained on 765 pre-TAVI CT scans for one-year mortality prediction and then compared to CAPRI and EuroSCORE Logistic using AUC, bootstrap tests, and calibration curves on 192 CT scans.
Automated TAC segmentation achieved a mean Dice score of 0.777 ± 0.108. The eCAPRI score included body surface area (BSA)-indexed right ventricle volume, BSA-indexed pulmonary arteries max diameter, and abdominal muscles surface at L3 level in addition to automatically computed TAC volume and clinical biomarkers previously identified in the CAPRI score. On the evaluation dataset, eCAPRI showed an AUC of 0.731, outperforming CAPRI (AUC = 0.669) and EuroSCORE Logistic (AUC = 0.588) significantly (p = 0.034), with better calibration.
The eCAPRI score, combining fully automated TAC volume extraction and additional imaging biomarkers, improved one-year mortality prediction over CAPRI and EuroSCORE Logistic. It may support standardized risk stratification in TAVI patients.
Question Can an eCAPRI using imaging biomarkers from pre-operative CT scans improve the prediction of one-year mortality in patients undergoing transcatheter aortic valve replacement? Findings The eCAPRI score, integrating automated TAC volume and additional biomarkers, outperformed CAPRI and EuroSCORE Logistic in predicting one-year mortality (AUC = 0.731, p = 0.034). Clinical relevance The eCAPRI score provides a standardized approach to mortality risk assessment in transcatheter valve procedures. By improving prediction accuracy, it supports more informed clinical decisions and personalized care planning, ultimately contributing to better outcomes for patients undergoing TAVI."

With a focus on the prevalent psychological complications following the onset of this condition, this study aimed to explore the correlation between antenatal depression and Corona disease anxiety, personality traits, and postpartum depression during the COVID-19 pandemic.                                                           Materials and Methods:                     This cross-sectional descriptive-analytical study investigated women receiving care at health centers affiliated with Kerman University of Medical Sciences during the last month of their pregnancy and the postpartum period in 2022. Following the acquisition of informed consent, participants were assessed using various measures, including demographic and obstetric information, the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale, the Corona Disease Anxiety Scale (CDAS), and the NEO Personality Inventory-Revised during their third trimester of pregnancy. The same group of participants completed the Edinburgh Depression Scale and the Corona Disease Anxiety Scale (CDAS) 4-6 weeks after childbirth.                                                           Results and Discussion:                     There was a significant correlation between family income, unwanted pregnancy as perceived by both the mother and father, and antenatal depression. Additionally, marital satisfaction played a significant role in postpartum depression. Furthermore, antenatal depression was significantly associated with neuroticism, agreeableness, and physical symptoms related to Corona disease anxiety. Personality traits, with the exception of extroversion and conscientiousness, and various domains of Corona disease anxiety, excluding psychological symptoms, were also significantly associated with postpartum depression.                                                           Conclusion:                     During pandemics or epidemics, such as the COVID-19 outbreak, experiencing mental distress during pregnancy can contribute to mental health issues during the postpartum period. This risk is particularly true in individuals with unique personality traits, emphasizing the need for increased focus on mental health within prenatal care during these crises."

Method:                     This cross-sectional study was conducted in Kerman, Iran. Data were collected from patients who visited Afzalipour Hospital in Kerman more than twice during the COVID-19 epidemic from the end of February 2020 to March 21, 2021. We conducted two key analyses: 1. Mixed effect logistic regression was used to check the relationship between the variables and COVID-19 severity. 2. Mixed effect linear regression was used to check the relationship between the variables and the length of stay in the hospital.                                                           Results:                     The findings indicated that the most important risk factors for the severity of COVID-19 were heart diseases (OR=1.67,95%CI:1.20-2.30), increasing age (OR=2.23 for age&gt;54, 95%CI:1.70- 2.90), male gender (OR=1.47,95%CI:1.10-1.96), respiratory diseases other than asthma, and frequency of admission (OR=1.60,95%CI:1.20-2.15). All patients who underwent readmission experienced a shorter duration of hospitalization during their subsequent admission (OR=0.94,95%CI:0.91,0.96) and had a higher mortality rate (30% within 14 days, 26.6% between 14-90 days). Patients readmitted at intervals of 14-90 days and greater than 90 days exhibited lower disease severity compared to those readmitted within the 0-14 day period.                                                           Conclusion:                     Examining readmissions, the severity of COVID-19, and the length of hospital stay in affected patients are important factors for planning and allocating resources for COVID-19 management and treatment. These factors can help policymakers develop effective clinical guidelines for hospitalization or outpatient treatment of COVID-19 patients and contribute to reducing the burden of disease in the community."

Kinovea, as an accessible motion-analysis software, provides both visual and quantitative feedback. However, its application in supporting technique development among beginner athletes remains insufficiently explored. Aim: This study aims to describe the use of Kinovea in biomechanics training and examine its contribution to the awareness of kinematic characteristics and movement techniques among beginner athletes. Methods: A descriptive qualitative design involved 72 beginner athletes aged 18–25 years selected through purposive sampling. Data were collected over 16 weeks through interviews, field observations, and motion video recordings analyzed using Kinovea. Kinematic data focused on joint angles, stride behavior, and movement phases during walking, running, and the flight phase. Qualitative data were analyzed using content analysis with NVivo 12, while kinematic results were interpreted descriptively to identify performance patterns and areas for technical refinement. Result: Kinematic analysis showed coordinated joint-angle patterns across all phases. Walking analysis identified arm swing angles of 50.9°–58.8° and leg separation angles of 64.3°–67.2°, indicating a stable gait rhythm. The running analysis revealed knee angles of 68.8°–69.8° and elbow angles of 87.6°–89.1°, indicating efficient propulsive mechanics. The flight phase demonstrated knee angles of 81.2°–87.8° and elbow angles of 80.4°–88.3°, suggesting effective momentum use and postural stability. These measurements supported stride-efficiency assessment and technique evaluation. Qualitative findings revealed that Kinovea enabled athletes to interpret movement phases and identify technical inefficiencies through slow-motion and frame-by-frame visualization. Conclusion: Kinovea supports basic motion analysis by providing clear kinematic information and helping beginner athletes observe and refine their movement techniques. The findings also offer practical value for coaches by enabling more precise identification of inefficient patterns and guiding targeted corrections during early-stage training."

Case Series and Literature Review,Giovanni Balestrucci; Vitaliano Buffa; Maria Teresa Del Canto; Maria Chiara Brunese; Salvatore Cappabianca; Alfonso Reginelli,10.3390/hearts7010002,2025-12-22,Hearts,"Mitral annular disjunction (MAD) is a structural abnormality of the mitral valve increasingly detected with advanced cardiac imaging, particularly cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR). However, the clinical impact of different degrees of disjunction and the lack of standardized measurement criteria remain controversial. This study aimed to describe a series of patients with MAD assessed by CMR and to discuss, in the context of current literature, potential cut-off values that may distinguish physiological from pathological MAD. We retrospectively identified all CMR examinations performed at our institution over a 6-month period in which MAD was visible in at least two cine steady-state free precession (SSFP) projections. For each patient, we recorded MAD extent, presence of mitral valve prolapse/regurgitation, late gadolinium enhancement (LGE) pattern, and main clinical presentation. Nine patients (mean age 57 years; 5 men) were included. Larger MAD distances (&gt;4 mm) were frequently associated with non-ischemic LGE in the basal lateral wall and with valvular abnormalities, whereas smaller disjunctions (≤3 mm) were often observed in patients without significant structural disease. Non-ischemic LGE was present in 6/9 patients, all with MAD &gt; 5 mm. These observations, together with published data, support the hypothesis that small degrees of MAD may represent a frequent anatomical variant, while more extensive disjunction, especially when associated with fibrosis, may indicate a pathological substrate for arrhythmias. Standardized CMR-based criteria and validated MAD cut-off values are needed to improve risk stratification and to incorporate MAD assessment into routine clinical practice."

This retrospective study included 67 individuals who underwent isolated, elective mitral valve repair with neochordae between 2019 and 2024. Participants were divided into the RAFF ( n = 36) and non-RAFF ( n = 31) groups. In the RAFF technique, chordal length is determined by referencing the anterior leaflet chordae from the ipsilateral papillary muscle, with loop sets anchored to the frontal head of the papillary muscle. Leaflet resection was not performed in any case. Baseline demographics and lesion characteristics were similar between groups. The RAFF group demonstrated significantly less residual mitral regurgitation at the conclusion of surgery ( p = 0.014). Use of the RAFF method was significantly associated with suppression of postoperative leaflet billowing and a lower recurrence rate of moderate or greater mitral regurgitation during follow-up. Frontal fixation of posterior leaflet neochordae, a defining feature of the technique, resulted in a significant increase in coaptation length without inducing systolic anterior motion or elevating transvalvular gradients. The method also significantly reduced aortic cross-clamp time without compromising hemodynamic performance. The RAFF technique offers a standardized and anatomically guided approach to neochordae reconstruction. It minimizes inter-surgeon variability and anatomical inconsistencies, and promotes durable mitral competence by optimizing leaflet coaptation without incurring adverse events."

Objective: to evaluate IS predictors in patients with moderate or severe AS, which will help identify high-risk groups and optimise stroke prevention. Material and methods . A retrospective review of data from the hospital information system for case-control analysis was conducted at one of the Federal Centers for Cardiovascular Surgery. Inclusion criteria: moderate or severe AS, patient age ≥18 years. Exclusion criteria: moderate or severe mitral stenosis, moderate or severe mitral regurgitation. Logistic regression was used to determine IS predictors. Odds ratio (OR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated for each of the significant risk factors. Results . The study included 208 patients with AS (the main group consisted of 51 patients with a history of IS or transient ischemic attack). The median age of patients was 68 [62.0; 72.0] years, the proportion of men was 53.8%. According to the multivariate analysis, the following predictors of cerebral ischemic events were identified: male gender (OR 2.739; 95% CI 1.048–7.156, p=0.040), extra-, intracranial stenosis &gt;50% (OR 2.488; 95% CI 1.089–5.686, p=0.031), aortic arch atheromas (OR 5.947; 95% CI 1.179–29.994, p=0.031), the result of the CHA2DS2VASc scale with an increase of 1 point (OR 4.030; 95% CI 1.912–8.499, p&lt;0.001). Conclusion. Supra-cardiac atherosclerosis (extraand intracranial atherosclerosis, aortic atheromas) is the main predictor of IS in patients with AS, which determines the need for its assessment in order to optimise patient treatment."
OpenAlex,mitral regurgitation,Retained fragmented Raytec gauze eluding an alleged correct postoperative count following cardiothoracic surgery: case report of a rare “never event”,Marco Lizwan; Philip Y. K. Pang,10.1186/s13037-025-00472-w,2025-12-20,Patient Safety in Surgery,"Abstract Introduction Retained surgical items are rare yet serious complications that may occur despite correct instrument and sponge counts. Surgical sponges remain the most frequently retained items, with gauze marker strand retention being an uncommon mechanism. Case presentation A 69-year-old male with severe mitral regurgitation and triple-vessel coronary artery disease underwent mitral valve replacement with coronary artery bypass grafting. All surgical counts were verified as correct at the conclusion of surgery. Postoperative chest radiography, however, revealed two linear radio-opaque foreign bodies near the left lower sternum. Mediastinal re-exploration identified two radio-opaque strands, measuring 3.0 cm and 2.0 cm, attached to the left lower chest wall near the internal mammary artery stump. These were confirmed to be detached marker strands from Raytec gauzes. The patient’s recovery was uneventful and he was discharged well. Conclusion This case illustrates that retained gauze fragments can occur despite correct counts due to fragmentation of radiopaque markers. Surgeons and operating room nurses should inspect gauzes for integrity, maintain vigilance when manipulating sponges in confined operative fields, and consider adjunct technologies such as radiofrequency or barcode tracking. In high-risk surgeries, postoperative imaging may be warranted even with accurate counts to ensure patient safety."

As such, this study aimed to further evaluate the diagnostic utility of ePLAR in a large cohort of patients with PHTN. Methods and Results All RHCs between 2018-2023 across three tertiary centers were retrospectively reviewed. Patients with PHTN were characterized as pre-capillary or post-capillary (isolated or combined). Concurrent ePLAR was calculated. ROC analysis evaluated the accuracy of ePLAR in detecting pre-capillary PHTN. Overall, 2235 patients had PHTN by RHC, mean age 63.5 ± 14.7 years, 53.5% male. Of these, 43.3% had pre-capillary PHTN. ROC analysis demonstrated ePLAR to have good accuracy in detection of pre-capillary PHTN (AUC 0.760), with a cutoff of 0.20m/s demonstrating a sensitivity and specificity of 77% and 60% respectively. This persisted on sensitivity analysis for contemporaneous investigations and for right ventricular function. Conclusions In this large cohort, ePLAR was validated as an accurate tool for identifying patients with pre-capillary PHTN. This widely available, non-invasive, and reproducible parameter can have an important role in the work up of PHTN and may guide the need for invasive testing."

Speckle-tracking echocardiography enables early detection of myocardial dysfunction before abnormalities appear in conventional echocardiographic parameters. This study evaluated left ventricular (LV) global longitudinal strain (GLS) in pediatric SCD patients, and its relationship with traditional LV function indices, disease complications, hemolysis markers, and diseasemodifying therapy. We retrospectively analyzed 278 echocardiograms from 185 participants (118 SCD patients, mean age 12.2 years; 67 age- and sex-matched controls, mean age 11.8 years) obtained between 2015 and 2023. Among the SCD cohort, 66.1% had the HbSS genotype, 9.3% had HbSβ°-thalassemia, and 17.8% had HbSβ⁺-thalassemia; the majority (83.9%) were on hydroxyurea. Compared to controls, SCD patients had significantly lower, but still normal, GLS (–21.5% vs. –22.3%; p &lt; 0.001), along with significantly larger chamber diameters, elevated mitral valve E velocity, E/A ratio, and tricuspid regurgitation maximal velocity. Prior stroke (β = 0.9) and avascular necrosis (β = 1.51) were independently associated with worse GLS. The different genotypes did not exhibit significant difference in GLS. The strain values did not correlate with hemolysis markers, suggesting that other mechanisms may underlie myocardial impairment. A significant age-related decline in GLS was detected, with an inflection point at approximately 9.9 years. Longitudinal analysis of LV strain in the SCD cohort demonstrated a small decline from –21.6% to –21.2% over a 3.7-year follow-up period. Finally, pediatric SCD patients exhibit significant cardiac remodeling and diastolic dysfunction with preserved, yet lower, LV GLS, underscoring the need for further research in this population."
OpenAlex,mitral regurgitation,A massive left atrium in the context of severe mitral regurgitation: a case report,Ryaan EL‐Andari; Zachary Davidson; Jeevan Nagendran,10.1080/14796678.2025.2605920,2025-12-18,Future Cardiology,"Mitral regurgitation (MR) is among the most common heart conditions. Untreated, severe MR may result in adverse cardiac remodeling, atrial fibrillation (AF), and heart failure. A 45-year-old male with a history of AF presented with heart failure symptoms. Transesophageal echocardiogram revealed a myxomatous mitral valve with anterior leaflet prolapse, severe MR, and massively dilated left atrium (LA). A computerized tomography scan found severe LA dilation up to 17.8 cm. The patient underwent mitral valve replacement, tricuspid valve repair, and LA reduction. MR is known to result in LA dilation due to increased LA volume and pressure. While large LA sizes have been reported, they are often related to congenital conditions and rarely grow to the size identified in this case. AF and LA dilation both predict adverse outcomes, increasing the risk of thrombus formation in such a large chamber."

Methods: This prospective single-center cohort study included 101 patients with chronic heart failure (mean age 62 ± 15.5 years; 70.3% male) with paroxysmal or persistent drug-refractory atrial fibrillation who underwent atrioventricular node ablation and CRT-D implantation. All patients received optimal medical therapy before and after undergoing the procedure. Predictors of 5-year mortality were assessed using exploratory machine-learning methods, including random forest and Shapley additive explanations. Results: During 5-year follow-up, 13 cardiovascular deaths were recorded. Five key predictors of mortality were identified: left ventricular ejection fraction, 6 min walk distance, mean pulmonary artery pressure, systolic relaxation coefficient, and degree of mitral regurgitation. The exploratory predictive model showed high accuracy (92%) in terms of classifying the outcomes. Conclusions: Atrioventricular node ablation (AVNA) combined with CRT-D was associated with the observed long-term clinical outcomes observed in patients with drug-refractory tachysystolic atrial fibrillation. The exploratory machine learning analysis identified key mortality-associated factors, which may support future efforts in personalized risk stratification and hypothesis generation. The combination of AVNA and CRT-D was associated with the observed long-term outcomes in this real-world cohort."

Advances in endoscopic visualization and surgical instrumentation have enhanced precision while minimizing trauma, improving both functional and esthetic outcomes. This study presents a single-center experience with total endoscopic mitral valve repair (MVR) performed using two- or three-dimensional video-assisted technology. Methods: Between October 2022 and September 2025, 239 patients underwent total endoscopic MVR at our institution. Demographic, operative, and postoperative data were collected and analyzed. Results: Median age was 63 years, with 64.4% male. Median logistic EuroSCORE and EuroSCORE II were 2.53 and 0.83, respectively. Most patients were NYHA class II (54.4%), and 47.7% had pulmonary hypertension. Mitral annuloplasty was performed in 99.2% of cases; 78.6% received Gore-Tex chordae, 6.3% underwent posterior leaflet resection, and 11.7% edge-to-edge repair. Conversion to sternotomy occurred in 0.4%. In-hospital mortality was 1.3%; stroke occurred in 0.4%. Postoperative atrial fibrillation developed in 26.8%, while major complications such as sepsis (2.1%) and renal failure requiring dialysis (1.3%) were infrequent. Median ventilation time was 5 h, ICU stay was 2 days, and hospital stay was 7 days. Pre-discharge echocardiography showed ≤mild regurgitation in 99.2%. Conclusions: Total endoscopic MVR using two- or three-dimensional video assistance is safe, feasible, and yields excellent clinical, functional, and cosmetic results, with low morbidity and rapid recovery."

Hoopes; Vakhtang Tchantchaleishvili,10.1111/aor.70056,2025-12-18,Artificial Organs,"ABSTRACT Background Microaxial devices provide effective short‐term hemodynamic support in patients with cardiogenic shock or during high‐risk procedures. However, there is a paucity of data regarding device‐associated valvular complications. We sought to pool existing data to understand its incidence, management, and outcomes. Methods An electronic search was conducted in October 2024 to identify studies reporting microaxial device–associated valvular complications that did not resolve with device explantation. A total of 26 case reports and case series, representing 27 patients, were included. Patient‐level data were extracted for analysis. Results The median age was 50 years [IQR 34–65], and 78% (21/27) were male. The indications for microaxial support were cardiogenic shock (85.2%, 23/27), coronary bypass grafting (7.4%, 2/27), and high‐risk percutaneous coronary intervention (7.4%, 2/27). The most commonly used devices were the Impella 5.0 (41%, 11/27) and Impella CP (22%, 6/27). Aortic regurgitation (AR) developed in 67% of patients (18/27). Mitral regurgitation (MR) developed in 33% (9/27) of patients, all of which were severe. The median duration of microaxial support was 10 [3–15] days. Overall, 74% (20/27) of patients underwent surgical management, 11% (3/27) underwent transcatheter treatment, and 15% (4/27) were managed nonoperatively. In‐hospital/30‐day mortality was 11% (3/27), including two deaths among patients with MR (22%) and one in a patient with AR (5.6%) with a pre‐existing bioprosthetic aortic valve ( p = 0.19). When considering the patients with only native valves and excluding the bioprosthetic aortic valve, mortality was significantly higher among MR patients compared to those with AR (MR: 22%; AR: 0%, p = 0.04). At a median follow‐up of 183 [30–365] days, overall survival was 89% (24/27). Conclusion AR was more common than MR; however, all MR cases were severe. MR may be associated with worse outcomes. Surgical management appears to be the most frequently employed strategy for valvular injury."

Cavalcante; Jyothy Puthumana; Akhil Narang; Judy Hung; James D. Thomas; Lauren S. Ranard; Vera H. Rigolin,10.1001/jamacardio.2025.4561,2025-12-17,JAMA Cardiology,"Importance Primary mitral regurgitation (MR) is a prevalent valvular lesion. Current American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association guidelines include class I recommendations for intervention for severe primary MR at the onset of symptoms, significant left ventricular (LV) enlargement (end-systolic dimension ≥40 mm), or dysfunction (ejection fraction ≤60%), with a class IIA recommendation for mitral valve repair when performed at an experienced surgical center. Recent data suggest a survival penalty when waiting for class I surgical guideline indications, and novel markers of decompensation are under investigation. Observations Comprehensive assessment of MR severity using echocardiography is critical, and when warranted, cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) is complementary. Assessment of LV size and function, as well as serial changes in both, is crucial for determining timing of surgery. New-onset atrial fibrillation, left atrial enlargement, pulmonary hypertension, and exercise-induced changes in LV function should also be considered in borderline scenarios. The roles of LV volumes, global longitudinal strain, CMR-derived measures of myocardial dysfunction, and cardiac biomarkers are worthy of further investigation regarding consideration for early surgical intervention. Conclusions and Relevance A more refined approach incorporating assessment of extravalvular cardiac injury, novel imaging markers, and biomarkers is needed to optimize surgical timing in primary MR. Further research is warranted to validate these emerging parameters and refine guidelines to improve patient outcomes."

However, some patients with severe aortic stenosis exhibit eccentric remodeling with enlarged left ventricular cavities, enabling a normal flow, low ejection fraction ( NF ‐ LEF ) phenotype. We assessed the prevalence, hemodynamic characteristics, and post‐transcatheter aortic valve implantation outcomes of NF ‐ LEF . Methods In this substudy of the COMPARE‐TAVI 1 trial, 979 patients undergoing transfemoral transcatheter aortic valve implantation were stratified by left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) (&lt; or ≥50%) and stroke volume index (&lt; or ≥35 mL/m 2 ) into 4 groups: normal flow, normal LVEF, NF‐LEF, low flow, normal ejection fraction, and low flow, low ejection fraction. Results NF‐LEF was observed in 10.7% of patients. Reduced LVEF was associated with previous myocardial infarction, pacemakers, New York Heart Association class &gt;2, atrial fibrillation, moderate or worse mitral regurgitation, and larger left ventricular cavities ( P &lt;0.001) with eccentric hypertrophy ( P =0.004). Compared with low‐flow, low‐ejection fraction, patients with NF‐LEF more frequently had moderate or worse aortic regurgitation ( P =0.007), whereas low flow, low ejection fraction showed poorer diastolic indices, suggesting diastolic dysfunction with high left ventricular filling pressures. Patients with low flow, normal ejection fraction were the most symptomatic and showed less improvement in 6‐minute walk distance at 1 year compared with normal flow, normal ejection fraction. During follow‐up, both low‐flow groups demonstrated significant increases in stroke volume index ( P &lt;0.001), whereas LVEF also improved among patients with reduced LVEF ( P &lt;0.001). Conclusions NF‐LEF is a prevalent aortic stenosis phenotype characterized by preserved flow despite reduced LVEF, likely driven by eccentric remodeling with moderate or worse aortic regurgitation and more favorable diastolic properties, with similar survival and time‐to‐event outcomes across phenotypes after transcatheter aortic valve implantation at long‐term follow‐up. Despite higher comorbidity burdens, patients with NF‐LEF showed functional and clinical improvements comparable with normal flow, normal ejection fraction, indicating a severe aortic stenosis phenotype."

Borger; Patrick Perier,10.1093/ejcts/ezaf461,2025-12-17,European Journal of Cardio-Thoracic Surgery,"Abstract OBJECTIVES Mitral annular disjunction (MAD) is a structural abnormality of the mitral annulus fibrosus, associated with myxomatous leaflet degeneration, mitral valve prolapse (MVP), and ventricular arrhythmias. The combination of annular dilatation and abnormal annular motion increases mechanical stress on the mitral leaflets, triggering the degenerative process. METHODS This review summarizes the major pathophysiologic, diagnostic and therapeutic measures for the treatment of patients with MAD and an indication for mitral surgery. RESULTS The diagnosis is primarily based on non-invasive imaging techniques. Echocardiography is the first choice due to its ability to assess real-time mitral valve function. Cardiac Computed tomography and Magnetic Resonance Imaging provide more comprehensive information on the extend of MAD and the presence of calcifications. Indications for surgical mitral valve treatment are based on current recommendations. In cases with MAD and moderate mitral regurgitation, early intervention may be advocated in the presence of arrhythmogenic MVP. Long-term outcomes after treatment are assessed through multimodal imaging and electrocardiogram monitoring. A ring annuloplasty is an important cornerstone of treatment. Stabilization of the mitral annulus abolishes functional prolapse and increases the antiarrhythmic effect of mitral surgery. However, postoperative arrhythmic burden may persist in some cases, requiring continuous monitoring and sometimes an additional device therapy. CONCLUSIONS MAD represents a complex anatomical and functional entity associated with diagnostic challenges and rhythm abnormalities. Although the current indications for surgical treatment follow the recommendations for treatment of primary mitral regurgitation, early treatment may be important especially in patients with arrhythmias."

Understanding the mechanism of MR, whether primary, due to intrinsic valve abnormalities, or secondary, resulting from atrial or ventricular remodeling, is essential for optimal management. Echocardiography, particularly advanced modalities such as three-dimensional imaging and strain analysis, plays a central role in this process. It allows accurate quantification of MR severity, detailed characterization of valve and ventricular anatomy, and assessment of remodeling, all of which are critical for determining the optimal timing for intervention. Beyond diagnosis, echocardiography is indispensable in guiding therapy selection: it informs surgical planning by defining leaflet pathology for repair versus replacement strategies, and directs transcatheter interventions by guiding interatrial septal puncture, catheter orientation, and device deployment in real time. While surgery remains the gold standard for primary MR, transcatheter approaches including edge-to-edge repair and emerging mitral valve replacement are increasingly relevant, particularly in patients at high surgical risk or with complex anatomy. This review emphasizes the pivotal role of echocardiography in the pre-procedural assessment of MR, highlighting its ability to integrate anatomical, functional, and hemodynamic information to guide patient-tailored therapeutic strategies and optimize outcomes within a Heart Team framework."

It examines the potential treatment for sickle cell anaemia and other chronic or acute diseases like myocardial infarction, angina, CHF, hypertension, rheumatic heart disease, ischemic mitral regurgitation, cardiomyopathy, platelet aggregation, oxidative stress, endothelial dysfunction, and thrombotic conditions. The review examines the potential of Terminalia arjuna leaf gall in SCD treatment, identifying its main bioactive compound, 5-Hydroxymethylfurfural, known for its anti-sickling properties. Galls form when plants react to insect attacks, notably from Trioza fletcheri in T. arjuna. Studies indicate that extracts from Terminalia arjuna exhibit significant anti-sickling effects. While the pharmacological potential of these extracts is promising, further clinical studies and safety assessments are necessary to validate efficacy and standardisation for therapeutic use. The review examines how Arjuna bark decoction has been used in the Indian subcontinent for centuries to manage anginal pain, hypertension, congestive heart failure, and dyslipidemia. While its potential in cardiovascular diseases warrants further study, recent literature highlights its anti-ischemic, antioxidant, hypolipidemic, and antiatherogenic effects, primarily due to its beneficial phytoconstituents like triterpenoids and flavonoids. Arjuna has shown promise in treating ischemic cardiomyopathy, with no serious side effects reported; however, long-term safety remains unclear. Its role in coronary prevention still needs exploration."

Shernan; Sergey Karamnov,10.1213/ane.0000000000007756,2025-12-15,Anesthesia & Analgesia,"BACKGROUND: Evaluation of the mitral valve during transcatheter edge-to-edge repair (TEER) for management of mitral regurgitation is commonly guided by intraprocedural interventional transesophageal echocardiography (TEE). The risk of iatrogenic mitral stenosis (MS) remains a concern, particularly in patients requiring multiple clips, since the mitral valve orifice area (MVA) is reduced. The value of conventional flow-based echocardiographic methods to rule out MS is limited by intraprocedural and general anesthesia (GA)-induced hemodynamic variability. This retrospective study introduces the novel adaptation of a 3-dimensional (3D) Orifice Area (3DOA) technique to evaluate post-TEER MVA. We evaluated the degree of agreement between MVAs derived via TEE 3DOA, TEE pressure half-time (PHT), and postprocedure transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) PHT with patients awake. METHODS: TEE and TTE images from 20 adult patients with severe mitral regurgitation undergoing a TEER (MitraClip, Abbott) procedure were retrospectively reviewed. MVAs obtained by MTEE 3DOA and TEE PHT under GA were compared to those acquired with TTE PHT with patients awake. Agreement was assessed via calculation of Bland–Altman 95% limits of agreement and Lin’s concordance correlation coefficients, both with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). RESULTS: There was good agreement between TEE 3DOA-derived MVA measurements under GA and TTE PHT-derived MVA measurements in awake patients, as reflected by Bland–Altman (lower limit of agreement: −.0.45 [95% CI, −.58 to −.31] and upper limit of agreement: 0.26 [95% CI, 0.12–0.4]), and an excellent concordance correlation coefficient value (0.95 [95% CI, 0.86–0.98]). In contrast, agreement between TEE PHT-derived MVA and TTE PHT-derived MVA was weak, with much broader limits of agreement (lower limit of agreement: −1.6 [95% CI, −2.19 to −1.02] and upper limit of agreement: 1.43 [95% CI, 0.84–2.01]) and a weak concordance correlation coefficient value (0.46 [95% CI, 0.02–0.75]). CONCLUSIONS: In this retrospective cohort study, we demonstrated excellent agreement between TEE-3DOA-derived MVA under GA and TTE PHT-derived MVA in awake patients, but not between TEE versus TTE PHT. These findings warrant further validation in larger patient datasets to assess the utility of 3D echocardiographic approaches in evaluating MVA after TEER."
