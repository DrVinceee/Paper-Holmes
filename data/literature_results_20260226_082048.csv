We aimed to identify risk factors, clinical and imaging features of spontaneous IAD (sIAD) using a case-control design.
We collected data on sIAD patients admitted to Tongji Hospital in Wuhan, China from June 2017 to June 2024. Non-IAD ischemic stroke (IS) and non-IAD intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) patients served as control groups. Logistic regression models analyzed the three data sets, with results expressed as odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence interval (CI).
After screening, 71 patients with sIAD, 84 patients with non-IAD IS and 102 patients with non-IAD ICH were included in this study. The findings showed that the participants with diabetes had a lower likelihood of sIAD than non-IAD IS (OR = 0.145, 95%CI = 0.030-0.702). Compared with non-IAD ICH patients, individuals with sIAD had lower systolic blood pressure on admission (OR = 0.941, 95%CI = 0.900-0.983) and less likely to be young (OR = 0.911, 95%CI = 0.855-0.970). Serological data showed that compared with non-IAD ICH patients, elevated triglyceride (OR = 0.326, 95%CI = 0.179-0.594) were associated with the reduced likelihood of sIAD, whereas the opposite was true for uric acid levels (OR = 1.007, 95%CI = 1.000-1.014). In imaging, sIAD patients showed the largest number of arterial lumen dilatation, followed by stenosis with dilatation.
Diabetes may be associated with a reduced likelihood of sIAD. Differences in serologic markers may help in the differential diagnosis of sIAD from other cerebrovascular events."

Despite high procedural success, postoperative complications remain common and clinically consequential. Understanding how research on these complications has evolved is essential for guiding future investigations and improving outcomes. This study maps the global research landscape of TAVR-associated postoperative complications, with emphasis on thematic evolution, collaboration patterns, and emerging mechanistic and analytical approaches.
A bibliometric analysis of publications from 2006 to 2025 was conducted using the Web of Science Core Collection. Publication trends, contributing countries and institutions, authors, subject categories, and journals were analysed. CiteSpace and VOSviewer were used to visualise keyword co-occurrence, citation bursts, collaboration networks, and thematic clusters.
A total of 3587 publications were identified, with rapid growth after 2014. The United States led in publication output and international collaboration, followed by Germany, Italy, and the United Kingdom. Research themes shifted from early feasibility studies towards complication-focused topics. High-frequency keywords included stroke, paravalvular leak, and bundle branch block, while recent attention has increasingly focused on frailty, sarcopenia, and multimorbidity. Biomechanical terms such as finite element and fluid-structure interaction reflected deeper mechanistic exploration. The literature spanned over 20 disciplines, indicating strong interdisciplinarity.
The field has shifted from procedural feasibility to multidisciplinary, mechanism-oriented studies of complications affecting long-term outcomes, with frailty emerging as a key patient-centred determinant in older TAVR populations."

Their pathophysiology is not fully understood. They preferentially affect the elderly and comorbid patients. Their association with aortic stenosis is known as Heyde's syndrome. Diagnosis is based on digestive endoscopy (upper gastrointestinal endoscopy, colonoscopy and small bowel capsule endoscopy). Non-specific treatment includes management of blood thinners, iron supplementation (oral or intravenous) and blood transfusions. The specific first-line treatment is endoscopic destruction (argon plasma electrocoagulation being the most common), if necessary, by deep enteroscopy (with double balloon technique) in their jejunal and ileal locations. If endoscopic treatment fails, other treatments may be considered. In Heyde's syndrome, aortic valve replacement (surgical or transcatheter, TAVI) is often effective. Some pharmacological treatments have been shown to be effective, most notably long-acting release somatostatin analogues, followed by thalidomide (which has a poorer safety and tolerability profile). Bevacizumab, radiological embolization and surgery are only considered in most refractory or salvage cases."

Optum Market Clarity Data was used to identify patients with clinically significant AS (CSAS) who received an AVR between 2016 and 2023 and whose AVR occurred within two years of their CSAS diagnosis. Patient characteristics were measured at baseline; pre-procedural factors, including the number of cardiac specialist visits and imaging events, were measured from CSAS diagnosis to AVR (TAVR vs SAVR). Stepwise generalized linear models were used to assess whether the number of cardiac specialist visits and imaging events contribute to the differences in time to TAVR and SAVR, after adjusting for baseline characteristics.
Of the 14,225 patients in the cohort, 42 % received a TAVR. Compared to the SAVR cohort, the TAVR cohort was, on average, more male, older, sicker, and had more Medicare enrollees. TAVR patients had approximately two times more cardiac specialist visits (3.73 vs 6.37) and imaging events (1.18 vs 2.07) than SAVR patients. Time to TAVR is 65 days longer (RR = 1.77, 1.67-1.87) than SAVR, after adjustment for patient characteristics. This difference reduces to 11 days (RR = 1.12, 1.07-1.17) after accounting cardiac specialist encounters and imaging events.
Pre-procedural encounters significantly contribute to the longer time to AVR for TAVR patients. Findings suggest a need for streamlining the pre-procedural process for TAVR to enhance timely care delivery for CSAS patients."

This study aims to compare outcomes of BE THVs and SE THVs in patients with LFLG AS.
This was a retrospective, single-institution cohort study of TAVR procedures between 2012 and 2024. Patients with LFLG AS (mean gradient < 40 mmHg and ejection fraction < 50% or stroke volume index < 35 mL/m2) were stratified by respective valve type. Patients with prior aortic valve replacement were excluded. Postoperative outcomes were compared between groups. Kaplan-Meier estimates and a Cox regression model were generated for survival. Cumulative incidence curves and a cause-specific cox regression model were generated for heart failure (HF) readmission.
A total of 732 patients identified underwent TAVR for LFLG AS. Of these, 478 (65.3%) received a BE THV and 254 (34.7%) received a SE THV. STS PROM was similar between groups. There was no difference in 30-day mortality between groups. SE THVs had a lower mean gradient but increased rates of paravalvular leak at 30 days post-TAVR. Kaplan-Meier estimates were comparable between groups and there was no significant difference after multivariable analysis (HR 1.15, 95% CI 0.90-1.46, p = 0.27). Cumulative incidence estimates of HF readmission were similar between groups, however, BE THV was associated with reduced hazard of HF readmission on multivariable analysis (HR 0.77, 95% CI 0.59-0.99, p = 0.04).
In patients with LFLG AS undergoing TAVR, BE and SE THVs have comparable midterm survival. BE THVs have a reduced risk of HF readmission on multivariable analysis."

Over the past decade, SRT has undergone remarkable refinement and diversification. Traditional strategies - surgical septal myectomy and alcohol septal ablation - have been continually optimized, demonstrating durable relief of left ventricular outflow tract obstruction and sustained symptomatic improvement. Emerging techniques, including percutaneous intramyocardial septal radiofrequency ablation, transapical beating-heart myectomy, transcoronary radiofrequency ablation, and endoluminal electrosurgical myotomy, offer promising, less-invasive alternatives that achieve hemodynamic outcomes comparable to surgery. Nevertheless, long-term data on these novel procedures are scarce, and evidence-based algorithms for matching individual patients to the optimal technique remain elusive. This review synthesizes 65 years of technical evolution in SRT and proposes an evidence-driven framework for individualized procedure selection that integrates anatomical complexity, patient-specific risk profiles, and institutional expertise, thereby advancing the field toward truly personalized and effective care."

Existing studies inadequately address its specific disease burden and associated health inequities. This study aims to comprehensively evaluate the global, regional, and national burden of NRCAVD from 1990 to 2021 to inform equitable public health policies and resource allocation strategies.
Utilizing the Global Burden of Disease (GBD) 2021 dataset, we quantified NRCAVD burden through age-standardized incidence rates (ASIR), mortality (ASDR), disability-adjusted life years (DALYs), and sociodemographic index (SDI). Key drivers of burden trends were identified via age-sex decomposition, age-period-cohort (APC) modeling. Health inequalities and TAVR penetration were assessed through disparity metrics, while Bayesian age-period-cohort (BAPC) models projected future trajectories to 2041.
Between 1990 and 2021, global NRCAVD burden increased significantly, with males and populations in high-SDI regions experiencing disproportionately higher burdens. While women showed lower disease incidence, they faced higher mortality rates. Health disparities worsened primarily due to aging and population growth. Higher penetration of TAVR is associated with a decrease in ASDR of NRCAVD, which was observed in multinational registries. Incidence peaked at ages 75-79, whereas mortality and DALYs were highest at 85-89 years. Projections indicate declining age-standardized rates (ASIR: -2.88%, ASDR: -0.69%, DALYs: -7.54% by 2041), though reductions lagged in males compared to females.
Global NRCAVD burden remains unequal, particularly in high-SDI regions where mortality rates are disproportionately high. Addressing widening inequalities requires sex-specific interventions for aging populations, expanded access to cost-effective valvular therapies, and strengthened health systems in underserved regions. Multinational collaboration to standardize NRCAVD surveillance and share best practices in lifecycle management is imperative to achieve health equity in an aging world."

Heart failure,"Guidelines acknowledge that discordant low-gradient (LG) aortic stenosis (AS) may be severe, but verifying this can be challenging. Right heart catheterization during exercise is considered the gold standard for evaluating ventricular hemodynamics. No invasive studies have compared the hemodynamic response of discordant LG and severe AS during exercise. The aim of this observational study was to describe exercise hemodynamics in patients with asymptomatic discordant AS and left ventricular ejection fraction ≥50%.
Patients with aortic valve area ≤1.5 cm2 underwent right heart catheterization at rest and during maximal exercise, measuring pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (PCWP), cardiac output (CO), and the PCWP/CO-slope. Patients were stratified into 3 groups: discordant LG AS (aortic valve area ≤1.0 cm2 and mean gradient <40 mm Hg); moderate AS (aortic valve area >1.0 cm2); and high-gradient (HG) severe AS (aortic valve area ≤1.0 cm2 and mean gradient ≥40 mm Hg).
Among 86 patients, 17 (20%) had discordant LG, 49 (57%) moderate, and 20 (23%) HG severe AS. The median PCWP/CO-slope was significantly steeper in discordant LG (3.3 [interquartile range, 2.1-4.3] mm Hg/L/min) and HG severe AS (2.7 [1.9-3.4] mm Hg/L per minute) compared with moderate AS (1.9 [0.7-2.8] mm Hg/L per minute), P=0.004. In a regression model adjusted for age, sex, and rest PCWP, systemic arterial compliance and AS severity were significantly associated with the PCWP/CO-slope. Furthermore, patients with discordant LG AS had a leftward-upward shift in the PCWP/CO-curve.
Discordant LG and HG severe AS had similar hemodynamic responses to exercise with steeper PCWP/CO-slope than in moderate AS, suggesting that discordant LG AS is a severe form of AS. In addition, the left upwards shift in PCWP/CO-curve for discordant LG compared with HG severe AS indicates that this group also has heart failure with preserved ejection fraction physiology.

Since the first-in-human procedure in 2002, TAVI has gained global acceptance owing to its favorable clinical outcomes and faster recovery than those associated with surgical aortic valve replacement. Landmark trials have demonstrated the noninferiority or superiority of TAVI across high-, intermediate-, and low-surgical risk populations, leading to guideline endorsement as a recommended option for appropriately selected patients across all surgical risk groups. Furthermore, long-term follow-up data support the durability of contemporary TAVI devices. Beyond its current established indications, TAVI is being explored for broader applications such as asymptomatic severe AS, moderate AS with heart failure, and pure aortic regurgitation; however, these uses remain investigational and are not yet part of formal guidelines. This review summarizes TAVI's historical evolution, pivotal clinical trial evidence, and procedural innovations that have enabled its widespread use. We explore Korea-specific experiences with TAVI implementation, highlighting national registry data, healthcare policy considerations, and institutional adoption. Future perspectives include long-term device performance, lifetime valve management strategies, and the integration of artificial intelligence into transcatheter valve therapy."

While double valve surgery (DVS) remains the gold standard, its high operative risks have led to investigating novel strategies, chiefly transcatheter interventions. Due to the lack of commercially available transcatheter devices for MS, numerous high-risk patients undergo isolated transcatheter aortic valve replacement (I-TAVR). The long-term efficacy and durability of this single-valve approach in a multivalvular stenotic setting is not well established.
Retrospective analyses of consecutive patients treated for concomitant severe AS and moderate-to-severe MS at a single institution (2015-2025), divided according to treatment strategy (DVS vs I-TAVR). Propensity-score matching accounted for baseline differences, while univariable and multivariable analyses evaluated factors associated with recurrent heart failure (HF) readmissions.
Ninety-seven patients underwent DVS and 129 I-TAVR. Both before and after propensity score matching, no differences were observed in short- nor mid-term incidence of all-cause mortality (unmatched, p = 0.078; matched, no events) nor stroke (unmatched, p = 0.783; matched, p = 1.00). However, I-TAVR was found to be associated with greater HF rehospitalizations (unmatched, p = 0.001; matched, p = 0.006). The univariable and multivariable analyses demonstrated I-TAVR to be an independent risk factor for HF rehospitalization, in both the unmatched and matched populations.
In patients with high-grade concomitant AS and MS, addressing only AS with I-TAVR is an independent predictor of HF readmissions. While I-TAVR remains a valid therapeutic option in high-risk patients with high-grade multivalvular stenosis, DVS should be considered as the preferred treatment option in any patient that can tolerate surgery.

Cerebral embolic protection devices (CEPD), including filter-based and deflection-based systems (Sentinel and TriGUARD), aim to reduce embolic complications; however, their clinical benefit remains uncertain. This study evaluated the efficacy and safety of CEPD during TAVR using trial sequential analysis (TSA) and the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) framework.
Randomized controlled trials (RCTs comparing TAVR with and without CEPD were identified through four electronic databases from inception to April 2025. Primary outcomes were all-cause mortality, major adverse cardiovascular and cerebrovascular events (MACCE), stroke, and disabling stroke. Pooled risk ratios (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated. TSA was conducted with a 5% type I error and 80% power.
Nine RCTs including 11,876 patients were analyzed. CEPD use showed no significant reduction in mortality, MACCE, stroke, or disabling stroke. Secondary and subgroup analyses yielded consistent findings. TSA demonstrated that the accrued evidence was insufficient to confirm a clinical benefit.
Current evidence does not support the routine use of CEPD during TAVR, given the lack of significant benefit in key clinical outcomes.

Developed by a multidisciplinary Heart Team including patient representatives, the guidelines emphasize patient-centered ""lifetime"" management, shared decision-making, and treatment at high-volume expert Heart Valve Centers, especially for complex surgical and transcatheter procedures. The scope has been broadened to address cancer and radiation-associated VHD, cardiogenic shock and acute heart failure, multiple and mixed VHD, and sex-specific issues. Key changes in indications for imaging, treatment, and follow-up of VHD are discussed in the perspective of evidence-based medicine. Key updates include earlier intervention in severe, high-gradient, asymptomatic aortic stenosis, refined age thresholds favoring transfemoral transcatheter aortic valve implantation, and its use in bicuspid aortic stenosis and aortic regurgitation in high-risk or inoperable patients. Recommendations for secondary mitral regurgitation (MR) distinguish atrial from ventricular mechanisms and upgrade mitral transcatheter edge-to-edge repair to class I in selected cases of ventricular secondary MR. At the same time, surgery remains first-line for primary MR, with defined triggers for early repair and emerging roles for transcatheter edge-to-edge repair and transcatheter mitral valve implantation in high-risk patients. The document also strengthens guidance on tricuspid interventions, structured assessment of right ventricular dysfunction, and simplifies antithrombotic strategies, including restricted use of dual antiplatelet therapy after transcatheter aortic valve implantation in patients without another indication for oral anticoagulation. Implementing these recommendations should streamline care pathways and reduce the burden of VHD."

We report the case of a 55-year-old woman with severe symptomatic aortic stenosis who underwent elective mechanical aortic valve replacement. Preoperative echocardiography showed preserved ventricular dimensions with low-normal systolic function. Due to technical difficulties during mini-sternotomy, a prolonged aortic cross-clamp time was required with repeated cardioplegia. Failure to wean from cardiopulmonary bypass was followed by complete left ventricular akinesia, immobile left-sided valves, and minimal right ventricular activity despite maximal support. Full sternotomy revealed a rigid, non-compliant myocardium consistent with SHS. Central veno-arterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation was instituted without myocardial recovery. The patient died from multiorgan failure on postoperative day three. SHS results from profound myocardial ischemia, causing adenosine triphosphate depletion, calcium overload, and irreversible actin-myosin binding. Prevention, achieved through meticulous myocardial protection and strict minimization of ischemic time, remains the only effective strategy against this devastating and irreversible complication of cardiac surgery."

Case reports,"Transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) is an effective and safe treatment for severe aortic stenosis. Despite advancements reducing complications, rare life-threatening events like ventricular perforation remain significant challenges. This case details the management of an acute left ventricular perforation during TAVI.
A 74-year-old woman with symptomatic severe bicuspid aortic stenosis underwent transfemoral TAVI. Sudden haemodynamic collapse occurred during the device delivery. Transoesophageal echocardiography demonstrated massive pericardial effusion, attributed to guidewire-induced left ventricular perforation. The patient maintained haemodynamic stability with pericardial drainage on cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB). However, pericardial effusion recurred after transitioning from CPB to extracorporeal membrane oxygenation support. Cardiac surgeons repaired the laceration at the apex and achieved haemostasis through minimally invasive left anterior thoracotomy, successfully resolving the intraoperative crisis and rescuing the patient.
This case illustrates that ventricular perforation/rupture during TAVI, while rare, constitutes a fatal complication. To mitigate this risk, enhanced preoperative risk stratification and intraprocedural monitoring for left or right ventricular perforation/rupture are imperative. Prompt recognition and intervention-including pericardiocentesis, CPB initiation, and surgical haemostasis-are critical upon occurrence. Innovatively employing minimally invasive left anterior thoracotomy for repair in this case significantly reduced surgical trauma, facilitating rapid postoperative recovery."

Endovascular stents typically consist of a metal framework and a flexible membrane graft designed to reopen obstructed aortic segments and maintain blood flow through the true lumen. Consequently, stents are widely used to treat aortic expansion diseases and aortic occlusive stenosis. However, traditional stents have limitations in terms of adaptability to complex anatomical structures, long-term durability, biomechanical stability, and reliance on radial support force for fixation, lacking active fixation mechanisms. These shortcomings remain the primary causes of postoperative complications, significantly impacting the quality of life for patients with aortic dissection.                                                           Methods:                     The research status of the endovascular stent was discussed in depth, and the main factors for the optimal design of the stent (geometry, pattern configuration, additional fixtures, and optimization methods) were analyzed and summarized according to the complications targeted by the repair device.                                                           Results:                     The composition structure, working principle, and development status of the stent grafts under review are elaborated in detail. Stent grafts attempt to alleviate postoperative complications through three approaches: enhancing the flexibility of the stent framework, improving the fit between the vessel wall and the stent, and reducing vascular injury. Blood flow guiding channels are established to alleviate the obstruction of branch blood flow. Additional self-anchoring devices are added to adapt to the dynamic remodeling of blood vessels.                                                           Discussion:                     The effects of various factors, including geometric parameters, structural design, and parameter optimization techniques, on the optimization of stent primary mechanical performance are discussed. The current research status of functional improvement methods for stents is also summarized.                                                           Conclusion:                     Refining the quantitative relationship between stent structural parameters and mechanical performance, as well as exploring the balance criteria between flexibility and radial support force, represent promising directions for future development. These objectives necessitate further in-depth analysis and research."

With a focus on the prevalent psychological complications following the onset of this condition, this study aimed to explore the correlation between antenatal depression and Corona disease anxiety, personality traits, and postpartum depression during the COVID-19 pandemic.                                                           Materials and Methods:                     This cross-sectional descriptive-analytical study investigated women receiving care at health centers affiliated with Kerman University of Medical Sciences during the last month of their pregnancy and the postpartum period in 2022. Following the acquisition of informed consent, participants were assessed using various measures, including demographic and obstetric information, the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale, the Corona Disease Anxiety Scale (CDAS), and the NEO Personality Inventory-Revised during their third trimester of pregnancy. The same group of participants completed the Edinburgh Depression Scale and the Corona Disease Anxiety Scale (CDAS) 4-6 weeks after childbirth.                                                           Results and Discussion:                     There was a significant correlation between family income, unwanted pregnancy as perceived by both the mother and father, and antenatal depression. Additionally, marital satisfaction played a significant role in postpartum depression. Furthermore, antenatal depression was significantly associated with neuroticism, agreeableness, and physical symptoms related to Corona disease anxiety. Personality traits, with the exception of extroversion and conscientiousness, and various domains of Corona disease anxiety, excluding psychological symptoms, were also significantly associated with postpartum depression.                                                           Conclusion:                     During pandemics or epidemics, such as the COVID-19 outbreak, experiencing mental distress during pregnancy can contribute to mental health issues during the postpartum period. This risk is particularly true in individuals with unique personality traits, emphasizing the need for increased focus on mental health within prenatal care during these crises."

Method:                     This cross-sectional study was conducted in Kerman, Iran. Data were collected from patients who visited Afzalipour Hospital in Kerman more than twice during the COVID-19 epidemic from the end of February 2020 to March 21, 2021. We conducted two key analyses: 1. Mixed effect logistic regression was used to check the relationship between the variables and COVID-19 severity. 2. Mixed effect linear regression was used to check the relationship between the variables and the length of stay in the hospital.                                                           Results:                     The findings indicated that the most important risk factors for the severity of COVID-19 were heart diseases (OR=1.67,95%CI:1.20-2.30), increasing age (OR=2.23 for age&gt;54, 95%CI:1.70- 2.90), male gender (OR=1.47,95%CI:1.10-1.96), respiratory diseases other than asthma, and frequency of admission (OR=1.60,95%CI:1.20-2.15). All patients who underwent readmission experienced a shorter duration of hospitalization during their subsequent admission (OR=0.94,95%CI:0.91,0.96) and had a higher mortality rate (30% within 14 days, 26.6% between 14-90 days). Patients readmitted at intervals of 14-90 days and greater than 90 days exhibited lower disease severity compared to those readmitted within the 0-14 day period.                                                           Conclusion:                     Examining readmissions, the severity of COVID-19, and the length of hospital stay in affected patients are important factors for planning and allocating resources for COVID-19 management and treatment. These factors can help policymakers develop effective clinical guidelines for hospitalization or outpatient treatment of COVID-19 patients and contribute to reducing the burden of disease in the community."

Kinovea, as an accessible motion-analysis software, provides both visual and quantitative feedback. However, its application in supporting technique development among beginner athletes remains insufficiently explored. Aim: This study aims to describe the use of Kinovea in biomechanics training and examine its contribution to the awareness of kinematic characteristics and movement techniques among beginner athletes. Methods: A descriptive qualitative design involved 72 beginner athletes aged 18–25 years selected through purposive sampling. Data were collected over 16 weeks through interviews, field observations, and motion video recordings analyzed using Kinovea. Kinematic data focused on joint angles, stride behavior, and movement phases during walking, running, and the flight phase. Qualitative data were analyzed using content analysis with NVivo 12, while kinematic results were interpreted descriptively to identify performance patterns and areas for technical refinement. Result: Kinematic analysis showed coordinated joint-angle patterns across all phases. Walking analysis identified arm swing angles of 50.9°–58.8° and leg separation angles of 64.3°–67.2°, indicating a stable gait rhythm. The running analysis revealed knee angles of 68.8°–69.8° and elbow angles of 87.6°–89.1°, indicating efficient propulsive mechanics. The flight phase demonstrated knee angles of 81.2°–87.8° and elbow angles of 80.4°–88.3°, suggesting effective momentum use and postural stability. These measurements supported stride-efficiency assessment and technique evaluation. Qualitative findings revealed that Kinovea enabled athletes to interpret movement phases and identify technical inefficiencies through slow-motion and frame-by-frame visualization. Conclusion: Kinovea supports basic motion analysis by providing clear kinematic information and helping beginner athletes observe and refine their movement techniques. The findings also offer practical value for coaches by enabling more precise identification of inefficient patterns and guiding targeted corrections during early-stage training."

OpenAlex,deep learning,Combating Data and Target Shifts in Visual Tasks,Zhaorui Tan,10.17638/03194353,2031-01-01,University of Liverpool,"The rapid advancement of deep learning models for visual tasks has led to significant progress in many domains. However, a key challenge remains: ensuring that models can generalize effectively to unseen samples or novel classes, especially in real-world scenarios where training data-target pairs are often limited or unavailable, and test data may exhibit shifts in both data and targets. This thesis addresses the problem of shifts across data and targets, proposing novel methods to improve model generalization and transferability in complex settings. The thesis identifies the different shift scenarios for visual tasks and presents their problem forms. The research first relaxes the static target distribution assumption in Multi-Domain Generalization (mDG) tasks, introducing the General Multi-Domain Generalization (GMDG) objective to improve generalization under varying data shifts. Specifically, Extensive experiments validate that GMDG is feasible for classification, segmentation, and regression tasks. Further considering extreme target distribution shifts where even unknown novel classes emerge, the study also explores logical regularization techniques for tasks such as Generalized Category Discovery (GCD), mDG+GCD, and Class Incremental Learning (CIL), proposing a sample-based logical regularization term (L-Reg) to enhance data-, target-, and all-shift generalization. Additionally, a partial logic framework is introduced to address challenges in CIL, enabling models to retain room for unknown classes during training. This is further extended by the Partial-Logic Regularization (PL-Reg), which improves generalization across GCD, mDG+GCD, and transferability for CIL tasks. Furthermore, the thesis proposes a novel Semantic-aware Data Augmentation (SADA) framework for cross-modality generalization in text-to-image synthesis (T2Isyn), text-image retrieval (TIR), and image-text retrieval (ITR) tasks. This framework ensures semantic preservation across text and image modalities, improving both semantic consistency and image quality in cross-modality tasks. The methods proposed in this thesis offer significant advancements in visual generalization and transfer scenarios, providing theoretical insights and practical solutions for handling data shifts, target shifts, and multi-modalities in complex scenarios. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of the proposed methods, demonstrating their superior performance across a range of tasks."
OpenAlex,deep learning,Antecedents and consequences of Green-tech FDI in emerging markets,Zhuoran Liu,10.17638/03195308,2031-01-01,University of Liverpool,"As environmental pressures intensify, attracting sustainable foreign direct investment (FDI), particularly green-tech FDI, has become a critical pathway for emerging markets to achieve environmental sustainability. However, existing research remains fragmented, offering limited insights into why green-tech FDI enters emerging markets and how it affects regional green innovation. This thesis addresses these gaps by systematically examining both the antecedents and consequences of green-tech FDI through three empirical studies using regional data from China. Study 1 and Study 2 focus on the antecedents of green-tech FDI. Study 1 examines how host-country conditions can attract green-tech FDI, highlighting the role of environmental management information disclosure (EMID) by domestic firms in reducing information gaps and strengthening green market–seeking motives. Study 2 shifts attention to the active decision-making of green-tech FDI, showing that under uncertainty, green-tech foreign investors engage in identity-based bandwagon learning by imitating peers with similar green identities, thereby mitigating investment risks. Study 3 turns to the consequences of green-tech FDI. It demonstrates that, due to the technological complexity of green innovation and limited absorptive capacity in emerging markets, green-tech FDI may generate crowding-out effects rather than purely positive spillovers. Adopting a network perspective, the study further finds that universities play a key moderating role: through broad linkages and deep collaborations, they help mitigate negative spillovers and facilitate the diffusion of green technologies. Together, the three studies advance the literature on sustainable FDI by differentiating green-tech FDI from general FDI and identifying the specific mechanisms that shape its entry decisions and local innovation outcomes. Practically, the findings provide guidance for emerging-market governments and firms on how to attract and manage sustainable investment, balance growth with environmental objectives, and strengthen local innovation ecosystems."
OpenAlex,deep learning,A UAV-Based Framework for Community-Scale Residential Building Energy Modelling in China,Mengfan Jin,10.17638/03195460,2029-01-01,University of Liverpool,"With increasing emphasis on energy efficiency and carbon emission reduction in the building sector, rapid and scalable energy modelling of existing buildings is critical for retrofit projects and policy development. Conventional surveys, data collection and energy modelling processes remain labour-intensive and impractical for large-scale applications, and energy modelling often dominates project time and cost. Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) equipped with high-resolution and infrared cameras now offer fast and safe exterior surveys, showing great potential in building energy assessments. Yet, a systematic framework for UAV integration, from image capture through processing to inputs for building energy simulation, has not been established. This research addresses these challenges by developing a structured framework for community-scale building energy modelling, which integrates UAV photogrammetry to accelerate data acquisition, reduce labour, and shorten energy modelling time for retrofit projects. The framework is designed to minimise prior data requirements while maximising automation and retaining sufficient accuracy and reliability. It also addressed systemic issues, such as the lack of data necessary to fully exploit the potential of available technologies in the context of this study. To achieve this research objective, a mixed-methodology approach, combining desk studies and fieldwork, was adopted. First, a comprehensive review of UAV-based building energy studies mapped the current applications and available tools, proposing a preliminary framework. Fieldwork then encompassed a pilot study and a detailed case study. In the pilot test, a single building was surveyed to identify an optimal toolchain for flight planning, image capture, photogrammetric reconstruction, model generation, and selection of a simulation platform. The resulting refined framework was applied to a case study of a 39-building community, and it was demonstrated that further automation was necessary. The potential for automation was then further explored. Geomatic algorithms, machine learning, and deep learning techniques were compared, and the combination that best balanced accuracy and processing time was selected for 3D model generation and window-to-wall ratio (WWR) extraction. In parallel, an archetype library of residential buildings in the Hot Summer Cold Winter (HSCW) zone in China was compiled to facilitate the assignment of thermal parameters. Finally, a reusable community-scale building energy modelling (CBEM) workflow was assembled in Grasshopper using Ladybug Tools components to process the aforementioned inputs. In conclusion, this study integrates UAV photogrammetry, GIS-based geomatic algorithms, machine learning, and graphical programming to develop an UAV-CBEM framework. The outcomes establish a foundation for scalable UAV-based building energy assessments, enhancing applicability in data-limited and large-scale settings worldwide."

OpenAlex,deep learning,Unsupervised Deep-learning Methods for Low-dose Computed Tomography Reconstruction,Ran An,10.17638/03194237,2027-01-01,University of Liverpool,"Computed tomography (CT) has become an indispensable imaging technique in medical diagnostics and industrial applications, owing to its non-invasive nature and high resolution in visualizing object internal structures. While X-ray CT (X-ray computed tomography) significantly enhances lesion detection capabilities, excessive exposure to X-ray radiation raises substantial health concerns, including elevated cancer risks and potential genetic damage. Although low-dose CT (LDCT) protocols reduce radiation safety concerns, they inevitably introduce severe noise and artifacts, which might compromise diagnostic accuracy. Recent advances in supervised deep learning approaches have demonstrated remarkable success in LDCT reconstruction. However, the reliance on paired training data severely limits their deployment in practical CT applications. This fundamental constraint highlights the critical importance of developing unsupervised reconstruction methods. Although existing unsupervised LDCT methods have made notable progress, they still face challenges requiring systematic solutions. This thesis makes three contributions to advance the field of unsupervised LDCT reconstruction: 1. Current dual-domain self-supervised LDCT denoising methods typically neglect the heterogeneity of the non-stationary Gaussian noise levels in low-dose sinograms and usually treat them as common images without appropriately controlling the denoising strength. The denoisers employed by them, which are based on classic convolutional neural networks (CNN), will lead to blurring artifacts in the reconstructed images if directly used for sinogram denoising. In addition, the denoising strength in the sinogram and image domains must be well-balanced to avoid introducing over-blurring or secondary artifacts in the reconstructed images, but existing approaches do not focus on this crucial point. To address these limitations, this thesis proposes a novel end-to-end dual-domain self-supervised framework for LDCT denoising. It employs Dropblock layers to adaptively localize the effect of convolution for sinogram denoising and sets a weighted average between the denoised sinograms and their noisy counterparts to better control the denoising strength, thus effectively reducing the blurring artifacts and leading to a well-balanced dual-domain denoising. Numerical experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and superior performance of the proposed method. 2. Existing normalizing flows (NFs)-based unsupervised LDCT reconstruction methods face challenges in both image quality and computational efficiency. On one hand, they typically utilize a two-way transformation strategy between noisy images and latent variables, which could easily lead to detail loss and secondary artifacts in the reconstructed images. On the other hand, training NFs on high-resolution CT images is computationally intensive. Although conditional normalizing flows (CNFs) can mitigate computational costs by learning conditional probabilities, existing approaches rely on labeled data for conditionalization, leaving unsupervised CNFs-based LDCT reconstruction a challenge. To tackle these issues, this thesis proposes a novel unsupervised LDCT iterative reconstruction algorithm based on CNFs. The proposed method employs a strict one-way transformation strategy during the alternating optimization in the dual spaces to prevent detail loss and secondary artifacts, and proposes a novel unsupervised conditionalization strategy for CNFs, thus achieving efficient training and inference on high-resolution images. The proposed method illustrates high-quality and relatively fast unsupervised reconstruction. Experiments across two datasets demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed method by rivaling several state-of-the-art methods. 3. Current diffusion model-based LDCT reconstruction methods solely employ the prior distributions learned from normal-dose CT data but neglect the valuable priors in low-dose data, which contain information about the characteristics of low-dose noise and artifacts. In addition, their reconstruction speed suffers from multiple sampling steps, presenting low efficiency. Breaking new ground in prior utilization, this thesis proposes a novel unsupervised LDCT iterative reconstruction algorithm based on dual denoising diffusion probabilistic models (DDPM), which leverages both normal-dose and low-dose priors. Specifically, the proposed method employs two DDPMs to learn the prior distributions from normal-dose and low-dose images, respectively, and incorporates them into a joint iterative reconstruction framework. To accelerate the reconstruction, partial diffusion sampling and single-pass deterministic reconstruction strategy are utilized in the proposed method, as well as the spaced OS-SART approaches. Experiments at different dose levels demonstrate the outstanding performance and fast speed of the proposed reconstruction algorithm. Through these innovations and contributions, this thesis addresses some significant challenges in current deep-learning-based unsupervised LDCT reconstruction methods, and proposes three novel unsupervised reconstruction algorithms. The proposed methods effectively improve the performance and efficiency of LDCT reconstruction under different unsupervised learning conditions, and provide some new perspectives and inspirations for future research."
OpenAlex,deep learning,From Sparse to Dense: Label-Efficient Weakly Supervised Segmentation for Images and Videos,Jian Wang,10.17638/03195330,2027-01-01,University of Liverpool,"Obtaining high-quality annotated data has become a primary bottleneck for training deep learning models, particularly for dense prediction tasks like semantic segmentation and video salient object segmentation. The demand for meticulous, pixel-level labeling makes fully-supervised approaches prohibitively expensive and limits their scalability. This thesis directly confronts this issue by proposing and systematically investigating a label-efficient ""sparse-to-dense'' paradigm. The core objective is to develop innovative frameworks that can learn from sparse, inexpensive weak supervision—such as image-level tags or scribbles—and intelligently propagate this minimal information to generate complete, pixel-accurate dense predictions. The major part of this thesis focuses on the ""sparse-to-dense'' challenge within Weakly Supervised Semantic Segmentation (WSSS) for images, where models learn from only image-level tags. Dominant approaches rely on Class Activation Maps (CAMs) as initial object seeds. However, CAMs inherently activate only the most discriminative object regions, leading to incomplete pseudo-labels. This gives rise to the central problem of activation densification: the critical process of expanding these sparse activations to cover the full extent of an object. Our research addresses this challenge through a progressive, multi-faceted strategy. Our exploration begins with a foundational framework (C3) designed to rectify the intrinsic flaws of initial CAMs. We propose a synergistic mutual calibration method. This method leverages the discrepancies between the two maps to generate local prototypes, which are simultaneously utilized to complete missing object parts and suppress background noise, yielding a significantly more accurate and complete initial seed. This foundational work immediately reveals the limitation of single-prototype instability and its inability to capture diverse features. Building on this foundation, we then develop architecture-specific strategies to address deeper limitations of the prototype-based approach. For Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) (C4), the use of a single prototype proves insufficient to capture significant intra-class variation. In response, we introduce an Optimal Transport (OT)-assisted framework that effectively mines multiple, diverse prototypes, thereby yielding more comprehensive activation maps. However, while C4 solves the intra-class diversity problem, the inherent local context constraint of the CNN architecture becomes the new bottleneck, fundamentally limiting the quality of globally-aware feature extraction needed for optimal multi-prototype assignment. This limitation necessitates a shift in architectural focus from CNNs to Vision Transformers. In the ViT architecture (C5), a new challenge arises where the token gap between the discriminative class token and varied patch tokens leads to incomplete activation. To bridge this gap, we leverage a tailored application of Optimal Transport, where the algorithm is tasked with learning a comprehensive proxy to ensure complete object activation. Despite these architectural advances (C3-C5), the overall WSSS performance hit a ceiling. This is fundamentally limited by the sparse supervision of class labels, which cannot provide precise boundary information. To break this ceiling, our WSSS exploration culminates in a universal enhancement strategy (C6) that transcends architecture-specific designs by leveraging Visual Foundation Models (VFMs). We resolve the conflict between the discriminative nature of initial CAMs and the VFM's need for holistic prompts. By modeling the CAM foreground as a graph and employing spectral analysis, our method intelligently selects a diverse set of prompt points that represent the overall structure of the foreground object. This guides the VFM to generate superior, boundary-aware supervision that can universally enhance any WSSS pipeline. Subsequently, the thesis extends the ""sparse-to-dense'' paradigm to the dynamic domain of video, addressing Weakly Supervised Video Salient Object Segmentation (WSVSOS) (C7) from sparse scribble annotations. In this specific context, the challenge evolves into spatio-temporal densification, which requires both full-object coverage within each frame and temporal consistency across the video sequences. To this end, we introduce the core CFMR framework, which utilizes Spatio-Temporal co-regulation. This framework is subsequently enhanced (CFMR+) by integrating the VFM guidance strategy from C6, which provides high-quality spatial priors essential for ensuring both high spatial detail and inter-frame consistency. By enforcing both intra-frame and cross-frame consistency between these two streams, our method effectively propagates the sparse initial signal to generate dense and temporally coherent saliency masks. In conclusion, this thesis presents a comprehensive and cohesive investigation into label-efficient segmentation tasks, offering a suite of innovative and effective strategies for the ""sparse-to-dense'' challenge. Our work establishes a progressive roadmap that systematically overcomes architectural and semantic limitations, culminating in highly robust and generalized densification pipelines. Our extensive experimental results on standard benchmarks validate the state-of-the-art performance of these methods, providing robust solutions to a long-standing problem in the computer vision field."

A diferencia de otras plataformas centradas en la visualización del estado actual, la solución propuesta busca anticipar comportamientos futuros, y se plantea como una alternativa abierta, replicable y específicamente orientada a la predicción. Para lograrlo, se ha diseñado una arquitectura modular basada en el lenguaje Python, capaz de integrar múltiples fuentes de datos abiertos: registros históricos del tráfico, datos históricos de situación meteorológica, y coordenadas espaciales de los sensores de medición. El sistema aplica un proceso de limpieza, interpolación temporal y transformación de variables, incluyendo la codificación cíclica del tiempo y la conversión espacial a coordenadas UTM, lo que permite una fusión precisa entre datos geográficos y meteorológicos mediante técnicas como la ponderación por distancia inversa (IDW). El modelo predictivo se basa en una red neuronal LSTM, especialmente adaptada para secuencias temporales multivariables. Se entrena utilizando una estrategia de ventana deslizante a 32 muestras (7 horas y 45 minutos) para predecir la intensidad de tráfico en el siguiente intervalo.

Unlike other platforms focused on visualizing the current state, the proposed solution seeks to anticipate future behaviors, and is positioned as an open, replicable alternative specifically oriented towards prediction. To achieve this, a modular architecture based on the Python language has been designed, capable of integrating multiple open data sources: historical traffic records, historical weather situation data, and spatial coordinates of measurement sensors. The system applies a process of cleaning, temporal interpolation, and variable transformation, including cyclic encoding of time and spatial conversion to UTM coordinates, allowing for precise fusion between geographical and meteorological data through techniques such as inverse distance weighting (IDW). The predictive model is based on an LSTM neural network, especially adapted for multivariate time sequences. It is trained using a sliding window strategy of 32 samples (7 hours and 45 minutes) to predict traffic intensity in the next interval. The system additionally incorporates an IterableDataset mechanism to handle large volumes of training data without compromising the stability of the environment. The obtained results show robust accuracy in validation scenarios, with acceptable prediction errors (MAE and RMSE). Furthermore, an interactive web interface has been developed, allowing for the local deployment of the system, with the capacity for real-time data ingestion and direct visualization of predictions. This work demonstrates the technical and operational feasibility of applying deep learning to urban traffic analysis and lays the groundwork for its future evolution towards more generalizable, robust, and useful systems in real smart city contexts."
OpenAlex,deep learning,Deep Learning-Based Data Hiding Technique for Medical Images,Hadjer SAIDI,,2026-06-26,University of Biskra Theses Repository (University of Biskra),"This thesis introduces novel deep learning-based frameworks for secure medical image steganography, addressing the critical challenge of protecting sensitive patient information while preserving diagnostic quality. Medical images present unique security requirements due to their dual nature: containing both critical visual data for diagnosis and sensitive patient metadata, which conventional steganographic techniques do not adequately address. Our work presents two complementary approaches to this challenge. First, we develop a Mask-RCNN based framework that intelligently identifies diagnostically insignificant regions within medical images for strategic data embedding. By combining this regionaware detection with Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) embedding in the frequency domain, our method achieves remarkable imperceptibility with Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR) values exceeding 115 dB while maintaining high payload capacity. Second, we propose a clinical quality-aware convolutional neural network architecture that leverages an encoder-decoder framework for end-to-end steganography. This approach employs parallel processing paths with scaled residual learning to embed secret medical images within cover images while preserving diagnostic features. Extensive experimentation across multiple medical imaging modalities (CT, MRI) from datasets including MIDRC-RICORD-1B, and IQ-OTH/NCCD, demonstrates that our method achieves a good trade-off between payload and imperceptibility. The frameworks developed in this thesis achieve an optimal balance between embedding capacity, imperceptibility, and robust secret recovery, providing healthcare institutions with effective tools for safeguarding patient privacy while maintaining the integrity of medical diagnostics. This work significantly advances the field of medical image security and establishes a foundation for future innovations in secure healthcare information systems."
OpenAlex,deep learning,A Novel Deep-Learning-Based Approach for Estimating High-Resolution InSAR Parameters,"Dell Amore, Luca; Carcereri, Daniel; Demir, Begüm; Rizzoli, Paola",,2026-06-01,elib (German Aerospace Center),"Nowadays, SAR Interferometry (InSAR) represents one of the most powerful tools to perform complex tasks, such as retrieving Earth’s surface topography and monitoring its deformations. However, denoising strategies are crucial for the generation of reliable and high-quality InSAR products. In this framework, we propose a complete and generalized theoretical and statistical model to physically describe and simulate a noise-free interferogram, together with its corresponding noisy version, starting from the knowledge of the InSAR acquisition geometry and of the underlying topography. A deep-learning-based model is then trained in a fully-supervised manner to estimate high-resolution InSAR parameters, i.e. coherence and interferometric phase, leveraging the proposed statistical model. In particular, an accurate assessment of the network’s estimation performance is conducted by comparing it to state-of-the-art denoising filters, such as Boxcar and Phi-Net and showing the added value of the proposed theoretical modifications to the state-of-the-art literature."
