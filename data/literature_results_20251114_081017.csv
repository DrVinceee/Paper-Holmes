Because of the severe shortage of donors, a ventricular assist device (VAD) is necessary as a bridge to heart transplantation. However, reports on VAD implantation for cardiomyopathy in Danon disease patients are limited. Herein, we report a successful pediatric case with nearly 800-day of biventricular assistance as a bridge to heart transplantation. A 12-year-old girl with severe heart failure due to hypertrophic cardiomyopathy associated with Danon disease underwent left implantation of a Heartware VAD (Heartware Inc., Miami Lakes, FL, USA). Owing to severe right ventricular failure, she was unable to be weaned off the cardiopulmonary bypass, and a right VAD implantation was undertaken using a Gyro pump (Kyosera, Kyoto, Japan). However, the right ventricular function did not recover postoperatively, and she subsequently underwent right implantation of a Heartware VAD on postoperative day 34. Despite several VAD-related complications, including aortic and pulmonary valve insufficiency and a driveline infection requiring hospitalization, the patient was able to attend junior high school during the waiting period for a heart transplantation. After a total waiting period of 882 days, including 791 days of biventricular Heartware VAD assistance, the patient underwent a heart transplantation."

This study evaluated outcomes of aortic root replacement (ARR) when valve preservation was initially intended, irrespective of the eventual procedural success.
We retrospectively reviewed patients who underwent ARR (VSRR or Bentall) between 2002 and 2023, excluding those with aortic stenosis, prior AVR, endocarditis, or partial root replacement. Patients were categorized as single-clamp VSRR (S-VSRR, n=251), multiple-clamp VSRR (M-VSRR, n=16), failed VSRR (F-VSRR, n=10), and primary Bentall (n=548).
VSRR was unsuccessful, or required multiple cross-clamp attempts in 9.4% of cases. Failure occurred in 1.0% of aneurysm and 2.5% of dissection cases (p=0.28). Bentall patients were older (58 ± 14 years) than S-VSRR (48.2 ± 14.2 years) and M-VSRR (48 ± 13 years; p < 0.01). Preoperative severe AR was most frequent in F-VSRR (70%). Preservation succeeded in 83% with moderate-to-severe AR versus 89% with none-to-mild AR. Leaflet repair was more common in M-VSRR (43.8%) than S-VSRR (19.5%; p=0.02). In unadjusted analysis, F-VSRR was associated with more bleeding-related reoperations and longer ICU and hospital stays. At follow-up, 85.6% of S-VSRR and 68.7% of M-VSRR had none-to-mild AR. Mortality and reoperation rates were low across groups.
VSRR was technically challenging or unsuccessful in about 10% of cases, especially with advanced AR. Although mid-term survival and valve durability were comparable, these patients may experience higher perioperative morbidity, underscoring the need for careful patient selection and intraoperative judgement."

PubMed,aortic stenosis,Managing The Mitral Valve In HCM Surgery: Tips And Tricks.,Sara Ranchordás; Miguel Abecasis; Eduard Quintana,10.48729/pjctvs.574,2025-11-13,Portuguese journal of cardiac thoracic and vascular surgery,"Mitral regurgitation (MR) in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) patients is mainly due to systolic anterior motion (SAM) of the mitral valve (MV). However, other mechanisms contributing to mitral regurgitation may coexist as a result of further structural abnormalities. SAM might occur because of the increased septal thickness alone or due to simultaneous MV or subvalvular apparatus anomalies, such as mitral leaflet elongation, papillary muscle body anomalies, accessory papillary muscles or additional papillary muscle heads. Additionally, anomalous mitral chordae or the recently described mitral-aortic discontinuity (leading to a longer anterior mitral leaflet (AML)) can contribute to abnormal physiology. A closed aortomitral angle may also contribute. During intraoperative echocardiographic assessment, it is important to thoroughly evaluate the MV and the regurgitant jet to understand the mechanism(s) that cause MR in HCM patients. Although myectomy alone is frequently enough to correct SAM, concomitant MV procedures may be needed, especially when the septum is thin (<16-18 mm) and/or there is intrinsic MV disease. Detection of concomitant regurgitation mechanisms beyond SAM can eventually be identified preoperatively, either by direct structural detection (valve prolapse), by pharmacological palliation of SAM with vasopressors and negative inotropic agents or suspected by identification of anteriorly and centrally directed regurgitant mitral jets. Surgical techniques that can be employed to contribute to SAM elimination include plication/extension/retention plasty of the AML, resection/release/reorientation of papillary muscles, division of anomalous chordae, edge-to-edge repair, or, at times, prosthetic MV replacement. If there is structural MV disease concomitant to HCM, appropriately tailored techniques to address the MV may be used. Transoesophageal echocardiography at the end of the procedure should demonstrate elimination of SAM, resolution of LVOT obstruction, and appropriate coaptation of the MV leaflets and nearly resolution of MR. Provocation with inotropes can be used to ensure no latent obstruction persists."

Case reports,"Double aortic arch (DAA) is a rare congenital vascular anomaly that is typically diagnosed in infancy. In adult patients undergoing transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR), an undetected DAA can present unique anatomical and procedural challenges.
A 71-year-old woman with end-stage renal disease and severe aortic stenosis was incidentally found to have a DAA during preprocedural TAVR evaluation. The device was inserted via the right femoral artery, as it provided the largest vessel diameter and most favorable anatomy for device passage. The pronounced curvature of the aortic arch created an unfavorable anatomy that hindered advancement of the delivery system, even with multiple attempts using a double-stiff wire technique. Ultimately, a snare-assisted approach enabled successful navigation and valve deployment. The patient later developed postprocedural stroke, and the use of cerebral embolic protection was limited by her complex arch anatomy.
This case highlights the critical role of comprehensive imaging and individualized procedural planning in managing rare vascular anomalies during TAVR. It provides practical insight into overcoming severe arch tortuosity with snare-assisted techniques, offering educational value for interventionalists encountering similar structural challenges.
Snare-assisted techniques offer a practical solution for TAVR in patients with complex arch anatomy when standard approaches fail."

Cardiothoracic imaging,"Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) requires multimodality imaging for accurate diagnosis, risk assessment, and management strategies. Echocardiography serves as the primary imaging tool, evaluating left ventricular wall thickness, outflow tract gradients, and mitral valve morphology. It provides essential diagnostic information and guides treatment decisions, with stress echocardiography particularly valuable for detecting dynamic gradients in obstructive HCM and supporting preoperative planning for interventions such as myectomy. Cardiovascular MRI complements echocardiography through superior resolution, enabling detailed assessment of myocardial mass, flow dynamics, and comprehensive tissue characterization. Late gadolinium enhancement and extracellular volume measurements enhance prognostic evaluation and risk stratification. Cardiac MRI excels at helping distinguish HCM from phenocopies like infiltrative or storage diseases and detecting myocardial disarray, microvascular dysfunction, and abnormalities in myocardial metabolism. Nuclear imaging proves crucial for identifying HCM phenocopies, including transthyretin amyloidosis and sarcoidosis, providing specific diagnostic capabilities. Cardiac CT, while having a secondary diagnostic role, becomes invaluable for evaluating coronary anatomy in patients considered for septal reduction therapies, ensuring comprehensive preoperative assessment. This integrated multimodal approach provides comprehensive HCM evaluation, enabling precise diagnosis, robust risk stratification, and individualized treatment planning. Each modality contributes unique strengths that collectively enhance clinical decision-making and optimize patient outcomes in this complex myocardial disease.

We report the case of a male patient in his 70s with recurrent melena and profound anemia requiring multiple transfusions. Extensive initial investigations, including gastroscopy and colonoscopy, failed to identify a bleeding source. The diagnosis was suspected after echocardiography confirmed critical AS and was later confirmed by capsule endoscopy, which revealed bleeding small bowel angiodysplasia. Instead of pursuing direct endoscopic treatment of the angiodysplasia, the decision was made to address the underlying cause with transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI). Following the procedure, the patient's hemoglobin stabilized, and subsequent enteroscopy confirmed resolution of the angiodysplasia. This case highlights that in patients with AS and obscure GIB, maintaining a high index of suspicion for Heyde's syndrome is crucial. It demonstrates that timely intervention with TAVI can serve as a definitive treatment by resolving the bleeding diathesis through correction of the shear-stress platelet insult and underscores the importance of a multidisciplinary approach between cardiology and gastroenterology to achieve optimal patient outcomes."

This study investigated whether the Hemoglobin-Geriatric Nutritional Risk Index (H-GNRI) could predict major adverse cardiovascular events (MACEs) after TAVI. Methods: Patients who underwent TAVI at a single institution were classified into three groups according to their H-GNRI scores: low-risk (H-GNRI score = two), intermediate-risk (H-GNRI score = one), and high-risk (H-GNRI score = zero). The primary outcome was the occurrence of MACEs post-TAVI, and Kaplan-Meier survival and Cox proportional-hazard analyses were performed. Results: Of the 205 patients analyzed, 123, 67, and 15 were assigned H-GNRI scores of two, one, and zero. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis revealed that patients with H-GNRI scores of one and zero developed significantly more MACEs than those with a score of two (log-rank p = 0.0030; 1 vs. 2, p = 0.0032; 0 vs. 2, p = 0.0077). In the Cox proportional-hazard analysis, factors associated with MACEs included H-GNRI score (using score two as reference; score one: hazard ratio [HR] = 2.02, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.10-3.60, p = 0.021; score 0: HR = 2.67, 95% CI = 1.10-6.44, p = 0.028), procedure time (HR = 1.00; 95% CI = 1.00-1.01; p = 0.0093), and length of hospital stay after TAVI (HR = 1.02; 95% CI = 1.01-1.04, p = 0.0003). Conclusions: Preoperative H-GNRI scores were markedly associated with the incidence of postoperative MACEs in patients undergoing TAVI."

This article aims to present our institutional approach, supported by the current literature, in managing several challenging anatomical scenarios. We focus on seven high-impact scenarios-bicuspid aortic valve (BAV), hostile transfemoral access, iliofemoral/aortic tortuosity, adverse aortic angulation, heavy annulus/Left Ventricular Outflow Tract (LVOT) calcification, small annulus, and risk of coronary obstruction-and propose a practical approach to minimize the risk of complications. In BAV, current generation transcatheter heart valves (THV) achieve favorable early outcomes when sizing accounts for supra-annular constraints and implantation depth is tailored. Transfemoral access remains dominant in contemporary registries, yet a meaningful minority of cases require adjunctive peripheral vascular intervention to enable THV delivery-system passage. In case of annulus or LVOT calcification, small annuli, complex aortic anatomy, high risk for coronary obstruction, and pre-procedural Computed Tomography (CT) allow for an accurate sizing of THV and tailored procedural planning. A structured, CT-driven pathway that links anatomic findings to specific facilitation and bailout steps can standardize decision-making and improve safety across these challenging scenarios. We strongly highlight the importance to build a network where most complex procedures are carried out in Valve Centers where expert operators are trained to manage high volume, high complexity, and difficult complications."

Surgical aortic valve replacement (SAVR) remains the standard therapy, while transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) is increasingly adopted across a broader range of risk profiles due to accumulating evidence and advancements in device technology. Observational registries and early trial data indicate that TAVI is technically feasible in selected BAV anatomies, with device-success rates exceeding 90%. Nonetheless, bicuspid morphology is still technically demanding, with several possible pitfalls during transcatheter procedure and pre-procedural planning compared with tricuspid valve. The rates of moderate-to-severe paravalvular leak (PVL), permanent pacemaker implantation (PPI), and annular complications remain high, especially in the presence of extensive calcifications with raphe or tapered roots, underscoring the importance of meticulous multimodality imaging, dedicated sizing algorithms, and device-specific strategies. Long-term durability signals are encouraging but remain limited, underlining the need for prospective trials with extended follow-up. This review summarizes current knowledge on BAV anatomy and its management, exploring the available evidence supporting the role of transcatheter approach in this challenging and unique scenario."

This therapy was initially reserved for those at high or prohibitive surgical risk but is now firmly established across all surgical risk categories. Its non-inferiority to surgical aortic valve replacement has been demonstrated even in low-risk populations, supporting the rapid worldwide expansion of its use. Nevertheless, despite procedural refinements and the advent of newer-generation prostheses, conduction disturbances leading to permanent pacemaker implantation (PPI) remain one of the most frequent and clinically relevant complications. Reported incidence ranges between 8% and 20% depending on prosthesis type, implantation technique, and baseline patient characteristics. Multiple clinical, anatomical, and procedural factors have been identified as strong predictors of post-TAVR conduction disturbances. Taken together, the integration of anatomical and clinical risk assessment, precise procedural planning, careful device selection, structured monitoring, and emerging therapeutic strategies constitutes a comprehensive, evidence-based approach to reduce the burden of conduction disturbances following TAVR. Such a multimodal framework has the potential not only to lower the incidence of permanent pacemaker implantation but also to improve safety, optimize healthcare resource utilization, and support the broader adoption of TAVR in increasingly younger and lower-risk patient populations."

The management of asymptomatic severe AS remains challenging and requires a tailored, patient-specific approach. Optimal timing of intervention in asymptomatic patients continues to be a matter of ongoing debate. In individuals with severe AS and reduced left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF), both the ESC/EACTS and ACC/AHA guidelines recommend aortic valve replacement (AVR), regardless of symptom status. In contrast, for patients with preserved LVEF (≥50%), the decision to proceed with AVR must be individualized and based on a comprehensive risk assessment. Risk stratification plays a central role in guiding early intervention strategies and should incorporate clinical findings, echocardiographic parameters, biomarkers, and advanced imaging techniques such as cardiac magnetic resonance and computed tomography. Recent randomized controlled trials have yielded mixed results regarding the mortality benefit of early AVR but have consistently demonstrated a reduction in heart failure-related hospitalizations. Timely intervention in carefully selected high-risk patients may improve long-term outcomes, while avoiding unnecessary procedures in lower-risk individuals remains equally important."

Valvular interstitial cells (VICs) from female and male donors were isolated and exposed to pro-calcifying medium (PM), and the expression of matrix gla protein (MGP), fibronectin (FN1) and bone morphogenic protein 2 (BMP2) was analyzed. The effect of sex hormones on hydroxyapatite (HA) deposition by VICs was also analyzed. Exposure to PM increased MGP gene expression in male (n = 5, +5.8-fold, p = 0.031), and female VICs (n = 6, +4.9-fold, p = 0.004). In female VICs a +3.5-fold MGP increase accompanied the transition from the fibrotic to the calcific phase (p = 0.022 vs. males) while in male VICs the increase was delayed to the calcific phase. Female VICs upregulated FN1 (+1.8-fold, p = 0.003), while male VICs upregulated BMP2 (+3.7-fold, p = 0.05). 5α-dihydrotestosterone increased HA deposition +6.3-fold in male and +5.2-fold in female VICs (p ≤ 0.001 and p < 0.04, respectively).

Female VICs decreased HA deposition when exposed to progesterone (-2.4-fold, p = 0.037 vs. PM) and estrogen (-2.0-fold, p = 0.072). In summary, VICs show donor-sex-specific gene expression which is modifiable by 5α-dihydrotestosterone. This needs to be considered when designing in vitro regulatory studies."

Echocardiography results also showed that compared with atic-/- zebrafish hearts, in wild-type zebrafish hearts, the ejection fraction was significantly reduced, shortening fraction was reduced, and ventricular wall thickness was significantly increased. Meanwhile, aerobic exercise intervention in atic-/- zebrafish showed that aerobic exercise effectively improved the symptoms of HCM and improved cardiac function in atic-/- zebrafish hearts. Transcriptome sequencing results showed that aerobic exercise improved the symptoms of HCM in atic-/- zebrafish hearts involving the calcium signaling pathway, Apelin signaling pathway and ECM-receptor interaction. The q-PCR results of key differential genes involved in these pathways further confirmed that aerobic exercise could bring beneficial effects to atic-/- zebrafish. In conclusion, this study found that the loss of ATIC can lead to hypertrophic cardiomyopathy in zebrafish, and aerobic exercise intervention can effectively improve the hypertrophic pathological characteristics of atic-/- zebrafish hearts, providing new intervention targets and effective lifestyle interventions for HCM."

While transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) and endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR) have become established minimally invasive treatments for high-risk patients, simultaneous management of both conditions remains rare. Case Presentation: We report the first documented case in Serbia of a simultaneous TAVR and EVAR in a 75-year-old male with severe symptomatic AS and AAA. The patient had a history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus, atrial fibrillation, prior radiofrequency pulmonary vein ablation, and pacemaker implantation. Echocardiography demonstrated severe AS with a transvalvular gradient of 116/61 mmHg, an aortic valve area of 0.6 cm2, and a left ventricular ejection fraction of 30-35%. Coronary angiography revealed 50-60% stenosis of the right coronary artery. Following evaluation by a multidisciplinary Heart and Vascular Team, a combined procedure was performed under general anesthesia via bilateral femoral access. TAVR with a Medtronic Evolut R valve was successfully deployed, followed by EVAR with satisfactory stent graft positioning and angiographic results. The patient's postoperative course was uneventful, and he was discharged on the ninth day. At six-month follow-up, echocardiography showed optimal valve function, and CT identified a type II endoleak, which was managed conservatively. Conclusions: This case demonstrates the feasibility and safety of simultaneous TAVR and EVAR in a high-risk elderly patient, emphasizing the importance of careful preoperative planning and a coordinated multidisciplinary approach. Further studies are warranted to establish standardized guidelines for the management of patients with coexisting severe AS and AAA."

However, the prognostic value of cystatin-C remains unidentified in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) patients. The objective of this study was to investigate whether serum cystatin-C could predict all-cause mortality independently in HCM patients.
Data from 456 HCM patients treated at West China Hospital were collected and stratified into two groups based on the median baseline serum cystatin-C level. All-cause mortality was the primary outcome. Cox regression models were used to analyze the association between cystatin-C levels and mortality risk.
A total of 90 deaths were recorded over a median follow-up period of 4.67 years. Patients with higher cystatin-C levels had an increased risk of all-cause mortality (adjusted hazard ratio (HR): 2.11, 95% CI [1.30-3.42], p = 0.003) compared to those with lower levels. Time-dependent area under the curves (AUC) of cystatin-C in different time points, ranging from initial measurement to follow-up, showed a relatively stable fluctuation between 0.70 and 0.80. In comparison, the commonly used renal function markers, estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) and serum creatinine, yielded lower AUC values. Restricted cubic spline curves showed that with median value of cystatin-C (1.01 mg/L) as reference, there was a gradual rise in risk of all-cause mortality with cystatin-C increasing. Subgroup analyses in female, in the patients ≥ 58 years old, and in the patients with eGFR ≥ 60 mL/min/1.73 m2 consistently confirmed robustness of the main findings.
Elevated serum cystatin-C levels are associated with a higher risk of all-cause mortality in HCM patients, providing valuable prognostic information beyond traditional renal function markers such as eGFR and serum creatinine."

The aim of present work is to study the relation of&#x0D; weight of the heart with age and weight of cadaver.&#x0D; Material and Methods: The study was performed in the Department of Anatomy, Shri Ram&#x0D; Murti Smarak Institute of Medical Sciences, Bareilly on 30 hearts from embalmed cadavers.&#x0D; The hearts were procured from the cadavers available in our department. The heart was&#x0D; thoroughly cleaned and measurements were taken.&#x0D; Results: The mean heart weight was 223.37 ± 57.78 g. Significant relationship between age of&#x0D; the cadaver and weight of the heart (p=0.0004), weight of cadaver and weight of heart&#x0D; (p=0.0001) was observed.&#x0D; Conclusion: The above study provides valuable data of the heart in our geographical location,&#x0D; which may be useful for cardiac surgeons and physicians."

OpenAlex,mitral regurgitation,Characterization of Left Ventricular Hemodynamic Forces in Mitral Regurgitation Using 4-Dimensional-Flow Magnetic Resonance Imaging,Monisha Ghosh Srabanti; Ali Fatehi Hassanabad; Lyes Kadem; Julio García,10.1177/30494826251395620,2025-11-13,Journal of the Heart Valve Society,"Background: Mitral regurgitation (MR) is one of the most common valvular heart diseases. Despite the recognized importance of hemodynamic force (HDF) in cardiology, its exploration in MR has been limited. Therefore, using a retrospective observational study design, we aimed to investigate the potential of noninvasively assessed systolic and diastolic HDF derived from 4-dimensional-flow magnetic resonance imaging (4D-flow MRI) as markers for determining MR. Method: The study cohort included 15 controls (19-61 years) and 26 MR patients (20 with primary and 6 cases with secondary MR, 33-75 years) classified into trivial-to-severe MR through cardiac MRI. The 3 T/4D-flow MRI sequence was used to assess left ventricular (LV) HDF (integral of intraventricular pressure gradients over the LV cavity) in 3 directions (lateral-septal, inferior-anterior, and apical-basal) using “Segment,” v2.2 R6410. Results: A negative coefficient for peak-systolic apical-basal HDF corresponded to decreased ejection fraction (β = −8.1, SE = 3.3, t = −2.5, P = .03), and a positive association was found between LV mass index and peak-systolic apical-basal HDF (β = 25.6, SE = 11.1, t = 2.3, P = .04). Peak-systolic apical-basal and E-wave apical-basal (diastolic HDF at E-wave time point) HDF emerged as significant predictors in detecting severe MR (Estimate = 2.2, P = .007; Estimate = 1.8, P = .015, respectively). The peak-systolic apical-basal HDF was also notably correlated with age in moderate-severe MR ( r = 0.88, P = .022). Conclusion: Mitral regurgitation affects early diastolic filling and peak systolic ejection, indicated by peak-systolic and E-wave HDF in the apical-basal direction, offering insights into dynamic flow patterns and LV remodeling. Hemodynamic force analysis could enhance risk stratification and guide therapeutic decisions, complementing traditional diagnostic methods for improved MR management."
OpenAlex,mitral regurgitation,Mitral Annular Disjunction Assessed Using Cardiac MR Imaging in Pediatric Patients,Şükriye Yılmaz; Berna Uçan; Hasan Bulut; Senem ÖZGÜR; Tamer YOLDAŞ; Pelin Altınbezer,10.3390/diagnostics15222857,2025-11-12,Diagnostics,"Background/Objectives: Mitral annular disorders constitute a heterogeneous group of structural abnormalities that can significantly influence morbidity and mortality in both adult and pediatric populations. Advances in cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) imaging have refined the ability to characterize these disorders with high spatial resolution and reproducibility. Among them, mitral annular disjunction (MAD) and mitral valve prolapse (MVP) have emerged as interrelated entities implicated in valvular dysfunction, arrhythmogenesis, and myocardial remodeling. This study aimed to determine the prevalence of MAD in a pediatric cohort, explore its association with MVP, and delineate related CMR findings, including myocardial fibrosis. Methods: A retrospective review was conducted in 295 pediatric patients who underwent clinically indicated CMR between September 2022 and June 2025. Echocardiographic and CMR data were systematically compared for the detection of MAD, MVP, and mitral regurgitation (MR). MAD length and mitral annular measurements were obtained from two-chamber and left ventricular outflow tract (LVOT) cine sequences. Late gadolinium enhancement (LGE) was evaluated to identify myocardial fibrosis. Results: MAD was detected more frequently by means of CMR than echocardiography (23.2% vs. 9.3%), as was MVP (34.2% vs. 22.4%), whereas MR was more often observed on echocardiography (31.2% vs. 15.2%). Inter-modality agreement was moderate for MAD, moderate-to-substantial for MVP, and fair for MR. LGE was identified only in patients with concomitant MAD and MVP, suggesting limited myocardial involvement in isolated MAD. Conclusions: CMR demonstrates superior sensitivity in detecting MAD and MVP compared with echocardiography and allows for early recognition of systolic–diastolic annular dissociation before advanced myocardial remodeling occurs. These findings underscore the clinical utility of CMR as a complementary modality for comprehensive assessment, risk stratification, and follow-up of pediatric patients with suspected mitral annular abnormalities."

Babu Peter; Tamil Selvan; S Hariharan; S Naveen,10.25259/crcr_112_2025,2025-11-12,Case Reports in Clinical Radiology,"The aortomitral intervalvular fibrosa (AMIVF) is a thin, avascular structure that lies between the anterior mitral leaflet and the non-coronary cusp of the aortic valve. It is particularly susceptible to infection and mechanical insult, making it a rare site for pseudoaneurysm formation. Among the various causes, tuberculosis is an exceedingly uncommon etiology, especially in immunocompromised patients. We report the case of a 27-year-old retroviral-positive male who presented with shortness of breath, palpitations, and hemoptysis. Initial echocardiography revealed a pseudoaneurysm at the aortomitral continuity with severe mitral and aortic regurgitation. Subsequent computed tomography (CT) aortogram confirmed the presence of a contrast-filled pseudoaneurysmal sac protruding into the left atrium. Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) further delineated the anatomy, showing a cystic structure arising between the aortic and mitral valves, compressing the left atrium and confirming the diagnosis. The patient underwent surgical aneurysm resection and aortic valve replacement. Histopathology and cultures revealed Mycobacterium tuberculosis as the causative agent. Pseudoaneurysms of the AMIVF are rare but clinically significant. In immunocompromised individuals, tuberculosis should be considered a potential etiology. Multimodal imaging, including echocardiography, CT, and MRI, is crucial for timely and accurate diagnosis. Early surgical intervention is often required to prevent catastrophic complications such as rupture or fistula formation."

Myocardial work derived from noninvasive pressure‐strain loop is a novel and promising afterload‐independent approach to evaluate LV performance. We hypothesized that it may provide diagnostic and prognostic utility in these patients. This study aimed to evaluate myocardial work parameters in patients with significant primary mitral regurgitation, and explore their association with postinterventional LV ejection fraction and clinical composite events. Methods The study prospectively enrolled 180 patients with severe primary mitral regurgitation at baseline and patients were followed up for postinterventional LV function (&gt;12 months) and clinical events (24.0 [23.3–24.6] months). Logistic regression and Cox proportional hazards regression analyses were performed as appropriate. Results Compared with patients exhibiting postinterventional LV ejection fraction ≥50%, individuals with LV ejection fraction &lt;50% demonstrated lower LV global longitudinal strain, global work index (GWI), global constructive work (GCW), and global work efficiency ( P &lt;0.001 for all) and higher global wasted work ( P =0.001). Preinterventional LV global longitudinal strain, GWI, GCW, and global work efficiency were independent predictors of postinterventional LV dysfunction ( P &lt;0.05 for all). The predictive power of logistic regression models comprising LV global longitudinal strain, GWI, and GCW were similar but stronger than the model comprising LV ejection fraction. Preinterventional LV global longitudinal strain, GWI, GCW, and global work efficiency were independently associated with the risk of composite clinical events during follow‐up ( P &lt;0.001 for all). Conclusions Myocardial work parameters, especially GWI, GCW, and global work efficiency, are independent predictors of postinterventional LV dysfunction and are associated with the occurrence of postinterventional clinical composite events."

Methods Using Danish nationwide registries, we identified patients undergoing first-time mitral valve intervention for MR during the period 1996-2022. Patients were categorized as frail or non-frail based on the Hospital Frailty Risk Score. We assessed one-year mortality with the reverse Kaplan-Meier estimator and adjusted comparison were computed using multivariable adjusted Cox regression analysis. A composite outcome of death or time in hospital &amp;gt;14 days within one year was examined using multivariable adjusted logistic regression analysis. Results A total of 7,000 patients (90.0%) were considered non-frail (median age 67.0 years, 66.3% male) and 782 (10.0%) were considered frail (median age 71.0 years, 56.3% male). One-year mortality was 8.2% among non-frail patients and 13.4% among frail patients (p-value &amp;lt;0.0001), but no statistically significant difference was observed, HR=1.16 (95% CI: 0.88-1.54, reference: non-frail patients) in the adjusted analysis. Within the first year after mitral valve intervention, 42.8% of non-frail patients were never admitted, 42.1% were admitted for 1-14 days, 6.2% for 14-28 days, and 5.1% for &amp;gt;28 days. Among frail patients, the corresponding proportions were 26.6%, 46.3%, 9.1%, and 9.8%. In the adjusted analysis, frail-patients were associated with higher odds of the composite outcome, OR=1.65 (95% CI: 1.37-2.00). Conclusion Frail patients were associated with more time spent in hospital within the first year following surgery compared with non-frail patients, but no statistically significant difference was found in the one-year mortality according to frailty status in adjusted analysis."

However, data on the prevalence of PH-LHD analyzed systematically using a contemporary diagnostic framework are lacking. Methods and Results We performed a systematic literature search including patients with heart failure with preserved or reduced ejection fraction (HFpEF, HFrEF), mitral regurgitation (MR) or aortic stenosis (AS) in three Western European countries (Austria, Germany, Switzerland; total population ∼102 Million in 2024). Studies reporting peak tricuspid regurgitation velocity (TRV) from echocardiography or mean pulmonary arterial pressure (mPAP) from right heart catheterization were included. We used a two-strata system to classify PH-LHD: ‘at-risk’ (TRV &amp;gt;2.8m/s) or ‘manifest’ (TRV &amp;gt;3.4m/s in combination with mPAP &amp;gt;20mmHg, to account for RHC referral bias). Meta-analysis was performed using a generalized linear mixed model. From N=123 reports including 51,333 patients, there were N=34, N=17, N=39, and N=37 studies focusing on HFpEF, HFrEF, aortic stenosis and mitral regurgitation, respectively. PH prevalence estimates based on TRV &amp;gt;2.8 m/s for patients with established HFpEF, HFrEF, aortic stenosis and mitral regurgitation were 62% (95%CI: 49-74%), 66% (95%CI: 57-74%), 73% (95%CI: 68-78%) and 80% (95%CI: 76-83%), respectively, and 20% (95%CI: 7-33%), 34% (95%CI: 24-43%), 38% (95%CI: 31-45%) and 54% (95%CI: 49-59%) when using TRV &amp;gt;3.4m/s in combination with mPAP &amp;gt;20mmHg, respectively. Extrapolation resulted in 2,287 (95%CI:1,770-2,804)/100,000 individuals ‘at risk’ and 805 (95%CI:325-1,285)/100,000 individuals with ‘manifest’ PH associated with heart failure (HFpEF and HFrEF combined). In addition, 712 (95%CI:637-787)/100,000 individuals and 413 (95%CI:347-480)/100,000 individuals had ‘at risk’ and ‘manifest’ PH associated with AS or MR, respectively. These collective data suggest that ∼2.7% of the population have ‘at risk’ and ∼1.0% ‘manifest’ PH-LHD in Austria, Germany and Switzerland in 2024. Conclusions The prevalence of PH in patients with from LHD is considerable, although estimates vary by cardiac subtype and specificity of diagnostic criteria. These data warrant prospective studies emphasizing focus on PH detection and management for people with LHD, particularly heart failure."

However, the long-term effects of functional tricuspid regurgitation (FTR) on AF recurrence and the improvement of TR after radiofrequency catheter ablation (RFCA) remain unclear. Methods This retrospective, single-center observational study involved 1,690 patients with persistent atrial fibrillation (PsAF) who underwent AF ablation between January 2012 and June 2022. 153 paients with significant FTR were propensity matching 153 patients with no or mild FTR based on age, body mass index, and mitral regurgitation (MR) severity. Patients were followed up for at least 1 year. Procedural success was defined as freedom from any atrial tachyarrhythmia (&amp;gt;30 s) after the 3-month blanking period, off antiarrhythmic drugs. Significant FTR was defined as moderate to severe TR. Significant TR improvement was defined as a reduction in TR severity by ≥2 grades from pre- to post-ablation. Results Among the observational cohort, 153 patients (9.1%) had significant FTR, the severity of which correlated with female sex, AF duration, atrial/ventricular remodeling, and NT-proBNP levels. During the 12-month follow-up, the procedural success rate was 67.6% (207/306). RFCA significantly reduced the proportion of RA and RV enlargement ( P &amp;lt; 0.001), and improved the severity of FTR ( P &amp;lt; 0.001). Logistic regression analyses showed that AF recurrence [odds ratio (OR) 18.244, 95% CI 7.500–52.427, P &amp;lt; 0.001]) was the strongest independent risk factor for non-significant TR improvement after ablation. After a mean follow-up of 5.3 ± 3.7 years, the overall procedural success rate was 47.4% (145/306). The overall success rate was significantly lower in patients with significant FTR compared to those with no or mild FTR (37.3% VS 57.5%, P &amp;lt; 0.001). A comparable difference was observed between ventricular FTR and no or atrial FTR (27.1% VS 53.4%, P &amp;lt; 0.001). Conclusions Significant FTR was an independent predictor of AF recurrence in patients with PsAF undergoing RFCA. The long-term success was poor in the subgroups of significant FTR and those with ventricular FTR. Furthermore, successful RFCA was associated with significantly improved FTR in patients with PsAF."

Oikonomou; Rohan Khera,10.1101/2025.11.04.25339526,2025-11-06,bioRxiv (Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory),"ABSTRACT Background The scientific literature on artificial intelligence-enabled electrocardiography (AI-ECG) has defined a robust performance of AI models in detecting and predicting several structural heart disorders (SHDs) using ECGs. However, as a diagnostic test, the real-world clinical utility of AI-ECG reliability requires the consistency of its results when repeated under similar conditions. Aim To evaluate the reliability of AI-ECG models for different ECGs for the same person, across different diagnostic labels, and using varied modeling approaches. Methods We used ECG images (2000-2024) from 5 hospitals and an outpatient network within a large, integrated US health system. For each individual, we identified multiple ECGs recorded within a 30-day period. We evaluated 7 models: 6 convolutional neural networks (CNNs) trained to detect individual SHDs, including LV systolic dysfunction, left valve diseases and severe LVH; an ensemble XGBoost integrating individual CNNs as a composite screen for multiple SHDs. We used concordance correlation coefficient (CCC), Spearman correlation, Cohen’s kappa, and percent agreement in binary screen status to test model reliability. We evaluated factors associated with different AI-ECG outputs (Δ probability&gt; 0.5) and assessed stability across ECG layouts (digital, printed, photo). Results Across sites, we identified 1,118,263 ECG pairs, with a median 1 (1-3) days between ECGs. The ensemble XGBoost had the higher test-retest correlation (CCC: 0.89-0.92) and agreement (kappa: 0.75-0.82) between pairs compared with CNNs (CCC: 0.78-0.88; kappa: 0.57-0.72). After adjusting for demographics, ECG pairs that included one or both inpatient ECG were significantly more likely to yield unstable predictions (ORs: 1.60 [1.50-1.70] and 1.91 [1.78-2.05], respectively) compared with pairs with both ECGs obtained in outpatient settings. Among outpatient pairs across sites, the XGBoost model had a CCC of 0.89-0.94, a Spearman correlation of 0.90-0.94, and a kappa of 0.78-0.84, with concordance rates of 89-92%. Notably, ensemble model predictions were also stable across different ECG layouts. Conclusion An ensemble AI-ECG model integrating multiple CNN predictions had higher reliability compared with models for individual disorders. Discordance was more common in inpatient ECGs, suggesting instability in high-acuity settings. Reliable ensemble AI-ECG model outputs support readiness for clinical implementation for SHD screening.

This ratio may reflect the proportional or disproportionate burden of regurgitation on the left atrium. To address this gap, we aimed to investigate the association between the regurgitant volume (RVol)/LAV ratio and clinical outcomes in patients with VFMR, using data from a multicentre prospective registry. Methods and Results We calculated the RVol/LAV ratio from baseline transthoracic echocardiograms. The median value of the RVol/LAV ratio was 0.40. A total of 1830 patients who underwent M-TEER were allocated into two groups: the low RVol/LAV (RVol/LAV ratio &amp;lt;0.40) and high RVol/LAV (RVol/LAV ratio ≥0.40) groups. The primary endpoint was heart failure hospitalization. Eight hundred eighty-eight and 942 patients were included into the low RVol/LAV ratio and high RVol/LAV ratio groups, respectively. The median follow-up period was 508 days. At three years after repair, 215 (37.6%) and 187 (32.1%) patients in the low RVol/LAV and high RVol/LAV groups, respectively, were hospitalized for heart failure. The patients in the low RVol/LAV group demonstrated a significantly higher risk of heart failure hospitalization than did those in the high RVol/LAV group (hazards ratio, 1.25; 95%confidence interval, 1.03–1.52; p = 0.022). Furthermore, using multivariable Cox regression analysis, the low RVol/LAV was an independent predictor of the primary endpoint. Conclusions The RVol/LAV ratio might serve as a valuable metric for improving risk stratification in patients with VFMR."

The condition remains diagnostically challenging due to overlapping features with other autoimmune and psychiatric disorders, absence of definitive biomarkers, and variable infectious histories. Objective To describe a diagnostically complex case of PANDAS in a preadolescent girl presenting with concurrent choreiform movements, acute psychosis, and subclinical valvular changes. Case A 12-year-6-month-old previously healthy girl developed sudden-onset involuntary dance-like movements and acute psychiatric symptoms, including auditory hallucinations and bizarre delusions. Neurological examination revealed chorea without focal deficits. Echocardiography showed mild mitral and tricuspid regurgitation. Anti Streptolysin O (ASTO) test was positive, but other Laboratory markers of inflammation were normal. The temporal clustering of symptoms, subtle cardiac findings, positive ASTO test and exclusion of alternative diagnoses supported a working diagnosis of PANDAS. Management included antipsychotic, benzodiazepine, and anticonvulsant therapy, with referral for tertiary evaluation and potential immunomodulation. Conclusion This case emphasizes the importance of early recognition of PANDAS in children with abrupt neuropsychiatric and motor symptom onset, the necessity of thorough differential diagnosis, and the value of multidisciplinary care in optimizing outcomes."
