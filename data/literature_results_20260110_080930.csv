PubMed,aortic stenosis,The journey from repair to replacement in pediatric aortic valve stenosis: a 10-year single-center experience.,Guowei Zeng; Xinjie Zhang; Longming Huang; Bozhong Shi; Kai Luo; Xiaoyang Zhang; Haoyu Li; Jinghao Zheng; Xiaomin He,10.1186/s12887-025-06494-8,2026-01-09,BMC pediatrics,"The optimal reoperation strategy and long-term outcomes of pediatric patients with congenital aortic stenosis (AS) have not been well elucidated. This study aimed to evaluate the reintervention outcomes and long-term prognosis in patients with isolated AS following their initial aortic valve (AoV) repair.
A retrospective analysis was conducted on the clinical data of all patients with isolated AS who underwent initial AoV repair between 2013 and 2024. The primary outcome was the rate of freedom from reoperation after the initial procedure and secondary surgeries.
A total of 203 patients who underwent initial AoV repair were included. The median age at initial surgery was 2.4 (0.6, 4.7) years. The 30-day mortality rate was 0.5% (1/203). The 10-year freedom from AoV reoperation rate was 50.9% (95% CI: 36.2%-65.6%; n = 48/203). The 10-year freedom from AoV replacement rate was 62.7% (95% CI: 46.0%-79.4%; n = 28/203). Among the 48 patients who underwent reoperation, 20 underwent AoV repair and 28 underwent AoV replacement. Patients in the AoV replacement group were older (9.4 ± 4.0 years vs. 6.7 ± 3.6 years, P = 0.022) and had higher body weight (32.2 ± 14.3 kg vs. 22.8 ± 12.1 kg, P = 0.021). The 10-year freedom from AoV reoperation rate after the secondary procedure was 87.9% (95% CI: 73.4%-100.0%; n = 3/45). The 10-year freedom from moderate or greater AS/ aortic regurgitation was 50.2% (95% CI: 30.8%-69.6%; n = 15/45). Compared with secondary AoV repair, AoV replacement was associated with superior long-term outcomes (P = 0.001).
Favorable outcomes are achieved in patients with AS after initial AoV repair; however, nearly half of the patients may require reoperation within 10 years. For reoperations, AoV replacement is more likely to provide desirable long-term quality of life."

AS can culminate in heart failure if left untreated. Early treatment with minimally-invasive transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) is being evaluated in clinical trials. We addressed an unmet clinical need for early detection, referral to echocardiography for AS evaluation, and possible treatments (e.g., lifestyle changes, drugs, or TAVR). As aortic valve calcification (AVC) is typically present in AS, we created a method to detect AVC in low-cost/no-cost non-contrast CT calcium score (CTCS) screening exam images. We developed a multi-task deep network to identify a cylindrical aortic valve region of interest (ROI) and applied Agatston criteria within the ROI to obtain calcifications. Predicted ROIs had good agreement with cardiologists' labels and sometimes were better, and predicted Agatston scores agreed with cardiologists (r = 1.00, paired t-test p = 0.573, t = 0.57). On a retrospective screening cohort of 2000 + patients, we found that 20.6% of men and 22.2% of women had some degree of AVC. According to guidelines, 3.53% and 9.04%, respectively, would have severe AS. These promising results indicate that further evaluation of this approach is warranted, with the potential for significant public health impact."

A study on 46 patients, who were aged ≥ 3 months and suffered TOF, was carried out over a period from May 2023 to May 2024.
All 46 patients (mean age 8.4 months, weight 7.1 ± 1.8 kg) underwent TOF repair via right vertical infra-axillary thoracotomy. Only one patient required re-intervention for electrode wire bleeding, managed through the same incision. Mean cardiopulmonary bypass and aortic clamp times were 174 ± 48 and 108 ± 35 minutes, respectively. Average postoperative hospital stay was 10.3 ± 8.6 days. The most common early complications were postoperative pneumonia (26.1%) and junctional ectopic tachycardia (23.9%). Follow-up was conducted in all patients, with an average duration of 8.1 ± 4.3 months. At the last follow-up, right ventricular outflow tract pressure gradient decreased from 63 ± 23.2 to 20 ± 9.8 mmHg, and pulmonary valve annulus size increased from 8.7 ± 1.9 to 11.6 ± 1.8 mm. No deaths occurred during follow-up. Mild and moderate right ventricular outflow tract stenosis were observed in 22 (47.8%) and 2 (4.2%) patients, respectively. One patient (2.1%) developed moderate pulmonary valve regurgitation.
The early-term result of minimally invasive cardiac surgery in the treatment of TOF is relatively positive, making this a promising alternative to the traditional method. However, further practice in a narrow space is required to reach proficiency."

Emerging transcriptomic and single-cell analyses implicate immune dysregulation, RNA methylation, and necroptosis as critical modulators of myocardial remodeling. Objectives: This scoping review synthesizes bioinformatic, transcriptomic, and experimental data to delineate the immunogenetic architecture of HCM and identify candidate molecular targets for immune-metabolic modulation. Methods: Following Joanna Briggs Institute and PRISMA-ScR guidelines, we systematically searched PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, and GEO through September 2025 for studies evaluating immune infiltration, RNA regulation, and necroptosis in human HCM. Data were narratively synthesized across histologic, clinical, and multi-omics domains. Results: Among 8191 screened records, 25 studies met the inclusion criteria. Key immune-epigenetic regulators included the lncRNA-mRNA pair MIR210HG-BPIFC, m6A readers IGFBP3 and YTHDC1, and necroptosis gene JAK2. The HCM myocardium exhibited the depletion of reparative M2 macrophages and Tregs; enrichment of cytotoxic CD8+ T cells; and activation of the TNFα-NFκB, IL-6-JAK-STAT3, and PI3K-Akt pathways. Machine learning biomarkers (RASD1, FCN3, and PIK3R1) exhibited diagnostic accuracy (AUC > 0.85). Drug target predictions identified ruxolitinib and celecoxib as potential immunometabolic modulators (agents predicted to modulate both immune and metabolic pathways based on gene expression signatures). Conclusions: These findings support a hypothesis that HCM may involve immunogenetic mechanisms, rather than being exclusively sarcomeric in nature, although this remains to be validated. The integration of molecular and imaging biomarkers may enable precision immunotherapy, redefining HCM from a structural cardiomyopathy to a biologically stratified condition."
PubMed,aortic stenosis,Transcatheter Closure of an Ascending Aortic Pseudoaneurysm Guided by Intracardiac Echocardiography.,Manabu Sato; Hiromasa Hayama; Yae Matsuo; Yoshiyuki Yazaki; Kenji Makino; Go Hashimoto; Hidehiko Hara,10.7759/cureus.98755,2025-12,Cureus,"A 60-year-old man with a history of multiple cardiac surgeries presented with exertional dyspnea. CT revealed a 20 × 10 mm ascending aortic pseudoaneurysm with a neck diameter of 7 mm, located near the suture line of a previous aortic root replacement, compressing a saphenous vein graft (SVG). Given the high risk of reoperation, percutaneous catheter closure with a 9/12 mm Amplatzer Vascular Plug II (AVP II) was performed alongside drug-eluting stent (4.0 × 18 mm) implantation to address SVG stenosis. Intraoperative intracardiac echocardiography (ICE) was essential for guiding AVP II deployment and ensuring accurate placement. This case highlights the effectiveness and safety of ICE-guided percutaneous interventions in managing complex aortic pathologies in high-risk patients. Successful closure of the pseudoaneurysm and resolution of the SVG compression demonstrated the feasibility of this minimally invasive approach in patients with complex surgical histories."

The specific relationship between DM and the extent and distribution of calcification within the thoracic aorta and its segments has not been fully elucidated in the literature. We aimed to assess the association of calcification of aorta segments, including root, ascending, arch, and descending parts, with coronary atherosclerotic burden, including CAC, stenosis severity, and non-calcified plaque in patients with DM.
This retrospective study included symptomatic patients with suspected coronary artery disease who underwent a 256-slice multi-detector computed tomography angiography examination between May and December 2024.
A total of 138 symptomatic patients were enrolled in this study. The enrolled patients were categorized into two groups: DM group (n = 60, with a mean age 58 ± 12 years and 42% males) and non-DM group (n = 78, with a mean age 54 ± 11 years and 53% males). Calcification of the descending aorta was significantly associated with the presence of significant coronary stenosis (≥ 50%), and this association remained statistically significant after adjustment for conventional coronary risk factors (P = 0.020). Calcification in the aortic root (r = 0.2, P = 0.016), ascending aorta (r = 0.3, P = 0.004), and descending aorta (r = 0.3, P = 0.002) was significantly correlated with CAC. However, these associations did not remain significant in regression analysis after adjusting for coronary risk factors. Calcification at different thoracic aorta segments showed no significant association with the presence of non-calcified coronary plaque.
Calcification of the descending aorta was independently associated with significant coronary stenosis in patients with DM."
PubMed,aortic stenosis,Intraoperative bradycardia leading to cardiac arrest during anterior lumbar interbody fusion (ALIF) in a morbidly obese patient-a rare complication and management strategy: a case report.,Worawich Kraipindakul; Teerachat Tanasansomboon; Wicharn Yingsakmongkol; Weerasak Singhatanadgige; Vit Kotheeranurak; Worawat Limthongkul,10.21037/jss-25-56,2025-12-31,Journal of spine surgery (Hong Kong),"Intraoperative bradycardia leading to cardiac arrest is a rare and serious complication during anterior lumbar interbody fusion (ALIF) surgeries. This case report presents a unique and previously undocumented instance of bradycardia progressing to asystole during an ALIF, highlighting the importance of autonomic nervous system involvement and intraoperative vigilance.
A 64-year-old female with a history of hypertension and morbid obesity was scheduled for an ALIF at L5/S1 due to adjacent segment disease (ASD) and foraminal stenosis at that level. Intraoperatively, after manipulation of the peritoneum and blunt dissection around the aortic bifurcation, her heart rate (HR) suddenly dropped to 50 beats per minute (bpm), followed by a rapid decrease in blood pressure (BP) and cardiac arrest. Immediate cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) and administration of ephedrine successfully restored spontaneous circulation within 30 seconds. The surgical and anesthesia teams promptly decided to abort the operation. Further evaluation revealed no evidence of myocardial infarction, and the patient made a full recovery. This rare event suggests that hyper vagal stimulation from manipulation of the superior hypogastric plexus (SHP) and peritoneum may be a possible mechanism. It underscores the critical importance of vigilant monitoring, prompt intervention, and effective communication between surgical and anesthesia teams to manage acute hemodynamic instability during high-risk spinal surgeries.
This case illustrates a rare but critical intraoperative event likely caused by hyper vagal stimulation during anterior spinal exposure near autonomic plexuses. Surgeons and anesthesiologists must be aware of this potential complication. Prompt recognition and a coordinated team response are essential for favorable outcomes. Consideration of invasive hemodynamic monitoring and collaboration with access surgeons may improve safety in complex ALIF procedures, especially in high-risk patients such as those with morbid obesity."
PubMed,aortic stenosis,Clinical 4D flow MRI assessment in aortopathy-what the clinician needs to know.,Malenka M Bissell; Pankaj Garg,10.21037/cdt-24-478,2025-12-31,Cardiovascular diagnosis and therapy,"Interval cross-sectional imaging plays an important role in aortopathy surveillance. Often, cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is used over computed tomography (CT) due to the lack of radiation in repeated surveillance and the option of additional hemodynamic assessment. Primarily, assessment includes the orthogonal measurement of aortic dimensions in a three-dimensional (3D) structure. Lately, four-dimensional (4D) flow MRI is becoming more widespread as it can be acquired within 1-5 minutes using advanced techniques. In addition to standard flow quantification, 4D flow MRI offers advanced hemodynamic quantification. This review discusses important advanced imaging biomarkers, including helical flow pattern, wall shear stress (WSS), flow displacement and systolic flow reversal ratio (sFRR). It focuses on those parameters that can be analyzed using commercially available post-processing platforms and are accessible for clinical centers without the need for research setup and collaboration. WSS plays a role in the assessment of bicuspid aortic valve disease. Here it is elevated even without the presence of stenosis. Flow displacement is also of value in bicuspid aortic valve disease and is abnormal in heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) as well as chronic aortic dissection. 4D flow MRI is also useful in understanding and assessing flow changes in aortic valve replacement."

Multiple etiologies, including glomerular hyperperfusion, can cause secondary FSGS. Unilateral renal artery stenosis can lead to FSGS of the contralateral native kidney, but it is not well demonstrated whether transplant renal artery stenosis can cause a similar change in a single transplanted kidney.
A female underwent kidney transplantation at the age of 17 on January 14, 2020. Her renal function remained stable until 25 months later, when the patient presented with hypertension and elevated serum creatinine (SCr), with an unremarkable urine test. Ultrasound and computed tomography angiography (CTA) revealed stenosis at the initial segment of the main transplant renal artery. After percutaneous transluminal angioplasty of the main transplant renal artery, her SCr and blood pressure recovered. 5 months later, hypertension recurred with moderate proteinuria (2.5 g/d). An allograft biopsy showed a remarkable cellular FSGS lesion. Due to the absence of glomeruli in the electronic microscope sample, a second biopsy was performed a month later. Unexpectedly, no FSGS, except for very mild glomerular hypoperfusion and remarkably enlarged juxtaglomerular apparatus, was found. Hemodynamic abnormality in the kidney was suspected as the two biopsy sites were from the lower pole and upper pole, respectively. The donor kidney had an accessory renal artery on a common aortic patch with the main renal artery. Doppler ultrasonography confirmed two different hemodynamic areas in the kidney. Transplant renal artery stenosis of the main artery induced an FSGS lesion in the region dominated by the accessory artery. Endovascular stenting was performed, and her proteinuria turned negative, with SCr recovering only 3 days later. The patient had long-term follow-up after discharge and had a favorable condition.
Transplant renal artery stenosis can cause regional hyperperfusion leading to adaptive FSGS, presenting with proteinuria and morphologically manifesting as a cellular variant of FSGS instead of the classic variant, which is usually closely related to hyperperfusion. The lesion must be differentiated from primary and other secondary FSGS. Removal of the hemodynamic abnormality can quickly relieve hypertension and proteinuria."

This study aimed to elucidate clinical and molecular differences between HD and non-HD patients with AS, focusing on transcriptomic profiling of resected aortic valves.
We retrospectively analysed 183 patients with severe AS who underwent surgical aortic valve replacement (SAVR) at the University of Yamanashi Hospital from February 2015 to May 2024. Among them, 34 patients were receiving maintenance HD, while 149 were not. Clinical data, echocardiographic findings, and computed tomography-based valve calcification were assessed. RNA sequencing was conducted on aortic valve specimens from five HD and four non-HD patients. Differentially expressed genes were identified, followed by enrichment analysis and immune cell profiling using CIBERSORTx.
HD patients exhibited lower body mass index, a higher prevalence of ischaemic heart disease, elevated C-reactive protein and B-type natriuretic peptide levels, and impaired diastolic function compared to non-HD patients. RNA sequencing revealed 35 upregulated and 30 downregulated genes in HD valves. Enrichment analysis demonstrated that genes involved in immune response and ossification were upregulated in aortic valves from HD patients. CIBERSORTx analysis suggested increased macrophage infiltration. Comparison with public datasets identified HD- associated gene signatures.
Patients with AS on HD exhibited distinct clinical features and gene expression profiles. Upregulation of immune and ossification-related genes, alongside macrophage infiltration, suggests a key role for immune response in AS progression among HD patients."

Less is known about the operator volumes-outcomes association in the contemporary era.
To determine whether an operator-level volume-outcomes association exists for TAVR and MTEER in the contemporary era.
This cohort study examined data from patients undergoing TAVR or MTEER between January 2020 and December 2023 included in the Society of Thoracic Surgeons (STS)/American College of Cardiology (ACC) Transcatheter Valve Therapies (TVT) Registry, a national all-comers real-world registry. Consecutive patients undergoing TAVR for aortic stenosis or MTEER for mitral regurgitation were included. Data analysis was performed from October 2024 to December 2025.
TAVR or MTEER.
The primary outcome measures were (1) 30-day all-cause mortality, (2) a 30-day composite outcome, and (3) in-hospital procedural complications following TAVR or MTEER. Data from the STS/ACC TVT Registry were analyzed for patients undergoing TAVR or MTEER between 2020 and 2023. The primary analysis assessed the association between operator volume and 30-day outcomes using a 2-level random-effects logistic regression model. The interaction between operator and hospital volumes and the association between TAVR and MTEER outcomes were also evaluated.
A total of 358 943 patients underwent TAVR at 827 hospitals (7524 operators; median [IQR] annual volume, 24 [11-47]), and 51 407 patients underwent MTEER at 493 hospitals (2483 operators; median [IQR] annual volume, 12 [7-19]). For TAVR, median (IQR) patient age was 79.0 (73.0-85.0) years, and 152 186 patients (42.4%) were female; for MTEER, median (IQR) patient age was 79.0 (71.0-84.0) years, and 23 402 patients (45.5%) were female. Low-volume operators demonstrated inferior process of care measures compared with high-volume operators. In adjusted analyses, a higher risk of 30-day mortality (odds ratio [OR], 1.13; 95% CI, 1.02-1.26; P = .02) and in-hospital complications (OR, 1.09; 95% CI, 1.03-1.16; P = .005) was observed for low-volume TAVR operators (<15/y) compared with high-volume operators (>37/y). For MTEER, in-hospital complications (OR, 1.31; 95% CI, 1.11-1.56; P = .002) were higher for low-volume operators (<8/y) compared with high-volume operators (>16/y), while 30-day mortality was not different (OR, 1.16; 95% CI, 0.96-1.41; P = .12). Associations were consistent across hospital volume strata. Operator-level outcomes for TAVR and MTEER were not correlated.
In this cohort study, results from a large, contemporary US registry demonstrate a persistent inverse association between operator volume and patient outcomes for both TAVR and MTEER. These findings may help inform future policies aimed at ensuring optimal outcomes."

Here, we use empirical data to characterise the comprehension-production gap and computational modelling to investigate potential mechanisms underlying this distinctive linguistic profile, focusing on children aged 7 months to 6 years. Using parental reports (Communicative Development Inventories), we measured the receptive and expressive vocabularies of children with WS (n = 67) and compared them to typically developing children (n = 1210) and cross-syndrome groups with Down syndrome (n = 27), and fragile X syndrome (n = 15). Results confirm that children with WS show a unique trajectory: alongside general delay, they exhibit a significantly reduced comprehension-production asymmetry not observed in other groups. To elucidate the potential origins of this phenomenon, we implemented a biologically inspired neural network-self-organising map (SOM)-to model early word learning and evaluate visual and auditory map representations. Our findings reveal that WS-like vocabulary patterns can emerge from selective difficulties in visual processing, leading to exemplar-based rather than prototype-based object representations. The model suggests that these visual processing challenges, consistent with known visuospatial difficulties in WS, may contribute to the atypical comprehension-production relationship, while broader processing constraints may underlie general delays. This study provides a mechanistic account of vocabulary development in WS, highlighting the role of visual constraints in shaping lexical outcomes. More broadly, it underscores the need to conceptualise language development as an interaction between sensory input and cognitive subsystems, explaining why the comprehension-production gap is not a uniform feature of language acquisition."

In this study, we present a case of upper limb neurological symptoms following a serratus anterior plane block (SAPB) administered after MICS, which was visualized via contrast x-ray imaging. A 74-year-old woman with severe aortic stenosis underwent aortic valve replacement via minithoracotomy. We preoperatively inserted a SAPB catheter deep into the serratus anterior muscle (SAM). Postoperative x-ray imaging with contrast medium revealed its distribution extending from the chest wall (second to fourth ribs), detached from the thorax, toward the right upper arm. We initiated a programmed intermittent bolus infusion (PIBI) via the catheter, but the patient developed reduced grip and sensory deficits in the right arm. Discontinuation of PIBI on postoperative day five led to neurological symptom resolution by day six. The clinical course and contrast distribution suggested that the catheter tip may have migrated to the superficial layer of the SAM. These findings highlight the importance of confirming catheter placement and carefully monitoring neurological symptoms when atypical contrast spread patterns are observed."

To study the impact of CMA on clinical and hemodynamic outcomes following ViV-TAVI for failed SAVR.
Data of patients who underwent ViV-TAVI for failed SAVR valves at two institutions (Heart Center Leipzig at Leipzig University, Leipzig, Germany; Cedars-Sinai Smidt Heart Institute, Los Angeles, USA) were retrospectively collected and compared regarding the existence of CMA. Outcomes of interest included Valve Academic Research Consortium (VARC)-3-based clinical endpoints, Computed Tomography-based hypoattenuated leaflet thickening (HALT), hemodynamic outcome, and mid-term all-cause mortality.
Of the 687 patients who underwent ViV-TAVI, post-procedural CT of sufficient quality to measure commissural alignment was available in 180 patients (47.8% females, mean age 78.0 years). Self-expanding TAVI valves were used in 49.2% of the cases. CMA was found in 35 individuals (19.4%) and was associated with reduced VARC-3-based technical success (80% vs. 93%, p = 0.03), driven by increased rates of coronary obstruction (17.1% vs. 5.6%, p = 0.03). The incidence of HALT was 31.7%, without differences in patients with and without CMA. VARC-3-based device success was 62.9%, driven by an incidence of residual mean valve gradient (≥ 20 mmHg) of 35.4%, without differences between groups. Midterm survival after a mean of 747 days was 84.6% and comparable between groups.
For patients undergoing ViV-TAVI for failed SAVR, technical success is reduced for cases of CMA due to higher odds of coronary obstruction, without differences in mid-term survival."

This study investigates the association between the PPG and coronary atherosclerosis, as characterized by intravascular ultrasound (IVUS).
This is a pre-specified analysis of the PPG Global study (NCT04789317). We included stable patients with hemodynamically significant lesions (FFR ≤0.80) undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) guided by IVUS. PPG was calculated from manual FFR pullbacks before PCI. Pathophysiological CAD patterns were classified as focal or diffuse based on the median PPG (0.62).
A total of 261 patients (264 vessels) with PPG and IVUS were included. The mean age was 69±11 years, 77% were male, and 33% had diabetes mellitus. A significant correlation was observed between PPG and plaque burden (r=0.53, 95% CI 0.43-0.61, p<0.001). Vessels with focal CAD exhibited significantly higher plaque burden compared to those with diffuse CAD (83±6% vs. 76±8%, p<0.001). The prevalence of attenuated plaques was greater in vessels with high PPG (68% vs. 39%, p <0.001), while calcified plaques were more frequent in vessels with low PPG (60% vs. 78%, p=0.003).
In vessels with flow-limiting stenoses, high PPG is associated with increased plaque burden. Vessels with high PPG (focal disease) predominantly exhibited lipid-rich plaques, whereas those with low PPG (diffuse disease) had a greater calcium burden."

Data on bridging stent choice in IBD are limited. The aim of this meta-analysis was to assess Advanta V12/iCast outcomes when used as bridging stent during IBD procedures.
The English medical literature was systematically searched through PubMed, Scopus, and Cochrane Library (last search: 03.01.2025). The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses statement was followed, and a predefined protocol was registered to PROSPERO. Randomized controlled trials and observational studies (2000--2025) reporting on the Advanta V12/iCast-related outcomes were eligible. The ROBINS-I tool and Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluations (GRADE) were used to assess the risk of bias and quality of evidence. Primary outcomes were technical success, stenosis/occlusion, endoleak Ic/IIIc, and reintervention rates during follow-up. Data on the outcomes of interest were synthesized using proportional meta-analysis.
From 2698 study reports, 10 observational studies (510 targeted IIAs, 467 IIAs bridged with Advanta V12/iCast) were included. According to ROBINS-I, eight studies were of low and two were of moderate quality. Technical success was 98% (95% confidence interval (CI) = 93%-100%; I2 = 0%; certainty: very low). Regarding the 30-day outcomes, the occlusion/stenosis rate was 2% (95% CI = 0%-9%; I2 = 0%), the endoleak Ic/IIIc rate was 0.3% (95% CI = 0%-3%; I2 = 0%) and the reintervention rate was 1% (95% CI = 0%-3%; I2 = 0%). The mean follow-up among studies was 23.4 months (95% CI = 14.2-32.7). During follow-up, the occlusion/stenosis rate was 4% (95% CI = 1%-11%; I2 = 19%; certainty: very low), the endoleak Ic/IIIc overall rate was 5% (95% CI = 3%-8%; I2 = 0%; certainty: very low), and the reintervention rate was 5% (95% CI = 3%-9%; I2 = 0%; certainty: very low).
The Advanta V12/iCast balloon-expandable covered stent showed low occlusion/stenosis, endoleak, and reintervention rates at 30 days and follow-up and appeared to be a reliable bridging stent choice in IBDs.Clinical ImpactThe available literature on iliac branch devices does not provide adequate evidence supporting bridging stent selection. This systematic review and meta-analysis on the use of Advanta V12/iCast as bridging stent showed a high technical success rate of 98%, along with low occlusion/stenosis, endoleak Ic/IIIc and reintervention rates at 30 days, which were maintained below 5% during the total follow-up. These results reflect on the reliability of Advanta V12/iCast when used as bridging stent in iliac branch devices. However, the low quality of evidence should be considered upon result interpretation."

Classically, TAVI is performed via femoral arterial access. However, some patients who have severe peripheral arterial disease do not have safely accessible femoral arteries. In such patients, the use of carotid access has been well described via the 'clamp-and-sew' technique. We describe a minimally invasive carotid access technique for TAVI deployment. The right common carotid is accessed by a 3 cm suprasternal incision. The carotid sheath is entered, and the surgeon obtains proximal and distal control of the carotid artery. The surgeon then makes two opposing purse strings over the anterior surface of the carotid artery. The Seldinger technique is used to obtain access to the carotid artery, followed by placement of the TAVI sheath. The valve is then deployed and echocardiographically confirmed. Upon removal of the TAVI sheath, the purse strings are tightened and sequentially tied. Haemostasis is achieved and skin is closed. This minimally invasive TAVI technique provides an option for patients with unfavourable peripheral access sites while offering the benefits of TAVI compared to open valve replacement."

It allows surgeons to implant any commercially available aortic valve prosthesis (sutureless, biological, mechanical) in a surgically conventional manner, while offering minimal surgical trauma (sternum-free, rib-free, pectoralis muscle sparing). We present a step-by-step standardized procedure of robotic aortic valve replacement with a mechanical prosthesis for a young female patient with severe symptomatic aortic valve stenosis in a unicuspid aortic valve."

Following the acquisition of informed consent, participants were assessed using various measures, including demographic and obstetric information, the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale, the Corona Disease Anxiety Scale (CDAS), and the NEO Personality Inventory-Revised during their third trimester of pregnancy. The same group of participants completed the Edinburgh Depression Scale and the Corona Disease Anxiety Scale (CDAS) 4-6 weeks after childbirth.                                                           Results and Discussion:                     There was a significant correlation between family income, unwanted pregnancy as perceived by both the mother and father, and antenatal depression. Additionally, marital satisfaction played a significant role in postpartum depression. Furthermore, antenatal depression was significantly associated with neuroticism, agreeableness, and physical symptoms related to Corona disease anxiety. Personality traits, with the exception of extroversion and conscientiousness, and various domains of Corona disease anxiety, excluding psychological symptoms, were also significantly associated with postpartum depression.                                                           Conclusion:                     During pandemics or epidemics, such as the COVID-19 outbreak, experiencing mental distress during pregnancy can contribute to mental health issues during the postpartum period. This risk is particularly true in individuals with unique personality traits, emphasizing the need for increased focus on mental health within prenatal care during these crises."
Crossref,valvular heart disease,The Severity of Disease and Hospital Length of Stay for the First and Second Admission of COVID-19 Patients: An Observational Study from Southeastern Iran,Milad Ahmadi Gohari; Mohammad Hossein Mehrolhassani; Shoboo Rahmati; Elham Sharifpoor; Hossein Mirzaei; Yunes Jahani,10.2174/0126667975341163241129050027,2026-10,Coronaviruses,"Background:                     This study aimed to investigate the severity of disease and length of hospital stay for COVID-19 patients admitted to a hospital in southeastern Iran.                                                           Method:                     This cross-sectional study was conducted in Kerman, Iran. Data were collected from patients who visited Afzalipour Hospital in Kerman more than twice during the COVID-19 epidemic from the end of February 2020 to March 21, 2021. We conducted two key analyses: 1. Mixed effect logistic regression was used to check the relationship between the variables and COVID-19 severity. 2. Mixed effect linear regression was used to check the relationship between the variables and the length of stay in the hospital.                                                           Results:                     The findings indicated that the most important risk factors for the severity of COVID-19 were heart diseases (OR=1.67,95%CI:1.20-2.30), increasing age (OR=2.23 for age&gt;54, 95%CI:1.70- 2.90), male gender (OR=1.47,95%CI:1.10-1.96), respiratory diseases other than asthma, and frequency of admission (OR=1.60,95%CI:1.20-2.15). All patients who underwent readmission experienced a shorter duration of hospitalization during their subsequent admission (OR=0.94,95%CI:0.91,0.96) and had a higher mortality rate (30% within 14 days, 26.6% between 14-90 days). Patients readmitted at intervals of 14-90 days and greater than 90 days exhibited lower disease severity compared to those readmitted within the 0-14 day period.                                                           Conclusion:                     Examining readmissions, the severity of COVID-19, and the length of hospital stay in affected patients are important factors for planning and allocating resources for COVID-19 management and treatment. These factors can help policymakers develop effective clinical guidelines for hospitalization or outpatient treatment of COVID-19 patients and contribute to reducing the burden of disease in the community."

Kinovea, as an accessible motion-analysis software, provides both visual and quantitative feedback. However, its application in supporting technique development among beginner athletes remains insufficiently explored. Aim: This study aims to describe the use of Kinovea in biomechanics training and examine its contribution to the awareness of kinematic characteristics and movement techniques among beginner athletes. Methods: A descriptive qualitative design involved 72 beginner athletes aged 18–25 years selected through purposive sampling. Data were collected over 16 weeks through interviews, field observations, and motion video recordings analyzed using Kinovea. Kinematic data focused on joint angles, stride behavior, and movement phases during walking, running, and the flight phase. Qualitative data were analyzed using content analysis with NVivo 12, while kinematic results were interpreted descriptively to identify performance patterns and areas for technical refinement. Result: Kinematic analysis showed coordinated joint-angle patterns across all phases. Walking analysis identified arm swing angles of 50.9°–58.8° and leg separation angles of 64.3°–67.2°, indicating a stable gait rhythm. The running analysis revealed knee angles of 68.8°–69.8° and elbow angles of 87.6°–89.1°, indicating efficient propulsive mechanics. The flight phase demonstrated knee angles of 81.2°–87.8° and elbow angles of 80.4°–88.3°, suggesting effective momentum use and postural stability. These measurements supported stride-efficiency assessment and technique evaluation. Qualitative findings revealed that Kinovea enabled athletes to interpret movement phases and identify technical inefficiencies through slow-motion and frame-by-frame visualization. Conclusion: Kinovea supports basic motion analysis by providing clear kinematic information and helping beginner athletes observe and refine their movement techniques. The findings also offer practical value for coaches by enabling more precise identification of inefficient patterns and guiding targeted corrections during early-stage training."

Traditional management strategies follow a step-by-step approach, prioritizing guideline-directed medical therapy (GDMT) and reserving interventional (surgical or percutaneous) options only in case of persistent symptoms or worsening HF after GDMT. However, greater experience with the use of percutaneous procedures, even in high-risk patients, could support a more integrated approach, which exploits the synergistic effects of medical and interventional therapies to increase the tolerability of one vs the other, thereby improving quality of life and outcomes through their synergic effects. This expert opinion paper summarizes current data and evolving practices in the management of VHD in patients with HF, including secondary mitral regurgitation, aortic stenosis, aortic regurgitation, and tricuspid regurgitation."

We aimed to determine (i) whether baseline RRI predicts survival after mitral transcatheter edge-to-edge repair (M-TEER) and (ii) whether RRI changes in response to the procedure. Methods In this prospective, single-center cohort we enrolled consecutive patients with severe mitral regurgitation who underwent M-TEER between October 2020 and December 2021 (trial registration number 412/20, date of registration 02.09.2020). Baseline demographics, estimated laboratory parameters, comprehensive echocardiography, and Doppler-derived RRI were collected before and 3 months after intervention. The primary endpoint was all-cause mortality. Associations were analyzed with multivariable Cox regression. Renal endpoints were not systematically collected and were therefore not included as clinical outcome measures. Results Among 109 patients (53.2% women), the median baseline RRI was 0.71 (IQR 0.67–0.75) and showed no correlation with eGFR, left-ventricular ejection fraction, or echocardiographic measurements of mitral regurgitation at baseline. Higher RRI was associated with all-cause mortality, and in exploratory post hoc analyses an RRI cutoff &gt; 0.70 remained predictive independent of baseline renal function (HR 5.37, p 0.07). RRI improved significantly 3 months after M-TEER (0.67; IQR 0.63–0.70; p &lt; 0.001), particularly in patients with a post-procedural MR reduction of at least 1 grade. However, the change in RRI showed no correlation with mortality or changes in renal function. Conclusions A baseline RRI above 0.70 was independently associated with mortality following M–TEER, underscoring its potential prognostic relevance. The marked post-procedural decline in RRI, especially in patients with relevant MR improvement, suggests that RRI reflects hemodynamic rather than renal filtration changes. Given the limited sample size and number of events, these findings should be considered exploratory and hypothesis-generating, requiring validation in larger multicenter cohorts. Graphical Abstract"

The underlying cause was severe dynamic mitral regurgitation (MR) and secondary tricuspid regurgitation (TR). After successful extubation and weaning, the patient’s MR nearly resolved. Discharged in improved condition with guideline-directed medical therapy, the patient was soon readmitted for heart failure with pulmonary edema. The transthoracic echocardiogram confirmed recurrent, worsening MR.​ Transcatheter edge-to-edge repair was successfully performed, reducing the patient’s severe MR to trivial and resolving TR completely. At 1-year follow-up, the patient remained stable with improved cardiac function and no readmissions for cardiac causes."

We report a case of mitral valve replacement in a 76-year-old woman with a large caseous cavity, coronary artery disease, severe mitral valve stenosis and atrial fibrillation. Preoperative computed tomography showed a large caseous cavity (3 x 3.5 cm) in the posterior annulus extending into the atrioventricular groove. After unroofing and evacuation, the cavity was excluded with a pericardial patch. The lower edge of the patch was sutured to the ventricular side of the cavity; valve sutures passed through the residual posterior leaflet, the upper edge of the patch and the atrial edge of the cavity. The mitral prosthesis was then secured. The patient was weaned from cardiopulmonary bypass without complications. Intraoperative echocardiography demonstrated a well-seated mitral prosthesis with no valvular or paravalvular leaks. Postoperative imaging confirmed successful exclusion of the cavity in the atrioventricular groove. The postoperative echocardiogram revealed a mean gradient of 4 mmHg across the mitral prosthesis and no mitral regurgitation. Patch exclusion of the caseous cavity is a safe and feasible approach to support implanting a mitral prosthesis and obliterating a cavity."

Objectives: We aimed to study with an automatic three-dimensional transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) dedicated software patients with moderate and severe mitral regurgitation when compared to patients with no structural cardiac chamber alterations (patients with patent foramen ovale (PFO) who underwent TEE) . Methods: We employed a TEE software dedicated to automatic analysis of 34 parameters of the mitral valve apparatus comparing MVP patients with moderate and severe mitral regurgitation and patients with PFO without cardiac chamber structural alterations. Mitral valve effective regurgitant orifice (ERO) and regurgitant volume were correlated to automatic MVP parameters. Results: 59 MVP patients and 43 PFO patients were analysed. All MVP patients presented P2 mitral valve prolapse, 15 (25.4 % ) with both posterior and anterior prolapse. Twenty-seven automatic parameters (79%) were different concerning MVP and PFO patients (p&amp;lt; 0.05): diameters, area, perimeter, height, angle, coaptation width, lenght, closure line lenght, annulus. ERO was 0.43 + 0.11 cm2 , and regurgitant volume: 62.2 + 14.9 ml/beat. Automatic analysis correlated to 75 percentile ERO MVP patients (ERO&amp;gt; 0.48 cm2): Posterior Leafltet Area (r:0.74, p:0.031); Posterior Leafltet Lenght (r:0.73, p:0.032); Tenting area (r:0,41, p:0.048). Conclusions: Automatic mitral valve parameters analysis were different concerning MVP and no structural cardiac chamber (PFO) patients. 75 percentile ERO MVP patients (ERO&amp;gt; 0.48 cm2) correlated to posterior leaflet parameters.This anatomic information could be useful to planning and surgical treatment of mitral valve prolapse patients."
OpenAlex,mitral regurgitation,Early and intermediate outcomes of cavitron ultrasonic surgical aspiration to treat mitral annular calcification,Wendy Jin; Sabet W Hashim; R H G McKay; Jeff Mather; Susan Collazo; David W. Yaffee,10.1093/ejcts/ezag016,2026-01-06,European Journal of Cardio-Thoracic Surgery,"Abstract OBJECTIVES Severe mitral annular calcification (MAC) carries an increased risk of perioperative complications in patients undergoing mitral valve surgery and may be considered a prohibitive surgical risk. Cavitron ultrasonic surgical aspiration (CUSA) has been reported as a method for controlled debridement of severe MAC during mitral valve surgery, however experience in the literature is limited. METHODS We assessed 30-day and intermediate-term outcomes in 67 consecutive patients (mean age: 72 (SD 9) years; female sex: 65.7% (44/67)) with severe MAC who underwent mitral valve repair or replacement for mitral stenosis and/or regurgitation using CUSA between 3/2021 and 12/2024. Operations included isolated mitral valve replacement (41.8% (28/67)), isolated mitral valve repair (4.5% (3/67)), mitral and aortic valve replacement (37.3% (25/67), mitral valve replacement with coronary bypass (6.0% (4/67)), and mitral and aortic valve replacement with coronary bypass (10.4% (7/67)). Intermediate survival was estimated using the Kaplan–Meier method. RESULTS Mortality rate was 6.0% (4/67), stroke was 3.0% (2/67), and new postoperative atrial fibrillation was 29.0% (20/67). There were no atrioventricular groove ruptures. At a median echocardiographic follow-up time of 361 days (IQR 112, 671) moderate paravalvular leak occurred in 3.0% (1/67). Mid-term all-cause mortality was 9.0% at a mean follow-up time of 42.5 (95% CI 39.0, 46.0) months. CONCLUSIONS The use of CUSA to debride severe mitral annular calcification in patients undergoing mitral valve surgery is associated with acceptable short-term morbidity and mortality and durable intermediate-term results. This technique allows surgical intervention in patients who may otherwise be deemed prohibitive surgical risk."
OpenAlex,mitral regurgitation,Comparative study of transcatheter aortic valve implantation versus conventional surgical aortic valve replacement in the treatment of severe aortic stenosis with reverse ventricular remodeling,Haoyan Li; Sumin Yang; Wenlong Yan; Xiaodong Chen; Xun Chi,10.3389/fcvm.2025.1712400,2026-01-06,Frontiers in Cardiovascular Medicine,"Introduction This study aimed to compare echocardiographic outcomes and analyze the changes in ventricular remodeling at different time points after surgery in patients with severe aortic stenosis (AS) undergoing either surgical aortic valve replacement (SAVR) or transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR). Methods This retrospective study consecutively enrolled 175 patients with severe AS who underwent either SAVR or TAVR. Transthoracic echocardiograms obtained at baseline, 30 days, and 1 year after the procedure were analyzed by multiple echocardiographers at our institution. Results At baseline, the TAVR group was significantly older (74 ± 7 years vs. 62 ± 9 years, p &amp;lt; 0.001) and had a higher prevalence of hypertension (53.5% vs. 31.0%, p = 0.003), coronary artery disease (38.4% vs. 23.0%, p = 0.028), and atrial fibrillation (16.3% vs. 2.3%, p = 0.002). Additionally, the TAVR cohort demonstrated significantly worse cardiac functional status ( p &amp;lt; 0.001). Compared to TAVR patients, SAVR patients ( N = 87) exhibited a more pronounced reduction in left ventricular end-systolic dimension (−0.5 ± 0.65 cm vs. −0.2 ± 0.47 cm, p &amp;lt; 0.001) and left ventricular end-diastolic dimension (−0.6 ± 0.64 cm vs. −0.3 ± 0.55 cm, p &amp;lt; 0.001) at the 1-month follow-up. A decrease in left ventricular mass was observed in both groups from baseline to 1 month postoperatively, with the SAVR group showing a significantly greater reduction (LV mass: −67.3 ± 59.31 g vs. −38.2 ± 46.49 g, p = 0.003; LVMI: −39.1 ± 33.93 g/m 2 vs. −22.5 ± 27.08 g/m 2 , p = 0.005). However, these differences were not sustained at the 1-year follow-up. SAVR patients experienced a transient decline in right ventricular function at 1 month, which recovered by 1 year postoperatively. At the 1-year follow-up, the TAVR group experienced a higher incidence of Major Adverse Cardiac Events (MACE) ( p = 0.01), despite showing significant improvement in the severity of both mitral and tricuspid regurgitation compared to baseline ( p &amp;lt; 0.001). Although pulmonary artery pressure improved in both groups after AVR, the SAVR group demonstrated significantly lower pressure at 1 year ( p &amp;lt; 0.001). Conclusion In patients with severe aortic stenosis, SAVR was associated with more significant regression of left ventricular dimensions and mass at 1 month compared to TAVR, alongside a transient impairment of right ventricular function. By 1 year postoperatively, however, no significant differences in ventricular remodeling were observed between the two groups."

While her preoperative transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) did not reveal a discrete mass, it showed a mean mitral gradient of 7 mmHg; intraoperative transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) identified a 2 cm × 1.2 cm thrombus on the bioprosthetic MV. Given these findings, the surgical team decided to replace the mitral valve concurrently with LVAD implantation. Although this approach is not routine, the goal was to improve her quality of life and reduce postoperative complications. Post-procedure TEE showed an improved MV mean gradient of 3 mmHg with no evidence of paravalvular leak. The patient was subsequently discharged home in stable condition without any thromboembolic events. This case highlights the challenges of managing complex valvular pathology in patients undergoing LVAD placement."

One of the advantages of the proposed LVAD is in cases where end-stage left ventricular failure is accompanied by mitral valve regurgitation and pulmonary hypertension. Another advantage is minimally invasive implantation with minimal thoracic trauma, without disrupting the breathing process, which shortens the length of hospital stay. The best drive system for converting the rotary motion of the servo motor into reciprocating motion of the piston of the suction-discharge device was chosen. Two types of drive were considered, namely a yoke mechanism and a crank mechanism that were evaluated in terms of energy efficiency of the entire device. One of the most important conclusions is that both mechanisms have comparable operating parameters for balloon inflation and similar electrical energy consumption which amounts to comparable operating times for these mechanisms. However, the energy consumption of the yoke mechanism is slightly higher. At the same time the pressure in the left ventricle and aorta is slightly lower in comparison with a yoke mechanism. Furthermore, the results of the study also showed that the balloon pressures were significantly higher with crank drive, which may cause the balloons to wear out more quickly. The mass flow rates generated by both drives are similar with a slight advantage for the yoke mechanism. Finally, typical aortic, atrial and left ventricular pressure plots during the cardiac cycle are also shown."

This relationship involves mechanisms like endothelial dysfunction, arterial stiffness, and accelerated atherosclerosis, which contribute to impaired coronary perfusion and increased cardiovascular risk. Various studies have highlighted the high prevalence of CAD among hypertensive patients and the role of blood pressure management in reducing cardiovascular events. Ayurveda offers a holistic approach, focusing on doshic balance, detoxification, and lifestyle interventions to manage CAD and HTN. A case study was conducted at Jeena Sikho Lifecare Limited Clinic, Guwahati, involving a 46-year-old female diagnosed with CAD. The patient presented with symptoms of breathlessness, bradycardia, chest tightness, and weakness. After receiving Ayurvedic treatment, significant improvements were noted. Coronary angiography revealed severe CAD with Triple Vessel Disease, but follow-up echocardiography indicated stable left ventricular function, with no worsening of mitral regurgitation or development of new symptoms. The patient’s condition stabilized with preserved heart function, highlighting the efficacy of integrating Ayurvedic therapies alongside conventional treatment for CAD management. This case study underscores the potential of Ayurveda in managing CAD, improving symptoms, and promoting overall health. Holistic Ayurvedic therapies, including dietary adjustments, lifestyle modifications, and Ayurvedic interventions, appear to offer significant benefits in conjunction with standard medical care for cardiovascular diseases."

OpenAlex,mitral regurgitation,NF1 with Multiple Cardiac Structural Abnormalities Leading to Cerebral Infarction,J. Ye; Yiyi Jiang; Hanmin Wang; Dan Wang,10.3390/diagnostics16010163,2026-01-04,Diagnostics,"Background/Objectives: Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is an autosomal dominant disorder driven by mutations in the NF1 gene, whose pathogenesis centers on the loss of neurofibromin function and subsequent hyperactivation of the RAS/MAPK pathway. Notably, to the best of our knowledge and following a systematic literature search conducted by our research team, no cases of NF1 complicated by severe cardiac structural abnormalities that ultimately lead to cerebral infarction have been reported to date. Thus, it is of paramount importance to avoid missed diagnosis by performing comprehensive cardiac-related examinations in patients with NF1. Case Presentation: A 20-year-old male patient diagnosed with NF1 presented with right-sided limb weakness and was initially identified with cerebral infarction. To clarify the underlying etiology, a comprehensive clinical evaluation was performed, including cardiac imaging assessments (to characterize cardiac structural changes) and whole-exome sequencing (to identify the presence of procoagulant gene mutations). Comprehensive evaluation revealed a spectrum of cardiac structural abnormalities in the patient: aortic valve prolapse with severe regurgitation, non-infective vegetations on the aortic valve leaflets, mild-to-moderate mitral regurgitation, left ventricular hypertrophy and dilation, and left atrial dilation. Whole-exome sequencing detected exclusively a pathogenic variant in the NF1 gene, with no other pathogenic/likely pathogenic variants or thrombophilia-associated polymorphisms being found. Laboratory investigations ruled out infectious etiologies, supporting the notion that NF1-mediated cardiac structural and developmental anomalies are the primary driver of cardiac vegetation formation, given the absence of other identified contributing factors; embolization of one such vegetation ultimately led to both splenic and cerebral infarction. Conclusions: This case emphasizes the necessity of implementing early and proactive cardiac evaluations in patients with NF1. Additionally, for NF1 individuals—particularly those presenting with suggestive vascular or cardiac symptoms—a comprehensive multifactorial assessment of thrombotic risk is critical. Collectively, maintaining clinical vigilance for cardiac abnormalities in NF1 patients and avoiding diagnostic oversight is essential to reduce life-threatening risks."
OpenAlex,mitral regurgitation,Apico-aortic conduit in Gaucher’s disease with porcelain aorta case report: a less invasive alternative,Varun Shetty; Divyanshi Shukla; Meenakshi Bhat; Govind Datta Chamarthi,10.1186/s43057-025-00184-y,2026-01-03,The Cardiothoracic Surgeon,"Abstract Background Gaucher’s disease (GD) Type IIIc, linked to the D409H mutation, can cause severe cardiovascular calcification and porcelain aorta, making conventional aortic surgery hazardous. We present a case where an apico-aortic conduit offered a safer alternative. Case presentation A 20-year-old woman with Type IIIc GD (homozygous D409H mutation) presented with New York Heart Association (NYHA) Class III dyspnoea, palpitations, and syncope. She had hypertension, hypothyroidism, and a sibling deceased from the same condition. On enzyme replacement therapy for 6 years, she was found to have severe calcification of the aortic valve, root, and ascending aorta, stenosis of arch vessels, grade II aortic regurgitation, mild mitral stenosis, and proximal left anterior descending artery stenosis. Intraoperatively, extensive calcification precluded root and arch reconstruction. A left ventricular apex–descending thoracic aorta conduit with a mechanical valve was constructed, combined with coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) to the left anterior descending artery and an innominate artery bypass. Recovery was uneventful, and follow-up at 13 months showed the patient in NYHA Class I with patent conduit and grafts. Conclusions An apico–aortic conduit can provide a safe and effective solution in GD with porcelain aorta, avoiding high-risk aortic manipulation. To our knowledge, this is the first reported use of a valved conduit in Gaucher-related calcification, broadening surgical options for this complex patient group."
OpenAlex,mitral regurgitation,The Incremental Role of Stress Echocardiography in Valvular Heart Disease: A Narrative Review,Adriana Correra; Alfredo Mauriello; Carmen Del Giudice; Celeste Fonderico; Matilde Di Peppo; Vincenzo Russo; Antonello D’Andrea; Giovanni Esposito; Natale Daniele Brunetti,10.3390/diagnostics16010148,2026-01-02,Diagnostics,"Background/Objectives: The diagnosis and risk stratification of valvular heart disease have traditionally relied on resting echocardiography. However, in a significant portion of patients, resting findings do not fully reflect the hemodynamic severity of the condition, particularly in asymptomatic individuals with severe valvular disease or those with nonspecific symptoms. In this context, stress echocardiography emerges as a vital imaging modality, providing a dynamic assessment of valvular, ventricular, and pulmonary function under hemodynamic load (from physical exercise or pharmacological agents). Methods: We conducted a comprehensive synthesis and critical evaluation of the current landscape, recent advancements, and future directions regarding the application of stress echocardiography in valvular heart disease. Results: This comprehensive review explores the incremental role of stress echocardiography in valvular heart disease, analyzing the evolution of its clinical applications, from low-flow, low-gradient aortic stenosis to the evaluation of contractile reserve and exercise-induced pulmonary hypertension in mitral stenosis and regurgitation. We discuss standardized protocols, key parameters to monitor, and the diagnostic and prognostic outcomes from major clinical trials and current guidelines. Attention is given to stress echocardiography’s ability to unmask the true severity of the disease and to identify patients at high risk for adverse events, thereby guiding crucial clinical decisions, such as the optimal timing for surgical or transcatheter intervention. Conclusions: The review evaluates the limitations of modality and outlines future research directions, including its integration with new technologies like 3D echocardiography and speckle tracking techniques, to further optimize the role of stress echocardiography as a decision-making tool in the multidisciplinary management of valvular heart disease."
