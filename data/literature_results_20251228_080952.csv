PubMed,aortic stenosis,Measurement of myocardial extracellular volume fraction and cardiomyocyte diameter before and 6 months after aortic valve replacement in patients with severe aortic stenosis.,Noor Sharrack; Alex Makins; John D Biglands; Peter Kellman; Sven Plein; David L Buckley,10.1016/j.jocmr.2025.102679,2025-12-25,Journal of cardiovascular magnetic resonance : official journal of the Society for Cardiovascular Magnetic Resonance,"Extra cellular volume fraction (ECV) is an independent predictor of mortality in aortic stenosis (AS). ECV can be measured using myocardial T1 maps acquired before and after contrast administration. Standard ECV measurements do not consider the limited rate of water exchange (WX) between cardiomyocytes and the extracellular matrix which can result in underestimated ECV at higher contrast agent concentrations.
The objective was to estimate ECV in patients with severe AS before and after surgical aortic valve replacement (AVR) using a 2-site exchange model (2SXM) that also enables estimates of the intracellular lifetime of water (τic; an indicator of the minor diameter of the cardiomyocytes).
20 patients (67 ± 6 years) with severe AS, referred for AVR, underwent MRI on a 3T MR system before and 6 months after AVR. T1 measurements were made using a multiparametric saturation-recovery single-shot acquisition before and at multiple time points post-injection of contrast agent. A 2SXM and standard linear model (LM) were used to estimate ECV and, when combined with indexed left ventricular mass (LVMI), to calculate cell and matrix volumes, (LVMI x (1-ECV)/1.05) and (LVMI x ECV/1.05), respectively. The 2SXM model was also used to estimate τic.
Data were acquired before and 174 (157 to 267) days after AVR. LVMI reduced following AVR, from 78 ± 15g/m2 to 63 ± 11g/m2 (p<0.001). ECV estimates increased from 22 ± 3% to 28 ± 5% (p<0.001) using the LM compared to 28 ± 5% to 32 ± 4% (p=0.005) using the 2SXM. Indexed cell volume decreased from 58 ± 12 cm3/m2 to 43 ± 9 cm3/m2 (p < 0.001; LM) and from 54 ± 12 cm3/m2 to 41 ± 8 cm3/m2 (p<0.001; 2SXM). Indexed matrix volume did not change significantly by either method (LM, 16 ± 4 cm3/m2 to 17 ± 3 cm3/m2; 2SXM, 20 ± 5 cm3/m2 to 19 ± 3 cm3/m2). τic decreased from 0.21 ± 0.12s to 0.12 ± 0.09s (p=0.007).
Cellular hypertrophy regressed 6 months following AVR; the extracellular matrix volume did not change significantly. τic decreased post-AVR indicating that the reduction in cell volume can be largely attributed to a reduction in cardiomyocyte diameter."

PubMed, Scopus, Embase, Web of Science, and the Cochrane Library were systematically searched for studies comparing SU-AVR with TAVR. Risk ratios (RR) with 95 % confidence intervals (CIs) were computed for binary outcomes. Trial sequential analysis (TSA) was performed to assess whether the results in our meta-analysis were conclusive.
This systematic review and meta-analysis included 22 observational studies of symptomatic patients. When comparing SU-AVR to TAVR, similar risk of in-hospital mortality (RR 0.67, 95 % CI 0.37-1.24, p = 0.20, I2 = 15.1 %) and two-year mortality (RR 0.73, 95 % CI 0.39-1.37, p = 0.32, I2 = 61.5 %) were noted. However, SU-AVR was associated with significantly lower 30-day mortality (RR 0.46, 95 % CI 0.28-0.75, p = 0.002, I2 = 0.9 %), total number of valvular leakages (RR 0.13, 95 % CI 0.05-0.32, p < 0.00, I2 = 59.5 %), and one-year mortality (RR 0.51, 95 % CI 0.32-0.80, p = 0.003, I2 = 0.0 %). In the TSA analysis, 30-day mortality, one-year mortality, and total leakage rate showed true-positive results in the method. The two-year mortality rate yielded false-negative results due to the too low required information size.
In patients with aortic stenosis, SU-AVR was associated with similar in-hospital mortality and two-year mortality rates compared with TAVR; however, it was associated with significantly lower 30-day mortality, total number of valvular leakages, and one-year mortality rates."

ODYSSEY-HCM was a phase 3, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial that enrolled adults with symptomatic nHCM and left ventricular ejection fraction ≥ 60% to receive mavacamten, a selective cardiac myosin inhibitor, or placebo for 48 weeks with dose titration guided by serial echocardiography. The co-primary endpoints were the change in peak oxygen uptake and the 23-item Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire clinical summary score. Mavacamten produced clear pharmacodynamic effects manifested by reductions in circulating markers of myocardial stress and imaging indices consistent with modest reverse remodelling, but it did not produce statistically significant improvement in the prespecified co-primary clinical endpoints at 48 weeks. Treatment was associated with an increased incidence of reversible reductions in ejection fraction necessitating protocol-mandated dose interruption, indicating a constrained therapeutic window in this cohort. Collectively, the data demonstrate target engagement without definitive patient-centered benefit over the study interval. Further evaluation is required, including randomized trials of agents with alternative pharmacokinetic and titration properties, studies with extended exposure, and phenotype-enriched enrollment, to determine whether biomarker and imaging responses can be translated into sustained improvements in functional capacity and health-related quality of life in patients with nHCM."

We retrospectively analyzed 123 patients with suspected AIS who underwent both brain CTP and whole-body CT between April 2022 and May 2025. Image quality, vascular and parenchymal CT values, diagnostic findings, and incidence of post-contrast acute kidney injury (PC-AKI) were assessed. A control group of 115 patients who underwent dynamic contrast-enhanced CT of the chest and abdomen was used for comparison.
The proposed protocol achieved high CT values (≥ 350 HU) in major vessels and comparable CT enhancement in organs compared to the control group. Visual assessment yielded very high scores (vessels, 4.975; organs, 3.725) and complete inter-reader agreement (vessels, k = 0.98; organs, k = 0.877). Only one patient (0.8%) who underwent mechanical thrombectomy developed PC-AKI. Whole-body CT revealed clinically significant vascular disease (including aortic dissection, pulmonary embolism, and severe carotid stenosis) in 14.6% of cases and incidental suspected malignancy in 5.7% of cases.
Following brain CTP, whole-body CT enables the detection of significant vascular and incidental findings in patients with suspected AIS and provides valuable diagnostic information. This protocol, which utilizes low-tube voltage and SPBI, is a simple, time-efficient, and safe method that enhances vascular and organ contrast, supporting its clinical utility in AIS diagnosis."
PubMed,aortic stenosis,Surgeon Volume Affects Technical Success and Subsequent Outcomes following Complex Endovascular Aneurysm Repair.,Thomas F X O'Donnell; Beatrix Choi; Alexandra Sansosti; Kirsten D Dansey; Sara L Zettervall; Patric Liang; Nicholas Swerdlow; Marc L Schermerhorn; Bernardo C Mendes; Hiroo Takayama; Adham Elmously; Virendra I Patel,10.1016/j.ejvs.2025.12.041,2025-12-23,European journal of vascular and endovascular surgery : the official journal of the European Society for Vascular Surgery,"Although complex endovascular repairs are becoming increasingly common, complication rates are less well studied, and published rates of technical success vary widely. In addition, whether high volume surgeons are more able to rescue intra-operative complications has not been well studied.
This study analysed all complex abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) repairs in the Vascular Quality Initiative from 2014 to 2023. Multilevel logistic regression with inverse probability weighting was used to identify factors associated with lack of technical success (defined as successful introduction of the main graft, incorporation of all target vessels without occlusion or stenosis > 50%, and no type I/III endoleaks). Secondary analyses assessed the differential impact of type I/III endoleaks compared with graft/target vessel complications.
There were 6 556 repairs (3 246 para/juxtarenal AAAs and 3 310 thoraco-abdominal aortic aneurysms) with an overall technical success rate of 82.7%; technical failures were due to type I/III endoleak in 9.6%, target vessel complications in 5.6%, and complications with the main body in 4.0%. Technical success increased in concert with volume in crude and adjusted analyses. Technical failure was associated with a markedly higher adjusted odds of peri-operative death, thoraco-abdominal life altering events, acute kidney injury, dialysis, spinal cord ischaemia, and re-operation. Repairs with technical failure at the hands of higher volume surgeons were less likely to experience death than cases of technical failure in the hands of lower volume surgeons (p < .01 for interaction). Technical success was similarly associated with higher 5 year survival (86% vs. 65%; p < .001). Both type I/III endoleaks and branch/main body complications were associated with worse peri-operative outcomes and lower 5 year survival. Although type I/III endoleaks had less impact than branch/main body complications in elective settings, in symptomatic/ruptured settings.
Technical success had a strong association with outcomes of endovascular complex AAA repair, especially in non-elective settings. Higher volume surgeons had higher rates of technical success, and their outcomes were less negatively impacted by technical failures, suggesting a potential benefit to centralising more urgent and complex cases."

Advances,"Women with significant aortic stenosis (AS) are under-represented among patients undergoing aortic valve replacement in the United States as compared with men despite similar disease prevalence.
This study evaluated the impact of sex on the clinical recognition of significant AS following diagnostic transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE).
Using data from a large administrative multicenter database, we assessed rates of clinical diagnosis of AS defined by assignment of an Internal Classification Diagnosis (ICD) code for AS following a diagnostic TTE. Fine-Gray models were used to evaluate the 1-year cumulative rate of AS diagnosis by sex, AS severity, and AS phenotype accounting for competing risk of death.
Among 2,036 included patients (48.9% female, 51.1% male), the 1-year rate of clinical recognition following a diagnostic TTE with at least moderate AS was low (52.4%), and women were less likely as compared with men to receive a clinical diagnosis of AS (55.7% male vs 48.9% female; P = 0.003). Specifically, among patients with severe AS, women were less likely to receive an ICD diagnosis as compared with males (64.1% vs 74.3%), driven primarily by lower rates of clinical recognition of severe low gradient AS (66.9% male vs 54.3% female; P = 0.004).
Rates of clinical recognition of AS following a diagnostic TTE are low, and vary significantly by sex, AS disease severity, and severe AS phenotype. Further studies are needed to maximize the clinical recognition of TTE-confirmed AS and to mitigate sex disparities in diagnosis and treatment."

The disease's progression is driven by a combination of mechanical stress, lipid infiltration, and immune responses, which involve both innate and adaptive immune systems. To explore the role of immune-related proteins in CAVD, we applied a targeted proteomic approach based on the proximity extension assay technique. Ten proteins were downregulated in patients with CAVD with respect to control subjects, indicating disrupted biological processes such as redox homeostasis, immune response, and cell motility. A protein-protein interaction network revealed connections between these proteins, with notable clusters associated with immune regulation and redox homeostasis. Further analysis identified two distinct patient subgroups, suggesting heterogeneity among patients with CAVD, which could help with patient stratification. The study identified proteins that may serve as candidate biomarkers for early detection of CAVD and emphasizes the role of immune-driven mechanisms in CAVD."

With treatment for severe AS limited to valve replacement and no effective pharmacotherapies, new interventions are urgently needed for patients. This study evaluated pemafibrate, a selective peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha (PPARα) activator as a novel therapeutic for CAVD and AS.
In an aortic valve wire injury (AVWI) model of AS in Ldlr ⁻/⁻ mice, pemafibrate administration (0.2 mg/kg/day) for 15 weeks improved aortic valve function and reduced valvular calcification by 39% (p<0.001), accompanied by reduced leaflet inflammation and CD68⁺ macrophage infiltration. These effects were independent of changes in plasma triglyceride levels. In vitro , pemafibrate suppressed inflammation-mediated calcification of primary human valvular interstitial cells (VICs) by modulating macrophage-derived secreted factors, identifying macrophage-VIC crosstalk as a key disease mechanism. Direct treatment of macrophages with pemafibrate, or exposure to serum from pemafibrate-treated participants in the PROMINENT randomized controlled trial, shifted macrophages toward a less inflammatory and less chemotactic phenotype. Proteomic analyses of patient serum substantiated these findings by reflecting a systemic reduction in inflammatory parameters and monocyte activation. Network integration of the in vitro derived pemafibrate-responsive proteome with human calcified AV tissue proteomes identified aberrant protein translation (GNB2L1, GSPT1) and disrupted bioenergetics (MYDGF, PDIA4) as potential clinically relevant pemafibrate-responsive pathways and effector proteins relevant to AS progression.
Pemafibrate slows experimental AS progression and valve calcification through modulation of macrophage-VIC crosstalk, independent of lipid lowering. These findings support further evaluation of pemafibrate as a potential pharmacological approach for CAVD and support further testing in randomized clinical trials."

Imaging methods and practice,"Bicuspid aortic valve (BAV) stenosis complicates transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) planning, with no validated automated measurement algorithm available. We developed Cardioverse, the first fully automated deep learning algorithm for BAV anatomical assessment in TAVR planning.
We conducted a large-scale, multicenter retrospective study encompassing 1,147 consecutive patients with BAV undergoing TAVR across 16 high-volume Chinese centers (March 2019-February 2023). Cardioverse was trained on this cohort and evaluated in an internal (n = 437) and external (n = 110) validation cohorts. Our novel Cardioverse algorithm demonstrated exceptional segmentation performance across all anatomical targets with Dice similarity coefficients >0.97 for coronary cusps and ostia. Critically, the algorithm achieved unprecedented workflow efficiency gains: 80% reduction in assessment time [241.0 IQR (181.0, 297.0) vs. 1251.0 IQR (872.0, 1408.0) seconds], 85% reduction in user interactions [57.0 IQR (45.0, 78.0) vs. 382.5 IQR (285.5, 475.0) clicks], and 87% reduction in manual effort [7.5 IQR (4.8, 9.3) vs. 57.2 IQR (43.5, 68.4) meters mouse movement] compared to expert observers (P < 0.001). Importantly, accuracy was maintained across all BAV phenotypes with correlation coefficients >0.91 for all critical measurements, including annular dimensions, calcification quantification, and aortic root morphology assessment.
Cardioverse transforms pre-TAVR assessment for BAV patients, offering a validated solution combining accuracy and efficiency. It reduces assessment time from over 20 min to < 5 min, addressing the need for standardized, rapid, and reliable BAV evaluation. Its robust performance across diverse BAV phenotypes makes it a crucial tool for enhancing TAVR planning consistency.

Numerous randomised controlled trials have consistently demonstrated the safety and efficacy of TAV implantation compared with surgical aortic valve replacement, prompting an expansion of indications towards lower surgical risk, often younger, patients. In parallel, the number and types of TAV prosthesis have also increased. Although all devices have generally demonstrated favourable procedural and longer-term clinical outcomes, variations in frame design, material properties and leaflet configurations render specific devices more favourable in certain settings. In this review, we describe key differences in TAV design and how this may affect the choice of TAV prosthesis in the challenging clinical scenarios of patients with small annuli, coronary disease, long life expectancy, risk of permanent pacing and aortic regurgitation, which are expected to be encountered more frequently as indications for TAV implantation expand."

Case reports,"Recent evidences have supported the use of transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) across all risk categories of patients. However, in case of young patients several points should be considered in a lifetime perspective taking into account both surgical and percutaneous therapies.
An 82-year-old man with a history of aortic valve disease treated 12 years earlier with surgical aortic valve and aortic root replacement was admitted for worsening dyspnoea. Echocardiogram showed degenerated surgical bioprosthesis with severe regurgitation. Due to prior surgery and high operative risk, the heart team opted for valve-in-valve TAVI. The procedure was successful and the patient remained asymptomatic at 30-day follow-up.
This case shows how to approach aortic valve disease in a lifetime perspective. Surgical and percutaneous approaches can be used in multiple combinations according to patient's age, anatomical characteristics and personal preferences."

Cardiovascular interventions,"Patients with severe aortic regurgitation (AR) frequently face high surgical risks, rendering them ineligible for surgery. Transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) is now a primary therapy for aortic valve stenosis. However, its application in pure native AR has been relatively limited.
The aim of this study was to evaluate the mid-term efficacy and safety of a novel self-expanding transfemoral TAVR device designed for treating pure native AR.
A prospective, single-arm clinical trial (ChiCTR2300075152) enrolled 110 consecutive patients with severe pure AR from 15 centers. The Pioneer Valve system with a rotatable feature and 3 independently angle-adjustable locators was used. Outcomes up to 1-year follow-up were reported per Valve Academic Research Consortium 3 criteria. The median clinical follow-up duration was 348 days (Q1-Q3: 342-357 days).
The mean age was 73.37 ± 4.21 years, with a median Society of Thoracic Surgeons score of 5.97% (Q1-Q3: 4.04%-8.63%). Technical success was achieved in 109 of 110 cases (99.1%), and valve migration occurred in 1 case. Mean aortic valve gradient and mean effective orifice area at 30 days were 7.88 ± 2.7 mm Hg and 2.2 ± 0.64 cm2, respectively. New permanent pacemaker implantation occurred in 23 of 105 cases (21.9%; 95% CI: 14.3%-29.8%). All-cause mortality was 3 of 110 (2.7%; 95% CI: 0.9%-8.3%) at 1 year. Significant improvements in NYHA functional class, Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire score, and positive left ventricular remodeling were observed up to 1 year.
This study demonstrates that the Pioneer Valve provides a safe and effective alternative for high-risk or inoperable patients with severe pure AR, achieving favorable mid-term outcomes with stable hemodynamic performance."

In this study, we designed a polysaccharide-based carrier (HF-AF) from fucoidan, featuring a dynamic supramolecular structure. A dynamic supramolecular network was established within this carrier via dynamic supramolecular interactions between hydroxypropyl-β-cyclodextrin and adamantane-methylamine. The anti-inflammatory compound tilianin, formulated into nanocrystals (Til NCs), was then encapsulated to create a shear-responsive nanosystem (HF-AF@Til NCs). The system's primary therapeutic strategy is its response to pathological hemodynamic forces: upon encountering high shear stress at a stenosis, the supramolecular network undergoes dissociation, triggering a mechanically-gated release of the encapsulated Til NCs. This shear-triggered function is complemented by the natural P-selectin affinity of the fucoidan backbone, which facilitates the anchoring of the nanocarrier at the inflamed lesion site. This sophisticated ""anchor-and-release"" mechanism enables superior drug accumulation precisely at plaque sites. In ApoE-/- atherosclerotic mice, HF-AF@Til NCs significantly reduced aortic lipid deposition and exerted potent anti-atherosclerotic effects by modulating macrophage polarization, inhibiting the NF-κ-B signaling pathway, and improving lipid profiles. In conclusion, this shear-responsive nanodelivery system, which leverages a targeting polysaccharide, effectively enhances drug accumulation and therapeutic efficacy at atherosclerotic lesions, demonstrating significant potential for the targeted therapy of atherosclerosis."

Our primary outcomes were short cardiovascular and non-cardiovascular mortality as well as long-term mortality. We combined aggregate data meta-analysis for dichotomous outcomes using incidence rate ratio (IRR) with reconstructed time-to-event data derived from published Kaplan-Meier curves using validated algorithms.
Seventeen studies were included. Overall, AVR was associated with a significantly lower risk of all-cause mortality compared with conservative management (IRR = 0.43; 95% CI, 0.32-0.57; p < 0.001). Cardiovascular mortality was also significantly reduced with AVR (IRR = 0.47; 95% CI, 0.29-0.75; p < 0.01; I2 = 62%). The risk of heart failure hospitalization was markedly lower among AVR recipients (IRR = 0.39; 95% CI, 0.22-0.67; p < 0.01), with consistent benefit across study designs. AVR was further associated with a substantial reduction in sudden cardiac death (IRR = 0.13; 95% CI, 0.04-0.48; p < 0.01) and myocardial infarction (IRR = 0.11; 95% CI, 0.04-0.31; p = 0.03). The risk of stroke was not significantly different between groups (IRR = 0.77; 95% CI, 0.58-1.02; p = 0.07). Reconstructed Kaplan-Meier analyses demonstrated durable long-term survival benefit with AVR, consistent across surgical and transcatheter approaches.
Patients with asymptomatic AS, managed with either SAVR or TAVR, were associated with lower short- and long-term mortality compared to conservative management."

Results: Compared to the standard, TNC images at 1.5 mm intervals showed higher AVCS (mean difference: -290 ± 418, p < 0.001), with high reproducibility between techniques (CS: ICC 0.969, [IQR 0.962, 0.975]). Compared with reference, VNC showed no significant differences in AVCS at either slice intervals, with excellent reproducibility (3.0 mm, ICC 0.970 [0.963, 0.976]; 1.5 mm, ICC 0.971 [0.964, 0.977]). Compared to TNC 3.0 mm, strong concordance was observed using other reconstruction techniques in assessing severe AV calcification (κ = 0.81 [95% CI: 0.74-0.88], 0.83 [95% CI: 0.76-0.90], and 0.83 [95% CI: 0.76-0.90] for TNC at 1.5 mm, VNC at 3.0 mm, and 1.5 mm, respectively), with low misclassification rates. Conclusions: Our study highlights high reproducibility in the evaluation of AVCS by VNC reconstruction at 3.0 and 1.5 mm intervals compared with reference offering a reliable alternative with an excellent diagnostic accuracy."

Fatty acids (FAs) play a crucial role in these processes. A treatment option for severe symptomatic AS in elderly and high-risk patients is transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI).
To investigate the change in FA profiles in patients undergoing TAVI.
This single-center prospective study included 25 patients with severe AS qualified for TAVI procedure. Blood samples were collected before TAVI and after six months. FA profiles were analyzed by gas chromatography-electron ionization mass spectrometry.
Notable changes were identified in FA profiles, including a reduction in docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) levels (117 ± 48.0 µM vs. 141 ± 53.0 µM, p = 0.001) and an increase in alpha-linolenic acid (ALA) concentration (32.8 ± 12.3 µM vs. 19.9 ± 6.40 µM, p = 0.003) six months post-TAVI. Additionally, significant elevations were noted in specific medium-chain FAs (C12) and branched-chain fatty acids (iso C16, iso C17 and anteiso C15, anteiso C17) at six months after TAVI. However, total n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (n3 PUFA) levels decreased (p = 0.039), while n-6 polyunsaturated fatty acids (n6 PUFA) levels exhibited no significant overall change at this time point. Decrease in mean pressure gradient (PG) was negatively correlated with eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), DHA, n-3 docosapentaenoic acid (DPA n3) and n3 PUFA levels in a six-month observation.
Our results underscore the complex interplay between cardiac intervention and FA changes, providing novel insights into the metabolic impact of TAVI on FAs serum profile."

It may present with systemic anomalies (Axenfeld-Rieger syndrome) or without (Axenfeld anomaly) and may sometimes be associated with multiple congenital malformations. The estimated prevalence ranges from 1 in 50,000 to 1 in 200,000 live births, with an approximate rate of 1 in 100,000, but no epidemiological studies have been conducted to date. A clinical diagnosis of Axenfeld-Rieger syndrome requires the presence of both Axenfeld and Rieger ocular anomalies, accompanied by extraocular systemic features. Ocular manifestations include iris abnormalities, posterior embryotoxon, juvenile-onset glaucoma (a common complication), and dysgenesis of the iridocorneal angle with iridocorneal adhesions. The most commonly observed systemic anomalies include: umbilical defects; craniofacial dysmorphism; dentofacial abnormalities, such as Class III malocclusion due to maxillary hypoplasia, oligodontia, dental malformations (taurodontism, root dysplasia), microdontia, hypodontia, and anodontia; hearing impairment (partial or complete sensorineural hearing loss); and cardiac anomalies, including non-congenital heart disease and mitral valve insufficiency. Additional anomalies may include hypospadias in males, anal stenosis, endocrine disorders (notably growth retardation) secondary to pituitary dysfunction, psychomotor delay, and various neurological malformations such as Dandy-Walker malformation, mega cisterna magna, posterior fossa cysts, cerebellar vermis hypoplasia, ventriculomegaly, aprosencephaly, cerebral atrophy, microcephaly, arteriovenous malformations (AVM), and digital anomalies such as camptodactyly. Diagnosis is typically made in infancy, based on iris anomalies such as corectopia (displacement of the pupil), polycoria (multiple pupils), and iris hypoplasia. Posterior embryotoxon is frequently observed upon slit-lamp examination. Given the clinical variability, a comprehensive pediatric assessment is essential to identify systemic anomalies and distinguish Axenfeld-Rieger syndrome from the isolated Axenfeld anomaly."

A contemporary review.,Ovidio A García-Villarreal,10.24875/GMM.25000018,2025,Gaceta medica de Mexico,"Functional mitral regurgitation (FMR) is the consequence of a series of geometric and functional alterations in the left ventricle, which precipitate structural changes in the mitral valve (MV). Left ventricular remodeling, whether global or localized, generates abnormal tension or tethering of the papillary muscles and chordae tendineae, thereby compromising proper MV closure. Given that FMR is often associated with coronary artery disease, the surgical indication for concomitant MV surgery with coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) is unequivocal. However, the surgical indication for isolated MV surgery in patients with FMR without the need for CABG or other concomitant surgical procedures is more contentious. Excluding the indications for non-surgical procedures, this article examines the context and current status of isolated MV surgery in FMR. Furthermore, a potential decision-making algorithm for surgical interventions in patients with FMR is presented, based on the current accumulated evidence."

Case reports,"Libman-Sacks endocarditis is a form of non-bacterial thrombotic endocarditis, associated with autoimmune conditions such as systemic lupus erythematosus and antiphospholipid syndrome (APLS). Vegetations are usually small and are managed with immunosuppression and anticoagulation.
A 50-year-old female presented to her hospital with left leg weakness, with imaging showing a right parietal stroke and an old occipital lobe stroke. Inpatient transthoracic echocardiography showed a large mitral valve (MV) vegetation with moderate-to-severe mitral regurgitation (MR). She self-discharged against medical advice before further workup could be completed and was lost to follow-up until persuaded to have an outpatient transoesophageal echocardiogram, which showed severe MR with a large (2 cm × 3 cm) mass attached to the posterior MV leaflet. Blood cultures were negative. Review of previous blood tests showed a triple-positive APLS panel, which was positive on repeat testing. She underwent successful mechanical MV replacement. Valve histology was consistent with Libman-Sacks endocarditis. Warfarin therapy was continued, complicated by subdural haematoma (successfully treated), but with no further thrombo-embolic events. Subsequent anti-nuclear antigen testing was positive, and hydroxychloroquine was commenced. Transoesophageal echocardiography 1 year later showed a well-functioning MV prosthesis.
The management of young individuals with ischaemic stroke should include attention to atypical causes. Libman-Sacks endocarditis is usually associated with small vegetations and high thrombotic risk, usually managed medically with anticoagulation and treatment of underlying conditions. Our case was atypical, with the presence of a large vegetation causing significant valvular dysfunction, but it demonstrates that replacement with mechanical prostheses can be a feasible management strategy."

We sought to: validate right ventricular (RV) stroke volumes (SV3DE) and tricuspid regurgitant volumes (RegVol3DE) measured by three-dimensional echocardiography (3DE). Then, we compared the quantitative metrics used to assess TR severity obtained by 3DE and both the conventional and the corrected PISA methods.
3DE RV and left ventricular (LV) SV were collected simultaneously with direct Fick measurements at right heart catheterization (RVSVRHC) in 45 patients (66±14 years, 76% women) with no or trivial TR, and in 57 consecutive patients (73±13 years, 61% women) with mild to torrential (14% mild, 37% moderate, 26% severe, 16% massive, and 7% torrential) TR, and mild or no mitral or aortic regurgitation. In the latter group, RHC and 3DE were combined to derive TR regurgitant volume (RegVol3DE-RHC=RVSV3DE-RVSVRHC) and compared to the 3DE volumetric RegVol (RegVol3DE =RVSV3DE-LVSV3DE). Effective regurgitant orifice area (EROA) and regurgitant fraction (RegFr) were calculated from RegVol3DE, as well as through conventional and corrected PISA methods.
The feasibility of RVSV3DE was 74%. Among patients with no or trivial TR, RVSV3DE and RVSVRHC showed a strong correlation (R2= 0.916, p<0.0001), with a minimal bias (3.7 mL) and reasonable precision (limits of agreement, LOA: -10 mL;18 mL). In those with mild to torrential TR, RegVol3DE correlated with RegVol3DE-RHC (R2=0.918, p<0.0001) and was accurate (bias= -1.3 mL, LOA:-17.9 mL;15.2 mL). EROA, RegVol and RegFr derived from conventional PISA (0.48±0.4 cm2, 38±20 mL, and 36±18%, respectively) were significantly smaller (p<0.05) than those obtained from corrected PISA (0.61±0.5 cm2, 48±24 mL, and 46±24 %, respectively), and volumetric 3DE (0.62±0.5 cm2, 46±25 mL, and 42±18%, respectively).

Although left ventricular systolic function is usually preserved, subclinical myocardial dysfunction may be present. Global longitudinal strain (GLS) is a sensitive parameter for detecting early myocardial impairment.
This study aimed to evaluate subclinical myocardial dysfunction in children with ARF-related carditis using GLS and other strain parameters and to assess its progression over a one-year follow-up period according to the severity of mitral regurgitation (MR).
A total of 30 children with ARF-related carditis and preserved systolic function were prospectively enrolled. Patients were divided into two subgroups based on MR severity: moderate MR (Group 1, n = 12) and mild MR (Group 2, n = 18). Conventional echocardiographic parameters and speckle-tracking-derived strain measures were assessed at diagnosis, six months, and 12 months. GLS values were compared with those of age- and sex-matched healthy controls (n = 52).
At diagnosis, GLS was significantly lower in ARF patients than controls (-19.9 ± 2.86 vs. -22.6 ± 4.65; p = 0.02) and at six months (-20.4 ± 3.42 vs. -22.6 ± 4.65, p = 0.04). Although GLS improved in the mild MR subgroup (-21.9 ± 3.82 vs. -22.6 ± 4.65, p = 0.41), it remained significantly impaired in the moderate MR subgroup (-19.25 ± 3.32 vs. -22.6 ± 4.65, p < 0.01) at 12 months. In multivariable linear regression analysis, GLS was negatively correlated with the severity of valve regurgitation (r = -0.53, p = 0.02) and NT-proBNP (r = -0.62, p = 0.012).
GLS and NT-proBNP are sensitive indicators of subclinical myocardial dysfunction in children with ARF-related carditis, especially in those with moderate MR. Longitudinal strain imaging may enhance early detection and guide long-term monitoring."

Finally, 23 studies were included, all of which scored ≥7 on the Newcastle-Ottawa scale. Meta-analysis results showed that, the left ventricular end-systolic volume index (P < 0.01), left ventricular end-diastolic volume index (P < 0.01), and left ventricular mass index (P < 0.01) of patients with MR were higher than those of healthy individuals. In contrast, the left ventricular ejection fraction (P < 0.01) and global radial strain (GRS) (P < 0.01) of patients with MR was lower than that of healthy individuals; the difference was significant. The E/A of both groups (P = 0.22), global circumferential strain (P = 0.43), global longitudinal strain (P = 0.10), left ventricular relative wall thickness (P = 0.20), and some indexes with significant heterogeneity were analyzed by subgroup according to the degree of MR. The combined results of most subgroup analysis were consistent with the overall results and the heterogeneity was reduced.
There is significant difference in the GRS between patients with MR and healthy individuals, which can provide reference for evaluating left ventricular function in patients with MR."

Medical therapy alone is insufficient, and either TEER (transcatheter edge to edge) or surgery is recommended. Short- and long-term comparative outcomes remain unclear. We aim to address this gap using available data.
We performed a meta-analysis of studies examining the outcomes of surgery and/or transcatheter edge to edge. MEDLINE, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Library were assessed. The incidence rate of late severe MR was the primary outcome. A random model was performed. Leave-one-out, subgroup, and meta-regression analyses were conducted.
Thirty-two studies (1923 patients); 20 in surgery [1166] vs 12 in TEER [757]) were selected. TEER patients were, on average, 10 years older, with twice the rate of NYHA III/IV symptoms and more than double the STS score. At a weighted mean follow-up of 3.2 years, compared to isolated transcatheter, surgery was associated with decreased incidence of late severe mitral regurgitation (2.53 vs 6.66 events per 100 person-years, P-interaction = 0.03), late all-cause mortality (3.00 vs 8.84, P-interaction = 0.024), late heart failure hospitalization (4.44 vs 17.03, P-interaction < 0.01), and late NYHA III/IV (2.98 vs 22.47, P-interaction < 0.01). However, significantly better long-term outcomes associated with surgery showed high heterogeneity. There were no differences in early all-cause mortality, early cardiac-specific mortality, late cardiac-specific mortality, postprocedural morbidities nor atrial diameter. On meta-regression, preprocedural heart failure (Beta = 0.0224, P < 0.01) and coronary artery disease (Beta = 0.0294, P < 0.00001) were linked to increased late severe mitral regurgitation. Older age, hypertension, mitral valve replacement, and associated aortic valve surgery were linked to increased late all-cause mortality.
Surgery and isolated transcatheter edge-to-edge repair showed comparable short-term outcomes, with surgery appearing more effective long-term; however, due to study limitations and heterogeneity, these findings are hypothesis-generating and require validation through prospective studies."

Understanding the mechanism of MR, whether primary, due to intrinsic valve abnormalities, or secondary, resulting from atrial or ventricular remodeling, is essential for optimal management. Echocardiography, particularly advanced modalities such as three-dimensional imaging and strain analysis, plays a central role in this process. It allows accurate quantification of MR severity, detailed characterization of valve and ventricular anatomy, and assessment of remodeling, all of which are critical for determining the optimal timing for intervention. Beyond diagnosis, echocardiography is indispensable in guiding therapy selection: it informs surgical planning by defining leaflet pathology for repair versus replacement strategies, and directs transcatheter interventions by guiding interatrial septal puncture, catheter orientation, and device deployment in real time. While surgery remains the gold standard for primary MR, transcatheter approaches including edge-to-edge repair and emerging mitral valve replacement are increasingly relevant, particularly in patients at high surgical risk or with complex anatomy. This review emphasizes the pivotal role of echocardiography in the pre-procedural assessment of MR, highlighting its ability to integrate anatomical, functional, and hemodynamic information to guide patient-tailored therapeutic strategies and optimize outcomes within a Heart Team framework."

A substantial portion of patients with cardiogenic shock have concomitant severe mitral regurgitation (MR), which exacerbates hemodynamic instability by reducing forward cardiac output and contributes to pulmonary edema and respiratory failure through regurgitant backflow. In this high-risk setting, mitral transcatheter edge-to-edge repair (M-TEER) offers a minimally invasive treatment that can lead to hemodynamic and symptomatic improvement and potential mortality benefit. Initially indicated for patients with severe MR at prohibitive surgical risk, M-TEER is now guideline-supported for both primary and secondary MR in select populations. Emerging data suggest that M-TEER can reduce heart failure hospitalizations and improve patient quality of life. As clinical indications for M-TEER continue to expand, there is growing interest in the role of M-TEER as a stabilizing intervention in patients with cardiogenic shock and severe MR. This review aims to synthesize the current evidence surrounding the use of M-TEER in cardiogenic shock with a focus on patient selection, procedural and clinical considerations, and short- and long-term outcomes."

Several different transcatheter approaches were developed as therapeutic options in high-risk patients. Among them, the Carillon® Mitral Contour System, which offers a minimally invasive, trans- coronary-venous approach to indirect annuloplasty that reduces annular dimensions and improves leaflet coaptation without the need for transseptal access or manipulation of the mitral valve apparatus. A key advantage of Carillon lies in its extracardiac, leaflet-sparing mechanism. By acting from the lumen of coronary sinus and great cardiac vein, the device preserves the possibility of future interventions such as transcatheter edge-to-edge repair, direct annuloplasty, or even valve replacement, while still allowing successful placement of left ventricular pacing leads for cardiac resynchronization therapy. The current article provides the Carillon device characteristics and technical aspects of implantation procedure. The paper is an overview of the clinical studies and real-world registries conducted on the Carillon device, and the effectiveness of this treatment for functional mitral regurgitation.

This retrospective study included 67 individuals who underwent isolated, elective mitral valve repair with neochordae between 2019 and 2024. Participants were divided into the RAFF (n = 36) and non-RAFF (n = 31) groups. In the RAFF technique, chordal length is determined by referencing the anterior leaflet chordae from the ipsilateral papillary muscle, with loop sets anchored to the frontal head of the papillary muscle. Leaflet resection was not performed in any case. Baseline demographics and lesion characteristics were similar between groups. The RAFF group demonstrated significantly less residual mitral regurgitation at the conclusion of surgery (p = 0.014). Use of the RAFF method was significantly associated with suppression of postoperative leaflet billowing and a lower recurrence rate of moderate or greater mitral regurgitation during follow-up. Frontal fixation of posterior leaflet neochordae, a defining feature of the technique, resulted in a significant increase in coaptation length without inducing systolic anterior motion or elevating transvalvular gradients. The method also significantly reduced aortic cross-clamp time without compromising hemodynamic performance. The RAFF technique offers a standardized and anatomically guided approach to neochordae reconstruction. It minimizes inter-surgeon variability and anatomical inconsistencies, and promotes durable mitral competence by optimizing leaflet coaptation without incurring adverse events."

The differential diagnosis of this mass included a caseous calcification of the mitral annulus (CCMA), and intra-cardiac thrombus or tumor. Computed tomography imaging features were consistent with CCMA. Anticoagulation was administered for one month to rule out thrombus and to prevent systemic thromboembolism. The size of this mobile mass did not change but the severity of mitral regurgitation worsened from mild to moderate during the month. Surgical treatment was performed to prevent thromboembolism and treat mitral regurgitation. A biological mitral valve and tricuspid annular ring were implanted. The histopathologic examination of the excised mobile mass revealed fibrinous material with calcification. We report a case of CCMA that appeared in a short period of time, and the attached mobile mass was suggested to be the contents of CCMA.
1)A mobile high intensity echocardiographic mass consisting of fibrinous material with calcification is a characteristics feature of a caseous calcification of the mitral annulus (CCMA), and is suggested to be the contents of CCMA.2)Mitral regurgitation worsened over a short period in a patient with CCMA.3)CCMA with a mobile mass is extremely rare, and it is important to understand its clinical imaging features and clinical course."

This study aimed to develop a deep learning-based artificial intelligence (AI) model to detect MS using CXR.
In this retrospective study, 515 posteroanterior CXR images were analysed, including 285 from patients with MS and 230 from healthy controls. The dataset was randomly divided into training, validation and test datasets at a 7:2:1 ratio. An AI model was formulated by using the training dataset, and model performance was evaluated on the validation and test datasets using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), precision, recall, F1-score and accuracy. Saliency maps were generated to visualise the regions prioritised by the model.
The model achieved an AUC of 0.99 on the validation dataset, with a precision of 0.96, recall of 0.96, F1-score of 0.96 and accuracy of 0.96. On the test dataset, the model achieved an AUC of 0.99, with a precision of 0.95, recall of 0.94, F1-score of 0.94 and accuracy of 0.94.

We assessed the clinical profile, treatment, and outcomes of older HF patients managed in accredited units in Spain.
The SEC-Excelente-HF registry prospectively included 2,245 consecutive patients from 68 accredited HF units (2019-2023). Patients were stratified by age (< 75 years, n = 1267; ≥ 75 years, n = 973). Both hospitalized and outpatient patients were followed for 1 year. Data on demographics, comorbidities, therapies, and devices were collected. Primary outcomes were all-cause mortality, HF hospitalization, and their composite. Multivariable Cox models identified independent predictors of outcomes by age group.
Median age was 73 years, and 43.4% were ≥ 75 years. Older patients had higher prevalences of atrial fibrillation, valvular heart disease, chronic kidney disease, and anemia (all p < 0.001). Use of guideline-directed medical therapy was consistently lower in older patients, including RAAS inhibitors (69.2% vs 81.1%), beta-blockers (73.8% vs 87.1%), MRAs (46.2% vs 70.5%), and SGLT2 inhibitors (42.0% vs 62.4%; all p < 0.001).

Currently, there is no established, evidence-based medical therapy specifically designed for SRV failure, and treatment approaches are largely extrapolated from left ventricular heart failure (HF) guidelines. This therapeutic gap highlights the need for tailored pharmacologic strategies and optimized perioperative management in this unique population. The optimal timing of surgical intervention and the role of modern HF therapy are still under active investigation. (2) Methods: We present a case series of four patients (three adults and one child) with SRV dysfunction and severe TR, who underwent staged treatment consisting of optimized medical therapy followed by surgical tricuspid valve (TV) replacement. Medical therapy included positive inotropes, sacubitril/valsartan, sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 inhibitors (iSGLT2), beta-blockers, mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists (MRAs), and loop diuretics. (3) Results: All patients demonstrated clinical and hemodynamic improvement prior to surgery, with an increase in systemic ventricular ejection fraction (SVEF > 40%) and cardiac index. TV replacement was performed with favorable early postoperative outcomes and preserved ventricular function at mid-term follow-up. No mortality or major adverse events occurred during follow-up. One case of acute cystitis was associated with dapagliflozin. In all patients, postoperative SVEF remained >40%, and no recurrence of significant TR was observed. (4) Conclusions: A stepwise approach combining modern heart failure therapy and elective TV replacement in patients with SRV dysfunction and TR is safe and effective. Preoperative optimization leads to improved ventricular function and may enhance surgical outcomes. These findings support the integration of contemporary pharmacotherapy in the management strategy for SRV failure."

Transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) has emerged as a minimally invasive and effective alternative to surgical replacement, especially in elderly or high-risk patients. Objectives: The present study aims to assess the influence of the tricuspid annular plane systolic excursion (TAPSE)/pulmonary systolic arterial pressure (PASP) ratio on clinical outcomes in patients with aortic stenosis undergoing TAVR and offer valuable insights into patient selection and tailored management strategies for individuals undergoing TAVR. Methods: A retrospective analysis was conducted on 100 patients with AS who underwent TAVR, included in two distinct groups based on their median TAPSE/PASP ratio. Results: Patients were divided according to their median TAPSE/PASP ratio into two groups. Those with lower TAPSE/PASP ratios had a higher incidence of post-procedural atrial fibrillation (AF) (48% vs. 28%, p = 0.0404), lower left-ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) (41.06% vs. 49.50%, p < 0.0001), a more pronounced inflammatory and hematologic response, and longer hospitalization. Receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) analysis demonstrated modest but significant discrimination rather than high sensitivity or specificity for postprocedural arrhythmias, particularly atrial fibrillation. Conclusions: TAPSE/PASP should be regarded as a clinically useful risk-stratification marker in patients with AS undergoing TAVR, enabling the identification of high-risk patients and optimizing peri-procedural management."

We aim to determine whether G2 valves reduce these specific complications and thereby improve patient outcomes compared with G1. Methods: From February 2015 to September 2022, 1468 patients underwent TAVR at the university clinic in Kiel. After applying exclusion criteria, a final cohort of 1182 patients were analysed. Among these, 782 patients underwent TAVR with G1, whereas 400 underwent TAVR with G2. The primary study endpoints were the occurrence of new CD and PPMI within 30 days post-procedure. The secondary endpoints included diverse post-TAVR events as defined by the safety criteria of Valve Academic Research Consortium 3 (VARC III). A statistical analysis compared outcomes between the G1 and G2 groups. Results: Out of 1182 patients, 12.1% required PPMI within 30 days. Rates showed no statistical difference between G2 and G1 for PPMI (10.3% vs. 13.0%, IPTW-weighted p = 0.31) or CD (15.3% vs. 21.48%, IPTW-weighted p = 0.08). Among G2, the Sapien 3 Ultra valve had the lowest PPMI rate (4.8%). Overall, G2 and G1 had similar post-procedural and 30-day mortality rates. Conclusion: G2 valves may reduce post-procedure CD, but the difference is not statistically significant. Differences between specific valve types-such as the Sapien 3 Ultra's lower rates-are notable, but overall, PPMI and safety profiles remain similar between G1 and G2. Patient and procedural factors still play a significant role. Careful valve and patient selection is essential, and ongoing research will guide further improvements."

Many genetic mutations that cause HCM seem to enhance ventricular systolic function, suggesting that these HCM mutations are hypercontractile. Among the most common causes of HCM are mutations in the gene MYH7, which encodes for β-cardiac myosin, the principal human ventricular myosin. Previous work has demonstrated that, for purified myosins, some MYH7 mutations are gain-of-function while others cause reduced function, so how they lead to enhanced contractility is not clear. Here, we have characterized the mechanics and kinetics of the severe HCM-causing mutation M493I. Motility assays demonstrate a 70% reduction of actin filament gliding velocities on M493I-coated surfaces relative to wild type (WT). This mutation slows ADP release from actomyosin•ADP fivefold without affecting phosphate release or ATP binding. Yet it enhances steady-state ATPase Vmax twofold. Through single-molecule mechanical studies, we find that M493I myosin has a normal working stroke of 5 nm but a significantly prolonged actin attachment duration. Under isometric feedback, M493I myosins produce high, sustained force, with an actin detachment rate that is less sensitive to force than that of WT myosin. We also report direct measurement of the equilibrium state of the super-relaxed to disordered relaxed regulatory transition and show its disruption in M493I, with a concomitant enhancement to actin attachment kinetics. Together, these data demonstrate that enhanced myosin binding from inhibition of myosin's off state, combined with slow ADP release and enhanced force production, underlie the enhanced function and etiology of this HCM mutation."

This study was aimed at investigating the impact of hyperhomocysteinemia on rheumatic mitral valve calcification and prognosis in patients undergoing surgery.
This study included 672 patients with severe rheumatic mitral valve stenosis who underwent surgery between January 2016 and December 2022. Patients were stratified by preoperative homocysteine levels. Mitral valve pathology was assessed by echocardiography and coronary CTA, with all-cause mortality as the primary mid-term endpoint.
Among this surgical cohort of 672 patients with severe rheumatic mitral stenosis, 208 (31.0%) patients were identified with hyperhomocysteinemia. Imaging assessment revealed that these patients had a higher Agatston score for mitral valve calcification (37.47 vs. 17.19, p = 0.038) after adjusting baseline data. Restricted cubic splines revealed a significant dose-response relationship, with mitral valve calcification increasing progressively with higher homocysteine levels (p < 0.001). The Kaplan-Meier survival analysis showed that patients with hyperhomocysteinemia had significantly lower mid-term survival rates (log-rank p = 0.004). Through univariate and multivariate COX regression analyses, it was found that hyperhomocysteinemia was an independent risk factor affecting mid-term postoperative survival (HR, 2.257; p = 0.048).
In patients undergoing surgery for rheumatic heart disease, hyperhomocysteinemia was associated with the formation of rheumatic mitral valve calcification and increased mid-term postoperative mortality. Trial Registration: Chinese Clinical Trial Registry identifier ChiCTR2200067151."

Delayed diagnosis, limited awareness, and inadequate access to specialized cardiac care, contribute to advance disease presentation and poor outcome. Despite the availability of early detection tools and effective antibiotic prophylaxis, many Indian women are diagnosed at the late stages, necessitating complex surgical interventions such as balloon valvuloplasty, valve repair, or valve replacement. Surgical management presents unique challenges particularly regarding the choice between the mechanical and bioprosthetic valves, as the former requires lifelong anticoagulation therapy which poses risk during pregnancy. Socioeconomic impacts of RHD on women include not only financial constraints and loss of productivity but also significant disparities in healthcare access which further hinder timely and effective treatment. This narrative review will provide the comprehensive overview of the current state of research in a specific field and would explore the multifaceted surgical implications of RHD in Indian woman, and would also address demographic consideration, including the age of onset; clinical, reproductive, and hormonal factors; and socio-economic dimensions which influence disease progression and surgical outcomes. It also emphasizes the importance of early screening programs, tailored surgical strategies, and a multidisciplinary approach to care including preconception counselling and postoperative follow-up to improve outcomes. Addressing these gaps is essential to reduce the morbidity and mortality, and enhancing the overall quality of life for woman affected with RHD in India.

Imaging biomarkers, such as the callosal angle (CA), Evans Index (EI), and Disproportionately Enlarged Subarachnoid Space Hydrocephalus (DESH), play a crucial role in NPH diagnosis but are often limited by subjective interpretations. To address these challenges, we developed a fully automated and robust deep learning framework for measuring the CA directly from raw T1 MPRAGE scans.
Our method integrates two complementary modules. First, a BrainSignsNET model is employed to accurately detect key anatomical landmarks, notably the anterior commissure (AC) and posterior commissure (PC). Preprocessed 3D MRI scans, reoriented to the Right Anterior Superior (RAS) system and resized to standardized cubes while preserving aspect ratios, serve as input for landmark localization. After detecting these landmarks, a coronal slice, perpendicular to the AC-PC line at the PC level, is extracted for subsequent analysis. Second, a UNet-based segmentation network, featuring a pretrained EfficientNetB0 encoder, generates multiclass masks of the lateral ventricles from the coronal slices which then used for calculation of the CA.
Training and internal validation were performed using datasets from the Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging (BLSA) and BIOCARD, while external validation utilized 376 clinical MRI scans from Johns Hopkins Bayview Hospital, as well as PENS trial. Our framework achieved high concordance with manual measurements, demonstrating a strong correlation (r = 0.98, p < 0.001) and a mean absolute error (MAE) of 3.26 (SD 1.89) degrees. Moreover, error analysis confirmed that CA measurement performance was independent of patient age, gender, and EI, underscoring the broad applicability of this method.
These results indicate that our fully automated CA measurement framework is a reliable and reproducible alternative to manual methods, outperforms reported interobserver variability in assessing the CA, and offers significant potential to enhance early detection and diagnosis of NPH in both research and clinical settings."

To address these challenges, this study proposes an LSTM-PatchTST prediction method based on multi-dimensional feature dependency fusion: First, Pearson correlation analysis is used to screen key features, and Gaussian moving average filtering optimizes the data; Subsequently, the preprocessed time series is input to the LSTM network, where the forget gate and input gate capture short-term fluctuations and long-term trends respectively, while residual connections ensure complete preservation of multi-layer temporal features; Then, the dynamic features extracted by LSTM are passed to the PatchTST module, which divides the sequence into local patches, with a multi-layer self-attention encoder simultaneously modeling local details and global dependencies, achieving deep feature fusion. The model's performance is validated using actual pressure data from Fucun Coal Mine in Zaozhuang, Shandong. Experimental results show that, compared to pure PatchTST and Transformer + LSTM models, the proposed model reduces RMSE by approximately 48.6% and 30.0%, and MAE by approximately 58.7% and 38.8%, respectively.

We analyzed 802 patients who underwent CAS at three centers between 2018 and 2024. Clinical and ultrasound data were collected, and radiomic and deep learning features were extracted from preoperative plaque images. A combined model was built using Cox regression and random survival forest models, and then presented as a nomogram. Model performance was assessed using the C-index and Kaplan-Meier analysis.
Over a median follow-up of 62 months, 213 patients (26.6%) experienced ipsilateral stroke. We integrated the significant clinical, radiomics, and deep learning features (p<0.05) into a nomogram. The model demonstrated strong discriminative ability for stroke, with C-indices of 0.800 (95% CI: 0.759-0.841) in the training set, 0.751 (95% CI: 0.677-0.828) in the internal validation set, and 0.708 (95% CI: 0.634-0.782) in the external validation set. It significantly outperformed the conventional ultrasound model across all datasets (p<0.05). Moreover, Kaplan-Meier analysis confirmed that patients stratified into the high-risk group based on the nomogram had a substantially higher probability of ipsilateral stroke compared to the low-risk group (p<0.05).
A deep learning radiomics model based on preoperative ultrasound can predict long-time risk of ipsilateral stroke for patients with CAS, which may help in risk stratification and guide treatment decision-making and follow-up management."
PubMed,deep learning,KWC-YOLO: An efficient YOLO architecture for lumbar spinal stenosis grading through dynamic convolution and spatially-aware gating.,Wei Chen; Fan Wu; Yan Guo; Weiqing Zhuang; Hua Chen; Jie Feng; Jianfeng Wu,10.1016/j.compmedimag.2025.102685,2025-12-17,Computerized medical imaging and graphics : the official journal of the Computerized Medical Imaging Society,"Lumbar spinal stenosis (LSS) represents a significant global health burden, and its diagnosis from Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is often subject to inter-observer variability and time-consuming interpretation. While deep learning (DL) models offer a promising solution, they are frequently constrained by the scarcity of annotated medical data, high computational demands, and challenges in representing subtle pathological features. To address these limitations, we propose KWC-YOLO, a novel and efficient object detection framework for the automated detection and classification of lumbar central canal stenosis (LCCS) severity according to the Schizas grading criteria. Our model enhances the YOLOv11n architecture through three core innovations: (1) the integration of KernelWarehouse (KWConv), a parameter-efficient dynamic convolution mechanism that improves the feature adaptability of the detection head; (2) the introduction of a FasterGATE activation unit in the backbone to enhance non-linear representation and accelerate convergence; and (3) the implementation of a lightweight Slim-Neck structure, which optimizes the trade-off between feature fusion quality and computational cost. On a clinical lumbar spine MRI dataset, KWC-YOLO demonstrates superior performance, achieving a mean Average Precision at an IoU of 0.5 (AP50) of 86.7% and an AP95 of 63.0%. This represents a substantial improvement over the YOLOv11n baseline by 9.2 and 9.3 percentage points in AP50 and AP95 respectively, while simultaneously reducing the computational load by 36.5% to 4.0 GFLOPs. Conclusively, KWC-YOLO establishes a new benchmark for automated LCCS grading. Its compelling balance of high accuracy and computational efficiency holds the potential to alleviate the interpretative burden on radiologists, enhance reporting accuracy, and streamline clinical decision-making, ultimately leading to improved patient outcomes."

The transparent monotectic material succinonitrile-0.82 wt.-frac. water was used, in which succinonitrile-rich droplets with a slightly higher density than the liquid matrix form. They move to warmer regions in the sample due to thermocapillary forces in a temperature gradient. To exclude additional gravity effects on droplet movement and on thermosolutal convection, the experiment was carried out in six minutes of microgravity on the TEXUS-60 sounding rocket. A pre-trained deep-learning computer vision model based on mask R-CNN was used for droplet detection in microscopic images. The multi-object tracking model SORT was applied for statistical droplet evaluation from the detected objects. The moving droplets showed only slight deformation from spherical shape. Some droplets adhered to the boundary glass windows of the experimental container, and increased wetting behaviour and coagulation was observed at later stages of the experiment. Droplets approaching the container boundaries slow down their movement. Largely isolated and spherical droplets moving and dissolving in a slowly increasing temperature gradient follow the steady-state velocity model of Young et al. from 1959 very well, except for an offset from zero for vanishing droplet diameters. The model application to the experimental data reveals a temperature dependence of the surface tension of dσ/dT = - 0.99 ± 0.08 10-4 Jm-2K-1."

However, due to high dimensionality, nonlinearity and multi-scale behaviors in physical systems, the training of PINNs may become ill-posed. One of the primary reasons is the multi-objective loss competition arising from heterogeneity of Partial differential equations (PDEs) and boundary conditions (BCs). For multi-domain coupled systems, coupling relations among domains further complicates the problem. Current methods struggle to achieve satisfactory computation speed and accuracy. Inspired by hard-constraint PINNs, we propose a unified knowledge-embedding PINNs (UKE-PINNs) that defines a generalized graph-structured PINNs framework. UKE-PINNs integrates boundary conditions and implicit coupling relations, defined as essential knowledge, into PINNs ansatz, thereby alleviating the loss competition. Additionally, we introduce a residual learning method to learn the difference from rough knowledge, enabling the embedding of various forms of boundary dynamics and domain distribution patterns. Our method rigorously identifies and eliminates the inherent initialization errors in traditional hard constraint approaches, establishing a novel mechanism that accommodates rough knowledge of varying granularities. We validate UKE-PINNs on benchmark systems with both linear and nonlinear constraints. Tests include flow systems (4-node, 25-node) with linear constraints and standard nonlinear problems (Burgers, Allen-Cahn equations). Compared to pure PINNs and conventional hard-constrained methods, UKE-PINNs demonstrate significant improvements in accuracy and computational efficiency. The method achieves fine-grained accuracy while enabling substantial computational acceleration. Moreover, experiments also confirm that finer-grained rough knowledge embedding significantly enhances UKE-PINNs' performance."
PubMed,deep learning,ASR-GCN: Adaptive spatial information reconstruction GCN for skeleton-based action recognition.,Ying Wu; Zixuan Xu; Yuchen Huang; Jinzhuo Liu; Yong Yu,10.1016/j.neunet.2025.108508,2025-12-21,Neural networks : the official journal of the International Neural Network Society,"Over the past few years, skeleton-based action recognition has attracted significant focus in the area of computer vision. However, existing methods still face many challenges in feature extraction and dynamic feature learning for complex tasks. This paper proposes an innovative Adaptive Spatial Information Reconstruction Model (ASR-GCN) to address these challenges. By optimizing the feature extraction process, the recognition capability of the model is significantly improved while introducing only a minimal increase in parameters and computational complexity. First, we propose a Gated Reconstruction Unit (GRU), which promotes the model's learning of representative features by employing a reweighting gating strategy, significantly improving recognition efficiency. Furthermore, we observed that existing methods generally relied on fixed feature extraction strategies, which limits the deep mining of intrinsic features of skeleton data. Therefore, we constructed an Adaptive Spatial Information Reconstruction Unit (ASRU) to adaptively adjust the contribution of features, efficiently extract, reweight, and integrate feature information, enhancing the feature extraction capability of the model. We conducted experiments on two large action recognition benchmark datasets, NTU RGB+D 60 and NTU RGB+D 120. The results show that our model achieves current state-of-the-art performance on both benchmarks. On the cross-subject and cross-set of the NTU 120, the accuracy reaches 90.9% and 92.4%, respectively."
PubMed,deep learning,Decoupling time and space: An adaptive shared graph convolutional network for dynamic market price forecasting.,Yalin Wang; Guodong Li; Chenliang Liu; Jiang Luo; Yishun Liu; Weihua Gui,10.1016/j.neunet.2025.108489,2025-12-15,Neural networks : the official journal of the International Neural Network Society,"Accurate forecasting of product prices is vital for enterprises to anticipate market trends and adjust sales strategies proactively. Given the volatility of supply and demand, product prices often exhibit complex spatiotemporal coupling characteristics. However, traditional deep learning methods like graph neural networks mainly focus on local feature learning, limiting their ability to model the continuous evolution of market dynamics and spatial diffusion patterns. To overcome this limitation, this study proposes a novel spatiotemporal decoupling adaptive-shared graph convolutional network (STDAsh-GCN) for product price prediction. First, STDAsh-GCN introduces a globally shared parameter mechanism in the graph convolution process, enabling deep decoupling of spatial and temporal representations. Furthermore, an adaptive feature aggregation module is designed to dynamically assess and enhance the contribution of each node during convolution, thereby improving the capacity of the model to capture and integrate salient features. To further reveal intrinsic structural dependencies, a shared attention mechanism is incorporated to balance the influence of input features and adjacency relationships. Extensive experiments on three real-world industrial datasets, including one from a potassium sulfate production enterprise, validate the effectiveness of the proposed method compared to existing state-of-the-art methods."

Additionally, WSI contributes essential information for personalized treatment decisions. However, the application of deep learning models to WSI is hindered by two major challenges. First, the substantial data requirements, combined with the high cost and labor-intensive nature of sample annotation, limit the availability of well-labeled datasets. Second, the computational demands of these models pose practical constraints for many healthcare institutions. To address these challenges, we propose a weakly supervised deep learning model based on the transformer architecture. Specifically, we design a novel network incorporating the Swin Transformer, which, unlike traditional convolutional networks, emphasizes global feature extraction. This improves the accuracy of pseudo-label assignment during feature embedding. Additionally, we integrate a gated attention pooling mechanism and employ multi-instance learning (MIL), enabling, for the first time, immune score prediction directly from WSIs. Our model was evaluated through 5-fold cross-validation and achieved an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.88 for immune score prediction in liver cancer. Furthermore, it demonstrated strong predictive performance for genetic mutations, achieving an AUC of 0.99 for CUB and Sushi multiple domains 1 (CSMD1) mutations and 0.86 for Tumor Protein 53 (TP53) mutations in liver cancer. These results highlight the potential of transformer-based weakly supervised learning in computational pathology."
PubMed,deep learning,SSHF-DTI: Leveraging structural similarity and hierarchical features through a fusion network for drug-target interaction prediction.,Yuxiao Zhang; Chengping Zhao,10.1016/j.compbiolchem.2025.108853,2025-12-20,Computational biology and chemistry,"Predicting drug-target interactions (DTI) and binding affinities (DTA) is essential for drug discovery, but experimental methods remain costly and time-consuming. While deep learning approaches have improved prediction performance, many existing models rely on single-source data and lack integration of cross-domain features, limiting their generalization. This study aims to develop a more robust and generalizable model for DTI and DTA prediction. We propose SSHF-DTI, a model that integrates structurally similar information and multi-source substructure features to effectively preserve chemically meaningful molecular fragments and capture hierarchical feature dependencies. Structural similarity is incorporated through data enrichment based on Tanimoto coefficient evaluation of Morgan fingerprint similarity. This hybrid architecture combines transformer and convolutional components and further achieves hierarchical feature fusion, thereby significantly optimizing model performance improvement. Compared with baseline methods, SSHF-DTI achieved improvements of 0.031 and 0.147 in ROC-AUC and PR-AUC respectively on the Davis dataset. It also demonstrated strong generalization in drug-drug interaction (DDI) tasks and showed high sensitivity in distinguishing fine-grained molecular structural features affecting binding affinity. SSHF-DTI provides a powerful, generalizable framework for DTI/DTA/DDI prediction, capable of capturing complex hierarchical feature interactions. It shows promise for supporting drug discovery and virtual screening applications."

With a focus on the prevalent psychological complications following the onset of this condition, this study aimed to explore the correlation between antenatal depression and Corona disease anxiety, personality traits, and postpartum depression during the COVID-19 pandemic.                                                           Materials and Methods:                     This cross-sectional descriptive-analytical study investigated women receiving care at health centers affiliated with Kerman University of Medical Sciences during the last month of their pregnancy and the postpartum period in 2022. Following the acquisition of informed consent, participants were assessed using various measures, including demographic and obstetric information, the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale, the Corona Disease Anxiety Scale (CDAS), and the NEO Personality Inventory-Revised during their third trimester of pregnancy. The same group of participants completed the Edinburgh Depression Scale and the Corona Disease Anxiety Scale (CDAS) 4-6 weeks after childbirth.                                                           Results and Discussion:                     There was a significant correlation between family income, unwanted pregnancy as perceived by both the mother and father, and antenatal depression. Additionally, marital satisfaction played a significant role in postpartum depression. Furthermore, antenatal depression was significantly associated with neuroticism, agreeableness, and physical symptoms related to Corona disease anxiety. Personality traits, with the exception of extroversion and conscientiousness, and various domains of Corona disease anxiety, excluding psychological symptoms, were also significantly associated with postpartum depression.                                                           Conclusion:                     During pandemics or epidemics, such as the COVID-19 outbreak, experiencing mental distress during pregnancy can contribute to mental health issues during the postpartum period. This risk is particularly true in individuals with unique personality traits, emphasizing the need for increased focus on mental health within prenatal care during these crises."

Method:                     This cross-sectional study was conducted in Kerman, Iran. Data were collected from patients who visited Afzalipour Hospital in Kerman more than twice during the COVID-19 epidemic from the end of February 2020 to March 21, 2021. We conducted two key analyses: 1. Mixed effect logistic regression was used to check the relationship between the variables and COVID-19 severity. 2. Mixed effect linear regression was used to check the relationship between the variables and the length of stay in the hospital.                                                           Results:                     The findings indicated that the most important risk factors for the severity of COVID-19 were heart diseases (OR=1.67,95%CI:1.20-2.30), increasing age (OR=2.23 for age&gt;54, 95%CI:1.70- 2.90), male gender (OR=1.47,95%CI:1.10-1.96), respiratory diseases other than asthma, and frequency of admission (OR=1.60,95%CI:1.20-2.15). All patients who underwent readmission experienced a shorter duration of hospitalization during their subsequent admission (OR=0.94,95%CI:0.91,0.96) and had a higher mortality rate (30% within 14 days, 26.6% between 14-90 days). Patients readmitted at intervals of 14-90 days and greater than 90 days exhibited lower disease severity compared to those readmitted within the 0-14 day period.                                                           Conclusion:                     Examining readmissions, the severity of COVID-19, and the length of hospital stay in affected patients are important factors for planning and allocating resources for COVID-19 management and treatment. These factors can help policymakers develop effective clinical guidelines for hospitalization or outpatient treatment of COVID-19 patients and contribute to reducing the burden of disease in the community."

Kinovea, as an accessible motion-analysis software, provides both visual and quantitative feedback. However, its application in supporting technique development among beginner athletes remains insufficiently explored. Aim: This study aims to describe the use of Kinovea in biomechanics training and examine its contribution to the awareness of kinematic characteristics and movement techniques among beginner athletes. Methods: A descriptive qualitative design involved 72 beginner athletes aged 18–25 years selected through purposive sampling. Data were collected over 16 weeks through interviews, field observations, and motion video recordings analyzed using Kinovea. Kinematic data focused on joint angles, stride behavior, and movement phases during walking, running, and the flight phase. Qualitative data were analyzed using content analysis with NVivo 12, while kinematic results were interpreted descriptively to identify performance patterns and areas for technical refinement. Result: Kinematic analysis showed coordinated joint-angle patterns across all phases. Walking analysis identified arm swing angles of 50.9°–58.8° and leg separation angles of 64.3°–67.2°, indicating a stable gait rhythm. The running analysis revealed knee angles of 68.8°–69.8° and elbow angles of 87.6°–89.1°, indicating efficient propulsive mechanics. The flight phase demonstrated knee angles of 81.2°–87.8° and elbow angles of 80.4°–88.3°, suggesting effective momentum use and postural stability. These measurements supported stride-efficiency assessment and technique evaluation. Qualitative findings revealed that Kinovea enabled athletes to interpret movement phases and identify technical inefficiencies through slow-motion and frame-by-frame visualization. Conclusion: Kinovea supports basic motion analysis by providing clear kinematic information and helping beginner athletes observe and refine their movement techniques. The findings also offer practical value for coaches by enabling more precise identification of inefficient patterns and guiding targeted corrections during early-stage training."

OpenAlex,aortic stenosis,Outcomes of Surgical versus Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement: A Clinical Review,"Stang, Grace",,2026-01-01,Digital Commons - Gardner-Webb University (Gardner–Webb University),"Introduction: Surgical aortic valve replacement (SAVR) has been the predominant treatment for aortic stenosis (AS) for decades. However, transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) is becoming increasingly popular. Originally, TAVRs were only performed on patients who were deemed high-risk for surgery and would have died without the valve replacement. The purpose of this paper is to determine if TAVR or SAVR has better health outcomes for all patients no matter their surgical risk. Methods: A search via PubMed database was done using the key words “aortic stenosis”, “surgical aortic valve replacement”, “transcatheter aortic valve replacement”, and “mortality.” Additional search filters were applied for randomized control trials, systematic reviews, and meta- analyses. Dates were restricted to the last 5 years, and restrictions were added for English language and free full text only. This yielded 67 results and 5 were selected. Results: Of the five reviewed articles, all were meta-analyses and one systematic review. There was a total of 52122 patients. Primary endpoints across all articles were that there is no significant difference between TAVR and SAVR in the outcomes studied. Discussion: This review of studies provided supportive evidence that both TAVR and SAVR are valid treatment options or AS. TAVR had better short-term outcomes while SAVR had better long-term outcomes."

Its popularity has led to its use in lower volume institutions, where outcomes are comparable to higher volume centers. This study analyzes procedural volume and outcomes at our institution, compares them with the PARTNER III trial and evaluates complications and patient selection criteria. Design: This was a retrospective descriptive study. Setting: This study was performed at a public, multi-institutional healthcare system featuring an acute care hospital with a level I adult trauma and burn center. Participants: We obtained retrospective data on 37 patients who underwent TAVR in our hospital system in 2022. Data was collected on their outcomes, including mortality, readmission rates and cardiovascular and cerebrovascular complications at 30 days and 1 year. Interventions: No interventions were performed on patients as this was a retrospective study. Measurements and main results: Patient outcomes were compared with PARTNER III trial results. There was no 30-day mortality (versus 1% in the PARTNER III trial) and a 1-year mortality rate of 2.7% (versus 8.5% in the PARTNER III trial). During the procedures, no patients were converted to general anesthesia nor actively bleeding. At 30 days, no patients were readmitted for valve-related issues. Conclusion: This study demonstrates that lower volume healthcare institutions can achieve outcomes comparable/similar to higher volume institutions in specialized procedures like TAVR, challenging the assumption that superior outcomes are tied to institutional size. Our findings highlight the importance of quality, teamwork and individualized care in achieving excellent clinical outcomes, regardless of size."

Previously, valve replacement was only performed under cardiopulmonary bypass. Minimally invasive transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) is currently available for high-risk patients, including elderly ones. However, there is a risk of hemorrhagic complications even in minimally invasive procedures. In general population, the incidence of bleeding requiring transfusion after TAVI is 6—9%.

Chilian; Feng Dong,10.3390/ijms27010256,2025-12-25,International Journal of Molecular Sciences,"The aim of this study was to determine whether exosomes from Nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase (NAMPT)-overexpressing mesenchymal stem cells (MSC NAMPT-Exo) can attenuate aortic stenosis (AS) and explored the underlying mechanism. NAMPT expression was examined in EC CXCR4 KO (AS) mouse hearts. Six-week-old AS mice received weekly injections of NAMPT-Exo, MSC-Exo, or PBS for three weeks, followed by echocardiography and histological examination of the valves (H&amp;E, Alizarin Red, immunofluorescence). Cardiac ECs from control, AS, and NAMPT-Exo-treated mice were analyzed for miRNA expression (miR-146a-3p/5p, miR-125b-5p, miR-142a-5p). NAMPT expression was decreased in AS hearts. Treatment with NAMPT-Exo reduced aortic valve peak velocity, valvular thickening, and microcalcifications, while improving ejection fraction, fractional shortening, and ventricular dimensions. AS endothelial cells showed elevated levels of miR-146a-3p, miR-146a-5p, and miR-142a-5p, NAMPT-Exo specifically normalized miR-146a-3p. Histology revealed EndMT in AS valves, which was diminished by NAMPT-Exo. In vitro, inhibiting miR-146a-3p suppressed TGF-β-induced EndMT. Our results demonstrate that NAMPT-enriched MSC-derived exosomes effectively slow the progression of AS. Additionally, our findings highlight miR-146a-3p as a key regulator of EndMT, suggesting it as a potential molecular target for future therapies."
OpenAlex,aortic stenosis,Surgery of the Aortic Valve Using a Minimally Invasive Approach,Oleksandr Babliak; Dmytro Babliak; Serhii Yatsuk,10.63181/ujcvs.2025.33(4).30-36,2025-12-25,Ukrainian journal of cardiovascular surgery,"Aim. The aim of this study is to present and analyze the technique of isolated aortic valve replacement (AVR) or repair via a minimally invasive approach – right anterior thoracotomy in the second intercostal space. Materials and Methods. From February 2020 to November 2025, 180 patients at our institution underwent isolated aortic valve interventions. Since July 2020, we have implemented the technique of minimally invasive aortic valve surgery via right anterior thoracotomy. Between 2020 and 2025, 177 patients were operated on using this approach: 165 underwent aortic valve replacement (AVR), and 12 underwent aortic valve repair. In 2 (1.1 %) patients with isolated aortic valve stenosis, AVR was performed through axillary access for a better cosmetic effect. Since the introduction of this technique, median sternotomy was used in only one case due to difficulties with peripheral cannulation or severe aortic calcification. Results. Based on etiology and anatomical pathology, AVR was performed in 165 (91.6 %) patients – 90 (54.5 %) received biological prostheses, and 75 (45.5 %) received mechanical valves. Aortic valve repair was performed in 12 (8.4 %) patients. Aortic cross-clamp time ranged from 39 to 145 minutes (mean 89.4±19.5 min). Total cardiopulmonary bypass time ranged from 83 to 275 minutes (mean 150.9±29.4 min). Total operative time ranged from 165 to 435 minutes (mean 237.7±43.4 min). Intensive care unit (ICU) stay was 1.4±0.6 (1-3) days, and total hospital stay was 6.1±1.6 (3-16) days. There were no significant postoperative cardiac complications, mortality, or conversions to median sternotomy. Three cases (1.4 %) required surgical re-exploration due to bleeding. Conclusions. Right anterior mini-thoracotomy is a safe approach for aortic valve surgery. The use of exposure maneuvers during aortic valve replacement via mini-thoracotomy allows the operation to be performed without patient selection and yields good perioperative results."

Aidu; T.A Sakhnova; E V Blinova; VG Trunov; Sobolev Av,10.17116/cardiobulletin20252004126,2025-12-25,Russian Cardiology Bulletin,"Objective. To determine vECG and orthogonal ECG3 parameters and ranges of their changes for which diagnostic significance of estimates will be the same between MacPhee-Parungao leads calculated using Trunov-Aidu transformation and most common Frank leads calculated using Kors matrix and inverse Dauer matrix. Material and methods. An observational single-center non-controlled study included 1250 digital 12-lead ECGs recorded from 1250 adults with common cardiovascular diseases: hypertension, coronary artery disease, previous myocardial infarction, aortic stenosis, etc. We calculated orthogonal ECG3 in McFee-Parungao (Trunov-Aidu matrix) and Frank (Kors matrix and Dawer inverse matrix) leads. Statistical processing included correlation analysis and Bland-Altman plots to assess measurement agreement. Results. The study found significant diversity in ECG patterns among all ECGs. Amplitudes of ECG3 waves showed good agreement across all transformations. Integral vectors, fractional integrals, and ventricular gradient demonstrated high correlation. While spatial area of QRS loop showed consistency, its projections on orthogonal planes were less aligned. Spatial angle QRS-T exhibited high degree of linear correlation. Planar indexes of QRS loop and length parameters showed close results between McFee-Parungao and Frank systems. Conclusion. Measurements of integral vECG characteristics in computational orthogonal lead systems McFee-Parungao and Frank yield comparable results. Extreme values of spatial angle QRS-T (&gt;130°) associated with high cardiovascular risk show high agreement. However, intermediate and borderline values should be interpreted considering calculation method. Planar indexes&gt;0.91 may also be interpreted with high consistency."

Stucki; Stefano F. de Marchi; Konstantina Chalkou; Shaokai Zheng; Dominik Obrist,10.1093/ehjimp/qyaf161,2025-12-22,European Heart Journal - Imaging Methods and Practice,"Abstract Introduction Grading of aortic stenosis (AS) is paramount to determine the ideal timing for aortic valve replacement. However, echocardiographic assessment of AS is challenging and subject to inaccuracy. Increased turbulent kinetic energy (TKE) in the aorta, created by a restricted opening stenotic aortic valve, could serve as a new marker for assessing AS severity. However, in this contest, TKE evaluated with ultrasound color Doppler have not yet been clinically validated. Methods Porcine aortic valves were tested ex-vivo in a left heart mock loop under various flowrates (1, 2.5 and 4L/min) and three stiffness grades (SGa, SGb, SGc as native, stiffer, and stiffest stiffness grade, respectively). Reference TKE values were obtained using backlight particle tracking velocimetry. In parallel, TKE was estimated from ultrasound color Doppler measurements by computing the local spatial fluctuations of blood flow velocities. Transvalvular pressure gradients were evaluated both with continuous wave Doppler and pressure sensors (PGaolv). Results At 4 L/min, pressure gradients with continuous wave Doppler for SGc reached severe AS levels (41 mmHg ± 14). Both TKE measurement methods, adjusted for flow rates, increased significantly across all stiffness grades and distinguished between severe (SGc) and non-severe (SGa and SGb) AS. Conclusions In this ex-vivo AS model, both TKE measurement methods successfully differentiated severe from non-severe AS. These findings underscore the potential importance of ultrasound color Doppler echocardiography in estimating energy loss through turbulence, paving the way for the development of a new diagnostic tool for grading AS severity."

Since its inception in 2002, TAVR has significantly transformed the management of aortic stenosis. The treatment for TAVR procedural and device failures varies depending on the specific cause of failure. As the number of TAVR procedures increases, particularly in individuals aged 70 or younger, it is likely that we will see a rise in the number of patients needing further treatment due to degeneration of the transcatheter heart valve. Although TAVR has proved to be safe and effective, structural valve deterioration is inevitable. Even though TAVR has shown promising data of low structural valve deterioration rates up to 6 years from various clinical trials and up to 10 years in isolated series, the majority of these patients were older. But, reintervention after TAVR seems unavoidable. It may need reintervention with a second TAVR valve, or it may require surgical TAVR-explant and subsequent surgical aortic valve replacement. Also, a third option in the form of a hybrid technique, is available now. Thus, the selection of patients is crucial in choosing the appropriate initial management as it can have long-term repercussions."

Traditional surgical repair remains the gold standard, but high-risk patients often require less invasive alternatives. Aim: To review catheter-based interventions for MR, focusing on nursing care, anatomical considerations, procedural techniques, and clinical outcomes. Methods: This narrative review synthesizes evidence from pivotal trials (EVEREST I &amp; II, COAPT) and current guidelines (ACC/AHA, ESC/EACTS), emphasizing anatomical prerequisites, device selection, procedural workflow, and complication management. Results: Transcatheter edge-to-edge repair (TEER), modeled on the Alfieri stitch, has emerged as the most validated percutaneous approach. Favorable anatomy includes adequate leaflet length, central jet location, and mitral valve area &gt;4 cm². Technological advances (MitraClip G4, PASCAL Precision) enable treatment of complex anatomies such as flail segments and commissural jets. TEER demonstrates significant symptomatic improvement and reduced hospitalization in high-risk cohorts, with low rates of major complications (SLDA 1.5–5%, leaflet injury ≤2%, device embolization ≤0.7%). Nursing roles encompass preprocedural preparation, intraoperative monitoring, anticoagulation management, and postprocedural surveillance for complications such as tamponade, vascular injury, and residual MR. Conclusion: TEER represents a transformative option for patients unsuitable for surgery, offering durable MR reduction and improved quality of life when applied with rigorous anatomical assessment and multidisciplinary collaboration."
OpenAlex,mitral regurgitation,Iatrogenic atrial septal defect following transcatheter edge-to-edge mitral valve repair: A systematic review and meta-analysis,Deng Lei; Chunlan Zhou; Junqing Zhou; Chen Luo; Baoshi Zheng,10.1097/md.0000000000046486,2025-12-26,Medicine,"Background: Transcatheter edge-to-edge mitral valve repair (TEER) requires transseptal access of the left atrium, which usually causes an iatrogenic atrial septal defect (iASD). It is controversial that whether these patients with iASD persistence will progress to a bad prognostic state. So it’s worthwhile to evaluate whether the procedure of TEER induced iASD leads to development of a relevant interatrial shunt. This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to identify predictors of iASD persistence in patients with mitral regurgitation (MR) undergoing TEER and assess its effect on in-hospital outcomes and mortality. Methods: In this systematic review and meta-analysis, we conducted a literature search in various databases. Our investigation summarized data from contemporary studies on the incidence of iASD following TEER for MR and its association with clinical outcomes. Results: 10 studies were analyzed, possible predictors of risk factors for the persistence of iASD after TEER seemed to be atrial fibrillation before surgery (OR 1.40; P = .04), residual MR &gt; 2 + (OR 2.36; P = .001), residual tricuspid regurgitation &gt; mild(OR 1.52; P = .01), and prolonged fluoroscopic time(MD [in minutes] 5.36; P = .007). Patients with iASD persistence after TEER seemed to have a greater risk to suffer from right heart overload reflecting from the enlarged right ventricle end-diastolic dimension (RVEDD) (MD 3.27; P &lt; .00001) and the enlarged diameter of the right atrium (MD 4.41; P &lt; .00001). Patients with iASD persistence after TEER had a greater risk of heart failure rehospitalization (OR 2.71; P = .003). Conclusion: This systematic review and meta-analysis identified several related predictors of iASD persistence, possibly leading to right heart volume overload and a higher risk of heart failure rehospitalization. In order to generalize our findings, larger clinical studies in independent patient cohorts are necessary. What’s more, there is a need to perform a careful decision for interventional closure of an iASD after TEER."

No study investigated the temporal trend of patient characteristics and outcomes in comparison with the published randomized trials. AIM To investigate the temporal trend in baseline characteristics and outcomes of patients with secondary MR who underwent transcatheter edge-to-edge repair of the mitral valve in the real world compared with those from the published landmark trials. METHODS A comprehensive systematic literature search was conducted using MEDLINE, EMBASE, and CENTRAL databases, and the identified observational studies were divided into two five-year recruitment periods. The first period included 36 studies that enrolled patients between 2008 and 2012, and the second period included 25 studies that recruited patients between 2013 and 2017-2018. Pooled variables of each five-year recruitment period were compared with those of the landmark trials. A random-effects model was used for statistical comparisons. RStudio and RevMan software were used for the analysis. RESULTS Overall, there were no major variations in the findings between the first and the second five-year recruitment periods. EVEREST program vs observational studies: Patients in the EVEREST program were more likely to have non-ischemic MR etiology [odds ratio (OR) = 3.59, 95% confidence interval (CI): 2.92-4.42] and atrial fibrillation (OR = 1.71, 95%CI: 1.42-2.06). They were less likely to receive angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors/angiotensin II receptor blockers (OR = 0.72, 95%CI: 0.58-0.90) and implantable cardiac device (OR = 0.41, 95%CI: 0.33-0.49) as well as less likely to be symptomatic at hospital presentation without a difference in MR grade ≤ 2+ or mortality at 12-month follow-up. COAPT trial vs observational studies: COAPT patients were more likely to have prior myocardial infarction (OR = 1.62, 95%CI: 1.27-2.06) and renal insufficiency (OR = 2.66, 95%CI: 2.05-3.45). They were more likely to receive beta-blockers (OR = 2.54, 95%CI: 1.68-3.85) and an implanted cardiac device (OR = 2.20, 95%CI: 1.71-2.84). There was no difference in procedure success or mortality. MITRA-FR trial vs observational studies: MITRA-FR patients were less likely to have atrial fibrillation (OR = 0.49, 95%CI: 0.34-0.69) and renal insufficiency (OR = 0.18, 95%CI: 0.11-0.28) but more likely to have a history of myocardial infarction (OR = 1.48, 95%CI: 1.06-2.05) and to receive diuretics (OR = 19.81, 95%CI: 2.75-142.48) and implantable cardiac devices (OR = 1.69, 95%CI: 1.21-2.37). At hospital presentation, they were less likely to be symptomatic (OR = 0.25, 95%CI: 0.18-0.35) without a difference in MR grades 3+ and 4+. There was no difference in terms of MR grade or mortality at 12-month follow-up. CONCLUSION Patients in the landmark studies may have favourable or unfavourable characteristics when compared to those in the observational studies, but this did not translate into different outcomes over time."

Case Series and Literature Review,Giovanni Balestrucci; Vitaliano Buffa; Maria Teresa Del Canto; Maria Chiara Brunese; Salvatore Cappabianca; Alfonso Reginelli,10.3390/hearts7010002,2025-12-22,Hearts,"Mitral annular disjunction (MAD) is a structural abnormality of the mitral valve increasingly detected with advanced cardiac imaging, particularly cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR). However, the clinical impact of different degrees of disjunction and the lack of standardized measurement criteria remain controversial. This study aimed to describe a series of patients with MAD assessed by CMR and to discuss, in the context of current literature, potential cut-off values that may distinguish physiological from pathological MAD. We retrospectively identified all CMR examinations performed at our institution over a 6-month period in which MAD was visible in at least two cine steady-state free precession (SSFP) projections. For each patient, we recorded MAD extent, presence of mitral valve prolapse/regurgitation, late gadolinium enhancement (LGE) pattern, and main clinical presentation. Nine patients (mean age 57 years; 5 men) were included. Larger MAD distances (&gt;4 mm) were frequently associated with non-ischemic LGE in the basal lateral wall and with valvular abnormalities, whereas smaller disjunctions (≤3 mm) were often observed in patients without significant structural disease. Non-ischemic LGE was present in 6/9 patients, all with MAD &gt; 5 mm. These observations, together with published data, support the hypothesis that small degrees of MAD may represent a frequent anatomical variant, while more extensive disjunction, especially when associated with fibrosis, may indicate a pathological substrate for arrhythmias. Standardized CMR-based criteria and validated MAD cut-off values are needed to improve risk stratification and to incorporate MAD assessment into routine clinical practice."

Objective: to evaluate IS predictors in patients with moderate or severe AS, which will help identify high-risk groups and optimise stroke prevention. Material and methods . A retrospective review of data from the hospital information system for case-control analysis was conducted at one of the Federal Centers for Cardiovascular Surgery. Inclusion criteria: moderate or severe AS, patient age ≥18 years. Exclusion criteria: moderate or severe mitral stenosis, moderate or severe mitral regurgitation. Logistic regression was used to determine IS predictors. Odds ratio (OR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated for each of the significant risk factors. Results . The study included 208 patients with AS (the main group consisted of 51 patients with a history of IS or transient ischemic attack). The median age of patients was 68 [62.0; 72.0] years, the proportion of men was 53.8%. According to the multivariate analysis, the following predictors of cerebral ischemic events were identified: male gender (OR 2.739; 95% CI 1.048–7.156, p=0.040), extra-, intracranial stenosis &gt;50% (OR 2.488; 95% CI 1.089–5.686, p=0.031), aortic arch atheromas (OR 5.947; 95% CI 1.179–29.994, p=0.031), the result of the CHA2DS2VASc scale with an increase of 1 point (OR 4.030; 95% CI 1.912–8.499, p&lt;0.001). Conclusion. Supra-cardiac atherosclerosis (extraand intracranial atherosclerosis, aortic atheromas) is the main predictor of IS in patients with AS, which determines the need for its assessment in order to optimise patient treatment."
OpenAlex,mitral regurgitation,Retained fragmented Raytec gauze eluding an alleged correct postoperative count following cardiothoracic surgery: case report of a rare “never event”,Marco Lizwan; Philip Y. K. Pang,10.1186/s13037-025-00472-w,2025-12-20,Patient Safety in Surgery,"Abstract Introduction Retained surgical items are rare yet serious complications that may occur despite correct instrument and sponge counts. Surgical sponges remain the most frequently retained items, with gauze marker strand retention being an uncommon mechanism. Case presentation A 69-year-old male with severe mitral regurgitation and triple-vessel coronary artery disease underwent mitral valve replacement with coronary artery bypass grafting. All surgical counts were verified as correct at the conclusion of surgery. Postoperative chest radiography, however, revealed two linear radio-opaque foreign bodies near the left lower sternum. Mediastinal re-exploration identified two radio-opaque strands, measuring 3.0 cm and 2.0 cm, attached to the left lower chest wall near the internal mammary artery stump. These were confirmed to be detached marker strands from Raytec gauzes. The patient’s recovery was uneventful and he was discharged well. Conclusion This case illustrates that retained gauze fragments can occur despite correct counts due to fragmentation of radiopaque markers. Surgeons and operating room nurses should inspect gauzes for integrity, maintain vigilance when manipulating sponges in confined operative fields, and consider adjunct technologies such as radiofrequency or barcode tracking. In high-risk surgeries, postoperative imaging may be warranted even with accurate counts to ensure patient safety."
OpenAlex,mitral regurgitation,Suicide left ventricle triggered by accelerated junctional rhythm after TAVI: A case report of rhythm-dependent dynamic LVOT obstruction,Naoki Hoshino; Chihiro Nakashima;  Takashi Muramatsu; Akira Yamada; Hideo Izawa,10.1093/ehjcr/ytaf665,2025-12-19,European Heart Journal - Case Reports,"Abstract Background Suicide left ventricle (LV) is a rare, potentially fatal complication after transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI). It is typically caused by dynamic left ventricular outflow tract obstruction (LVOTO) following abrupt afterload reduction. Accelerated junctional rhythm (AJR) is an uncommon peri-procedural arrhythmia, and its role in precipitating suicide LV has not been reported. Case Summary An 87-year-old woman with extremely severe aortic stenosis was admitted for transfemoral TAVI. Concentric LV hypertrophy with a sigmoid septum and preserved systolic function was observed on baseline transthoracic echocardiography. She developed profound hypotension immediately after valve deployment. Transoesophageal echocardiography (TOE) revealed severe LVOTO and marked mitral regurgitation (MR) due to systolic anterior motion (SAM) of the mitral valve. The simultaneous appearance of AJR abolished atrial contraction, further reducing LV preload. LVOTO and SAM resolved during sinus rhythm, but recurred during AJR. Haemodynamics improved with rapid volume loading, vasoconstrictor administration and continuous right ventricular pacing, thereby reducing obstruction via induced ventricular dyssynchrony. AJR resolved spontaneously following emergence from anaesthesia, and a stable sinus rhythm was maintained. The patient was discharged on postoperative day 12 without recurrence. Discussion This case reports AJR as a novel trigger for suicide LV after TAVI, leading to preload reduction and promoting SAM, LVOTO and MR. Intraoperative TOE provided clear rhythm-dependent imaging of LVOT dynamics. Vigilant rhythm monitoring and prompt, targeted haemodynamic management, including pacing to induce ventricular dyssynchrony, are crucial for prevention and treatment in predisposed patients with small, hypertrophied ventricles with a sigmoid septum."

As such, this study aimed to further evaluate the diagnostic utility of ePLAR in a large cohort of patients with PHTN. Methods and Results All RHCs between 2018-2023 across three tertiary centers were retrospectively reviewed. Patients with PHTN were characterized as pre-capillary or post-capillary (isolated or combined). Concurrent ePLAR was calculated. ROC analysis evaluated the accuracy of ePLAR in detecting pre-capillary PHTN. Overall, 2235 patients had PHTN by RHC, mean age 63.5 ± 14.7 years, 53.5% male. Of these, 43.3% had pre-capillary PHTN. ROC analysis demonstrated ePLAR to have good accuracy in detection of pre-capillary PHTN (AUC 0.760), with a cutoff of 0.20m/s demonstrating a sensitivity and specificity of 77% and 60% respectively. This persisted on sensitivity analysis for contemporaneous investigations and for right ventricular function. Conclusions In this large cohort, ePLAR was validated as an accurate tool for identifying patients with pre-capillary PHTN. This widely available, non-invasive, and reproducible parameter can have an important role in the work up of PHTN and may guide the need for invasive testing."
OpenAlex,mitral regurgitation,Left ventricular strain and chamber dimensions in pediatric sickle cell disease: agerelated reduction in myocardial deformation independent of hemolysis and hydroxyurea therapy,Ziad Bulbul; Rana Zareef; Tania Abi Nassif; Theresia Tannouri; Francesca Rodigari; Hani Tamim; Maya El Khoury; Fadi Bitar; Miguel R. Abboud,10.3324/haematol.2025.288573,2025-12-18,Haematologica,"Sickle cell disease (SCD) is associated with cardiovascular complications. Speckle-tracking echocardiography enables early detection of myocardial dysfunction before abnormalities appear in conventional echocardiographic parameters. This study evaluated left ventricular (LV) global longitudinal strain (GLS) in pediatric SCD patients, and its relationship with traditional LV function indices, disease complications, hemolysis markers, and diseasemodifying therapy. We retrospectively analyzed 278 echocardiograms from 185 participants (118 SCD patients, mean age 12.2 years; 67 age- and sex-matched controls, mean age 11.8 years) obtained between 2015 and 2023. Among the SCD cohort, 66.1% had the HbSS genotype, 9.3% had HbSβ°-thalassemia, and 17.8% had HbSβ⁺-thalassemia; the majority (83.9%) were on hydroxyurea. Compared to controls, SCD patients had significantly lower, but still normal, GLS (–21.5% vs. –22.3%; p &lt; 0.001), along with significantly larger chamber diameters, elevated mitral valve E velocity, E/A ratio, and tricuspid regurgitation maximal velocity. Prior stroke (β = 0.9) and avascular necrosis (β = 1.51) were independently associated with worse GLS. The different genotypes did not exhibit significant difference in GLS. The strain values did not correlate with hemolysis markers, suggesting that other mechanisms may underlie myocardial impairment. A significant age-related decline in GLS was detected, with an inflection point at approximately 9.9 years. Longitudinal analysis of LV strain in the SCD cohort demonstrated a small decline from –21.6% to –21.2% over a 3.7-year follow-up period. Finally, pediatric SCD patients exhibit significant cardiac remodeling and diastolic dysfunction with preserved, yet lower, LV GLS, underscoring the need for further research in this population."
OpenAlex,mitral regurgitation,A massive left atrium in the context of severe mitral regurgitation: a case report,Ryaan EL‐Andari; Zachary Davidson; Jeevan Nagendran,10.1080/14796678.2025.2605920,2025-12-18,Future Cardiology,"Mitral regurgitation (MR) is among the most common heart conditions. Untreated, severe MR may result in adverse cardiac remodeling, atrial fibrillation (AF), and heart failure. A 45-year-old male with a history of AF presented with heart failure symptoms. Transesophageal echocardiogram revealed a myxomatous mitral valve with anterior leaflet prolapse, severe MR, and massively dilated left atrium (LA). A computerized tomography scan found severe LA dilation up to 17.8 cm. The patient underwent mitral valve replacement, tricuspid valve repair, and LA reduction. MR is known to result in LA dilation due to increased LA volume and pressure. While large LA sizes have been reported, they are often related to congenital conditions and rarely grow to the size identified in this case. AF and LA dilation both predict adverse outcomes, increasing the risk of thrombus formation in such a large chamber."

Pashimov; R Tuleutayev; Elmira Kultanova,10.3390/jcm14248938,2025-12-18,Journal of Clinical Medicine,"Objective: In this study, we aimed to determine the most significant risk factors for 5-year mortality in patients with paroxysmal and persistent drug-refractory tachysystolic atrial fibrillation after undergoing atrioventricular node ablation (AVNA) in combination with the implantation of a permanent three-chamber pacemaker with an implantable cardioverter–defibrillator function (CRT-D). Methods: This prospective single-center cohort study included 101 patients with chronic heart failure (mean age 62 ± 15.5 years; 70.3% male) with paroxysmal or persistent drug-refractory atrial fibrillation who underwent atrioventricular node ablation and CRT-D implantation. All patients received optimal medical therapy before and after undergoing the procedure. Predictors of 5-year mortality were assessed using exploratory machine-learning methods, including random forest and Shapley additive explanations. Results: During 5-year follow-up, 13 cardiovascular deaths were recorded. Five key predictors of mortality were identified: left ventricular ejection fraction, 6 min walk distance, mean pulmonary artery pressure, systolic relaxation coefficient, and degree of mitral regurgitation. The exploratory predictive model showed high accuracy (92%) in terms of classifying the outcomes. Conclusions: Atrioventricular node ablation (AVNA) combined with CRT-D was associated with the observed long-term clinical outcomes observed in patients with drug-refractory tachysystolic atrial fibrillation. The exploratory machine learning analysis identified key mortality-associated factors, which may support future efforts in personalized risk stratification and hypothesis generation. The combination of AVNA and CRT-D was associated with the observed long-term outcomes in this real-world cohort."
OpenAlex,mitral regurgitation,Valvular Complications Related to Microaxial Assist Device Use: A Case‐Level Systematic Review,Gregory Nolan; M. Elizabeth H. Hammond; Daler Rahimov; Chaitanya Karimanasseri; Nayeem Nasher; T. Reese Macmillan; John W. Entwistle; Keshava Rajagopal; Charles W. Hoopes; Vakhtang Tchantchaleishvili,10.1111/aor.70056,2025-12-18,Artificial Organs,"ABSTRACT Background Microaxial devices provide effective short‐term hemodynamic support in patients with cardiogenic shock or during high‐risk procedures. However, there is a paucity of data regarding device‐associated valvular complications. We sought to pool existing data to understand its incidence, management, and outcomes. Methods An electronic search was conducted in October 2024 to identify studies reporting microaxial device–associated valvular complications that did not resolve with device explantation. A total of 26 case reports and case series, representing 27 patients, were included. Patient‐level data were extracted for analysis. Results The median age was 50 years [IQR 34–65], and 78% (21/27) were male. The indications for microaxial support were cardiogenic shock (85.2%, 23/27), coronary bypass grafting (7.4%, 2/27), and high‐risk percutaneous coronary intervention (7.4%, 2/27). The most commonly used devices were the Impella 5.0 (41%, 11/27) and Impella CP (22%, 6/27). Aortic regurgitation (AR) developed in 67% of patients (18/27). Mitral regurgitation (MR) developed in 33% (9/27) of patients, all of which were severe. The median duration of microaxial support was 10 [3–15] days. Overall, 74% (20/27) of patients underwent surgical management, 11% (3/27) underwent transcatheter treatment, and 15% (4/27) were managed nonoperatively. In‐hospital/30‐day mortality was 11% (3/27), including two deaths among patients with MR (22%) and one in a patient with AR (5.6%) with a pre‐existing bioprosthetic aortic valve ( p = 0.19). When considering the patients with only native valves and excluding the bioprosthetic aortic valve, mortality was significantly higher among MR patients compared to those with AR (MR: 22%; AR: 0%, p = 0.04). At a median follow‐up of 183 [30–365] days, overall survival was 89% (24/27). Conclusion AR was more common than MR; however, all MR cases were severe. MR may be associated with worse outcomes. Surgical management appears to be the most frequently employed strategy for valvular injury."

Cavalcante; Jyothy Puthumana; Akhil Narang; Judy Hung; James D. Thomas; Lauren S. Ranard; Vera H. Rigolin,10.1001/jamacardio.2025.4561,2025-12-17,JAMA Cardiology,"Importance Primary mitral regurgitation (MR) is a prevalent valvular lesion. Current American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association guidelines include class I recommendations for intervention for severe primary MR at the onset of symptoms, significant left ventricular (LV) enlargement (end-systolic dimension ≥40 mm), or dysfunction (ejection fraction ≤60%), with a class IIA recommendation for mitral valve repair when performed at an experienced surgical center. Recent data suggest a survival penalty when waiting for class I surgical guideline indications, and novel markers of decompensation are under investigation. Observations Comprehensive assessment of MR severity using echocardiography is critical, and when warranted, cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) is complementary. Assessment of LV size and function, as well as serial changes in both, is crucial for determining timing of surgery. New-onset atrial fibrillation, left atrial enlargement, pulmonary hypertension, and exercise-induced changes in LV function should also be considered in borderline scenarios. The roles of LV volumes, global longitudinal strain, CMR-derived measures of myocardial dysfunction, and cardiac biomarkers are worthy of further investigation regarding consideration for early surgical intervention. Conclusions and Relevance A more refined approach incorporating assessment of extravalvular cardiac injury, novel imaging markers, and biomarkers is needed to optimize surgical timing in primary MR. Further research is warranted to validate these emerging parameters and refine guidelines to improve patient outcomes."
