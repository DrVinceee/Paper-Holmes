PubMed,aortic stenosis,Computational fluid hemodynamic based analyisis of the aorto iliac segment before the development of post EVAR iliac branch occlusion.,Han Yang; Qian-Hui Tang; Ming Hu; Zhong Qin; Si-En Guo; Hai-Lin Lu; Wen-Hong Jiang; Zhan-Man Zhang; Xiao Qin,10.1177/17085381261425714,2026-02-13,Vascular,"ObjectiveIliac limb branch occlusion after endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR) creates risk for limb or pelvic ischemia. This study aims to explore the hemodynamic factors associated with eventual iliac branch occlusion after EVAR for abdominal aortic aneurysm.MethodsSix patients with different causes of iliac branch occlusion were selected between January 2013 and December 2023, and computed tomography angiography (CTA) images were acquired at the time of preoperative and postoperative occlusion of EVAR. Specific CTA images were applied for modeling and computational fluid dynamics (CFD) analysis was implemented.ResultsPressure, velocity, wall shear stress (WSS), time-averaged wall shear stress (TAWSS), oscillatory Shear Index (OSI), and relative residence time (RRT) were calculated. Velocity, WSS, and TAWSS were elevated at the stenosis, and pressure, OSI, and RRT were decreased at the stenosis. Streamlines were reduced at stenotic sites. Iliac branch locations that eventually occluded had more disturbed flow compared to non-occluded sites. Both pressure and flow velocity gradient variations are greater on the occluded side than on the non-occluded side.ConclusionsComputational fluid hemodynamic analysis identified consistent flow disturbances associated with eventual iliac limb occlusion following EVAR. These findings suggest that CFD-based hemodynamic assessment may help stratify patients at risk of iliac branch occlusion before clinical manifestation."

The clinical course of conduction disturbances after PMI, based on the type of TAVI valve, remains unclear. Therefore, the present study aimed to evaluate the effects of different types of TAVI valves on the clinical course of conduction disturbances.
In total, 480 patients, including 230 with self-expandable (SE) valves and 250 with balloon-expandable (BE) valves, who underwent TAVI between January 2016 and December 2024, were enrolled in this study. The characteristics of patients who required PMI and the changes in the ventricular pacing ratio were compared.
There was no significant difference in PMI factors depending on the type of valve. Computed tomography (CT) images showed that the length of the membranous septum (MS) in the PMI group did not differ from the length of the MS in the non-PMI group. There was a significant difference in improvement in autologous AV conduction between the SE and BE groups at PMI time (SE group vs. BE group; 11/15 [66.7%] vs. 3/11 [27.3%], p = 0.047). At 1 month follow-up, the SE group improved significantly compared to the BE group (SE vs. BE; 14/15 [93.3%] vs. 4/11 [33.3%], p = 0.002).
Restoration of autologous AV conduction and subsequent decrease in ventricular pacing ratio were more likely in the SE group and less variable in the BE group. This result indicates that PM dependency can be reduced by using an extended AVD setting or AVH."

Our study evaluated 5-year outcomes in patients after minimally invasive surgery for aortic valve replacement (AVR) compared with FS access.
We conducted a single-center registry data analysis of AV patients who underwent only elective, isolated AVR compared to MS, and FS hospitalized between 2014 and 2024 in the Cardiac Surgery Department at the Medical University of Silesia. Redo, emergency, salvage and concomitant procedures were excluded. The 5-year survival data were verified in the National Health Fund. Propensity score matching (PSM) was conducted to determine FS controls for the MS group in a 1 : 1 ratio with a 0.1 SD caliper.
The study group included 1289 elective patients (73 MS, and 1216 FS). All operative and postoperative data before and after PSM are presented in tables. PSM resulted in 65 MS cases and 65 FS controls. The 5-year survival did not differ between groups, either before PSM (HR = 0.92, 95% CI [0.34-2.5]; p = 0.6) or after PSM (HR = 0.79, 95% CI [0.25-2.5]; p = 0.480). After matching, differences were found only in cardiopulmonary bypass time in MS vs. FS (73 [IQR: 61-88] vs. 63 [IQR: 53-77]; p = 0.034) and higher requirement for norepinephrine support (90.8% vs. 61.5%; p < 0.001).
Our study demonstrates that minimally invasive aortic valve replacement offers comparable 5-year outcomes. The results suggest that the less invasive alternative should be the first choice option for patients with aortic valve diseases."

Current AI-enabled tools rely on murmur detection as a proxy for VHD but lack sensitivity for common subtypes like mitral regurgitation and are limited by small datasets. This study presents a novel neural network that directly predicts clinically significant VHD from stethoscope recordings, trained using echocardiographic targets rather than heart murmur labels. A diverse dataset of 1767 patients across UK primary care and hospital settings was developed, combining stethoscope recordings with echocardiographic labels. The trained recurrent neural network achieved an AUROC of 0.83, outperforming general practitioners and demonstrating exceptional sensitivity for severe aortic stenosis (98%) and severe mitral regurgitation (94%). This algorithm shows promise as a scalable, low-cost screening tool, enabling earlier diagnosis and timely referral for intervention.

Lipoprotein(a) possesses increased atherogenicity, contributing to residual cardiovascular risk. Elevated Lp(a) levels affect a substantial proportion of the population, rendering this a potentially high-impact therapeutic target, but currently available lipid-lowering agents and lifestyle interventions have minimal impact on lowering Lp(a), and lipoprotein apheresis is the sole effective-but impractical-method to significantly reduce Lp(a). Recent advances in Lp(a)-targeted therapies, notably nucleic acid-based approaches (e.g. antisense oligonucleotides and small interfering RNAs) and a small molecule inhibitor of Lp(a) synthesis, demonstrated substantial and often durable Lp(a)-lowering effects in Phase II trials. Phase III trials of these agents are now underway to examine the impact of lowering Lp(a) levels on atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease outcomes, and their results may transform the landscape of cardiovascular risk reduction and management for patients with elevated Lp(a). This review summarizes existing lipid-lowering therapies' limited effects on Lp(a), provides an update on the array of emerging therapeutics and their safety and efficacy, and discusses ongoing Phase III trials as well as other potential benefits of Lp(a)-lowering, such as slowing progression of calcific aortic valve stenosis."

Cardiovascular computed tomography (CT) has become essential for diagnosing BAV, planning procedures, and evaluating patients after treatment. This is largely due to CT's high spatial resolution and its ability to perform volume imaging effectively. This review provides an up-to-date overview of the increasing role of cardiovascular CT in the management of bicuspid aortic valve (BAV). It covers various aspects, including BAV morphology, optimal sizing for transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR), and post-procedural monitoring. We highlight significant innovations, such as supra-annular sizing techniques and artificial intelligence (AI)-guided analysis, that position CT at the nexus of anatomy, function, and targeted treatment. Additionally, we address controversies concerning inconsistencies in sizing algorithms, recent classification challenges, and radiation exposure. Future development areas include AI predictive tools, radiomic phenotyping, and CT-guided precision medicine. This synthesis aims to provide clinicians and researchers with a high-level guide to the clinical integration of cardiovascular CT and its future in the BAV population. This review provides the most current, comprehensive synthesis on the pivotal role of cardiovascular CT in BAV management, offering a roadmap for integrating advanced imaging into clinical practice and guiding future research priorities."

However, there are no clear evidence-based guidelines defining optimal heparin dosing or target activated clotting time (ACT) values. This study aimed to evaluate the association between intraprocedural UFH dosing, ACT values, and peri-procedural stroke risk in the overall population of patients undergoing TAVR, with a prespecified stratified analysis according to body mass index (BMI ≥ 30 vs. <30 kg/m2). Methods: This analysis enrolled consecutive individuals with severe aortic stenosis (AS) who were treated with TAVR using either balloon-expandable or self-expanding valves. The primary outcome was the occurrence of stroke during the periprocedural period in the overall population and according to BMI (<30 vs. ≥30 kg/m2). Secondary endpoints included periprocedural parameters, clinical outcomes (in-hospital and 1-year mortality), and safety outcomes. Subgroup analysis was performed to assess stroke risk according to ACT values. Patients with atrial fibrillation or receiving chronic oral anticoagulation were excluded. Results: A total of 1045 patients underwent TAVR between 2022 and 2024, including 827 with BMI < 30 and 218 with BMI ≥ 30. The study population had a mean age of 82 ± 6 years, and 56% of patients were male. In the overall study population, the mean heparin dose was 47 U/kg and the mean ACT value was 218 s. Patients with lower BMI received higher heparin doses (50 vs. 40 U/kg, p < 0.01) and had higher ACT values (221 vs. 208 s, p < 0.01). Protamine use was low and similar between groups. Periprocedural stroke rates were low overall (1.1%) and comparable between study groups (1.2% vs. 0.9%, p = 0.71). One-year mortality was also similar (3% vs. 4%, p = 0.53), with no significant differences in other safety outcomes. Subgroup analysis by ACT (≤250 vs. >250 s) showed no difference in stroke rates (1% vs. 1.5%, p = 0.60). Conclusions: In this single-center cohort, differences in heparin dosing and ACT values were not associated with differences in peri-procedural stroke or overall procedural outcomes. However, given the low number of stroke events, these findings should be interpreted cautiously. Prospective randomized studies are needed to define optimal anticoagulation strategies during TAVR."

This has informed the recommendation for urgent intervention upon diagnosis, especially when symptoms develop. Asymptomatic severe aortic stenosis has a four-year mortality between 30 and 50% if left untreated, which is similar to some metastatic cancers. Conservative management for patients with severe asymptomatic aortic stenosis was previously advocated, likely owing to the relative invasiveness of surgical aortic valve replacement. The advent of low-risk transcatheter aortic valve implantation with good medium-term durability has prioritized the need for a paradigm shift in the treatment of asymptomatic severe aortic stenosis towards a more proactive strategy of early intervention to reduce significant adverse events. This article provides a state-of-the-art overview of the contemporary management of patients with asymptomatic severe aortic stenosis."

However, the precise underlying mechanisms are not fully understood.
This study aimed to establish a causal association between cardiometabolic diseases and CAVS by using genetic correlations and a bidirectional two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis.
Genome-wide association study (GWAS) data for seven cardiometabolic disorders and CAVS were obtained from the FinnGen consortium. The genetic correlations between two conditions were evaluated using the linkage disequilibrium score regression (LDSC) and high-definition likelihood (HDL) methods. MR analyses were conducted with inverse-variance weighted (IVW) regression as the principal method, complemented by weighted median, heterogeneity analysis, and sensitivity tests.
We identified 12 shared genes between cardiometabolic disorders and CAVS. Functional enrichment analysis revealed that these overlapping genes are involved in cholesterol homeostasis, vascular remodeling, smooth muscle proliferation, and lipid accumulation. MR analysis suggested a causal relationship between cardiometabolic disorders and CAVS.
Our study indicates significant genetic overlap between cardiometabolic disorders and CAVS. This finding provides valuable insights into the underlying mechanisms of their co-occurrence and has important implications for future therapeutic strategies.

We conducted a comprehensive search across PubMed, Cochrane Central, and Scopus from March 1975 until December 2024 for studies comparing AVR vs conservative management in asymptomatic severe AS patients with preserved left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF). Outcomes were analyzed using a random-effects model to pool odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Our pooled analysis included four randomized controlled trials (RCTs) encompassing a total of 1427 patients. AVR significantly reduced the incidence of major adverse cardiovascular and cerebral events (MACCEs) (OR 0.36; 95% CI 0.22-0.61; p = 0.0002) compared to conservative management. The incidence of all-cause mortality, 30-day peri-procedural mortality, cardiovascular mortality, and myocardial infarction was comparable between the two groups. AVR was associated with a significant reduction in stroke incidence (OR 0.59; 95% CI 0.37-0.95, p = 0.03) and unplanned cardiovascular hospitalization rates (OR 0.35; 95% CI 0.27-0.46, p < 0.00001).

However, it still has disadvantages such as high thresholds and impedance and unstable pacing in some patients.
Our center pioneered the following J-wire pacing technique: inserting a J-wire through the auxiliary access 8F sheath (for balloon-expandable valves) or the main access 20F sheath (for self-expanding valves) into the descending aorta and aligning it at the same height as the left ventricular wire creates a loop circuit between the J-wire and the left ventricular wire after the balloon or prosthesis has been inserted into the annulus. This study included a total of 26 patients. The impedance and threshold of traditional wire pacing and J-wire pacing were measured, and the pacing method with the lower threshold was selected as the intraoperative pacing method.
All 26 patients were assigned to the J-wire pacing group, achieving a 100% surgical success rate. The proportion of patients with a pacing threshold ≤5 V was significantly higher compared to traditional wire pacing (76.92% vs. 0%), while the proportion with a threshold ≥10 V was significantly lower (0% vs. 38.46%).
J-wire pacing offers improved safety and effectiveness compared to traditional wire pacing in TAVR procedures. We herein share this single-center experience, hoping to provide novel insights for the refinement of TAVR procedures."

Cardiovascular imaging,"Diagnosing cardiac amyloidosis (CA) on echocardiography can be challenging due to the imaging overlap between CA and more prevalent causes of a hypertrophic phenotype. This study sought to (1) evaluate the performance of artificial-intelligence (AI) derived measurements incorporated into the established multiparametric echocardiographic scoring system to detect CA; (2) develop and validate an AI-based deep-learning model for video-based detection of CA on echocardiography.
The study population comprised 5776 patients (CA, 2756; controls, 3020). The training data set included patients from the UK National Amyloidosis Center and Taiwan MacKay Memorial Hospital (CA, 2241; controls, 2130). External test data sets were obtained from the US Duke University Health System (CA, 334; LVH controls, 668) and Japan National Cerebral and Cardiovascular Center (CA, 181; LVH controls, 222).
The multiparametric echocardiographic score computed using AI-derived measurements achieved an accuracy of 79.5% (sensitivity, 75.4%; specificity, 81.5%) in the United States cohort and 79.7% (sensitivity, 81.6%; specificity, 78.1%) in the Japan cohort. The deep-learning model demonstrated accuracies of 96.2% (sensitivity, 96.8%; specificity, 95.7%) and 95.8% (sensitivity, 97.3%; specificity, 94.3%) in the internal validation and internal test sets, respectively. External validation of the deep-learning model showed accuracies of 87.5% (sensitivity, 86.6%; specificity, 87.9%) in the United States and 88.4% (sensitivity, 92.3%; specificity, 85.3%) in the Japanese cohort. Subgroup analysis demonstrated that the deep-learning model showed robust discrimination of CA from other hypertrophic phenocopies: CA versus hypertension (area under the curve [AUC], 0.92 [95% CI, 0.91-0.94]), CA versus hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (AUC, 0.91 [95% CI, 0.87-0.94]), CA versus aortic stenosis (AUC, 0.93 [95% CI, 0.90-0.95]), CA versus chronic kidney disease (AUC, 0.93 [95% CI, 0.91-0.95]). The deep-learning model was able to classify a greater proportion of patients compared with the AI-derived multiparametric echocardiographic score and achieved superior diagnostic accuracy (AUC, 0.93 [95% CI, 0.91-0.95] versus AUC, 0.88 [95% CI, 0.85-0.90]; P<0.001).
Both the multiparametric echocardiographic score computed from AI-derived measurements and the fully automated deep-learning model can accurately identify patients with CA in globally diverse cohorts, with the deep-learning model providing superior performance."

We retrospectively analyzed 737 consecutive patients who underwent TAVI. Patients were stratified into tertiles according to ALBI score. Baseline clinical, echocardiographic, laboratory features were compared across tertiles. The primary endpoint was long-term all-cause mortality; secondary endpoints included in-hospital mortality and major complications. Kaplan-Meier analysis assessed survival, and Cox-regression models evaluated predictors of long-term mortality after adjustment for conventional risk factors.
Higher ALBI tertiles were associated with a greater comorbidity burden, worse ventricular function, and elevated biomarkers of inflammation and cardiac stress. In-hospital mortality increased across tertiles (5.3%, 7.3%, 11.8%). Long-term mortality also rose progressively (7.3%, 9.8%, 11.8%), with 60-month survival rates of approximately 90% (T1), 88% (T2), and 73% (T3). ALBI score independently predicted long-term mortality (HR 1.86, 95% CI 1.23-2.82), along with chronic kidney disease and lower TAPSE. Restricted cubic spline analysis demonstrated a near-linear association between ALBI and mortality risk.
Preprocedural ALBI score is independently associated with both short and long-term mortality after TAVI and may reflect systemic vulnerability not captured by conventional risk models. Incorporating ALBI into preprocedural assessment could enhance risk stratification."

This initiative aims to strengthen the national development of cardiovascular devices.
Computational analyses, mechanical tests, and hydrodynamic tests (normocardic and accelerated fatigue) were performed. The BVC-F was evaluated in a range of 20 to 200 beats per minute for 30 min. The accelerated fatigue tests were carried out at a frequency of 1050-1080 beats/min for a period of 1 month, followed by implantation in five Yorkshire porcine models using extracorporeal circulation.
Finite element analysis indicated a low risk of fracture (stresses 73% below yield strength) and radial expansion (15.95%). Tests validated an effective orifice area of 2.25 cm², transvalvular gradients < 10 mmHg, and a regurgitant flow lower than 5%. Accelerated fatigue tests confirmed structural integrity equivalent to 2.2 years. In vivo porcine implantation (n = 5) was successful, maintaining a mean gradient of 10 ± 2 mmHg with no paravalvular leakage. Furthermore, the viability of a ViV procedure was validated, resulting in sufficient annulus expansion and stable hemodynamics.
The BVC-F INC achieved compliance with preliminary safety and efficacy standards. Nonetheless, extended and complex simulations are requisite to assess long-term mechanical behavior, wear resistance, and functional stability before human clinical trials."

A propensity-matched, retrospective study of consecutive aortic valve interventions from 2010 to 2023.
A single institution.
Patients with severe AS and reduced EF (<50%) undergoing aortic valve intervention.
The cohort was dichotomized by SAVR versus TAVR.
A total of 1,164 patients underwent an aortic valve intervention for severe AS with reduced EF (<50%), of which 240 (20.6%) had an isolated SAVR and 924 (79.4%) underwent a TAVR. Propensity matching yielded 205 pairs. The 30-day mortality and stroke rates were no different across groups. Paravalvular leak was significantly higher in the TAVR group, and there was a statistically nonsignificant trend toward more pacemakers in the TAVR group (p = 0.093). At 1 year, EF was similar between groups: 48% (IQR: 41-53) in the SAVR group versus 53% (IQR: 37-58) in the TAVR group (p = 0.431). Conversely, at 1 year, mean pressure gradients were higher in the TAVR group (10 [7-15] mmHg v 8 [7-10] mmHg, p = 0.040). The cumulative incidence of heart failure readmissions was higher in the TAVR group, although it was a statistically nonsignificant trend (p = 0.066). The cumulative incidence of aortic valve reintervention was similar across groups (p = 0.564). Kaplan-Meier survival estimates were significantly lower in the TAVR group (p = 0.016).
While surgery may optimize survival after aortic valve replacement in patients with reduced EF, these observational findings need to be verified by prospective randomized controlled comparisons."

The objective of the study was to investigate procedure-related changes in eGFR and clinical outcomes following mTEER.
We studied patients in the Transcatheter Valve Therapy registry undergoing mTEER between 2013 and 2022 with available baseline and discharge eGFR. Multivariable linear regression identified baseline characteristics associated with changes in eGFR following mTEER. Cox proportional hazards models examined the adjusted association between improved (≥10% increase in eGFR), unchanged, and worsened renal function (≥10% decrease in eGFR) and survival at 1 year.
Among 48,472 patients undergoing mTEER, 15.7% experienced improved renal function and 13.7% had worsened renal function. Cardiogenic shock within 24 hours, age >80, Black race, diabetes, heart failure within 2 weeks, and female sex were strongly associated with worsened renal function after mTEER. Compared to the group with no change in renal function, improved renal function was associated with a decreased risk of 1-year mortality (adjusted hazard ratio: 0.77; 95% CI 0.69-0.86, p < 0.001), whereas worsened renal function was associated with an increased risk of death at 1 year (adjusted hazard ratio: 2.85; 95% CI 2.64-3.08, p < 0.001).
Approximately 30% of patients experience marked changes in renal function following mTEER.A greater than 10% increase or decrease in eGFR is independently associated with differences in 1-year survival. Careful attention to patients at greatest risk for worsened renal function after mTEER is warranted."

While traditional approaches have addressed these components in isolation, this review summarizes the mechanisms and clinical evidence of a 'whole-heart electro-mechanical optimization' approach for the treatment of bradycardia.
Accelerated atrial pacing can lower left-sided filling pressures and improve symptoms in patients with heart failure with preserved ejection fraction and diastolic dysfunction. Bachmann bundle area pacing restores physiological atrial activation, which not only improves diastolic filling and reduces atrial arrhythmia burden but also redefines the effective AV-delay. AV-sequential pacing enables optimization of AV coupling to enhance left ventricular filling by restoring appropriate timing between early ventricular filling and atrial contraction, and by reducing diastolic mitral regurgitation. Importantly, conduction system pacing, typically left bundle branch area pacing, preserves near-normal ventricular activation enabling the full hemodynamic benefits of the preceding interventions without pacing-induced dyssynchrony.
Together, these complementary and interdependent pacing strategies form an integrated 'whole-heart electro-mechanical optimization' approach aimed at integrative optimization of whole-heart pump function in selected patients."

This study aimed to correlate MAVIR with echocardiographic and clinical variables of myxomatous mitral valve disease (MMVD) severity in dogs.
Data from two centres were reviewed for healthy dogs and dogs with MMVD. The RF was calculated using Teichholz (RFTeichh) and Simpson (RFSMOD) methods. The correlation between MAVIR and echocardiographic indices and its difference across American College of Veterinary Internal Medicine and Mitral INsufficiency Echocardiographic (MINE) classes were assessed. A receiver operating characteristic curve analysis assessed MAVIR's ability to predict MMVD severity and RF.
A total of 1,109 examinations from 950 dogs were included in the present study. The MAVIR differed between healthy and MMVD at all American College of Veterinary Internal Medicine stages and MINE classes (P<0.001). It correlated with RFSMOD (Rho: 0.78, P<0.001) and RFTeichh (Rho: 0.83, P<0.001). The areas under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUCs) for discriminating mild from moderate and moderate from severe-late stage according to the MINE score were AUCs = 0.709 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.673, 0.745) and 0.784 (95% CI: 0.731, 0.836), respectively; for predicting RFSMOD ≥ 50%, the AUC was 0.946 (95% CI: 0.926, 0.966), with a cutoff >1.27 (sensitivity 91.11%; specificity 84.15%).
Retrospective study design and negative RF values are the limitations of this study.
Although not clinically validated against a gold standard, the MAVIR is associated with MMVD severity. A MAVIR >1.27 predicts an RFSMOD ≥ 50%. Given its simplicity, MAVIR might represent a valuable tool for staging MMVD and warrants further investigation."

This retrospective propensity-score-matched analysis compared the outcomes of MI-MVr in obese patients (body mass index [BMI] ≥30 kg/m2), with those in individuals with normal body weight (BMI 19-25 kg/m2), focusing on overall survival.
In 501 analysed matched pairs, BMI ranged 30-60 kg/m2 in obese group and 19-24.9 kg/m2 in normal-BMI group. There were no baseline differences among matched cohorts, except for higher incidence of hypertension (78% vs 57%, P < .001) and hypercholesterolaemia (35% vs 28%, P = .02) in obese patients, and slightly worse renal function. All patients received MI-MVr through right lateral mini-thoracotomy. The median total operative time (by 11 minutes) and cardiopulmonary by-pass time (by 5 minutes) were longer in obese patients (P = .001), but the cross-clamp times did not differ. There were no intergroup differences in the early complication rates or hospitalization lengths. After a median follow-up of 9.3 years, the overall survival was similar. Actuarial survival at 15 years was 59% for obese patients and 57% for those with normal BMI (log-rank, P = .38). A multivariable model identified diabetes (HR [95% CI], 1.65 [1.26-2.16], P = .0003), chronic lung disease (1.81 [1.31-2.51], P = .0004), left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) <50% (2.28 [1.78-2.93], P ≤ .0001), and older age (1.08 [1.07-1.10], P ≤ .0001) as independent predictors of mortality.
Obesity alone does not influence the outcomes of MI-MVr, but diabetes, chronic lung disease, and impaired pump function do affect the overall survival."

The value of four-dimensional automated right ventricular quantification (4D-RVQ) in PMR remains underexplored.
In this prospective study, 141 participants (36 mild, 31 moderate, 35 severe PMR, and 39 controls) underwent comprehensive echocardiography, including 2D speckle-tracking and 4D-RVQ. The RV-pulmonary artery (PA) coupling index was derived as the ratio of RV free wall longitudinal strain (RVFWLS) to pulmonary artery systolic pressure (PASP). Both 2D and 4D RVFWLS and RV global longitudinal strain showed a significant progressive decline with increasing PMR severity (P < 0.001), outperforming conventional parameters like TAPSE. The RV-PA coupling index demonstrated the strongest correlation with RVEF (r = -0.631, P < 0.001). 4D-RVQ parameters showed good agreement with 2D-derived values. Notably, the 4D RV-PA coupling index exhibited superior discriminatory power for moderate-or-greater PMR (AUC: 0.893, 95% CI: 0.809-0.977), slightly outperforming the 2D index. Despite the preservation of LV ejection fraction even in severe PMR, RV dysfunction was apparent by the moderate stage.
4D-RVQ provides a comprehensive and sensitive assessment of RV function in PMR. RV strain parameters and the RV-PA coupling index are superior to conventional measures for detecting early RV dysfunction. Its integration into clinical practice can improve the detection of right heart function with significant PMR by directly quantifying the pathophysiological hallmark of RV-PA uncoupling."

Despite this, little is known about sex differences in LV remodeling in patients with mitral valve prolapse (MVP) undergoing mitral valve repair (MVr).
To assess pre- and post-MVr sex differences in LV size and function in patients with MVP.
Patients with MVP operated between 2007-2024 at two Heart Valve Centers were included. We excluded patients with previous cardiac surgery, coronary artery disease, other concomitant procedures than tricuspid valve repair, non-sinus rhythm at baseline and those with significant post-surgical mitral regurgitation (≥grade 2). LV size was evaluated before and after surgery using both end-systolic diameter (ESD) and volume (ESV), while LV function was assessed by EF and GLS. Thresholds for normal sex-specific LV size and function were based on current recommendations. The primary outcome was postoperative LV damage, defined as the presence of enlarged LV ESVi, impaired LV EF or impaired LV GLS. The ability of preoperative measures of LV size to discriminate the outcome was assessed using receiver operating characteristics curve analyses.
A total of 190 patients (37% women, mean age 58 ± 12 years) were assessed 4 [1-6] months before and 14 [11-22] months after surgery. While men had significantly larger preoperative LV ESD (37 ± 5 mm vs. 34 ± 5 mm), LV ESV (74 ± 20 ml vs. 52 ± 13 ml) and LV ESV/BSA (36 ± 9 ml/m2 vs. 30 ± 7 ml/m2) than women, LV ESD/BSA was higher in women (19 ± 3 mm/m2 vs. 18 ± 2 mm/m2) (all p <0.010). Postoperatively, only men exhibited significantly lower LV ESV compared to the preoperative values, regardless of BSA indexation: LV ESV 62 ± 16 ml and LV ESV/BSA 31 ± 7 ml/m2 in men (both p <0.001), but LV ESV 50 ± 14 ml (p =0.265) and LV ESV/BSA 29 ± 8 ml/m2 (p =0.216) in women. In multivariable logistic regression analysis, women were 6.3 (95% CI 2.6-14.9, p <0.001) times more likely than men to have dilated LV after MVr after adjusting for baseline characteristics (p <0.001). LV EF was similar between sexes both before and after surgery. LV GLS was higher in women than in men before surgery (22.8 ± 2.6% vs. 22.1 ± 2.2%, p =0.038) but comparable after surgery (17.1 ± 2.6% vs. 17.2 ± 2.2%, p =0.715). Adjusting for age as well as preoperative LV GLS, LV size and left atrial reservoir strain, women were 3.3 (95% CI 1.5-7.3, p =0.003) times more likely than men to have impaired LV GLS postoperatively (p <0.001). The optimal cutoff of LV ESD/BSA to predict postoperative LV damage was 19 mm/m2 in men and 16 mm/m2 in women with an AUC of 0.68.
In patients with MVP undergoing MVr, women have higher BSA-adjusted LV size by ESD, while ESV remains larger in men. Only men demonstrate a significant reduction in LV ESV after MVr, whereas women are more prone to postoperative LV dilatation and dysfunction. Our findings suggest that women are being operated at a later stage of disease, and support the need for sex-specific assessment of preoperative LV size when referring patients to mitral valve surgery."

Case reports,"Infective endocarditis arising on a stenotic mitral valve is uncommon, and it may present with atypical morphology.
We report a case of infective endocarditis in a patient with mild to moderate degenerative mitral stenosis who developed an extensive, broad-based vegetation nearly occluding the mitral valve, with an overlying contiguous aneurysm-like cystic structure. Transthoracic echocardiography demonstrated an elevated transmitral gradient, while transesophageal echocardiography revealed hemodynamic communication between the cystic structure and the left ventricle. Computed tomography showed contrast enhancement within the cavity. Three-dimensional transesophageal echocardiography was crucial in delineating the en face morphology and extent of the obstruction. The surgical and pathological findings confirmed a flat vegetation with pseudoaneurysmal features.
This high-risk morphology warrants urgent surgical consideration, as aneurysmal rupture could precipitate acute mitral regurgitation superimposed on obstruction.
With the increasing prevalence of degenerative mitral stenosis, recognition of such morphologies is essential to guide timely surgical intervention."

Heart failure,"Left atrial (LA) remodeling, characterized by progressive enlargement, is commonly observed in heart failure with reduced ejection fraction and reflects left ventricular (LV) dysfunction and functional mitral regurgitation (FMR). However, its independent prognostic significance remains uncertain.
This study aims to investigate the independent association between LA volume index (LAVI) and long-term mortality in patients with heart failure, considering its interaction with FMR severity.
A cohort of 13,954 patients who received a diagnosis of heart failure stage B or C and a first diagnosis of reduced LV ejection fraction (<50%) at Mayo Clinic was analyzed. Comprehensive echocardiographic quantification of LAVI, LV function, FMR, and hemodynamics was performed. Survival analysis included Kaplan-Meier curves, Cox proportional hazards models, and spline modeling, adjusted for demographic, clinical, and echocardiographic variables.
Mean LAVI increased with worsening FMR (35 ± 14 mL/m2 in no FMR to 61 ± 23 mL/m2 in severe FMR). Higher LAVI was associated with increased mortality (HR: 1.13 per 10 mL/m2; P < 0.0001), independent of LV function, FMR, and comorbidities. A mortality risk threshold emerged at LAVI >40 mL/m2, with excess mortality increasing steeply beyond this point. Stratification showed significant interactions between LAVI, LV ejection fraction, atrial fibrillation, and pulmonary hypertension. Although LAVI threshold of excess mortality shifted from about 40 mL/m2 in no-mild FMR to about 60 mL/m2 in severe FMR, the slope of the relationship persisted unaltered, confirming the graded relationship between LAVI and outcome at each FMR grade (P for interaction = 0.35).
LAVI is an independent predictor of mortality in heart failure stage B or C, with excess risk starting at 40 mL/m2. The prognostic impact of LAVI persisted with a graded relationship in all FMR severity grades, emphasizing its role in risk stratification. These findings support the integration of LA remodeling assessment into heart failure management to refine prognostic evaluation and therapeutic strategies."

Mechanical circulatory support (MCS), such as the HeartMate 3 left ventricular assist device (LVAD), is a therapeutic option for patients who are ineligible for heart transplantation. Right heart failure (RHF), depending on the clinical criteria applied for its diagnosis, occurs in 10-40% of patients following LVAD implantation and significantly worsens prognosis. This report presents a 69-year-old male with chronic ischemic HF, prior cardiac resynchronization therapy with defibrillator (CRT-D) implantation, and coronary intervention with drug-eluting stents. Due to progressive mitral regurgitation (MR) and elevated HF biomarkers, MitraClip implantation was performed with initial clinical improvement. Subsequently, left ventricular function deteriorated despite optimized pharmacotherapy, leading to HeartMate 3 LVAD implantation. The postoperative course was complicated by recurrent cardiac tamponade requiring surgical management. Progressive RHF necessitated temporary support with an Impella RP device. Further complications included recurrent infections, sepsis, respiratory failure, and acute kidney injury requiring renal replacement therapy. Despite comprehensive treatment, progressive multiorgan failure and severe cachexia developed. Given the patient's status as a destination therapy, care was transitioned to home-based palliative management. This case illustrates the complexity of managing end-stage HF with LVAD support, highlighting the frequent complications such as RHF and infections, and the importance of recognizing when to prioritize comfort in advanced disease."

Imaging methods and practice,"In the follow-up of patients with mitral regurgitation (MR), assessment of left ventricular (LV) dilatation using standard echocardiography often yields inconsistent results. We investigated whether measuring 3D LV end-systolic volume (3DLVESV) improves risk stratification in moderate or greater MR.
In the prospective 3D Echocardiography and Cardiovascular Prognosis in Mitral Regurgitation (3D-PRIME) study, 227 patients -142 with primary (PMR) and 85 secondary MR (SMR)- underwent 2D/3D echocardiography. 3DLVESV was increased if ≥41.5/35 mL/m², and LV end-systolic diameter (LVESD) enlarged if ≥39.8/34.8 mm in men/women. The primary outcome was a composite of MR progression towards intervention, death, or heart failure hospitalization (HFH). Death or HFH was a secondary outcome.At baseline, 28% of PMR and 54% of SMR patients had increased 3DLVESV. After 21 (15-25) months, increased 3DLVESV was associated with 1.9-fold (1.2-3.2) higher adjusted risk of the primary outcome in PMR, and 4.1-fold (1.6-10.7) higher risk of death or HFH in SMR (P < 0.05). 3DLVESV and LVESD concordantly identified LV dilatation in 20% of PMR patients and were discordant in 27%. Both patients with increased 3DLVESV only, and those with increased both 3DLVESV and LVESD, had high risk of the primary outcome after adjusting for recommendations for intervention in PMR: HR 7.1 (2.9-16.9) and 4.9 (2.1-11.1), respectively (P < 0.001).
Increased 3DLVESV is associated with a higher risk of adverse events in patients with significant MR. In PMR, evaluating LV dilatation using both 3DLVESV and LVESD may enhance risk stratification and aid in patient selection for close follow-up.

We aimed to investigate whether the level and the change of the TyG index were associated with HCM.
The study retrospectively collected socio-demographic, medical, anthropometric, and laboratory data from patients with HCM who were continuously admitted to Beijing Anzhen Hospital between January 1, 2018, and December 31, 2022. Logistic regressions were used to determine the relationship between the TyG index, other HCM factors, and the incidence of atrial fibrillation (AF). After stratifying patients by TyG index, we compared inter-group characteristics and evaluated the association between the TyG index and AF using logistic regression, followed by subgroup analyses to examine the consistency of this association.
For the total HCM population, the prevalence of AF was 285/1284(22.20%). Patients with AF had greater age (61.8 ± 10.6 vs. 54.0 ± 14.2 years, P < 0.001), lower body mass index (BMI) (25.59 ± 3.27 vs. 26.47 ± 4.03, P < 0.001), larger left atrial diameter (LAD) (46.86 ± 7.11 vs. 40.39 ± 5.98, P < 0.001), and more moderate or severe mitral regurgitation (MR) (82.5% vs. 67.0%, P < 0.001). Patients with AF had significantly greater free fatty acids (FFA) level (0.50 ± 0.26 vs. 0.44 ± 0.22, P = 0.004), although their triglycerides (TG) (1.45 ± 0.95 vs. 1.77 ± 1.05, P < 0.001), TyG index (8.64 ± 0.64 VS. 8.84 ± 0.64, P < 0.001), total cholesterol (TC) (4.21 ± 1.07 vs. 4.53 ± 1.07, P < 0.001), and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) (2.55 ± 0.91 vs. 2.75 ± 0.88, P = 0.001) levels were much lower. In the multivariate logistic regression model, we discovered that age, LAD, left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF), and TyG index were independently linked with the occurrence of AF. Subgroup analysis of the study population showed no interaction between all subgroups after adjusting for confounders.
In conclusion, our study demonstrates that a higher TyG index is inversely associated with key adverse features in HCM, including LAD, and the prevalence of AF and moderate-to-severe MR. Further investigations are warranted to elucidate the mechanisms underlying these associations and their impact on the long-term prognosis of HCM."

ICM with significantly reduced LVEF remains one of the severe forms of chronic heart failure (CHF), associated with a high risk of adverse outcomes. The choice of the optimal treatment strategy, coronary revascularization in addition to intensive medical therapy, is a subject of active discussion and requires further study, especially regarding its effect on LV reverse remodeling and long-term prognosis. This retrospective cohort study included 561 patients with ICM and LVEF &lt;40%. The follow-up lasted from 2014 through 2024. 74% of the patients were men aged 61.4±8.7 years. Patients were divided into a revascularization group (PCI+OMT, n=281) and an OMT group (n=280). The structural and functional state of the heart was assessed using transthoracic echocardiography (ECHO) with standard protocols.
The OMT group had a significantly higher EuroSCORE II surgical risk (4.0±1.9% vs. 3.0±1.5% in the PCI+OMT group; p&lt;0.05), a greater prevalence of stage III or higher chronic kidney disease (35.7% vs. 17.8%; p&lt;0.05), and more severe LV dilatation (LV end-diastolic volume 265±54 ml vs. 245±45 ml; p&lt;0.05). The PCI+OMT group presented with significantly higher anatomical lesion complexity compared to the OMT group (SYNTAX Score 33.5±8.8 vs. 28.9±9.7, p&lt;0.05). At the 24-month follow-up, the PCI+OMT group demonstrated a superior improvement in LVEF (+10.7±6.8% vs. +2.1±4.5%, p&lt;0.001). The proportion of patients with severe mitral regurgitation (III+) was lower in the PCI+OMT group (5.3% vs. 16.1%, p&lt;0.001), and overall mortality was 10.7% vs. 23.2% in the OMT group (p&lt;0.001). The CHF-related hospitalization rate was also significantly lower in the PCI+OMT group than in the OMT group (17.8% vs. 33.9%; p&lt;0.001).
The combination of PCI and OMT is associated with a pronounced recovery of myocardial contractility, reverse LV remodeling, and regression of functional mitral regurgitation. The structural changes in the myocardium achieved through the integrative approach translate into a significant reduction in overall mortality and hospitalizations rates due to decompensated CHF during mid-term follow-up."

FAMR in AF is an independent predictor of poor prognosis in patients with HFpEF. This highlights the importance of rhythm control as a pathogenetic strategy for this patient category."
PubMed,mitral regurgitation,How does rewarming temperature affect bleeding after mitral valve repair?,Yu-Hua Cheng; Yun-Fei Han; Jian-Wen Zeng; Wei-Guo Ma; Kai Sun; Shao-Qing Lei; Wei-Qin Huang,10.1177/02676591261422997,2026-02-11,Perfusion,"ObjectiveSo far, evidence is scarce regarding the impact of rewarming temperature on bleeding after cardiac surgery under cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB). We seek to evaluate how rewarming temperature affects postoperative bleeding in patients undergoing mitral valve repair.MethodsClinical, anesthesia and CPB data were analyzed for 379 adults undergoing isolated mitral regurgitation repair. Platelet levels (1000/μL) were divided into three groups: low, 53-164 (n = 128); medium, 165-208 (n = 126); and high, 209-906 (n = 125). The primary endpoint was chest drainage volume (mL) at 24 postoperative hours. To delineate the degree and impact of rewarming, a variable ""rewarming/cooling ratio"" was defined as: peak rewarming temperature (°C) divided by nadir cooling temperature (°C). General linear models were used to evaluate factors associated with the volume of 24-h chest drainage.ResultsMean flow rate was 2.7 ± 0.1 L/min/m2, nadir core temperature 30.7 ± 1.3°C and peak rewarming temperature 36.2 ± 0.5°C. The ""rewarming/cooling ratio"" averaged 1.133 ± 0.044.Postoperatively, nadir platelet count was 115 ± 46 k/μL, and chest drainage averaged 344 ± 181 mL at 24 h. Two patients underwent re-exploration for bleeding (0.5%). Transfusion was required in 85 patients (22.4%).Gender (F = 20.585, p < 0.001), platelet count (F = 3.875, p = 0.024), fibrinogen (F = 4.241, p = 0.040), and chest incision (F = 58.097, p < 0.001), rather than the rewarming temperature (F = 2.322, p = 0.128), were factors significantly associated with 24-h chest drainage.A significant interaction existed between platelet levels and ""rewarming/cooling ratio"" (F = 3.717, p = 0.025), i.e., with a higher ""rewarming/cooling ratio"", 24-h chest drainage tended to increase in the low platelet group, and to decrease in patients with high and medium platelet levels.ConclusionsIn this series of patients undergoing isolated mitral regurgitation repair, gender, platelet count, fibrin and chest incision, rather than rewarming temperature, were independent factors significantly associated with postoperative bleeding. The impact of rewarming temperature on postoperative bleeding was modified by preoperative platelet levels. It is advisable to avoid excessive cooling during CPB and keep the cooling temperature at maximally allowable level."

While transcatheter edge-to-edge repair (TEER) improves symptoms and prognosis in selected patients, its effects on cardiac remodeling remain debated. This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to evaluate the impact of TEER on echocardiographic indices of cardiac remodeling.
PubMed, Scopus, and Cochrane Library were used to identify relevant studies assessing echocardiographic changes before and after TEER. Outcomes of interest were left ventricular (LV) ejection fraction, global longitudinal strain, LV end-diastolic and end-systolic volumes and LV end-diastolic and end-systolic diameter, tricuspid annular plane systolic excursion, pulmonary artery systolic pressure, and left atrial end-systolic volume.
Forty-two studies (3987 patients) were included. TEER was associated with a significant increase in LV ejection fraction (mean difference [MD], 1.51% [95% CI, 0.47-2.55]), without significant improvement in global longitudinal strain. Significant LV remodeling was observed, with reductions in LV end-diastolic volume (standardized MD, -0.26 [95% CI, -0.37 to -0.14]), LV end-systolic volume (standardized MD, -0.21 [95% CI, -0.30 to -0.12]), LV end-diastolic diameter (MD, -2.35 mm [95% CI, -3.66 to -1.04]) and left ventricular end-systolic diameter (MD, -2.30 mm [95% CI, -3.86 to -0.74). TEER also improved right ventricular function (tricuspid annular plane systolic excursion [MD, 1.29 mm [95% CI, 0.60-1.97]) and reduced pulmonary artery systolic pressure (MD, -6.75 mm Hg [95% CI, -8.53 to -4.97). No significant improvement in left atrial end-systolic volume was detected.
Available evidence suggests that TEER promotes significant cardiac remodeling in patients with secondary mitral regurgitation."

Successful repair requires restoration of physiologic leaflet motion and stable coaptation and prevents systolic anterior motion. This manuscript describes an algorithmic approach for Barlow's valve repair centered on chord transfer and leaflet management. Chord transfer utilizes normally functioning secondary chords as support for prolapsing leaflet segments. By mobilizing and reattaching these chords to areas of excess height or unsupported leaflet tissue, balanced leaflet motion can be restored. The technique is detailed step-by-step, including identification of abnormal chordal structures, selection of appropriate chords and precise re-implantation to restore coaptation geometry. Additional leaflet management strategies to address Barlow's disease include cleft closure, assessing and correcting areas of asymmetry, smoothing of irregular edges. Operative images and descriptions illustrate how to safely execute these modifications while preserving leaflet integrity and subvalvular architecture. This approach aims to simplify and standardize repair with a reliable method to repair a complex Barlow's valve without use of artificial neochord implantation."

We postulated that the enhanced visualization and wristed instrumentation of totally endoscopic robotic mitral repair could enable precise shortening with durable hemodynamics and acceptable peri-operative risk.
We retrospectively analyzed 523 consecutive degenerative mitral regurgitation (MR) repairs performed robotically at the National Taiwan University Hospital (January 2012-November 2024). Chordae shortening was used in 68 patients (13%; 46 primary, 22 adjunct) and compared with 455 contemporaneous repairs without shortening.
Baseline characteristics and operative times were similar [cross‑clamp 74±27 vs. 75±25 min; cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) 120±30 vs. 120±25 min]. All shortening cases achieved successful repair without conversion or valve replacement. At discharge, none/trace MR was more frequent after shortening (95.6% vs. 93.4%); no patient in the shortening group had ≥ moderate MR. Early events were low: 30-day mortality 0% vs. 0.2%, stroke 0% vs. 0.2%, renal failure 1.5% vs. 1.8%, and reoperation for bleeding 1.5% vs. 0%. Reintubation (2.9% vs. 0%) and new-onset atrial fibrillation (33.8% vs. 13.6%) were more common with shortening, yet median ventilation time was comparable, and resource use favored shortening [intensive care unit (ICU) stay 19±28 vs. 27±25 h; hospital stay 7.0±2.9 vs. 9.5±2.7 days]. Follow-up echocardiography (median, 3.6 years) showed sustained competence: 92% of shortening patients remained MR-free. Ten-year freedom from ≥ moderate MR was 95.6% with shortening vs. 94.5% without (log-rank P=0.66).
Robotic chordae shortening adds negligible operative time, shortens ICU and hospital stay, and delivers long-term valve competence equivalent to contemporary robotic repairs relying on chordal transfer or neochordae. Although new-onset atrial fibrillation was more frequent, other adverse events were rare. The robotic platform appears to overcome historical limitations of chordae shortening, restoring this tissue‑preserving option for anterior leaflet prolapse in degenerative mitral disease."

Unlike conventional indices such as left ventricular ejection fraction and global longitudinal strain, MW integrates myocardial deformation with left ventricular pressure, providing a load-adjusted and physiologically meaningful assessment of myocardial performance. Growing evidence demonstrates that impaired MW is consistently associated with adverse outcomes, including heart failure hospitalization, mortality, and functional deterioration, across a wide spectrum of cardiovascular conditions such as ischemic heart disease, valvular heart disease, and cardiomyopathies. The noninvasive estimation of MW using commercially available echocardiographic software has enhanced its feasibility in routine clinical practice, enabling improved risk stratification and early identification of high-risk patients. This review summarizes current evidence supporting the prognostic value of MW, highlights its incremental role beyond conventional echocardiographic parameters, and discusses future perspectives for its integration into everyday clinical decision-making."

Case reports,"Lambl's excrescences (LEs) are thin, filamentous valvular strands that are usually small and asymptomatic, however when they are large and mobile, they can cause embolic or obstructive events.
A 59-year-old man presented with recurrent angina-like chest pain. Coronary angiography showed an intermediate lesion in the left anterior descending artery without hemodynamic relevance. Echocardiography revealed a highly mobile, 20- to 30-mm filamentous structure attached to the left coronary cusp, intermittently prolapsing toward the left coronary ostium and causing moderate aortic regurgitation. Surgical excision and aortic valve replacement were performed through a ministernotomy. Symptoms resolved, and histopathology confirmed a giant LE.
Giant or hypermobile LEs can dynamically obstruct coronary ostia, mimicking atherosclerotic angina, even without significant coronary vascular disease. Surgical treatment is recommended when lesions are large, symptomatic, or associated with an increased risk of embolism.
Large LEs may cause coronary obstruction; multimodality imaging is essential, timely surgical removal provides relief and prevents ischemic or embolic complications."

Cardiovascular Imaging,"Multivalvular heart disease (MVD), defined as coexisting lesions in two or more valves, poses significant diagnostic and prognostic challenges. While isolated valvular heart disease (VHD) is well characterized, the impact of moderate aortic regurgitation (AR) with another concomitant moderate VHD remains unclear. Current guidelines focus mainly on isolated severe lesions, potentially underestimating moderate MVD. This study assessed the prevalence and prognostic impact of concomitant moderate VHD in patients with moderate AR.
We retrospectively analyzed 794 patients with ≥ moderate AR (2017-2023) from a dedicated echocardiographic database. Groups were: isolated moderate AR (n=178), isolated significant AR (n=214), and moderate AR plus ≥ one concomitant moderate VHD (n=402). Significant AR was defined by the presence of ≥1 echocardiographic severity criterion. Exclusion criteria included cardiomyopathy, prior cardiac surgery, LVEF <50%, or severe VHD other than AR. Follow-up was 24 months for a composite endpoint of all-cause mortality and heart failure hospitalization (HHF). VHD severity was graded per guidelines. Patients with moderate AR plus another VHD were older (79.9 vs. 66.4 years, p<0.001), with more comorbidities and larger left atria. During follow-up, 151 patients (18.8%) met the composite endpoint (63 HHF, 108 deaths). Moderate AR with another VHD independently predicted higher risk [HR 2.83 (95% CI: 1.32-6.03; p = 0.007)], comparable to isolated significant AR [HR 2.65 (95% CI: 1.23-5.70; p = 0.013)].
Moderate AR with another concomitant moderate VHD carries a prognosis similar to significant AR, indicating this combination is not benign and may be underestimated by current guidelines."

SISBH diagnosis is based on oral anticoagulation history associated with acute abdominal symptoms and suggestive radiological findings. Experience with this condition is still limited in the literature. This report highlights the clinical presentation and management of this rare condition, including the first known use of total-body positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) scan in the diagnostic workup of SISBH.
A 53-year-old male on long-term oral anticoagulation with VKA for mechanical mitral valve replacement due to rheumatic heart disease presented to the emergency department for abdominal pain and nausea. Physical examination was remarkable for abdominal distension, increased bowel sounds and rebound tenderness, a presentation compatible with intestinal subocclusion. At admission, the international normalized ratio was 8.3, indicating VKA intoxication. Abdominal CT revealed significant jejunal parietal thickening, suggestive of SISBH. PET/CT findings were also consistent with a possible hematoma, although an inflammatory or neoplastic process could not be excluded. We opted for conservative treatment with temporary warfarin suspension and vitamin K infusion. The patient's intestinal subocclusion gradually improved, and he was discharged after seven days with full recovery.
SISBH, although rare, should be considered in the differential diagnosis of acute abdominal symptoms in patients receiving long-term oral anticoagulation, particularly with VKAs. Conservative treatment is the preferred initial option. A high index of suspicion, followed by prompt abdominal CT, is key to early diagnosis. PET/CT provided minimal diagnostic value beyond CT. Conservative management with anticoagulation reversal and supportive care is generally the primary therapeutic strategy adopted in the literature, demonstrating favorable short-term outcomes, as was the case with our patient."

It is a progressive form of heart valves damage that leads to dysfunction of the heart. According to WHO 2020, It is urgently necessary to clarify the pathogenic mechanisms underlying RHD in order to develop therapeutic interventions. Molecular mimicry (MM), the fundamental mechanism underlying RHD, is triggered by antigens on group A streptococcus (GAS) to activate CD4 + T cells, which subsequently cross-react with related peptides in the tissue surrounding the heart valve. Although, the most well-established theory for the development of RHD is MM, however, over the past few years, competence of MM theory to elucidate autoimmune diseases in RHD is questioned several times. The GAS first adheres and colonize on the surface of epithelium of the heart and then with the help of various adhesion molecules invade the heart valves and cause inflammation. Furthermore, the observation that multiple members of the affected person's family have RHD supports the idea that genetics plays a role in the RHD pathogenesis. This suggests a genetic predisposition for RHD. Therefore, in the present review, besides MM, other factors such as cellular proteins, various cells producing cytokines and chemokines, and genetic factors that leads to disease manifestation have been discussed."

This study aims to synthesise and update contemporary long-term TAVI versus SAVR data.
This study comprised a systematic review and meta-analysis and employed a Bayesian hierarchical design. Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing TAVI to SAVR in low-risk to intermediate-risk patients with at least 5-year follow-up were included. The primary outcome was 5-year all-cause mortality; secondary outcomes were the 5-year incidence of stroke and the 5-year incidence of the composite of mortality and stroke.
Time-to-event data were reconstructed. Relative risks (RRs) with 95% credible intervals (CrIs) were estimated from reported 5-year event rates using minimally informative priors. Sensitivity analyses were performed using various meta-analytical models, and using conventional frequentist random-effects and fixed-effects models for sensitivity purposes.
A total of six RCTs, enrolling 7249 low- to intermediate-risk patients reported 5-year outcomes (TAVI n=3704, SAVR n=3545). The 5-year all-cause mortality rate was 29.7% (28.2-31.2%, TAVI) and 27.6% (26.1-29.1%, SAVR). The median RR for all-cause mortality was 1.12 (95% CrI 1.02-1.22, heterogeneity τ2=0), with a 99.3% posterior probability that SAVR is superior to TAVI for this endpoint. For stroke, the median RR was 1.13 (95% CrI 0.93-1.39, heterogeneity τ2=0.04), resulting in an 88.0% posterior probability that SAVR outperformed TAVI for this outcome. These results were consistent across conventional frequentist random-effects and fixed-effects models employing p values (RR 1.13, 95% CI 1.05 to 1.22, p=0.001, and RR 1.12, 95% CI 1.03 to 1.23, p=0.011, respectively). There was no evidence for an interaction effect of surgical risk category (p=0.470).
In this meta-analysis of RCTs, TAVI resulted in a clinically relevant increase in all-cause mortality, and a high probability of an increased risk of stroke, at 5 years of follow-up in low-risk to intermediate-risk patients, when compared to SAVR."

Cardiovascular interventions,"Estimating the probability of major bleeding (MB) in patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) after transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) is important for decision-making regarding anticoagulation strategy.
The aim of this study was to identify independent predictors of MB to create a risk assessment score in patients with AF after successful TAVR.
In this ENVISAGE-TAVI AF (EdoxabaN Versus standard of care and their effectS on clinical outcomes in pAtients havinG undergonE Transcatheter Aortic Valve Implantation-in Atrial Fibrillation; NCT02943785) on-treatment analysis, a stepwise Cox regression model identified MB predictors from baseline patient characteristics. A simple point-based additive score was constructed using the variable β estimates from the selected model. Patients were stratified into low-, moderate-, and high-risk groups according to their risk assessment scores; the likelihood of MB was compared between groups.
Among 1,377 patients, 139 (10.1%) experienced MB (mean ± SD on-treatment follow-up: 1.3 ± 0.8 years). The independent predictors of MB formed the HARHP (low Hemoglobin, excessive Alcohol use, severe Renal impairment, history of Hypercholesterolemia, and Percutaneous coronary intervention performed within 30 days of TAVR) score, with each parameter given a weight of 1 or 2. The likelihood of MB for high-risk patients (score ≥ 4) was 6.5 times higher than for low-risk patients (score = 0 or 1) (HR: 6.54; 95% CI: 3.61-11.85; P < 0.0001) and 2.9 times higher than moderate-risk patients (score = 2 or 3) (HR: 2.86; 95% CI: 1.62-5.04; P = 0.0003). The C statistic for the HARHP score was 0.63 at 1-year follow-up and 0.62 at 2-year follow-up.
Five independent predictors of long-term MB were identified in patients with AF requiring oral anticoagulant agents after TAVR and formed the HARHP score to assess MB risk. Use of the HARHP score may improve patient outcomes."

A comparative study was conducted involving 80 individuals: 40 patients with confirmed HCM and 40 sex- and age-matched controls (22 men, 18 women, mean age 55.3±13.3 years). All participants underwent a comprehensive examination at the cardiology department, including electrocardiography (ECG), echocardiography with full assessment of intracardiac hemodynamic parameters, Holter ECG monitoring, and laboratory tests. For molecular biological analysis, plasma expression levels of circulating microRNAs (-21, -29a, -133a) were determined for all participants using real-time polymerase chain reaction.
Circulating microRNA levels differed significantly between patients with HCM and the comparison group. The analysis showed a significant increase in the microRNA-21 expression (4.07 vs. 2.03; p&lt;0.001) and significant decreases in microRNA-29a (0.24 vs. 1.83; p&lt;0.001) and microRNA-133a (0.02 vs. 6.34; p&lt;0.001). ROC analysis demonstrated a high discriminatory ability of the studied microRNAs: microRNA-21 (AUC=0.887, sensitivity 89.7%, specificity 84.4%); microRNA-29a (AUC=0.884, sensitivity 92.3%, specificity 87.5%).
Increased expression of microRNA-21 and decreased expression of microRNA-29a are associated with myocardial fibrosis, while marked suppression of microRNA-133a reflects hypertrophic remodeling. These findings suggest that this microRNA panel holds promise as potential auxiliary markers for HCM, though clinical significance requires validation in larger, prospective studies."

Nevertheless, an unexplained phenomenon known as the obesity paradox has arisen in the context of transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI), inquiring conventional beliefs. The obesity paradox refers to better clinical outcomes observed in obese individuals undergoing TAVI. These include reduced all-cause mortality, lower rates of procedural complications, and improved long-term survival rates compared to their lean counterparts. Several theories have been proposed to explain the obesity paradox in TAVI. One of the most popular is the adipose tissue-mediated cardioprotective effect hypothesis. It is known that adipose tissue could offer both protective and harmful effects on the cardiovascular system. These effects can be linked to the adipose tissue's distribution, extension, and intrinsic biological characteristics. Obesity has been associated with adipose tissue malfunction, leading to proinflammatory and deleterious effects on the cardiovascular system. As opposed to what is believed, it is suggested that a healthy obese phenotype might be facilitated by exercise, leading to outstanding cardiovascular benefits. A healthy obese phenotype is also associated with a secretome profile that has unique adipose tissue features like adequate fat storage and formation of lipid droplets, a significant capacity for adipogenesis, minimal extracellular matrix fibrosis, potential for angiogenesis, adipocyte browning, and limited infiltration or activation of macrophages. This article is presented as a specialized narrative review, synthesizing current evidence on the relationship between obesity and outcomes in patients undergoing TAVI."

We excluded patients without a documented severity of MR at initial (n=1840) or follow-up (n=960) echocardiogram and those with severe MR at initial echocardiogram (n=450). We evaluated factors associated with the development of either moderate to severe or severe MR using multivariable logistic regression analysis.
A total of 7391 patients were included in the study, 4173 (56.5%) male, and median age 75 (IQR (IQR) 64-83). In total, 357 (4.8%) patients developed severe MR on the follow-up echocardiogram at a median of 1.4 years (IQR 0.9-2.4).

Beta-blocker prescription was associated with reduced progression to severe MR (aOR 0.74).
We identified several factors associated with the progression to severe MR in patients with HF. This information could be used by clinicians to identify patients who require closer echocardiographic follow-up and access to appropriate early interventions."

There were 29 (incidence rate 0.5 per 1000 person-years) cases in the fluoroquinolone group compared with 43 (0.7 per 1000 person-years) cases in the penicillin V group during the main (1-30 days) follow-up period; corresponding to a HR 0.70 (95% CI 0.43 to 1.11). Analyses of subsequent time periods yielded results consistent with the main period: HR 1.06 (0.63-1.78) for days 31-60 and 0.90 (0.59-1.36) days 61-120. No significant differences were found in any of the subgroup- or supplementary analyses. The absolute risk difference was -17 (95% CI -33 to 6) cases of valve regurgitation per 1 000 000 courses of fluoroquinolones.
In a nationwide cohort study, there was no statistical support for an increase in the risk of mitral or aortic valve regurgitation associated with oral fluoroquinolone use."

Different initial strategies, AoV repair/surgical valvuloplasty (SAV), AoV replacement (AVR), and Ross procedure were compared to elucidate the current best strategy.
All paediatric patients undergoing different initial AoV surgeries from 1976 to 2024 were included. Factors including prior balloon dilation (balloon valvuloplasty [BAV]), valve morphology, and initial disease (stenosis/regurgitation/mixed) were analysed. Survival and incidence of AoV reoperation/≥moderate AoV insufficiency/stenosis were evaluated.
A total of 323 patients underwent 142 SAV/33 AVR/137 Ross at median age/weight of 5.7 years [interquartile range, 0.5-12.6]/19.9 kg [6.9-48.8]. Surgical valvuloplasty group was the youngest (P < .01). Thirty-day mortality was 2.5% (8/323) without group differences (P = .15). Median follow-up was 9.6 years [2.7-17.8] with 10-/20-year survival rates of 90.4% [86.1-93.4]/87.1% [81.4-91.1] without group differences. Twenty-year cumulative incidences of AoV reoperations were higher after SAV: 78.4% [70.8-86.9] vs 24.6% [11.7-51.7] after AVR and 15% [6.8-33.1] after Ross, P < .01. Survivors with their native AoV at 20 years (n = 48, 14.8%) were younger at initial surgery (P < .01), had predominantly AoV stenosis (91.7%), and had fewer BAVs (P < .01). Cox regression demonstrated 7.8-fold higher mortality hazard after AVR (P < .01) and a lower reoperation hazard after AVR and Ross (HR 0.1 [95% CI, 0.1-0.5], P < .01 and HR 0.1 [95% CI, 0.1-0.3], P < .01) compared to SAV.
All initial AoV surgeries brought excellent early/long-term survival. Aortic valve reoperations occur most frequently after SAV. In case of favourable AoV anatomy, early SAV can preserve the native valve. Ross procedure identified as safe and durable."

Their concomitant occurrence carries a much poorer prognosis than isolated valve disease. Transcatheter edge-to-edge repair (TEER) of MR and TR is safe and effective, but there is limited data on combined MR/TR TEER.
The study evaluates the safety and efficacy of combined TEER for MR and TR in a real-world cohort.
This retrospective safety and efficacy analysis included the first 40 patients treated with combined MR/TR TEER between 2019 and 2021 at our single tertiary care referral centre.
Combined procedural success (MR reduction ≥2° and TR reduction ≥1°) was achieved in 80% of the cases. Simultaneous TEER was safe, with no intraprocedural death, myocardial infarction (MI), stroke, or major bleeding. At 1-year follow-up, the median New York Heart Association functional (NYHA) class improved by one grade; twelve patients (30%) died, and fourteen patients (35%) were hospitalized for HF. Procedural success and postprocedural residual MR ≤ 1° were associated with reduced 1-year mortality rates but not HF hospitalizations.
Combined MR/TR TEER is safe and reduces MR and TR in most patients, conferring a potential benefit regarding symptoms and prognosis. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) are needed to rigorously evaluate combination therapy in this setting."

This report highlights the diagnostic approach, therapeutic strategy, and outcomes in a complex patient with multiple comorbidities. A 78-year-old woman with multiple comorbidities, including hypertension, insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, dyslipidemia, asthma, peripheral arterial disease, spherocytosis, and chronic kidney disease, presented with recurrent episodes of acute pulmonary edema (APE) initially attributed to heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF). Transthoracic echocardiography showed grade II diastolic dysfunction, pulmonary hypertension, and mild valvular disease. Coronary catheterization excluded significant obstructive coronary artery disease, whereas renal angiography revealed severe bilateral renal artery stenosis (right: 65%, left: 80%-90%), associated with worsening renal function and refractory hypertension. Given the high-risk clinical phenotype, the patient underwent bilateral renal artery angioplasty with stent placement, following nephroprotective measures due to the elevated risk of contrast-induced nephropathy. The procedure was uneventful with good angiographic results. At one-year follow-up, no further episodes of pulmonary edema occurred, renal function improved, blood pressure was well controlled, and renal arteries remained patent on ultrasound. This case highlights the importance of evaluating renal artery stenosis in patients with sudden or recurrent acute pulmonary edema, refractory hypertension, or progressive renal dysfunction, particularly in the presence of multiple comorbidities. Bilateral renal revascularization was effective in stabilizing renal function and improving blood pressure control; however, long-term follow-up remains essential."

Machine Learning (ML) classifiers offer a promising solution, but they often lack generalisation as they are typically trained on small, homogeneous datasets from selected campaigns. Here, we address this challenge by leveraging the Squidle+ platform to assemble a heterogeneous dataset of 1.7 million annotations across 150,000 images from 325 expeditions in Australian waters. To effectively train models on this scale, we introduce a novel dataset distribution strategy, the neighbour-distribution, and implement adaptive cropping to account for varying image resolutions. To assess performance at a national scale, we excluded entire campaigns from training and used them as independent test sets, allowing evaluation on complete transects, in addition to composed datasets. Using this flexible training pipeline, we combined diverse annotation schemes into three high-level Essential Ocean Variables (EOVs): Seagrass, Canopy-Forming Macroalgae, and Hard Coral cover and one species-specific label, Ecklonia radiata. This represents the first use of such a large and diverse dataset for training an ML classifier of Ecklonia radiata. The resulting models achieved test accuracies of 85%-93% for the EOVs and 96.5% for Ecklonia radiata on campaign test sets spanning Australia's coastline, demonstrating robust performance at a national scale. To enhance accessibility, both the code and trained models are made publicly available and directly integrated into Squidle+, lowering the barrier for their use in ecological monitoring programs."

Herein, we theoretically construct a three-layer stacked hybrid system with a Si nanodisk sandwiched by the MoSe2 and MoTe2 nanodisks with the same radius based on the neural network constructed by deep learning (DL). First-order and second-order anapoles are excited simultaneously in this system and couple with excitons of bulk MoTe2 and MoSe2 nanodisks, respectively. Double strong coupling behaviors are achieved between the first-order anapole and the exciton of MoTe2 , as well as the second-order anapole and the exciton of MoSe2, resulting in four energy branches with large Rabi splitting of 100.6 meV and 118.2 meV, respectively.

We sequenced the circulating TCRβ chain repertoire from 2250 HLA-typed participants across three cross-sectional cohorts, including individuals with T1D and healthy related and unrelated controls. We found that HLA risk alleles show higher restriction of TCR repertoires in individuals with T1D. We leveraged deep learning to identify T1D-associated TCR subsequence motifs that were also observed in independent TCR cohorts residing in pancreas-draining lymph nodes of individuals with T1D. Collectively, our data demonstrate T1D-related TCR motif enrichment based on genetic risk, offering a potential metric for autoreactivity and groundwork for TCR-based diagnostics and therapeutics."

These lines are constructed with careful consideration of factors such as conductor materials, insulation levels, current ratings, and voltage ratings to maintain reliable and safe electricity delivery. However, various types of faults can occur in transmission lines, posing significant challenges, often leading to outages, equipment damage, and reduced system reliability. Accurate and fast fault classification is therefore a pressing requirement in modern smart grids, where proactive maintenance and resilience are critical. This research addresses the critical need for an efficient electric fault classification model. A comprehensive investigation is conducted, employing a variety of machine learning (ML) algorithms, including Decision Tree (DT), Random Forests (RF), Naive Bayes (NB), K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Support Vector Machine (SVM), and, AdaBoost, for fault classification. Additionally, fundamental ensemble techniques such as Hard-Voting, Soft-Voting, Stacking, and Blending are incorporated with five hybrid ML models (each constructed by combining various ML algorithms) to enhance fault classification performance and the reliability of transmission lines. Also, this research proposes a hybrid ML model, specifically (RF + DT + Stacking), to classify transmission line data. The main contribution of this work is an application-oriented evaluation of classical and ensemble machine learning models for electrical fault classification, with an emphasis on benchmarking performance, model interpretability, and computational efficiency. This study demonstrates that a carefully configured hybrid ensemble (RF + DT + Stacking) can provide a practical and lightweight alternative to deep learning-based methods in grid fault monitoring scenarios. The dataset used encompasses various attributes affecting line performance, making accurate classification critical for proactive issue detection, optimized maintenance scheduling, and uninterrupted energy supply.

Utilizing a large dataset of underwater recordings, we trained a known CNN architecture without domain-relevant pretraining to identify and classify Greater Caribbean manatee calls. Our approach combined advanced signal processing techniques such as filtering and normalization with deep learning algorithms to account for the dynamic and noisy conditions of marine environments, employing data augmentation and feature extraction strategies to focus on relevant and informative sound characteristics. The neural network demonstrated promising results, with an overall F1 score of 95.6% on the Wildtracks test dataset, and an F1 score of 64.4% on the Placencia dataset after fine-tuning on less than 10 seconds of vocalizations. This highlights the ability of the model to generalize to novel datasets collected in different regions with vastly different noise profiles. Although there is room for improvement in terms of generalization, these findings represent an advancement in the automated detection and classification of Greater Caribbean manatee vocalizations. This could potentially lead to more effective monitoring of their populations and contribute to the development of improved conservation strategies."

A dual-channel deep learning (DL) model was developed by combining longitudinal and transverse ultrasound images. The model's performance was compared with single-direction DL models and a clinical model using machine learning classifiers. Performance was evaluated using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) and calibration curves.
The dual-channel DL model outperformed the single-direction models, with AUC values of 0.765 in the training set and 0.726 in the external test set. The combined model, which integrated DL features and clinical indicators, achieved the highest AUC of 0.900 in the training set and 0.873 in the external test set, surpassing both the deep learning model using fused DL model (DL_F) and clinical models.
The dual-channel DL model demonstrated superior performance in predicting occult CLNM in PTMC patients. When combined with clinical features, it offers a robust tool for personalized risk stratification and treatment decision-making, providing a non-invasive method for predicting occult CLNM and supporting individualized treatment strategies."

Retinal fundus imaging reveals the known markers of elevated stroke risk in the eyes, which are retinal venular widening, arteriolar narrowing, and increased tortuosity. In contrast to other imaging techniques used for stroke assessment, the acquisition of fundus images is easy, non-invasive, fast, and inexpensive. This paper examines the feasibility of utilizing retinal fundus imaging to differentiate individuals with stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA), aiming to assess its potential for screening or diagnostic applications. Therefore, in this study, we propose a multi-view stroke network (MVS-Net) to detect stroke and TIA using retinal fundus images. Contrary to existing studies, our study proposes for the first time a solution to discriminate stroke and TIA with deep multi-view learning by proposing an end-to-end deep network, consisting of multi-view inputs of fundus images captured from both right and left eyes. Accordingly, the proposed MVS-Net defines representative features from fundus images of both eyes and determines the relation within their macula-centered and optic nerve head-centered views. Experiments performed on a dataset collected from stroke and TIA patients, in addition to healthy controls, show that the proposed framework achieves an AUC score of 0.84 for stroke and TIA detection."

Nevertheless, its practical utility is hindered by computationally expensive iterative processes. Deep learning (DL) methods can avoid this deficiency, but they often lack of model interpretability. To bridge this gap, we propose a novel deep group-based sparse representation framework, termed DeepGSR, which brings the GSR method and the DL approach together. DeepGSR not only circumvents the iterative bottlenecks of conventional GSR but also preserves its model interpretability through a learnable parameterization. Specifically, the network is built upon a GSR model that leverages nonlocal self-similarity, and it integrates adaptive patch matching and aggregation mechanisms to model complex intra-group relationships in the latent space. To reduce the computational complexity associated with traditional SVD-based rank shrinkage, we introduce a learnable low-rank shrinkage module that incorporates low-rank constraints while enhancing the interpretability and adaptability of the model. To better exploit frequency-specific structures, the network incorporates a shifting wavelet-domain patch partitioning strategy, which separately models high- and low-frequency components to further enhance the representation ability of the network. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DeepGSR, when applied as a drop-in replacement module to various image inverse problems such as image denoising, single-image deraining, metal artifact reduction, sparse-view computed tomography reconstruction, phase retrieval, and all-in-one image restoration consistently delivers effective performance, validating the effectiveness of the proposed framework.

By leveraging sequence-based embeddings from pretrained protein language models including ESM2, ProtTrans, and ESM1v, we developed iDLDDG, a deep learning framework that integrates multi-scale structural and evolutionary information via a multi-channel architecture. To balance residue-wise information density against entropy, our entropy-based algorithm determined 181 residues as optimal for modeling biophysical constraints.

Mental health (DASS-21), quality of life (WHOQOL-BREF), academic motivation (Academic Motivation Scale), and learning approaches (Revised Two-Factor Study Process Questionnaire) were used. Analyses included ANOVA, linear regression, and mediation models. While no significant differences in mental health were observed across cohorts, a positive trend emerged during the COVID-19 period, marked by increased deep learning, reduced surface learning, and higher scores in physical and environmental QoL compared with the other three non-COVID time points. Further, motivation was found to be higher during the COVID time point than in the pre-COVID (2018) period. The COVID-19 differences were further supported by linear regression, which showed that sex, age, income, ethnicity, stage of medical training, and study hours were associated with at least one of the assessed outcomes. Mediation models offered the additional insight that surface learning may increase amotivation, which, in turn, may result in worse mental health, whereas deep learning may have suppressive mediation. These findings underscore the importance of learning approaches in shaping motivation and mental health of medical students, showing that even in vulnerable situations, deeper learning approaches can minimize mental distress."

To develop and validate a deep learning model for cerebellar volume measurement in infant brain MRI across different ages, with a focus on detecting cerebellar hypoplasia or atrophy.
A deep learning segmentation model was developed using a publicly available dataset of 558 neonatal MRI scans. The model was validated on two independent datasets: a normal set (492 scans of typical infant brains) and an abnormal set (40 scans of cerebellar hypoplasia or atrophy). Two radiologists manually refined the segmented cerebellar regions to ensure consistency, followed by quantification of cerebellar volumes and diameters. The model's segmentation accuracy was assessed using the Dice similarity coefficient (DSC). A linear regression model was developed using the normal set to predict subjects' ages based on actual age, sex, and cerebellar volume. The difference between the predicted and actual ages (Δage) was calculated and used to classify subjects as normal or abnormal. The diagnostic performance of Δage in distinguishing between the normal and abnormal sets was assessed using the area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC).
The mean DSC for cerebellar segmentation was 0.962 in the normal set and 0.882 in the abnormal set. In the normal set, cerebellar diameters were as follows: the left-right diameter ranged from 44.688 mm to 102.266 mm, the anterior-posterior diameter from 32.656 mm to 69.180 mm, and the superior-inferior diameter from 24.000 mm to 61.000 mm. The average cerebellar volume in the normal set was 79.305 cm3, showing rapid growth from birth to 10.0 months of age, with a slower growth rate from 10.0 months to 24.0 months. The AUC for Δage in identifying subjects with cerebellar hypoplasia or atrophy was 0.851.
The proposed deep learning model can accurately segment the cerebellum in infant brain MRI, quantify cerebellar volumes, and assist in identifying cerebellar hypoplasia or atrophy."

Imaging cancer,"Purpose To develop a deep learning-based, computer-aided diagnosis (CADx) model for preoperative classification of ovarian tumors (OTs) on CT scans and to compare its performance with current US models and radiologist assessments. Materials and Methods This retrospective multicenter study (January 2021-November 2023) included patients with indeterminate OTs. The dataset comprised training, internal (n = 360), and external test (n = 27) sets. Final histopathology served as the reference standard. The CADx model was trained using self-supervised learning on public and institutional CT datasets. Performance of the CADx model was compared with that of two current US-based models (Risk of Malignancy [RMI] and Assessment of Different NEoplasias in the adneXa [ADNEX] models) and with radiologist reports. Metrics included the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values, with comparisons assessed using 95% CI overlap. Results The dataset contained 387 OT images from 344 patients (226 benign and 118 malignant OTs). The model achieved a median AUC of 0.84 (95% CI: 0.65, 0.92) on the internal test set and 0.61 (95% CI: 0.59, 0.65) on the external test set. The CADx model performed comparably with the two US models and radiologists. On the internal test set, AUCs for RMI, ADNEX, and radiologists were 0.77 (95% CI: 0.72, 0.83), 0.68 (95% CI: 0.51, 0.84), and 0.76 (95% CI: 0.69, 0.83), respectively. On the external test set, corresponding AUCs were 0.66 (95% CI: 0.44, 0.88), 0.86 (95% CI: 0.60, >0.99), and 0.67 (95% CI: 0.26, >0.99), respectively. The CADx model yielded the highest sensitivity (94.7%). Conclusion Despite disease and data variability, this CT-based deep learning model for preoperative OT classification achieved comparable performances to US models and radiologists on internal and external test sets, but further refinement is needed before clinical implementation.

Additionally, its limitations and areas for improvement are analysed. Information was gathered through a search in scientific databases such as PubMed, Scopus, ScienceDirect, and Google Scholar, selecting studies published in English between 2016 and 2025. After applying exclusion criteria and removing duplicates, 51 articles were included. The main applications of AI in endodontics are grouped into three areas. In Diagnosis, AI models based on convolutional neural networks (CNNs), such as Diagnocat, have demonstrated accuracy greater than 90% in detecting periapical lesions using radiographs and cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT). Likewise, AI algorithms have successfully identified vertical root fractures with high precision in CBCT images. In the analysis of root and canal morphology, deep learning models have shown high accuracy in detecting C-shaped root canals and other anatomical variations. Regarding treatment, deep learning models can predict case complexity and improve treatment planning. Additionally, neural network-based algorithms have outperformed traditional electronic apex locators in determining root canal length. In terms of prognosis, AI models have achieved 95.6% accuracy in predicting pain after root canal treatment (RCT). AI also aids in predicting the success of non-surgical endodontic retreatments. This study demonstrates how AI is revolutionising endodontics by improving diagnostic accuracy, treatment planning, and outcome prediction. However, it faces limitations such as the need for large datasets, high costs, and lack of self-development. Future studies should address these challenges to enhance its integration into clinical practice. (EEJ-2025-05-072)."

Fast-scanning and high-resolving mass analyzers provide the sensitivity and specificity required to probe minuscule amounts of biological material. However, acquiring data from hundreds of individual cells to achieve statistical power results in complex data sets. This challenge is compounded by the limited availability of specialized data analysis tools for single-cell metabolomics, as many techniques depend on the use of specialized sampling and ionization probes. This results in incompatibility with conventional metabolomics data processing tools. Here, we present CellMate, a MATLAB-based data processing platform designed for single-cell metabolomics using direct infusion techniques. CellMate comprises identification and peak alignment of detected metabolites in an intuitive graphical user interface. CellMate supports customizable quantitative, targeted, and nontargeted metabolomic workflows. The untargeted workflow is enabled by a novel deep learning-based image classification algorithm that effectively distinguishes endogenous metabolites from background species. The source code, along with a compiled installer, is available at github.com /LanekoffLab/CellMate. We believe that CellMate represents a significant advancement in the single-cell metabolomics toolbox, enabling comprehensive data extraction of precious metabolite information from single cells."

We integrated machine learning-based virtual screening, molecular docking and molecular dynamics simulations to identify natural compounds with high binding affinity to FABP5. Candidate compounds were further validated by in-vitro assays in HCC cell lines, including proliferation, migration/invasion, apoptosis/ferroptosis-related readouts, and mechanistic validation.
The optimized models enabled efficient screening of natural products and prioritized γ-linolenic acid (GLA) as a top candidate FABP5 inhibitor. Docking and simulations supported stable binding and key residue interactions. Experimentally, GLA inhibited HCC cell proliferation and aggressiveness and promoted cell death-related pathways consistent with anti-tumor activity.
Our deep learning-guided workflow identified γ-linolenic acid as a natural FABP5 inhibitor and supports its potential as a lead compound for HCC therapy."

A debate persists regarding the optimal aortic clamp occlusion strategy, with limited comparative data. The two principal strategies, which are transthoracic cross-clamping (TTCC) and endo-aortic balloon occlusion (EABO), offer distinct advantages, but comparative clinical data remain limited. This study compares the two techniques in terms of procedural safety and early outcome. Materials and Methods: This single-center retrospective study included consecutive adult patients undergoing elective MIS via video-assisted right mini-thoracotomy between 2012 and 2018 for mitral valve surgery. Tricuspid repair, atrial fibrillation and redo surgery were included in the final cohort. Aortic occlusion was performed with transthoracic cross-clamping (TTCC) or endo-aortic balloon occlusion (EABO). Primary endpoints were intra-operative complications and the rate of conversion to full sternotomy; secondary outcomes were overall mortality and Society of Thoracic Surgeons (STS)-defined comorbidities. Results: A total of 163 patients were analyzed (TTCC: n = 99, 60%; EABO: n = 64, 40%). While both techniques demonstrated equivalent safety profiles (overall mortality: 0%), EABO was associated with higher conversion to full sternotomy [(n = 7, 10.9%) vs. TTCC (n = 1, 1.3%), p = 0.016]. In a generalized estimation equations (GEE) model, no patient-level covariate predicted conversion, suggesting technical or procedural factors as the primary contributors. In addition, EABO was associated with longer cross-clamp time [median: 87 min (IQR: 73, 100) vs. TTCC median: 77 min (IQR: 65.5, 87.5), p = 0.03]. Stroke, acute kidney injury, respiratory failure, reoperation and wound infection did not differ significantly; also, hospital stay was similar between groups. Conclusions: In this single-center series, EABO showed longer operative times and a higher conversion rate to sternotomy, but without excess mortality or major complications. This may be correlated with the initial learning phase and redo cases; further comparison is needed to assess the benefits of EABO."

This study evaluates its feasibility and mid-term outcomes in concomitant aortic and mitral valve surgery.                                                           METHODS                     We retrospectively analyzed all consecutive patients undergoing endoscopic concomitant mitral and aortic valve surgery from January 2016 to July 2025. Cardiopulmonary bypass was established via peripheral cannulation. All procedures were performed through a right mini-thoracotomy using a 30° thoracoscope. The primary end-point was in-hospital mortality. Secondary end-points included major postoperative complications, a composite early outcome (in-hospital mortality, stroke, major bleeding requiring revision, postoperative myocardial infarction, or dialysis), and mid-term survival. Univariable logistic regression was used to identify predictors of the composite early postoperative outcome. Follow-up was 100% complete.                                                           RESULTS                     The analysis included 111 patients (median age 70 years [IQR 62–76], 55 males, median EuroSCORE II 3.3 [IQR 1.90–5.04]). The aortic valve was replaced in all cases. Mitral valve was repaired in 54 cases and replaced in 57. Concomitant procedures were performed in 44 cases. Median CPB and cross-clamp times were 198 [164–233] and 139 [117–160] min respectively. In-hospital mortality was 3.6%, with low rates of stroke (3.6%), bleeding (8.1%), and dialysis (5.4%). At a median follow-up of 46 months, overall survival was 87%. Reduced eGFR, coronary artery disease, chronic lung disease and peripheral arteriopathy were significantly associated with the composite early outcome.                                                           CONCLUSIONS                     Endoscopic technique can be successfully applied to combined aortic and mitral valve surgery, encouraging its broader adoption."

With a focus on the prevalent psychological complications following the onset of this condition, this study aimed to explore the correlation between antenatal depression and Corona disease anxiety, personality traits, and postpartum depression during the COVID-19 pandemic.                                                           Materials and Methods:                     This cross-sectional descriptive-analytical study investigated women receiving care at health centers affiliated with Kerman University of Medical Sciences during the last month of their pregnancy and the postpartum period in 2022. Following the acquisition of informed consent, participants were assessed using various measures, including demographic and obstetric information, the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale, the Corona Disease Anxiety Scale (CDAS), and the NEO Personality Inventory-Revised during their third trimester of pregnancy. The same group of participants completed the Edinburgh Depression Scale and the Corona Disease Anxiety Scale (CDAS) 4-6 weeks after childbirth.                                                           Results and Discussion:                     There was a significant correlation between family income, unwanted pregnancy as perceived by both the mother and father, and antenatal depression. Additionally, marital satisfaction played a significant role in postpartum depression. Furthermore, antenatal depression was significantly associated with neuroticism, agreeableness, and physical symptoms related to Corona disease anxiety. Personality traits, with the exception of extroversion and conscientiousness, and various domains of Corona disease anxiety, excluding psychological symptoms, were also significantly associated with postpartum depression.                                                           Conclusion:                     During pandemics or epidemics, such as the COVID-19 outbreak, experiencing mental distress during pregnancy can contribute to mental health issues during the postpartum period. This risk is particularly true in individuals with unique personality traits, emphasizing the need for increased focus on mental health within prenatal care during these crises."

Method:                     This cross-sectional study was conducted in Kerman, Iran. Data were collected from patients who visited Afzalipour Hospital in Kerman more than twice during the COVID-19 epidemic from the end of February 2020 to March 21, 2021. We conducted two key analyses: 1. Mixed effect logistic regression was used to check the relationship between the variables and COVID-19 severity. 2. Mixed effect linear regression was used to check the relationship between the variables and the length of stay in the hospital.                                                           Results:                     The findings indicated that the most important risk factors for the severity of COVID-19 were heart diseases (OR=1.67,95%CI:1.20-2.30), increasing age (OR=2.23 for age&gt;54, 95%CI:1.70- 2.90), male gender (OR=1.47,95%CI:1.10-1.96), respiratory diseases other than asthma, and frequency of admission (OR=1.60,95%CI:1.20-2.15). All patients who underwent readmission experienced a shorter duration of hospitalization during their subsequent admission (OR=0.94,95%CI:0.91,0.96) and had a higher mortality rate (30% within 14 days, 26.6% between 14-90 days). Patients readmitted at intervals of 14-90 days and greater than 90 days exhibited lower disease severity compared to those readmitted within the 0-14 day period.                                                           Conclusion:                     Examining readmissions, the severity of COVID-19, and the length of hospital stay in affected patients are important factors for planning and allocating resources for COVID-19 management and treatment. These factors can help policymakers develop effective clinical guidelines for hospitalization or outpatient treatment of COVID-19 patients and contribute to reducing the burden of disease in the community."

Kinovea, as an accessible motion-analysis software, provides both visual and quantitative feedback. However, its application in supporting technique development among beginner athletes remains insufficiently explored. Aim: This study aims to describe the use of Kinovea in biomechanics training and examine its contribution to the awareness of kinematic characteristics and movement techniques among beginner athletes. Methods: A descriptive qualitative design involved 72 beginner athletes aged 18–25 years selected through purposive sampling. Data were collected over 16 weeks through interviews, field observations, and motion video recordings analyzed using Kinovea. Kinematic data focused on joint angles, stride behavior, and movement phases during walking, running, and the flight phase. Qualitative data were analyzed using content analysis with NVivo 12, while kinematic results were interpreted descriptively to identify performance patterns and areas for technical refinement. Result: Kinematic analysis showed coordinated joint-angle patterns across all phases. Walking analysis identified arm swing angles of 50.9°–58.8° and leg separation angles of 64.3°–67.2°, indicating a stable gait rhythm. The running analysis revealed knee angles of 68.8°–69.8° and elbow angles of 87.6°–89.1°, indicating efficient propulsive mechanics. The flight phase demonstrated knee angles of 81.2°–87.8° and elbow angles of 80.4°–88.3°, suggesting effective momentum use and postural stability. These measurements supported stride-efficiency assessment and technique evaluation. Qualitative findings revealed that Kinovea enabled athletes to interpret movement phases and identify technical inefficiencies through slow-motion and frame-by-frame visualization. Conclusion: Kinovea supports basic motion analysis by providing clear kinematic information and helping beginner athletes observe and refine their movement techniques. The findings also offer practical value for coaches by enabling more precise identification of inefficient patterns and guiding targeted corrections during early-stage training."

OpenAlex,deep learning,Combating Data and Target Shifts in Visual Tasks,Zhaorui Tan,10.17638/03194353,2031-01-01,University of Liverpool,"The rapid advancement of deep learning models for visual tasks has led to significant progress in many domains. However, a key challenge remains: ensuring that models can generalize effectively to unseen samples or novel classes, especially in real-world scenarios where training data-target pairs are often limited or unavailable, and test data may exhibit shifts in both data and targets. This thesis addresses the problem of shifts across data and targets, proposing novel methods to improve model generalization and transferability in complex settings. The thesis identifies the different shift scenarios for visual tasks and presents their problem forms. The research first relaxes the static target distribution assumption in Multi-Domain Generalization (mDG) tasks, introducing the General Multi-Domain Generalization (GMDG) objective to improve generalization under varying data shifts. Specifically, Extensive experiments validate that GMDG is feasible for classification, segmentation, and regression tasks. Further considering extreme target distribution shifts where even unknown novel classes emerge, the study also explores logical regularization techniques for tasks such as Generalized Category Discovery (GCD), mDG+GCD, and Class Incremental Learning (CIL), proposing a sample-based logical regularization term (L-Reg) to enhance data-, target-, and all-shift generalization. Additionally, a partial logic framework is introduced to address challenges in CIL, enabling models to retain room for unknown classes during training. This is further extended by the Partial-Logic Regularization (PL-Reg), which improves generalization across GCD, mDG+GCD, and transferability for CIL tasks. Furthermore, the thesis proposes a novel Semantic-aware Data Augmentation (SADA) framework for cross-modality generalization in text-to-image synthesis (T2Isyn), text-image retrieval (TIR), and image-text retrieval (ITR) tasks. This framework ensures semantic preservation across text and image modalities, improving both semantic consistency and image quality in cross-modality tasks. The methods proposed in this thesis offer significant advancements in visual generalization and transfer scenarios, providing theoretical insights and practical solutions for handling data shifts, target shifts, and multi-modalities in complex scenarios. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of the proposed methods, demonstrating their superior performance across a range of tasks."
OpenAlex,deep learning,Antecedents and consequences of Green-tech FDI in emerging markets,Zhuoran Liu,10.17638/03195308,2031-01-01,University of Liverpool,"As environmental pressures intensify, attracting sustainable foreign direct investment (FDI), particularly green-tech FDI, has become a critical pathway for emerging markets to achieve environmental sustainability. However, existing research remains fragmented, offering limited insights into why green-tech FDI enters emerging markets and how it affects regional green innovation. This thesis addresses these gaps by systematically examining both the antecedents and consequences of green-tech FDI through three empirical studies using regional data from China. Study 1 and Study 2 focus on the antecedents of green-tech FDI. Study 1 examines how host-country conditions can attract green-tech FDI, highlighting the role of environmental management information disclosure (EMID) by domestic firms in reducing information gaps and strengthening green market–seeking motives. Study 2 shifts attention to the active decision-making of green-tech FDI, showing that under uncertainty, green-tech foreign investors engage in identity-based bandwagon learning by imitating peers with similar green identities, thereby mitigating investment risks. Study 3 turns to the consequences of green-tech FDI. It demonstrates that, due to the technological complexity of green innovation and limited absorptive capacity in emerging markets, green-tech FDI may generate crowding-out effects rather than purely positive spillovers. Adopting a network perspective, the study further finds that universities play a key moderating role: through broad linkages and deep collaborations, they help mitigate negative spillovers and facilitate the diffusion of green technologies. Together, the three studies advance the literature on sustainable FDI by differentiating green-tech FDI from general FDI and identifying the specific mechanisms that shape its entry decisions and local innovation outcomes. Practically, the findings provide guidance for emerging-market governments and firms on how to attract and manage sustainable investment, balance growth with environmental objectives, and strengthen local innovation ecosystems."
OpenAlex,deep learning,A UAV-Based Framework for Community-Scale Residential Building Energy Modelling in China,Mengfan Jin,10.17638/03195460,2029-01-01,University of Liverpool,"With increasing emphasis on energy efficiency and carbon emission reduction in the building sector, rapid and scalable energy modelling of existing buildings is critical for retrofit projects and policy development. Conventional surveys, data collection and energy modelling processes remain labour-intensive and impractical for large-scale applications, and energy modelling often dominates project time and cost. Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) equipped with high-resolution and infrared cameras now offer fast and safe exterior surveys, showing great potential in building energy assessments. Yet, a systematic framework for UAV integration, from image capture through processing to inputs for building energy simulation, has not been established. This research addresses these challenges by developing a structured framework for community-scale building energy modelling, which integrates UAV photogrammetry to accelerate data acquisition, reduce labour, and shorten energy modelling time for retrofit projects. The framework is designed to minimise prior data requirements while maximising automation and retaining sufficient accuracy and reliability. It also addressed systemic issues, such as the lack of data necessary to fully exploit the potential of available technologies in the context of this study. To achieve this research objective, a mixed-methodology approach, combining desk studies and fieldwork, was adopted. First, a comprehensive review of UAV-based building energy studies mapped the current applications and available tools, proposing a preliminary framework. Fieldwork then encompassed a pilot study and a detailed case study. In the pilot test, a single building was surveyed to identify an optimal toolchain for flight planning, image capture, photogrammetric reconstruction, model generation, and selection of a simulation platform. The resulting refined framework was applied to a case study of a 39-building community, and it was demonstrated that further automation was necessary. The potential for automation was then further explored. Geomatic algorithms, machine learning, and deep learning techniques were compared, and the combination that best balanced accuracy and processing time was selected for 3D model generation and window-to-wall ratio (WWR) extraction. In parallel, an archetype library of residential buildings in the Hot Summer Cold Winter (HSCW) zone in China was compiled to facilitate the assignment of thermal parameters. Finally, a reusable community-scale building energy modelling (CBEM) workflow was assembled in Grasshopper using Ladybug Tools components to process the aforementioned inputs. In conclusion, this study integrates UAV photogrammetry, GIS-based geomatic algorithms, machine learning, and graphical programming to develop an UAV-CBEM framework. The outcomes establish a foundation for scalable UAV-based building energy assessments, enhancing applicability in data-limited and large-scale settings worldwide."

OpenAlex,deep learning,Unsupervised Deep-learning Methods for Low-dose Computed Tomography Reconstruction,Ran An,10.17638/03194237,2027-01-01,University of Liverpool,"Computed tomography (CT) has become an indispensable imaging technique in medical diagnostics and industrial applications, owing to its non-invasive nature and high resolution in visualizing object internal structures. While X-ray CT (X-ray computed tomography) significantly enhances lesion detection capabilities, excessive exposure to X-ray radiation raises substantial health concerns, including elevated cancer risks and potential genetic damage. Although low-dose CT (LDCT) protocols reduce radiation safety concerns, they inevitably introduce severe noise and artifacts, which might compromise diagnostic accuracy. Recent advances in supervised deep learning approaches have demonstrated remarkable success in LDCT reconstruction. However, the reliance on paired training data severely limits their deployment in practical CT applications. This fundamental constraint highlights the critical importance of developing unsupervised reconstruction methods. Although existing unsupervised LDCT methods have made notable progress, they still face challenges requiring systematic solutions. This thesis makes three contributions to advance the field of unsupervised LDCT reconstruction: 1. Current dual-domain self-supervised LDCT denoising methods typically neglect the heterogeneity of the non-stationary Gaussian noise levels in low-dose sinograms and usually treat them as common images without appropriately controlling the denoising strength. The denoisers employed by them, which are based on classic convolutional neural networks (CNN), will lead to blurring artifacts in the reconstructed images if directly used for sinogram denoising. In addition, the denoising strength in the sinogram and image domains must be well-balanced to avoid introducing over-blurring or secondary artifacts in the reconstructed images, but existing approaches do not focus on this crucial point. To address these limitations, this thesis proposes a novel end-to-end dual-domain self-supervised framework for LDCT denoising. It employs Dropblock layers to adaptively localize the effect of convolution for sinogram denoising and sets a weighted average between the denoised sinograms and their noisy counterparts to better control the denoising strength, thus effectively reducing the blurring artifacts and leading to a well-balanced dual-domain denoising. Numerical experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and superior performance of the proposed method. 2. Existing normalizing flows (NFs)-based unsupervised LDCT reconstruction methods face challenges in both image quality and computational efficiency. On one hand, they typically utilize a two-way transformation strategy between noisy images and latent variables, which could easily lead to detail loss and secondary artifacts in the reconstructed images. On the other hand, training NFs on high-resolution CT images is computationally intensive. Although conditional normalizing flows (CNFs) can mitigate computational costs by learning conditional probabilities, existing approaches rely on labeled data for conditionalization, leaving unsupervised CNFs-based LDCT reconstruction a challenge. To tackle these issues, this thesis proposes a novel unsupervised LDCT iterative reconstruction algorithm based on CNFs. The proposed method employs a strict one-way transformation strategy during the alternating optimization in the dual spaces to prevent detail loss and secondary artifacts, and proposes a novel unsupervised conditionalization strategy for CNFs, thus achieving efficient training and inference on high-resolution images. The proposed method illustrates high-quality and relatively fast unsupervised reconstruction. Experiments across two datasets demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed method by rivaling several state-of-the-art methods. 3. Current diffusion model-based LDCT reconstruction methods solely employ the prior distributions learned from normal-dose CT data but neglect the valuable priors in low-dose data, which contain information about the characteristics of low-dose noise and artifacts. In addition, their reconstruction speed suffers from multiple sampling steps, presenting low efficiency. Breaking new ground in prior utilization, this thesis proposes a novel unsupervised LDCT iterative reconstruction algorithm based on dual denoising diffusion probabilistic models (DDPM), which leverages both normal-dose and low-dose priors. Specifically, the proposed method employs two DDPMs to learn the prior distributions from normal-dose and low-dose images, respectively, and incorporates them into a joint iterative reconstruction framework. To accelerate the reconstruction, partial diffusion sampling and single-pass deterministic reconstruction strategy are utilized in the proposed method, as well as the spaced OS-SART approaches. Experiments at different dose levels demonstrate the outstanding performance and fast speed of the proposed reconstruction algorithm.

OpenAlex,deep learning,From Sparse to Dense: Label-Efficient Weakly Supervised Segmentation for Images and Videos,Jian Wang,10.17638/03195330,2027-01-01,University of Liverpool,"Obtaining high-quality annotated data has become a primary bottleneck for training deep learning models, particularly for dense prediction tasks like semantic segmentation and video salient object segmentation. The demand for meticulous, pixel-level labeling makes fully-supervised approaches prohibitively expensive and limits their scalability. This thesis directly confronts this issue by proposing and systematically investigating a label-efficient ""sparse-to-dense'' paradigm. The core objective is to develop innovative frameworks that can learn from sparse, inexpensive weak supervision—such as image-level tags or scribbles—and intelligently propagate this minimal information to generate complete, pixel-accurate dense predictions. The major part of this thesis focuses on the ""sparse-to-dense'' challenge within Weakly Supervised Semantic Segmentation (WSSS) for images, where models learn from only image-level tags. Dominant approaches rely on Class Activation Maps (CAMs) as initial object seeds. However, CAMs inherently activate only the most discriminative object regions, leading to incomplete pseudo-labels. This gives rise to the central problem of activation densification: the critical process of expanding these sparse activations to cover the full extent of an object. Our research addresses this challenge through a progressive, multi-faceted strategy. Our exploration begins with a foundational framework (C3) designed to rectify the intrinsic flaws of initial CAMs. We propose a synergistic mutual calibration method. This method leverages the discrepancies between the two maps to generate local prototypes, which are simultaneously utilized to complete missing object parts and suppress background noise, yielding a significantly more accurate and complete initial seed. This foundational work immediately reveals the limitation of single-prototype instability and its inability to capture diverse features. Building on this foundation, we then develop architecture-specific strategies to address deeper limitations of the prototype-based approach. For Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) (C4), the use of a single prototype proves insufficient to capture significant intra-class variation. In response, we introduce an Optimal Transport (OT)-assisted framework that effectively mines multiple, diverse prototypes, thereby yielding more comprehensive activation maps. However, while C4 solves the intra-class diversity problem, the inherent local context constraint of the CNN architecture becomes the new bottleneck, fundamentally limiting the quality of globally-aware feature extraction needed for optimal multi-prototype assignment. This limitation necessitates a shift in architectural focus from CNNs to Vision Transformers. In the ViT architecture (C5), a new challenge arises where the token gap between the discriminative class token and varied patch tokens leads to incomplete activation. To bridge this gap, we leverage a tailored application of Optimal Transport, where the algorithm is tasked with learning a comprehensive proxy to ensure complete object activation. Despite these architectural advances (C3-C5), the overall WSSS performance hit a ceiling. This is fundamentally limited by the sparse supervision of class labels, which cannot provide precise boundary information. To break this ceiling, our WSSS exploration culminates in a universal enhancement strategy (C6) that transcends architecture-specific designs by leveraging Visual Foundation Models (VFMs). We resolve the conflict between the discriminative nature of initial CAMs and the VFM's need for holistic prompts. By modeling the CAM foreground as a graph and employing spectral analysis, our method intelligently selects a diverse set of prompt points that represent the overall structure of the foreground object. This guides the VFM to generate superior, boundary-aware supervision that can universally enhance any WSSS pipeline. Subsequently, the thesis extends the ""sparse-to-dense'' paradigm to the dynamic domain of video, addressing Weakly Supervised Video Salient Object Segmentation (WSVSOS) (C7) from sparse scribble annotations. In this specific context, the challenge evolves into spatio-temporal densification, which requires both full-object coverage within each frame and temporal consistency across the video sequences. To this end, we introduce the core CFMR framework, which utilizes Spatio-Temporal co-regulation. This framework is subsequently enhanced (CFMR+) by integrating the VFM guidance strategy from C6, which provides high-quality spatial priors essential for ensuring both high spatial detail and inter-frame consistency. By enforcing both intra-frame and cross-frame consistency between these two streams, our method effectively propagates the sparse initial signal to generate dense and temporally coherent saliency masks. In conclusion, this thesis presents a comprehensive and cohesive investigation into label-efficient segmentation tasks, offering a suite of innovative and effective strategies for the ""sparse-to-dense'' challenge. Our work establishes a progressive roadmap that systematically overcomes architectural and semantic limitations, culminating in highly robust and generalized densification pipelines. Our extensive experimental results on standard benchmarks validate the state-of-the-art performance of these methods, providing robust solutions to a long-standing problem in the computer vision field."

OpenAlex,deep learning,Diseño y construcción de un sistema predictivo de congestión de tráfico basado en aprendizaje automático,Zehan Li,,2026-07-17,UPM Digital Archive (Technical University of Madrid),"Resumen: Este proyecto desarrolla un sistema de predicción de la intensidad del tráfico urbano mediante técnicas de aprendizaje profundo, con el objetivo de mejorar la toma de decisiones de movilidad. A diferencia de otras plataformas centradas en la visualización del estado actual, la solución propuesta busca anticipar comportamientos futuros, y se plantea como una alternativa abierta, replicable y específicamente orientada a la predicción. Para lograrlo, se ha diseñado una arquitectura modular basada en el lenguaje Python, capaz de integrar múltiples fuentes de datos abiertos: registros históricos del tráfico, datos históricos de situación meteorológica, y coordenadas espaciales de los sensores de medición. El sistema aplica un proceso de limpieza, interpolación temporal y transformación de variables, incluyendo la codificación cíclica del tiempo y la conversión espacial a coordenadas UTM, lo que permite una fusión precisa entre datos geográficos y meteorológicos mediante técnicas como la ponderación por distancia inversa (IDW). El modelo predictivo se basa en una red neuronal LSTM, especialmente adaptada para secuencias temporales multivariables. Se entrena utilizando una estrategia de ventana deslizante a 32 muestras (7 horas y 45 minutos) para predecir la intensidad de tráfico en el siguiente intervalo. El sistema incorpora además mecanismo de IterableDataset para manejar grandes volúmenes de datos de entrenamiento sin comprometer la estabilidad del entorno. Los resultados obtenidos muestran una precisión robusta en escenarios de validación, con errores de predicción (MAE y RMSE) aceptable. Además, se ha desarrollado una interfaz web interactiva, que permite el despliegue local del sistema, con capacidad de ingestión de datos en tiempo real y visualización directa de las predicciones. Ente trabajo demuestra la viabilidad técnica y operativa de aplicar aprendizaje profundo al análisis de tráfico urbano, y sienta las bases para su evolución futura hacia sistemas más generalizables, robustos y útiles en contexto reales de ciudad inteligente. Abstract This Project develops an urban traffic intensity prediction system using deep learning techniques, with the aim of improving mobility decision-making. Unlike other platforms focused on visualizing the current state, the proposed solution seeks to anticipate future behaviors, and is positioned as an open, replicable alternative specifically oriented towards prediction. To achieve this, a modular architecture based on the Python language has been designed, capable of integrating multiple open data sources: historical traffic records, historical weather situation data, and spatial coordinates of measurement sensors. The system applies a process of cleaning, temporal interpolation, and variable transformation, including cyclic encoding of time and spatial conversion to UTM coordinates, allowing for precise fusion between geographical and meteorological data through techniques such as inverse distance weighting (IDW). The predictive model is based on an LSTM neural network, especially adapted for multivariate time sequences. It is trained using a sliding window strategy of 32 samples (7 hours and 45 minutes) to predict traffic intensity in the next interval. The system additionally incorporates an IterableDataset mechanism to handle large volumes of training data without compromising the stability of the environment. The obtained results show robust accuracy in validation scenarios, with acceptable prediction errors (MAE and RMSE). Furthermore, an interactive web interface has been developed, allowing for the local deployment of the system, with the capacity for real-time data ingestion and direct visualization of predictions. This work demonstrates the technical and operational feasibility of applying deep learning to urban traffic analysis and lays the groundwork for its future evolution towards more generalizable, robust, and useful systems in real smart city contexts."
OpenAlex,deep learning,A Novel Deep-Learning-Based Approach for Estimating High-Resolution InSAR Parameters,"Dell Amore, Luca; Carcereri, Daniel; Demir, Begüm; Rizzoli, Paola",,2026-06-01,elib (German Aerospace Center),"Nowadays, SAR Interferometry (InSAR) represents one of the most powerful tools to perform complex tasks, such as retrieving Earth’s surface topography and monitoring its deformations. However, denoising strategies are crucial for the generation of reliable and high-quality InSAR products. In this framework, we propose a complete and generalized theoretical and statistical model to physically describe and simulate a noise-free interferogram, together with its corresponding noisy version, starting from the knowledge of the InSAR acquisition geometry and of the underlying topography. A deep-learning-based model is then trained in a fully-supervised manner to estimate high-resolution InSAR parameters, i.e. coherence and interferometric phase, leveraging the proposed statistical model. In particular, an accurate assessment of the network’s estimation performance is conducted by comparing it to state-of-the-art denoising filters, such as Boxcar and Phi-Net and showing the added value of the proposed theoretical modifications to the state-of-the-art literature."

OpenAlex,deep learning,Assessing knowledge in policing,Tom Cockcroft; Jennifer Norman; Clare Rawdin,,2026-05-05,CLOK (University of Central Lancashire),"Assessment is one important component of effective learning design. The process of assessment can be explained as starting with an understanding of what a learner needs to know or be able to do by the end of the learning experience, what they have to do to achieve this and what method is best applied to ascertain if the learner has reached the required level (Cockcroft, 2023). Without assessment, educators and trainers would have limited awareness of the extent to which (if at all) they are cultivating learners’ knowledge, attitudes and skills, both as the learning proceeds (formative assessment) and at the end of learning (summative assessment). Traditionally, much police learning and associated assessment has been in-house / work-based. It has been delivered within local Learning and Development units, typically by former police officers (Stanko & Hohl, 2018) with portfolios predominantly used as the mode of assessment for practitioners. The embedding of a professionalisation agenda over the last decade, however, has led to a renewed focus on assessment for officers who have joined through the graduate entry routes (formally known as the Policing Education Qualifications Framework, PEQF; see Wood, 2018), and continue to join through the Police Constable Entry Pathways (PCEP). Framed by recent trends within police learning and specifically developments in the field of rape investigation, the aim of this chapter is twofold. Firstly, there is a focus on what the Soteria ‘deep dives’ revealed about the process of assessment. In this chapter the focus is focused on the the role of assessment within the portfolio-based Serious Sexual Assault Investigator’s Development Programme (SSAIDP). Secondly, an examination of what ‘best practice assessment’ might look like in the Rape and Serious Sexual Offending (RASSO) context"
