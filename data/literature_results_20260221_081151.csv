Lipoprotein(a) has anti-fibrinolytic properties; therefore, aspirin may reduce cardiovascular disease risk among individuals with high Lp(a). This analysis sought to determine the association of aspirin with incident AVC and AS across Lp(a) and LDL-C levels.
This observational study included up to 6598 participants in the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis. Aortic valve calcium was measured on non-contrast cardiac computed tomography. Multivariable Cox hazards regression assessed the association of self-reported regular aspirin use (≥3 days/week) with incident AVC and severe AS, stratified by Lp(a) and LDL-C. Aortic valve calcium and Lp(a) values were not reported to participants.
Mean age was 62 years, 53% were women, 23% reported regular aspirin use, 8% developed AVC (median 8.9 years), and 1% developed severe AS (median 16.7 years). Among individuals with elevated Lp(a), regular aspirin use was associated with a lower risk of incident AVC (Lp(a) ≥75 mg/dL: hazard ratio (HR) .42, 95% confidence interval (CI) .19-.93; Lp(a) ≥100 mg/dL: HR .17, 95% CI .04-.67) and severe AS (Lp(a) ≥50 mg/dL: HR .13, 95% CI: .04-.47; Lp(a) ≥75 mg/dL: HR .02, 95% CI .001-.29). For participants with elevated LDL-C, there was no association of regular aspirin use with incident AVC (LDL-C ≥130 mg/dL: HR 1.02, 95% CI .66-1.58; LDL-C ≥160 mg/dL: HR 1.51, 95% CI .53-4.28) or severe AS (LDL-C ≥100 mg/dL: HR .70, 95% CI .39-1.26; LDL-C ≥130 mg/dL: HR .46, 95% CI .14-1.47).
In this exploratory analysis of prospective observational cohort data, regular aspirin use was associated with a lower risk of AVC and severe AS in persons with high Lp(a), but not high LDL-C. Confirmatory studies are required to determine the role of aspirin in the prevention of AVC and AS for persons with high Lp(a)."

Those artifacts remain uncontrollable despite scanner-provided B0 shimming based on low-order spherical harmonic shapes. To mitigate those artifacts for higher image fidelity, the development of advanced B0 shimming techniques is demanding and typically requires knowledge of cardiac B0 conditions across patient populations. We recently proposed a new simulation approach to derive cardiac B0 distributions from readily available chest-abdomen-pelvis CT structural images based on first principles of classical electrodynamics. This approach is able to calculate the air-tissue interface-induced magnetic field variation across the body from diverse subjects using regular CT images. While the computational method has been step-by-step validated in previous work, a comprehensive demonstration in patients has been missing.
The aim of this study is to validate our proposed structural CT-derived cardiac B0 magnetic field computation approach using a side-by-side comparison between simulation and in vivo measurement obtained from the same cohort of clinical subjects.
Six subjects (female: 3, male: 3, age: 54.5 ± 17.2 years) with aortic stenosis or cancer who underwent clinically-indicated CT scans of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis were consented to undergo additional in vivo cardiac B0 measurement on a 3T MRI scanner. B0 distributions in the heart were computed based on CT images using our recently proposed approach and in vivo B0 maps acquired experimentally. CT images and MRI-based anatomical images were co-registered before field calculation, followed by the side-by-side field comparison after computation using correlation analysis of inhomogeneous field values, as well as the comparison of first-order spherical harmonic coefficients after decomposing field maps and the residual B0 inhomogeneities after shim from first to fifth order.
Simulated B0 maps show excellent agreement with in vivo measured B0 maps and strong average correlation (r = 0.92). After first and second-order shim analyses, both field maps show highly similar residual local B0 field patterns, especially near cardiophrenic angles and in the heart's inferior region, demonstrating the authenticity of localized features beyond overall field congruency. Both groups also demonstrate the trend of decreasing residual B0 inhomogeneity after shimming from first to fifth order, and their absolute differences in the mean of all subjects range from 0.25 to 2.3 Hz across different SH orders.
The consistency between simulation and in vivo measurements of B0 field conditions in the human heart from patients exhibiting various cardiac conditions fully validates the established B0 simulation approach. This approach can accurately compute the air-tissue interface-induced inhomogeneous magnetic field shapes and amplitudes from readily available structural CT images, setting the stage for the development of tailored and advanced cardiac B0 magnetic field correction methods and more robust cardiac MRI."
PubMed,aortic stenosis,Cost-effectiveness analysis of mavacamten for obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy: a perspective from the Chinese healthcare system.,Jialing Qian; Jiahao Zhang; Qingqing Jiang; Tingting Wu,10.1136/openhrt-2025-003914,2026-02-20,Open heart,"The clinical management of Obstructive Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy remains challenging, and the phase III EXPLORER-HCM trial has demonstrated that the novel cardiac myosin inhibitor Mavacamten can significantly improve patients' symptomatic and functional status.
This study aimed to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of the MBC regimen (Mavacamten plus a β-blocker or a calcium-channel blocker) versus the PBC regimen (placebo plus a β-blocker or a calcium-channel blocker) for treating Obstructive Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy from the perspective of the Chinese Healthcare System.
A Markov model was constructed using data from the EXPLORER-HCM clinical trial. Cost and utility inputs were sourced from public databases and published literature. Total costs, life-years (LY), quality-adjusted life years (QALY) and the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) were assessed. One-way deterministic sensitivity analysis and probabilistic sensitivity analysis were conducted to examine the robustness of the model.
Compared with the PBC regimen, Mavacamten treatment yielded an ICER of US$50 587.23/QALY. Its incremental cost was US$106 221.41, providing 2.1 additional QALY and 3.15 LY. Sensitivity analyses indicated that the drug price was the key driver influencing changes in the ICER value.
This study confirms that Mavacamten provides substantial health benefits to patients, but its relatively high ICER exceeds the commonly accepted willingness to pay."
PubMed,aortic stenosis,Scutellarin-eluting stents attenuate coronary restenosis by inhibiting the abnormal proliferation and migration of vascular smooth muscle cells through suppression of NF-κB signaling.,Li Zhang; Yuting Wang; Wei Min Gao; Wencong Gao; Ruoyan Ni; Jing Cai; Renhua Yang; Zhiqiang Shen; Bo He; Yu Zhuo; Peng Chen,10.1016/j.phymed.2026.157948,2026-02-11,Phytomedicine : international journal of phytotherapy and phytopharmacology,"Coronary restenosis remains a major challenge following percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), necessitating the development of effective stent-eluting drugs. Previous studies indicate that scutellarin protects vascular endothelial cells and exhibits anti-thrombotic and anti-platelet effects. Notably, our prior research demonstrated that scutellarin specifically counteracts oxidative stress-driven endothelial dysfunction, a key initiating event in restenosis. This combined evidence strongly suggests its potential against in-stent restenosis (ISR). Therefore, this study explores the efficacy of scutellarin in preventing ISR after PCI.
We investigated scutellarin, derived from Erigeron breviscapus, for its potential to prevent ISR following PCI.
The efficacy and mechanism of scutellarin were evaluated using both in vivo and in vitro models.
An experimental atherosclerosis model was established in APOE-/- mice. A coronary stenosis stent model was subsequently developed in minipigs through high-fat diet and balloon induced injury. Scutellarin-eluting stents with varying doses were implanted at stenosis sites. At 28 days post-PCI, multimodal imaging (QCA, OCT, IVUS) was performed to assess anti-restenosis efficacy. Additionally, in vitro H2O2-induced vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) were used to monitor proliferation and migration. Protein levels were measured to elucidate molecular mechanisms.
In APOE-/- mice, scutellarin significantly reduced lipid deposition in aortic plaques and suppressed inflammatory responses. In the porcine model, it markedly decreased neointimal thickness, neointimal area, and restenosis rates, while inhibiting inflammation. Collectively, these two in vivo models demonstrate that scutellarin-eluting stents effectively inhibit ISR. In vitro, scutellarin suppressed VSMCs proliferation and migration and mediated a shift from necrosis to autophagy-coordinated apoptosis. Mechanistically, scutellarin-mediated suppression of the synthetic phenotype switch in VSMCs was accompanied by the coordinated downregulation of both the Pl3K/AKT and IKKs/NF-κB cascades.
This study establishes the efficacy of scutellarin in mitigating ISR using two complementary in vivo models. Scutellarin-eluting stents in atherosclerotic minipigs overcome translational barriers through full interventional simulation. Furthermore, scutellarin inhibits VSMCs proliferation, migration and promotes autophagy-coordinated apoptosis by the coordinated downregulation of both the Pl3K/AKT and lKKs/NF-κB cascades.These findings highlight scutellarin as a promising candidate for next-generation bioactive stent coatings, bridging phytopharmacology and precision interventional cardiology."

Artificial intelligence-enabled electrocardiography (AI-ECG) algorithms accurately estimate cardiovascular disease risk. We investigated the association between inadequate preventive dental care and the AI-ECG-estimated risk of atrial fibrillation, aortic stenosis, low ejection fraction, cardiac amyloid, cardiovascular aging, and all-cause mortality.
We retrospectively analyzed 266 637 Mayo Clinic patients (2018-2024) who completed a Social Determinants of Health Survey and had an ECG performed within 1 year of survey completion. AI-ECG algorithms generated continuous risk scores (0 or 1) for atrial fibrillation, aortic stenosis, low ejection fraction, and amyloid. Cardiac aging was assessed by delta age, calculated as AI-ECG-estimated physiological age minus the chronological age. Associations with preventive dental care were analyzed using logistic regression. Cox regression evaluated dental care predictiveness on all-cause mortality.
Among 266 637 individuals (mean age, 59.5±16.4 years; 51.1% women), 49 918 (18.7%) reported inadequate preventive dental care. These individuals had higher delta age and increased AI-ECG-predicted risks of atrial fibrillation, aortic stenosis, amyloid, and reduced ejection fraction (all P<0.001). In multivariable logistic regression models including all AI-ECG scores, inadequate preventive dental care was associated with higher probabilities of low ejection fraction (odds ratio [OR], 1.80 [95% CI, 1.69-1.91]), atrial fibrillation (OR, 1.10 [95% CI, 1.04-1.17]), aortic stenosis (OR, 1.90 [95% CI, 1.64-2.20]), amyloid (OR, 1.18 [95% CI, 1.12-1.25]), and higher delta age (OR, 1.03 [95% CI, 1.02-1.03]) (all P<0.001). Inadequate preventive dental care predicted all-cause mortality after adjusting for demographics, risk factors, and AI-ECG algorithms (HR, 1.45 [95% CI, 1.38-1.53], P<0.001).
Inadequate preventive dental care is associated with subclinical cardiovascular disease. AI-ECG algorithms may facilitate cardiovascular risk stratification among individuals with limited preventive dental care access."

This study aimed to investigate the association between RV damage detected by RV free wall longitudinal strain (RVFWLS) and outcomes in patients with severe aortic stenosis who underwent transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI).
A total of 768 patients with severe aortic stenosis who underwent TAVI and echocardiographic images for RV functional assessment were included from a retrospective multicenter TAVI registry. The primary outcome was a composite of all-cause death and hospitalization due to cardiovascular events.
During a median follow-up of 21 (12-30) months, 213 patients (28%) experienced the primary end points. In the multivariable Cox proportional hazards model, a higher absolute RVFWLS value was independently associated with better outcomes (adjusted hazard ratio [HR], 0.88 [95% CI, 0.84-0.91]). RVFWLS demonstrated incremental values superior to those of conventional RV parameters. Adding RVFWLS <17% as an RV damage (Stage 4) criterion in staging classification identified 272 (35%) patients in Stage 4. Patients with RVFWLS-incorporated Stage 4 had lower event-free survival than did those in the other stages (adjusted HR, 1.55 [95% CI, 1.35-1.77]).
In patients with severe aortic stenosis who underwent TAVI, RVFWLS was independently associated with outcomes and provided superior prognostic value than other conventional RV echocardiographic parameters. Incorporating RVFWLS in a staging classification for RV damage showed incremental value for predicting survival after TAVI over the original staging classification."

Cardiovascular interventions,"The optimal management of coronary artery disease in patients undergoing transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) remains unclear, and evidence supporting routine percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) beforehand is limited. This study aimed to evaluate whether PCI before TAVR provides clinical benefit compared with conservative management in patients with significant coronary artery disease, using nationwide Swedish registry data.
This observational study included 2578 Swedish patients with significant coronary artery disease (≥50% angiographic stenosis or physiologically significant lesions) who underwent TAVR between 2008 and 2023. 1182 underwent PCI before TAVR, and 1396 were managed conservatively. The primary outcome was a composite of all-cause mortality, myocardial infarction, and urgent revascularization. Secondary outcomes included the individual components, cardiovascular mortality, any revascularization, stroke, and bleeding. The primary analysis used an instrumental variable approach based on each region's quarterly PCI treatment preference to account for confounding.
PCI was not associated with a significant difference in the primary composite outcome (instrumental variable-adjusted hazard ratio, 0.98 [95% CI, 0.85-1.14]; P=0.80) or in all-cause mortality, myocardial infarction, cardiovascular death, stroke, or urgent revascularization. PCI was, however, associated with a lower risk of any revascularization (adjusted hazard ratio, 0.46 [95% CI, 0.30-0.72]; adjusted P=0.002) and a higher risk of bleeding (instrumental variable-adjusted odds ratio, 1.59 [95% CI, 1.23-2.04]; adjusted P=0.002).
In this nationwide cohort, PCI before TAVR did not improve survival or reduce urgent revascularization but did reduce nonurgent revascularization at the cost of increased bleeding. Decisions should be individualized, balancing ischemic and bleeding risks and considering anticipated coronary access after TAVR."
PubMed,aortic stenosis,Left Atrial Strain Predicts Cardiac Outcomes in Moderate Aortic Stenosis.,Minjung Bak; Sang Yoon Lee; Sung-Ji Park; Heayoung Shin; Jihoon Kim; Eun Kyoung Kim; Sung-A Chang; Sang-Chol Lee; Seung Woo Park,10.1161/CIRCIMAGING.125.018451,2026-02-20,Circulation. Cardiovascular imaging,"Moderate aortic stenosis (AS) poses a substantial risk for adverse outcomes, yet its prognostic determinants and cardiac remodeling markers remain underexplored. This study aimed to evaluate prognostic factors, including left atrial strain, and their predictive value for adverse cardiac events in patients with moderate AS.
A retrospective cohort study included 1125 patients diagnosed with moderate AS between 2008 and 2019. Cardiac remodeling indices, including left atrial reservoir strain (LARS) and left ventricular global longitudinal strain, were assessed using speckle-tracking echocardiography. The primary outcome was cardiac death, while the secondary outcome was a composite of cardiac death or heart failure hospitalization.
Among the study population (median age, 74 years; 47.2% women), the Kaplan-Meier-estimated 5-year rates of cardiac mortality and the composite outcome were 16.7% and 33.9%, respectively, during a median follow-up of 42.8 months. Of the cardiac remodeling indices evaluated, LARS emerged as the most sensitive and independent predictor of cardiac death (adjusted hazard ratio, 0.948 per 1% increase; P=0.003) and the composite outcome (adjusted hazard ratio, 0.940 per 1% increase; P<0.001). Notably, the prognostic significance of reduced LARS persisted even after aortic valve replacement (hazard ratio, 2.177 for LARS <20.6% versus ≥20.6%; P=0.024). Furthermore, among all cardiac remodeling parameters analyzed, LARS showed the highest predictive performance for the composite outcome (C-index, 0.586 [95% CI, 0.541-0.632]) compared with other parameters.
LARS is a sensitive and independent prognostic marker in moderate AS, reflecting cardiac remodeling. Regular assessment of left atrial strain could enhance risk stratification and guide clinical management strategies in patients with moderate AS."
PubMed,aortic stenosis,Validation and longitudinal trajectory analysis of an AI-based ECG model for aortic stenosis: from community screening to pre-TAVR risk stratification.,Matthew W Segar; Kaleb D Lambeth; Alexander Postalian; Stephanie Coulter; Jasen Gilge; Naveed Razvi; Mohammad Saeed; Robert D Paisley; Ambarish Pandey; Mehdi Razavi,10.1093/ehjdh/ztag018,2026-03,European heart journal. Digital health,"Early aortic stenosis (AS) detection remains challenging, with many patients presenting late when left ventricular dysfunction may be irreversible. We evaluated whether longitudinal AI-enhanced ECG patterns can predict outcomes years before intervention and assessed the community screening potential of the AK-AVS model.
We conducted two complementary analyses: (1) community validation of the AK-AVS model in 3632 cardiovascular disease-free ARIC participants, and (2) longitudinal trajectory analysis of 7860 ECGs from 2040 TAVR recipients collected up to 10 years pre-procedure. Unsupervised clustering identified distinct AK-AVS trajectories, with mortality associations assessed using Cox regression and net reclassification improvement. In community screening (n = 16 moderate/severe AS), AK-AVS achieved an AUROC of 0.79, sensitivity 75%, and specificity 75% for moderate/severe AS. At hypothetical screening prevalences of 1-5%, positive predictive values improved to 3.1-14.3%. False-positive predictions identified individuals at 4-fold increased risk for future AS hospitalisation (HR 4.05, P < 0.001) and 52% increased risk for heart failure (HR 1.52, P = 0.02). In the TAVR cohort, trajectory analysis revealed three distinct patterns: Stable Low (19.3%), Accelerated Progression (23.6%), and Persistently High (57.1%). Elevated trajectory groups were older (78.4 and 77.8 vs. 72.6 years, P < 0.001) with higher pacemaker rates (16.4% and 17.3% vs. 10.7%, P = 0.008), despite similar hemodynamic severity. Both elevated patterns independently predicted mortality (Accelerated: HR 1.40, P = 0.03; Persistently High: HR 1.48, P = 0.005) and significantly improved risk reclassification beyond traditional risk scores (NRI 0.069-0.074).
Longitudinal AI-ECG trajectory patterns detect disease progression up to 4.5 years before TAVR and enhance mortality prediction beyond traditional risk scores. Community validation shows potential screening utility with 'false-positives' identifying future risk."

However, its neuroanatomical landscape remains poorly understood. In this study, we developed an optimized three-dimensional (3D) imaging approach that combined enhanced Clear, Unobstructed Brain Imaging Cocktails and Computational (CUBIC) tissue clearing and SWITCH-Off/On to visualize the neuronal architecture within calcified human aortic valves derived from patients undergoing aortic valve replacement surgery. Standard CUBIC analysis protocols have shown limited efficacy owing to poor clearing and antibody penetration in mineralized tissues. By integrating SWITCH chemistry before decalcification and refractive index matching, we achieved uniform delipidation, fluorescence preservation, and deep tissue labelling. Light-sheet fluorescence microscopy enabled high-resolution 3D reconstructions with an 80% success rate, revealing heterogeneous and spatially organized neuronal distributions across the aortic valve. This method offers a robust platform for studying valve innervation and its potential role in mechanosensing and disease progression, opening perspectives for neuro-targeted interventions in valvular heart disease."

Although cardiac rehabilitation (CR) is strongly recommended for patients with heart failure (HF) or post-cardiac surgery, cohort studies evaluating the long-term efficacy of CR in patients who have undergone TAVR are scarce. This study aimed to examine the association between outpatient CR and long-term clinical outcomes post-TAVR utilizing a nationwide administrative claims database in Japan.
Among 46,885 patients who underwent TAVR between April 2014 and March 2021, 34,165 patients who participated in inpatient CR and were discharged alive were included. Patients were categorized by outpatient CR participation. After propensity score matching, the primary outcome, a composite of all-cause mortality and HF hospitalization, was compared over a 3-year period.
Among the eligible patients, 29,552 (86.5%) were aged ≥ 80 years, and 22,805 (66.7%) were female. The participation rate in outpatient CR was 10.2%, with no observed increasing trend over the years. Advanced age, female sex, dementia, and multiple comorbidities were associated with non-participation in CR. The outpatient CR group exhibited reduced risk for the primary outcome (hazard ratio: 0.87, 95% confidence interval: 0.79-0.96) with a median follow-up of 734 days.
The participation rate in outpatient CR after TAVR remains low, with identifiable barriers in Japan. Participation was associated with improved outcomes, suggesting a beneficial management strategy for older patients post-TAVR."

The role of cardiopulmonary exercise testing (CPET) in predicting major adverse cardiac events (MACE) remains incompletely understood, particularly over long-term follow-up and independently of baseline symptoms.
We longitudinally studied 154 HCM patients (age 43 ± 16 years; 27% female), who underwent symptom-limited CPET. At baseline, 98 patients were in New York Heart Association (NYHA) Class I, 48 in Class II, and 8 in Class III. Septal reduction therapies (SRT), progression to end-stage HCM (ES-HCM), sudden cardiac death (SCD), heart failure-related death (HF), and heart transplantation (HT) represented a composite MACE endpoint.
Over a mean follow-up of 12 ± 9 years, 38 patients experienced MACE (SRT = 9; ES-HCM = 11; SCD = 10; HF/HT = 8). In multivariable analysis, independent predictors of MACE were percentage predicted peak VO2 (PVO2%) < 60 [hazard ratio (HR) 4.16, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.89-9.14; P < .001], and NYHA Class >I (HR 2.27, 95% CI 1.06-4.89; P = .036). By using SRT as a competing risk, the only predictor of MACE became PVO2% < 60 (HR 3.966, 95% CI 1.626-9.670; P = .002). Among asymptomatic patients (i.e. NYHA Class I), only PVO2% < 60 remained a significant predictor of MACE (HR 5.611, 95% CI 1.635-19.253; P = .006), with risk divergence evident after nearly 15 years of follow-up. The result was also confirmed in the competing risk analysis.
In this long follow-up study, CPET is a powerful prognostic tool in HCM. A reduced peak VO2 identifies those at higher risk, highlighting the potential for CPET to improve risk stratification, even among patients classified as NYHA Class I."

Risk stratification relies on the European Society of Cardiology (ESC) HCM Risk-SCD model, complemented by cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) assessment of myocardial fibrosis. Myosin inhibitors such as mavacamten improve obstruction and induce reverse remodelling, but their impact on arrhythmic risk score remains unknown. The objective was to analyse the impact of mavacamten on the evolution of the ESC rhythm score in patients with obstructive HCM.
Consecutive patients with symptomatic oHCM treated with mavacamten between October 2023 and June 2025 at four French referral centres for cardiomyopathies were retrospectively included. Clinical, echocardiographic, and CMR data were collected at baseline and after 6 months of therapy. Arrhythmic risk was calculated using the ESC HCM Risk-SCD model; patients with late gadolinium enhancement (LGE) ≥ 15% of left ventricular (LV) mass were reclassified into the high-risk category.
Among 186 eligible patients, 161 were included (mean age 62 ± 14 years, 55% male). At baseline, arrhythmic risk was classified as high in 6%, intermediate in 9%, and low in 85%. After 6 months of mavacamten, significant improvements were observed in New York Heart Association class (III: 35 to 2%, P < .001), resting LV outflow tract (LVOT) gradient (45 ± 31 to 12 ± 9 mmHg, P < .001), provoked gradient (80 ± 32 to 25 ± 19 mmHg, P < .001) and N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) levels. The median expected 5-year SCD risk decreased from 2.1% (1.7-3) to 1.4% (1.1-1.8) (P < .001). In high-risk patients, the score decreased from 7.7% (7.4-8.4) to 4.6% (4.5-6.0) (P = .001). European Society of Cardiology Risk-SCD reduction was entirely attributable to modifiable parameters: rest/Valsalva LVOT gradients (-33/-57 mmHg), left atrial diameter (-1.2 mm), and septal thickness (-1.5 mm, all P < .001). Mean HCM Risk Score reduction was 0.7% with heterogeneous inter-patient response, but homogeneous efficacy across centres (P = .206). Considering LGE, the proportion of patients with a high rhythmic risk fell from 16% to 15%. During a median follow-up of 19 months, no patient experienced SCD or required secondary prevention implantable cardioverter-defibrillator; two new non-sustained ventricular tachycardia episodes were recorded.
Mavacamten therapy was associated with marked haemodynamic and symptomatic improvements and a reduction in the ESC-based SCD risk in obstructive HCM. While these findings need to be confirmed and were not paralleled by a reduction in arrhythmic events, they suggest that myosin inhibition may influence arrhythmic risk stratification. Prospective studies with longer follow-up are required to determine whether such favourable remodelling translates into true arrhythmic protection."

This study aimed to clarify how metabolic remodelling relates to disease phenotypes in HCM. We used desorption electrospray ionization imaging mass spectrometry (DESI-IMS) to compare myocardial lipid signatures in patients who required septal reduction therapy (SRT) and those who did not.
In this prospective study, patients with HCM undergoing either right-ventricular biopsy or surgical septal myectomy were enrolled. Frozen 10 µm sections were analysed using DESI-IMS, and mass spectra were compared with volcano plots after signal-intensity normalization. Candidate ions showing |log2 fold change| ≥ 1 and P < .05 were annotated using the Human Metabolome Database.
Overall, 61 patients were analysed (34 [55.7%] were female; mean age 64.5 ± 15.9 years). Of these, 43 (70.5%) had obstructive HCM and 20 underwent SRT (SRT, n = 20; non-SRT, n = 41). The SRT group displayed a 3.3-fold higher signal for m/z 463.23, identified as testosterone glucuronide (P < .001). SRT remained the only predictor of elevated testosterone-glucuronide intensity in confirmatory regression (β = 1.991, P = .004), even after adjusting for age at diagnosis and the presence of hypertension, which significantly differed in baseline characteristics between the SRT and non-SRT groups.
DESI-IMS revealed selective accumulation of testosterone glucuronide in hypertrophied myocardium from patients needing SRT, suggesting that androgen-linked metabolic remodelling plays a role in advanced obstructive physiology in HCM."

This study aims to review the literature on the use of Cook Medical Custom-Made Devices (CMDs) incorporating an inner retrograde LSA branch and report a single-center experience with this approach.
A retrospective analysis was conducted on patients treated in a single high-volume aortic referral center between November 2023 and August 2025. Patients included underwent Zone 2 TEVAR using a CMD stent graft with a single retrograde inner LSA branch (Cook Medical, Bjaeverskov, Denmark). Literature on CMDs for LSA preservation was also reviewed to contextualize findings.
Sixty patients underwent LSA revascularization in Zone 2 TEVAR, including 28 carotid-subclavian bypasses, eight in-situ fenestrations, 16 off-the-shelf branched devices, and eight Cook Medical CMDs, of which seven single LSA inner branches and one was incorporated with a fenestration. All LSA branch CMD cases were elective, with a 100% technical success rate. Two early reinterventions were performed: one for a persistent Type Ia endoleak managed with proximal coil embolization, and another for a Type IIIc endoleak treated by relining the LSA stent graft. One postoperative death occurred due to cerebral embolization. There were no instances of branch occlusion, device migration, or target vessel stenosis during a short-term follow-up.
CMD LSA branch endografts represent a valid solution for complex Zone 2 aortic pathology, offering full endovascular repair with individualized anatomical adaptation over off-the-shelf solutions. Our outcomes demonstrate early feasibility with high technical success; however, further studies with larger cohorts and long-term follow-ups are warranted."

This review presents a comprehensive synthesis of its pharmacologic mechanisms, hemodynamic effects, clinical applications, and potential adverse outcomes in this complex setting. We delineate clinical scenarios in which vasopressin may be advantageous, critically appraise the current evidence, and support a physiology-guided, individualized approach to treatment. Patient profiles that may particularly benefit include advanced or mixed cardiogenic shock with low systemic vascular resistance, tachyarrhythmia-related shock, post-cardiac arrest shock, acute right ventricular failure, mitral stenosis, prosthetic mitral valve thrombosis, dynamic left ventricular outflow tract obstruction, Takotsubo syndrome, and severe aortic stenosis. In these settings, vasopressin's non-adrenergic mechanism of action may improve perfusion pressure while mitigating catecholamine-related adverse effects. We also outline clinical scenarios of cardiogenic shock in which vasopressin use may be detrimental and discuss its implications in patients receiving mechanical circulatory support. Finally, we highlight the need for prospective studies to optimize vasopressor selection in this high-risk and heterogeneous population."

Although generally well tolerated, TAVR can be associated with uncommon but potentially serious complications, including acute mitral regurgitation (MR) following valve deployment.
We present the case of a 94-year-old woman with symptomatic severe AS who developed acute, new-onset severe MR immediately after TAVR. Preprocedural imaging had shown no significant MR. The patient experienced acute hemodynamic compromise with pulmonary edema and hypotension, necessitating prompt medical intervention with vasopressors, diuretics, and noninvasive ventilation. Postoperative imaging excluded structural mitral valve (MV) damage and suggested impaired leaflet coaptation. The severity of MR improved markedly over the subsequent days, and at 1-year follow-up, only trace MR was observed. The likely mechanism was transient ischemic dysfunction of the posteromedial papillary muscle due to hypotension.
New-onset severe MR following TAVR is an uncommon yet clinically significant complication that necessitates prompt identification and intervention. In cases where intraprocedural hypotension occurs, transient papillary muscle dysfunction should be considered as a potential underlying mechanism, particularly when the MR is reversible and not associated with structural MV abnormalities or evidence of myocardial ischemia."

She was referred for mitral valve repair with the intention of valve preservation. Initial transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) suggested that the regurgitation was due to a ruptured chordae resulting in prolapse of the A2 segment. Intraoperative inspection following atriotomy revealed an aberrant chordae tendineae inserting anomalously into the left atrial wall, which was contributing to the A2 prolapse. The aberrant chordae was excised and replaced with polytetrafluoroethylene (Gore-Tex) neochords. A mitral annuloplasty ring was placed to complete the repair. Intraoperative transesophageal echocardiography confirmed excellent valve function with only minimal residual regurgitation. The patient had an uneventful recovery and was discharged on the fourth postoperative day. Aberrantly inserted chordae tendineae are an exceedingly rare finding and may lead to significant valvular dysfunction. Prompt surgical recognition and correction can result in successful valve preservation and excellent clinical outcomes."

While mild TR often stabilizes after mitral correction, management of moderate and severe TR in this context remains controversial due to limited evidence and applicability of guidelines largely derived from degenerative etiologies. This review synthesizes current data on diagnostic strategies, surgical decision-making, and outcomes in rheumatic TR.
A comprehensive literature search was performed across PubMed, Google Scholar, and OMNI databases (2010-2024) using the keywords ""rheumatic mitral disease,"" ""tricuspid regurgitation,"" and ""management."" Eligible studies included clinical trials, case series, reviews, and meta-analyses focusing on TR associated with rheumatic mitral disease. Data was extracted and critically appraised for study design, population, and outcome relevance.
Evidence for managing TR in rheumatic mitral disease primarily stems from retrospective cohorts and small prospective studies, with few randomized trials. Predictors of TR progression include annular dilation (>21 mm/m²), right ventricular dysfunction, pulmonary hypertension, and atrial fibrillation. Mild TR generally regresses following mitral surgery and is managed conservatively. For moderate TR, concomitant repair may prevent late progression and improve hemodynamics, though risks of postoperative arrhythmia and pacemaker implantation persist. Severe TR warrants surgical correction, preferably rigid ring annuloplasty, while valve replacement is reserved for advanced calcific disease. Emerging transcatheter therapies show promise for high-risk patients but lack robust rheumatic-specific data.
Optimal management of TR in rheumatic mitral disease requires individualized, Heart Team-based decision-making due to limited high-quality evidence. Future research should prioritize multicenter trials comparing repair, replacement, and transcatheter approaches, integrating advanced imaging for risk stratification and addressing access disparities in resource-limited settings."

Serial fetal echocardiography may provide dynamic information to support postnatal decision-making. Case Presentation: We report the case of a fetus diagnosed at 32 weeks' gestation with a borderline left ventricle, ventricular disproportion, hypoplastic left-sided structures, ductal-dependent systemic circulation, and a non-restrictive ostium secundum atrial septal defect. Serial fetal echocardiographic evaluations demonstrated stable left ventricular dimensions, preserved systolic function, impaired diastolic relaxation, and absence of endomyocardial fibroelastosis. Postnatal echocardiography confirmed hypoplastic aortic arch and coarctation. Following multidisciplinary evaluation, a biventricular repair strategy was selected. At 14 days of life, the patient underwent aortic arch reconstruction and partial atrial septal defect closure with preservation of a small therapeutic interatrial communication. Postoperative evolution was favorable, with progressive left ventricular growth and preserved function. At 2-year follow-up, echocardiography showed normalized mitral and aortic valve z-scores, good left ventricular systolic performance, and no evidence of myocardial fibrosis. Conclusions: This case highlights the value of serial fetal echocardiography in guiding individualized management of borderline left ventricle. Careful assessment of ventricular function and atrial septal physiology may support selection of a biventricular strategy in selected patients and contribute to favorable mid-term outcomes."

We aimed to evaluate the association of EAT with the presence of coronary artery disease (CAD) in patients with valvular heart disease.
A total of 72 patients scheduled for heart valve surgery were included in this prospective study. EAT was measured by transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) preoperatively. EAT thickness with positive coronary angiography (CAG) results were compared with the negative ones. The Mann-Whitney U test and Spearman Correlation was used to analyse in terms of non-normally distributed variables. The diagnostic decision-making characteristics of the presence of coronary lesions in the prediction of EAT were examined by ROC analysis.
Patients with concomitant hypertension (HT) disease had higher EAT thickness than without HT disease (4.11 mm vs 3.57 mm, p = 0.02). Median values were 4.10 (IQR 1.50) and 3.60 (IQR 0.80) respectively. Patient with CAD had significantly higher EAT thickness than without CAD (4.87 mm vs 3.50 mm; p < 0.001). Median values were 4.80 (IQR 0.80) and 3.50 (IQR 0.85), respectively. Smoking habit (Rho = 0.414, p = 0.013), ascending aortic diameter (Rho = 0.24, p = 0.043) and body/mass index (Rho = 0.360, p = 0.002) had positive correlation with EAT thickness. To define diagnostic value of EAT in predicting coronary lesion, UAC was calculated 0.929 in ROC analysis (p < 0.001). When the cut-off point was selected as 4.3 mm, EAT strongly predicts presence of any coronary lesion (sensitivity 78%, specificity 92%).
EAT thickness > 4.3 mm is a strong predictor of suspected CAD and may help determine the need for CAG in patients undergoing heart valve surgery."

This study evaluated the diagnostic accuracy of NT-proBNP for identifying reduced left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF < 50%) across different CKD stages.
This retrospective study included 840 patients with CKD Stages 3-5. Patients were categorized into reduced ejection fraction (REF, LVEF < 50%; n = 114) and preserved ejection fraction (PEF, LVEF ≥ 50%; n = 726) groups. Diagnostic performance was assessed using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis, and stage-specific optimal cut-off values were determined by Youden's J statistic. Multivariate logistic regression was used to identify independent predictors of reduced LVEF.
Median NT-proBNP levels were significantly higher in the REF group than in the PEF group (2,962 vs. 437 pg/mL, p < 0.001). In the overall cohort, NT-proBNP demonstrated good diagnostic performance (AUC: 0.805), with an optimal cut-off value of 1,562 pg/mL yielding 71.3% sensitivity and 77.8% specificity. Diagnostic accuracy differed according to renal function, being highest in Stage 3a (AUC: 0.872) and lowest in Stage 5 (AUC: 0.647). Optimal thresholds increased progressively with advancing CKD: 694 pg/mL (Stage 3a), 1,452 pg/mL (Stage 3b), 1,562 pg/mL (Stage 4), and 2,121 pg/mL (Stage 5). In multivariate analysis, log-transformed NT-proBNP remained an independent predictor of reduced LVEF (OR: 2.37, 95% CI: 1.96-2.86, p < 0.001), after adjustment for potential confounders including atrial fibrillation and valvular heart disease.
NT-proBNP is a useful marker for detecting systolic dysfunction in patients with CKD. However, a single diagnostic threshold is inadequate; stage-specific cut-off values improve diagnostic precision, particularly in early-to-moderate CKD, and may facilitate earlier referral for echocardiographic evaluation."

This study aimed to evaluate factors affecting the durability of bio-prosthetic pulmonary valves, with an emphasis on the angle of implantation as well as age, size or materials of prosthetic valve.
Of the 50 consecutive patients with TOF who underwent redo-PVR due to prosthetic valvular failure (PVF) between January 2001 and May 2020, 36 had good images for measuring implantation angle on computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging, or angiography. We defined the angle of implantation as the angle between an imaginary axial line from the center of the prosthetic valve and an imaginary parallel line from the point where the line meets the anterior wall of main pulmonary artery on sagittal planes.
The median age at total repair of TOF was 13.4 months (interquartile range [IQR], 8.4-22.3 months) and the median age at initial PVR was 10.1 years (IQR, 8.4-12.2 years). The mean interval from initial PVR to redo-PVR was 10.1±3.6 years and follow-up duration was 15.6±2.5 years after initial PVR. The implantation angle (<30° or ≥45°) was significantly related with early (<10 years after PVR) PVF.
The risk for early PVF was relatively lower when the implantation angle was between 30° and 45°. We should be careful to implant a prosthetic valve with an adequate angle to maintain a laminar flow in the pulmonary position for better durability."

Age and sex affect the clinical phenotypes and outcomes of this condition. This study aimed to identify age- and sex-specific factors influencing prognosis in elderly patients with HFmrEF/HFpEF to improve risk stratification and guide personalized treatment.
This observational, ambispective study was conducted at Papa Giovanni XXIII Hospital, Bergamo, from June 2017 to August 2022, enrolling patients >65 years with HFmrEF/HFpEF [New York Heart Association (NYHA) Class II-IV] according to ESC guidelines. Data collected included demographics, medical history, echocardiograms, and lab tests. Follow-up lasted at least 1 year, with outcomes defined as a composite of all-cause death, urgent heart transplant, HF hospitalization, and emergency department referral for decompensated HF. Findings were validated using the Swedish HF registry with a similar cohort.
Among 2263 HF patients, 971 HFmrEF/HFpEF patients (56.8% males, mean age 79.2 years) were analysed. Males had a higher prevalence of cardiovascular risk factors (e.g. diabetes, obesity, coronary artery disease). The composite outcome occurred more frequently in males (20.6 vs 17.14 per 100 patient years; IRR = 1.20, P = .035). Multivariable analysis identified male sex (HR 1.40, 95% CI 1.13-1.73), age >80 years (HR 1.91, 95% CI 1.22-3.00), higher NYHA class, chronic kidney disease, and severe valvular heart disease as independent predictors of worse outcomes. Males had a 40% higher risk of the outcome compared with women (HR 1.40, 95% CI 1.13-1.73), while patients >80 years old had nearly double the risk compared with those aged 65-70 (HR 1.91, 95% CI 1.22-3.00). The validation analysis in the SwedeHF, adapting the same multiple Cox regression model on 20 950 selected patients, median age 79 years and 57.8% men, and observed between January 2017 and August 2022, showed similar independent risk factors for the composite outcome.
This study highlights significant sex disparities in elderly HFmrEF/HFpEF patients, with higher age and male sex being an independent predictor for poor outcomes. These findings emphasize the need for personalized treatment strategies based on these demographic factors."

To assess the characteristics of patients with HFH in a real-world TTR-CA population, the occurrence of HFH, and the prognosis thereafter.
Data were collected from a multicentre TTR-CA registry and patients were dichotomized according to the occurrence of at least one HFH. Landmark analysis at the 1-year follow-up and Cox regression analysis with HFH as a time-dependent covariate were performed to assess the impact of HFH on all-cause mortality.
Overall, 654 patients were included [median age 78 (64, 83) years, 70.5% male, 70.6% wild type]. During a median follow-up of 24 (11-45) months, 141 (22%) patients experienced at least one HFH and 170 (26%) patients died. Patients with a HFH were older (82 vs 76 years, P < .001), had more wild-type TTR-CA [126 (89.4%) vs 336 (65.5%), P < .001], were more symptomatic [New York Heart Association Class II-IV 119 (86.9%) vs 279 (62%), P < .001], had higher National Amyloidosis Centre (NAC) disease stage, were less treated with disease-modifying therapy [45 (31.9%) vs 247 (47.4%), P = .001], had more co-morbidities and showed signs of more advanced disease by echocardiography. At the 1-year time point, patients with HFH had significant worse overall survival (log-rank χ² 37.673, P < .001). At the univariable (HR 7.71, 95%CI 5.50, 10.82; P < .001) and multivariable analyses, HFH was associated with all-cause mortality and showed incremental value on top of clinical variables, biomarkers [estimated glomerular filtration rate in Model 1 (χ² 97.3; P < .001) and NAC disease stage in Model 2 (χ² 78.8; P < .001)] and echocardiographic parameters (left ventricular mass index + stroke volume index + significant valvular lesion in Model 3 (χ² 60.3; P < .001) and including E/e' in Model 4 (χ² 43.4; P < .001)).
HFH is independently associated with all-cause mortality in patients with TTR-CA and has incremental value on top of established risk models."

Sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 (SGLT2) inhibitors improve outcomes and reverse left ventricle (LV) remodeling in HFrEF. The impact on RV function remains uncertain.
The Empire HF trial was an investigator-initiated, double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled trial of 190 participants with with a left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) of 40% or lower, with New York Heart Association (NYHA) Class I-III symptoms. Participants were randomized to receive either empagliflozin (at a dose of 10 mg once daily) or placebo, on top of recommended therapy for 12 weeks. The primary endpoint of this exploratory sub-study was changes in RV free wall strain (RVFWS) across the whole cohort. RVFWS was also stratified into tertiles based on baseline RVFWS. Secondary endpoints included changes in TAPSE and RV S' velocity.
Between June 2017 and September 2019, a total of 190 patients were enrolled, of whom 160 were included in this sub-study. Baseline characteristics were balanced between the groups (mean age of 64±11 years, 86% male, mean LVEF 29±8%, 79% in NYHA class II, 83 patients (52%) had an implanted cardiac device, and tricuspid valve regurgitation was absent/trace in 136 (85%) and mild in 24 (15%)). A high proportion of the population were on optimal medical treatment for HFrEF, and device therapy remained unchanged during follow-up.The overall mean RVFWS was -16.7±6.1%, with the empagliflozin group at -16.4±6.2% and the placebo group at -16.9±5.9%. No differences were observed in RVFWS between the groups. When stratified by baseline RVFWS into tertiles, patients in the lowest tertile demonstrated a significant improvement with empagliflozin (treatment effect: -2.9% [95% CI: -5.0 to -0.3]; P=0.027).This finding was independent of LVEF, plasma volume, and weight loss, and remained unchanged after additional adjustment for LV remodeling and the presence of resynchronization therapy.No significant treatment effect was observed in the middle or highest tertiles of RVFWS, nor in the overall or lowest tertiles of TAPSE or RV S'.
This exploratory substudy of the Empire HF, treatment with empagliflozin exerted no overall effect on RV function in stable HFrEF patients, but significantly improved RVFWS in patients in the lowest tertile of RVFWS after 12 weeks of treatment.

Contrast-enhanced T1-weighted MRI (T1C) is much more widely available, yet an accurate vessel segmentation method on this modality has not been established.
In this multicenter study, 1174 cases from four private institutions and one public dataset were used to train and evaluate an automatic segmentation model for intracranial arteries on T1C. Performance was assessed with Dice similarity coefficient (DSC), recall, and Hausdorff distance (HD) on both internal and external test sets. Prospective clinical validation was performed using paired time-of-flight magnetic resonance angiography (TOF-MRA) to compare our model with the gold standard and to investigate the reasons for discrepancies.
In internal test, the model achieved DSC = 0.886 ± 0.015, recall = 0.878 ± 0.033, and HD = 10.220 ± 3.821 mm. External test demonstrated robust generalization across four independent institutions, with DSC ranging from 0.859 to 0.884, recall ranging from 0.885 to 0.802, and HD ranging from 9.867 mm to 13.089 mm. Prospectively, clinical evaluation revealed the proposed model identified all target vessels and covered 88.5% of total vessel visible on TOF-MRA, provided a practical anatomic roadmap, but underestimated vessel diameter by 16.7% due to quality of inputs. Still, experts judged the majority of outputs clinically acceptable for presurgical planning.

Recently, a data-driven approach was introduced that uses deep reinforcement learning(DRL) and 3-D live images to study cell migration. This approach formulates the cell migration process as a sequential Markov decision process (MDP), so that hypotheses of the underlying mechanism of the observed migration can easily be incorporated as high-level regulatory rules and constraints for DRL. The application of the approach successfully uncovered a novel mechanism of cell migration in C. elegans embryogenesis that involves a modular organization of cells by using ubiquitous labels of cell nuclei and simple rules based on empirical statistics of the images. This success demonstrates new opportunities to use DRL to infer the biology of cell migration without prior knowledge. This paper presents an open framework, CellMigrationGym, to standardize the DRL approach to study cell migration. Built upon common packages (OpenAI Gym, PyBullet, and DRL libraries), CellMigrationGym provides powerful and flexible functions to investigate cell migration behavior. Through a case study, we demonstrate the critical functions of CellMigrationGym with technical details, such as 1) preparation and standardization of multiple observational data, 2) reward formulation and DRL model configuration appertaining to the hypotheses of migration mechanism (such as gradient-driven and collective cell behavior-driven mechanisms), 3) exploration of migration scenarios under hypothesized mechanisms, and 4) evaluation of neighboring cell's influence on the cell migration."

Our study aimed to reveal brain reorganization and explore potential peripheral biomarkers that reflect these processes.
51 insular glioma-related epilepsy (IRE) and 52 without epilepsy (IRnE) patients were included. Deep learning was used for tumor segmentation to generate masks for subsequent analyses. Virtual brain grafting was applied to eliminate the mass effect. Morphological analyses relied on MATLAB, SPM, and CAT12. Statistical analyses included χ2 test, t test, one-way ANOVA, regression, principal component, and correlation analysis.
Increased gyrification (GI) occurred on the contralateral side of IRnE. Increased gray matter volume and toroidal GI (Toro GI) appeared on the same and contralateral sides of IRE, respectively. Elevated Toro GI showed an initial predictive value for the control of postoperative epilepsy and was negatively associated with blood white cell, monocyte, and neutrophil counts in IRE. The opposite relationship was observed for GI in IRnE.
The brain would conduct different reorganization models to adapt to IRE and IRnE. These processes may be associated with specific peripheral inflammatory cells. Longitudinal studies and explorations of more specific biomarkers are necessary for elucidating the causal relationships and providing suggestions for therapeutic concepts of different insular glioma subtypes."

To improve lubrication effectiveness and restrain excessive tool degradation under severe thermo-mechanical cutting conditions, a minimum quantity lubrication (MQL) strategy aided with a carbon nanotube (CNT)-based nanofluid was adopted. Tool wear evolution was modelled using advanced machine learning approaches, including Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), Deep Neural Networks (DNN), and Support Vector Regression (SVR), with key machining parameters serving as the primary input variables. Experimental investigations demonstrated that CNT-based MQL substantially reduced tool wear, with an optimal nanoparticle concentration of 0.6%, attributed to improved heat dissipation and superior tribological behaviour at the machining zone. Among the implemented models, XGBoost exhibited the highest predictive accuracy, attaining an R² of 0.9924 along with minimal error indices, including MAE of 0.0017, RMSE of 0.002, and MAPE of 0.6%. In contrast, DNN and SVR showed comparatively poor predictive capability for the evaluated dataset split, reflected by low or negative R² values, highlighting the importance of model selection and data sensitivity in tool wear prediction tasks. Sensitivity analysis based on Spearman correlation revealed that cutting speed exerted the most dominant impact on tool wear (correlation coefficient = 0.94), followed by feed rate and depth of cut. Overall, the outcomes indicate that CNT-based nano-MQL combined with appropriately selected AI models-particularly XGBoost-provides a robust pathway for extending tool life, enhancing machinability, and enabling intelligent tool condition monitoring aligned with Industry 4.0 and sustainable manufacturing paradigms."

Securing networks using conventional cybersecurity models becomes increasingly challenging as the regularity of open-access networks increases, exposing critical attack regions. The research presented here recommends a hybrid model combining Blockchain (BC) and Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) built on Deep Learning (DL) (Hybrid BC + DL Model) to address such problems. This method integrates Artificial Intelligence (AI) and distributed trust management (DTM) for providing healthcare-specific security across the entire system. The hypothetical model focuses primarily on a Deep Sparse Autoencoder (DSAE) that helps standardize and reduce all the different traffic generated by medical IoT devices into a small, discrete graphical representation. These embedded technologies were securely encrypted by applying multiple layers of authentication. The primary layer is a standard Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (BiLSTM) network that captures temporal dependencies within healthcare data. The next layer is a set of high-powered sensor networks that can detect Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS), Man-in-The-Middle (MiTM), and Brute-Force Attacks (BFA). The simulation test result is subsequently validated using a Bayesian Product-of-Experts (BPoE) method that incorporates contextual medical challenges into the analysis, applies temperature scaling during testing, and improves clinical implementation accuracy. Networks that integrate BC technology have fixed audit logs, Smart Contracts (SC) that automate access control, and Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance (PBFT) consensus protocols, which permit the secure communication of attack data across the healthcare industry. The proposed model improves conventional benchmarks by 7.39-20.42% and SOTA (State-of-the-Art) by 1.00-7.19%, attaining accuracy scores of 96.73% and 93.58% on the IoT-Flock and the Canadian Institute for Cybersecurity Internet of Things 2023 (CICIoT2023) datasets. In both cases, the detection latency is less than 16 ms, demonstrating real-time feasibility in controlled experimental settings. When training and testing on distinct datasets, the average score ranges from 11.52 to 13.55%, indicating moderate generalization capability as measured by cross-dataset testing. DSAE-based Feature Extraction (FE) generated a 7.28% boost to accuracy, while the Bayesian Fusion Mechanism (BFM) resulted in around a 5.06% boost in accuracy. The outcome results of this study indicate that applying trained models to collected data resulted in a significant 9.39% improvement in accuracy. There was a 7.28% boost in accuracy when DSAE-based Feature Extraction (FE) was applied, 9.39% when algorithms that had been trained were used for collected data, and 5.06% when the Bayesian Fusion Mechanism (BFM) was implemented. The research findings have confirmed all these improvements. The analysis shows that the BC function has a Network Throughput (NT) of more than 698 Times Per Second (TPS), consensus delays of less than 468 ms, and validation success rates of more than 99.4%. Accuracy is maintained above 99.6%, and SC-based security measures are fully operational within 245 ms.

Existing object detection models have slow inference speed and low detection accuracy. This problem is more serious under shadows, oil stains, and occlusion from natural environments. Detection accuracy of existing models drops sharply in complex environments. This paper proposes a lightweight and high-accuracy crack detection framework based on YOLOv8s, named Crack-YOLO. It is designed to solve slow speed and low accuracy in road defect detection under complex conditions. The model replaces the original convolution modules in YOLOv8 with Context-Guided (CG) modules. It uses the designed C2f_DynamicConv to replace static convolution kernels. The original detection head is replaced with an Adaptive Spatial Feature Fusion (ASFF) head. Experiments and analysis are conducted on four datasets: CrackVariety, CrackTree200, Crack500, and CFD. Experimental results show that Crack-YOLO greatly outperforms YOLOv8s in both detection speed and detection accuracy. On the self-built CrackVariety dataset, the mAP@0.5 reaches 71.4%. The inference speed reaches 416 FPS. Compared with the baseline YOLOv8s model, accuracy increases by 31.0%. The speed increases by nearly two times. In addition, the model is successfully deployed on a Raspberry Pi 5 edge device. It is integrated with the ASTM D6433 standard. After detecting road defects, the Pavement Condition Index (PCI) is calculated automatically. This proves its practicality on devices with limited computing resources."

Traditional approaches to disease identification rely heavily on visual inspection and expert knowledge, which frequently lack the accuracy, speed, and scalability needed to address growing agricultural challenges. Early and precise disease detection enables proactive interventions that can prevent widespread crop damage and reduce excessive pesticide use, thereby supporting sustainable agricultural practices. Artificial intelligence, particularly deep learning methods, has emerged as a transformative solution for automated plant disease diagnosis. Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in image classification tasks, evolving from individual architectures to sophisticated ensembles and transferring learning models. However, existing CNN-based research on rice disease identification has typically focused on a limited number of disease classes, restricting their practical applicability in real-world agricultural settings. This study addresses these limitations by implementing DenseNet121, an advanced CNN architecture known for its efficient feature reuse and gradient flow, for comprehensive rice disease classification. We utilized a dataset comprising seven of the most common rice diseases, significantly expanding the scope beyond previous studies. The model employs transfer learning with pre-trained ImageNet weights and is optimized using the Adam optimizer with carefully tuned hyperparameters. The experimental evaluation on an independent test set demonstrates that our proposed model achieves an overall accuracy of 97.9%, with individual disease classification accuracy ranging from 94% to 99.67%. The model exhibits balanced performance across multiple metrics, including precision (96.2%), recall (97.97%), and F1-score (97%), confirming its robustness and generalizability.

Early detection is essential, as incipient lesions can be managed with noninvasive therapies. Conventional methods, such as visual-tactile inspection and radiography, remain limited by examiner variability and reduced sensitivity for early lesions. This study aimed to develop an efficient and interpretable deep learning framework for automated classification of enamel caries at multiple severity levels, while ensuring clinical applicability and transparency.A dataset of 2,000 clinical dental images categorized as advanced enamel caries, early-stage enamel caries, and no enamel caries was curated and expanded to 12,000 images using preprocessing and augmentation. Two transfer learning models, Modified EfficientNetB0 and Modified MobileNetV2, were trained individually, then combined using an attention-guided fusion mechanism. Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping (Grad-CAM) was applied to provide visual interpretability.Performance was evaluated using accuracy, precision, sensitivity, specificity, F1 score, and ROC AUC. Comparative analysis was performed across models and classifiers, with inference time assessed for clinical feasibility.The Modified EfficientNetB0 and MobileNetV2 models achieved accuracies of 96.33 and 96.25%, respectively. The fused model with Random Forest demonstrated superior performance, achieving 96.92% accuracy, F1 score of 96.92, and an ROC AUC of 99.34. Misclassifications were limited to adjacent disease stages, with no severe diagnostic errors.The proposed framework provides accurate, interpretable, and efficient enamel caries detection. Its low inference time supports real-time clinical use, enhancing diagnostic confidence and enabling early, minimally invasive interventions.

In the early stages, patients with DR may not exhibit any noticeable symptoms. It is a diabetic disorder that damages retinal blood vessels in the eyes. At first, there are no symptoms or sporadic visual issues. When it worsens, it affects both eyes and can lead to partial or total blindness. A person who already has DM is therefore constantly at a higher risk of developing the condition. Early identification can prevent the possibility of total and irreversible blindness. Therefore, needs an efficient and early diagnosis system. So, this paper proposes a new deep-learning methodology in a specific Deep Siamese DenseNet for early detection of DR. The proposed method is accomplished through various steps, such as Data Collection, Preprocessing, Augmentation, Segmentation, Feature Extraction, Feature Selection, and Detection. An adaptive histogram equalization approach named Contrast Limited Adaptive Histogram Equalization (CLAHE) is used to preprocess input images, which reduces amplification of noise. Then, the segmentation is done by the Optimized U-NETs. Next, features of the contrasted retinal images are extracted by residual attention EfficientNet (RA-EfficientNet). Then, the optimal features are selected by a hybrid Reptile Search Algorithm (RORS). Finally, the deep learning methodology includes DarkNet, DenseNet 201, and NasNetMobile used to detect diabetic retinopathy at an early stage. The model is implemented in MATLAB and evaluated using accuracy, precision, F-score, specificity, sensitivity, MCC, NPV, FPR, and FNR.

Reviews on cancer,"The advent of immunotherapy and targeted therapy has revolutionized oncology treatment in recent years, marking a transformative shift toward precision medicine. Artificial intelligence (AI) technology has played a pivotal role in tumor immunotherapy, targeted therapy, and related fields, by enhancing treatment efficacy prediction, identifying novel targets, and enabling personalized therapeutic strategies. In its early stages, AI development relied primarily on unimodal data processing architectures, which were limited to analyzing single data types and thus constrained in functionality. However, recent breakthroughs in data acquisition and integration have ushered in a new era of multimodal data fusion in oncology. Consequently, the integration of AI with multimodal data analytics now supports improved diagnostic accuracy, more precise prognosis prediction, and optimized individualized treatment planning-particularly in tumor immunotherapy and targeted therapy. Concurrently, this rapidly evolving domain faces pressing challenges, including data scarcity and lack of standardization, difficulty in aligning multimodal data, and the opaque, ""black-box"" nature of complex deep-learning models. Therefore, in this review, we aimed to summarize common AI technologies used in tumor diagnosis and treatment, multimodal data sources and fusion methods, applications of AI combined with multimodal data analysis in tumor immunotherapy and targeted therapy, and the key challenges currently facing this integrated approach."
PubMed,deep learning,Automated Multiclass Bone Segmentation Using Deep Learning: Implications for Templating in Radial Head Replacement.,Ausberto R Velasquez Garcia; Linjun Yang; Hiroki Nishikawa; James S Fitzsimmons; Adam J Wentworth; Jonathan M Morris; Michael J Taunton; Shawn W O'Driscoll,10.1016/j.jse.2026.02.005,2026-02-18,Journal of shoulder and elbow surgery,"Preoperative three-dimensional (3D) templating can improve surgical accuracy in anatomic-press-fit radial head arthroplasty (RHA). However, current imaging segmentation methods used for templating are time-consuming and prone to variability. This study aimed to train and validate an nnU-Net deep learning model to automate multiclass bone segmentation for RHA templating. We hypothesized that the nnU-Net model would achieve high accuracy in segmenting the upper extremity bones thereby supporting 3D bone templating in RHA.
A total of 93 upper extremity computed tomography (CT) scans met the eligibility criteria. Ground-truth segmentation was performed by a trained orthopedic surgeon and reviewed by a radiologist and an engineer to ensure accuracy. The nnU-Net model was trained and evaluated using the Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC) and Hausdorff Distance to measure overlap and segmentation accuracy against manual segmentations. The 3D bone models derived from the nnU-Net model and manual segmentation were compared through Mean Surface Distance (MSD) and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) were determined to assess the surface variation between the bone models. The average time on segmenting each CT was compared.
The nnU-Net achieved high segmentation accuracy with DSC values of 0.99 for the humerus, 0.98 for the ulna, and 0.96 and 0.95 for the cortical and non-cortical radii, respectively. The MSD remained below 0.2 mm for all bone classes. The mean RMSE values were consistent at 0.2 mm across all bones. Segmentation time averaged 3 min per scan compared to 78 min for manual segmentation, with consistent performance across gender, arm side, and CT slice thickness.
This deep learning model provides a fast and reliable solution for multiclass bone segmentation and demonstrates high accuracy in segmenting cortical and non-cortical regions, which are essential for RHA templating. The accuracy was consistent with clinical needs and fits below the sizing intervals of commercially available prostheses. This supports its potential utility for 3D preoperative planning in RHA, despite its inability to capture cartilage. This approach demonstrates clinical feasibility for improving efficiency and precision in templating radial head replacement surgery."

Here, we report a comprehensive molecular and cellular atlas for the adult human SCN by spatial transcriptomics, single-nucleus RNA sequencing, and deep-learning-based histological analysis. We identified seven human SCN neuron subtypes with specific transcriptomes and spatial distributions. Comparison of humans, mice, and non-human primates revealed the conserved functional segregation within the SCN regulated by LIM homeobox 1 (LHX1) and RAR-related orphan receptor B (RORB). Furthermore, our results suggested that the human SCN has undergone marked reorganization of its neuropeptide signaling network. Finally, integrative analysis of human SCN transcriptomes and genome-wide association studies (GWASs) identified arginine vasopressin (AVP)/neuromedin S (NMS) subtype as the potential neuronal correlate for morningness chronotype. Thus, our spatial and single-cell transcriptomic atlas of the human SCN provided a basis for the understanding of neural and molecular mechanisms of the human circadian clock."

Crossref,aortic stenosis,Recent Patents of Stent Grafts for Intravascular Aortic Repair,Yiwen Wang; Yuxin Zhang,10.2174/0118722083355380250716073539,2026-06,Recent Patents on Biotechnology,"Introduction:                     Endovascular aortic repair involves the placement of stents through minimally invasive methods to seal rupture sites near the aortic inflow tract, thereby preventing blood entry into the false lumen and promoting thrombosis, which reduces the risk of aortic rupture. Endovascular stents typically consist of a metal framework and a flexible membrane graft designed to reopen obstructed aortic segments and maintain blood flow through the true lumen. Consequently, stents are widely used to treat aortic expansion diseases and aortic occlusive stenosis. However, traditional stents have limitations in terms of adaptability to complex anatomical structures, long-term durability, biomechanical stability, and reliance on radial support force for fixation, lacking active fixation mechanisms. These shortcomings remain the primary causes of postoperative complications, significantly impacting the quality of life for patients with aortic dissection.                                                           Methods:                     The research status of the endovascular stent was discussed in depth, and the main factors for the optimal design of the stent (geometry, pattern configuration, additional fixtures, and optimization methods) were analyzed and summarized according to the complications targeted by the repair device.                                                           Results:                     The composition structure, working principle, and development status of the stent grafts under review are elaborated in detail. Stent grafts attempt to alleviate postoperative complications through three approaches: enhancing the flexibility of the stent framework, improving the fit between the vessel wall and the stent, and reducing vascular injury. Blood flow guiding channels are established to alleviate the obstruction of branch blood flow. Additional self-anchoring devices are added to adapt to the dynamic remodeling of blood vessels.                                                           Discussion:                     The effects of various factors, including geometric parameters, structural design, and parameter optimization techniques, on the optimization of stent primary mechanical performance are discussed. The current research status of functional improvement methods for stents is also summarized.                                                           Conclusion:                     Refining the quantitative relationship between stent structural parameters and mechanical performance, as well as exploring the balance criteria between flexibility and radial support force, represent promising directions for future development. These objectives necessitate further in-depth analysis and research."

With a focus on the prevalent psychological complications following the onset of this condition, this study aimed to explore the correlation between antenatal depression and Corona disease anxiety, personality traits, and postpartum depression during the COVID-19 pandemic.                                                           Materials and Methods:                     This cross-sectional descriptive-analytical study investigated women receiving care at health centers affiliated with Kerman University of Medical Sciences during the last month of their pregnancy and the postpartum period in 2022. Following the acquisition of informed consent, participants were assessed using various measures, including demographic and obstetric information, the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale, the Corona Disease Anxiety Scale (CDAS), and the NEO Personality Inventory-Revised during their third trimester of pregnancy. The same group of participants completed the Edinburgh Depression Scale and the Corona Disease Anxiety Scale (CDAS) 4-6 weeks after childbirth.                                                           Results and Discussion:                     There was a significant correlation between family income, unwanted pregnancy as perceived by both the mother and father, and antenatal depression. Additionally, marital satisfaction played a significant role in postpartum depression. Furthermore, antenatal depression was significantly associated with neuroticism, agreeableness, and physical symptoms related to Corona disease anxiety. Personality traits, with the exception of extroversion and conscientiousness, and various domains of Corona disease anxiety, excluding psychological symptoms, were also significantly associated with postpartum depression.                                                           Conclusion:                     During pandemics or epidemics, such as the COVID-19 outbreak, experiencing mental distress during pregnancy can contribute to mental health issues during the postpartum period. This risk is particularly true in individuals with unique personality traits, emphasizing the need for increased focus on mental health within prenatal care during these crises."

Method:                     This cross-sectional study was conducted in Kerman, Iran. Data were collected from patients who visited Afzalipour Hospital in Kerman more than twice during the COVID-19 epidemic from the end of February 2020 to March 21, 2021. We conducted two key analyses: 1. Mixed effect logistic regression was used to check the relationship between the variables and COVID-19 severity. 2. Mixed effect linear regression was used to check the relationship between the variables and the length of stay in the hospital.                                                           Results:                     The findings indicated that the most important risk factors for the severity of COVID-19 were heart diseases (OR=1.67,95%CI:1.20-2.30), increasing age (OR=2.23 for age&gt;54, 95%CI:1.70- 2.90), male gender (OR=1.47,95%CI:1.10-1.96), respiratory diseases other than asthma, and frequency of admission (OR=1.60,95%CI:1.20-2.15). All patients who underwent readmission experienced a shorter duration of hospitalization during their subsequent admission (OR=0.94,95%CI:0.91,0.96) and had a higher mortality rate (30% within 14 days, 26.6% between 14-90 days). Patients readmitted at intervals of 14-90 days and greater than 90 days exhibited lower disease severity compared to those readmitted within the 0-14 day period.                                                           Conclusion:                     Examining readmissions, the severity of COVID-19, and the length of hospital stay in affected patients are important factors for planning and allocating resources for COVID-19 management and treatment. These factors can help policymakers develop effective clinical guidelines for hospitalization or outpatient treatment of COVID-19 patients and contribute to reducing the burden of disease in the community."

Kinovea, as an accessible motion-analysis software, provides both visual and quantitative feedback. However, its application in supporting technique development among beginner athletes remains insufficiently explored. Aim: This study aims to describe the use of Kinovea in biomechanics training and examine its contribution to the awareness of kinematic characteristics and movement techniques among beginner athletes. Methods: A descriptive qualitative design involved 72 beginner athletes aged 18–25 years selected through purposive sampling. Data were collected over 16 weeks through interviews, field observations, and motion video recordings analyzed using Kinovea. Kinematic data focused on joint angles, stride behavior, and movement phases during walking, running, and the flight phase. Qualitative data were analyzed using content analysis with NVivo 12, while kinematic results were interpreted descriptively to identify performance patterns and areas for technical refinement. Result: Kinematic analysis showed coordinated joint-angle patterns across all phases. Walking analysis identified arm swing angles of 50.9°–58.8° and leg separation angles of 64.3°–67.2°, indicating a stable gait rhythm. The running analysis revealed knee angles of 68.8°–69.8° and elbow angles of 87.6°–89.1°, indicating efficient propulsive mechanics. The flight phase demonstrated knee angles of 81.2°–87.8° and elbow angles of 80.4°–88.3°, suggesting effective momentum use and postural stability. These measurements supported stride-efficiency assessment and technique evaluation. Qualitative findings revealed that Kinovea enabled athletes to interpret movement phases and identify technical inefficiencies through slow-motion and frame-by-frame visualization. Conclusion: Kinovea supports basic motion analysis by providing clear kinematic information and helping beginner athletes observe and refine their movement techniques. The findings also offer practical value for coaches by enabling more precise identification of inefficient patterns and guiding targeted corrections during early-stage training."

Liu; Xiaoyu He; Zejun Song,10.1111/dme.70239,2026-02-18,Diabetic Medicine,"Davis and colleagues' longitudinal Fremantle Diabetes Study Phase II study makes a pivotal contribution by demonstrating that type 2 diabetes doubles the risk of incident aortic valve replacement (AVR) with distal symmetrical polyneuropathy (DSPN) and intensive glucose-lowering therapy as key associates.1 Its strengths include rigorous age, sex and postcode matching, long-term follow-up from 2008 to 2021, and integration of competing risk models that address critical limitations of prior research and reinforce the clinical relevance of its findings. Several underdeveloped dimensions could further enhance the study's translational value and we aim to elaborate on targeted recommendations to address these aspects. Our core suggestions focus on three interconnected areas to deepen understanding and clinical applicability. First, subgroup stratification is essential as the study aggregates type 2 diabetes participants. Stratifying by diabetes duration, such as less than 5 years, 5–10 years and more than 10 years, would clarify whether AVR risk accumulates linearly or if thresholds exist. Distinguishing between glucose-lowering medication classes, such as sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors versus insulin, could reveal if specific therapies modify valvular risk.2 Second, a mechanistic exploration of the DSPN-AVR association is needed beyond the common soil hypothesis.3 Investigating sarcopenia as a mediator, given its links to both DSPN and aortic stenosis progression,4 could identify modifiable targets like resistance training. Third, outcome granularity matters in distinguishing urgent versus elective AVR as the former carries a higher perioperative risk.5 Assessing post-AVR non-mortality outcomes, such as infections and renal dysfunction, would provide a more comprehensive view of the diabetes-related burden and guide perioperative management. These recommendations build on the study's robust foundation without undermining its core findings. By addressing subgroup-specific risk, mechanistic mediators and outcome detail, future research can refine risk stratification, identify targeted interventions and optimize personalized care for adults with type 2 diabetes at risk of severe valvular heart disease. Davis and colleagues' work rightly highlights the need for heightened clinical suspicion of aortic stenosis in older adults with type 2 diabetes, and these extensions will further strengthen its translational impact.

Jonathan Zhang; Xiaojing Liu; Haibo Yang; Hua Zhang; Youjin Li; Jian Yang,10.3389/fcvm.2026.1662827,2026-02-18,Frontiers in Cardiovascular Medicine,"Background The prevalence of rheumatic aortic regurgitation (AR) is higher than that of aortic stenosis in developing countries, but the efficacy of transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) in high surgical risk patients with severe AR remains unknown. Our goal was to explore the differences in clinical outcomes of TAVR in patients with rheumatic and non-rheumatic AR. Methods 144 Rheumatic and 417 nonrheumatic patients with severe AR were prospectively enrolled from January 2018 to December 2021. All patients underwent transapical TAVR with J-Valve after evaluation by computed tomography angiography and transthoracic echocardiography before the procedure. The primary end point was 3-year all-cause mortality. Results The average age was 71.2 [interquartile range (IQR): 66.0–76.0] years, and the Society of Thoracic Surgeons score was 4.8 (IQR: 3.4–6.1) %. The proportion of patients with rheumatic AR who developed ≥ mild PVL was lower than the proportion of patients with non-rheumatic AR (5.6% vs. 11.3%, P &amp;lt; 0.001). At a median follow-up of 39.7 (IQR: 36.4–41.8) months, no difference was observed in the 3-year all-cause mortality ( P = 0.740) between the two groups. After multivariate adjustment, the Society of Thoracic Surgeons score, higher frailty and larger aortic angulation were associated with 3-year all-cause mortality. Conclusion For patients with rheumatic AR, the clinical outcomes were similar to those of patients with non-rheumatic AR. TAVR can be one of the feasible treatment options for such patients."

Zhigulina,10.17116/kardio20261901157,2026-02-18,Russian Journal of Cardiology and Cardiovascular Surgery,"Objective. The aim of the study was to apply a new echocardiographic technology in the visualization of turbulent blood flow and energy expenditure in healthy and patients with aortic stenosis. Materials and methods. Intraventricular blood flow studies were performed in 10 healthy subjects (average age 37±8 years) and 10 patients with aortic stenosis (average age 67±9 years) using the LISENDO 880LE premium ultrasound system (Fujifilm Corporation, Japan). Intracardiac blood flows were studied using a specialized software module Vector Flow Mapping (VFM). The structure of blood flow inside the left ventricle was assessed by the location of turbulence zones with the determination of the area, direction and acceleration of the vortex in certain phases of the cardiac cycle: isovolumic contraction, systole, diastole and atrial contraction. The results were calculated based on the average acceleration of blood flow and the area of turbulent flow in the outflow tract of the left ventricle. Results. Pressure gradients on the aortic valve and its opening area were evaluated to characterize aortic stenosis. The vortices formed during the filling of the left ventricle have a certain geometry and anatomical location that determine the directional blood flow during the shock discharge. The mechanics of myocardial contraction were assessed by three components: blood flows in the heart cavities, energy distribution and expenditure during the cardiac cycle, and their relationship between the area of turbulent flow and acceleration. Conclusion. Turbulence plays an important role in the normal functioning of the heart, supporting the movement and direction of blood flow. The energy dissipation during the cardiac cycle in aortic stenosis is determined by the area of the aortic valve opening, the zones of additional turbulence in the left ventricle, and the acceleration of turbulent vortices."

Patients and methods: This single-center retrospective study included 216 patients with angiographically confirmed calcified abdominal aortic stenosis (mean PACSS 3.7 ± 0.8) treated with EVT between 2005 and 2023. Of these, 33 patients had coral reef aorta (CRA). Patients were stratified by lesion location and CRA presence. Primary endpoints were 30-day adverse events and technical success (residual stenosis &lt;30%). Secondary endpoints were major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE), major adverse limb events (MALE), and all-cause mortality. Cox regression identified predictors of outcome. Results: Technical success was achieved in 81.9%. Thirty-day mortality was 0.5%. At 10 years, freedom from MACE was significantly lower in patients with non-bifurcation abdominal aortic stenosis (56% vs. 76%; aHR 2.13, p &lt; .05) and lowest in CRA (30% vs. 71%; aHR 3.17, p &lt; .05). Independent predictors of MACE were CRA, chronic total occlusion (aHR 3.38, 95% CI 1.57–7.29), critical limb-threatening ischemia (aHR 3.67, 95% CI 1.74–7.75), and age (aHR 1.06 per year, 95% CI 1.01–1.11). MALE was more frequent in patients with peripheral arterial disease (aHR 2.07, 95% CI 1.12–3.81), CRA (aHR 2.51, 95% CI 1.17–5.40), and current smokers (aHR 5.10, 95% CI 1.23–21.0). Conclusions: CRA and non-bifurcation abdominal aortic stenosis are associated with reduced long-term freedom from MACE after EVT. These findings define high-risk subgroups within calcified AIOD and highlight the prognostic value of anatomical lesion characteristics for treatment planning and follow-up."
OpenAlex,aortic stenosis,Editorial: Diagnostic and predictive roles of computational cardiovascular hemodynamics in the management of cardiovascular diseases,Fuyou Liang; Yonghui Qiao; David Perpetuini; Harvey Ho,10.3389/fbioe.2026.1804586,2026-02-18,Frontiers in Bioengineering and Biotechnology,"Current clinical management of cardiovascular diseases relies heavily on medical imaging. However, structural indices derived from medical images, such as the degree of stenosis or aneurysm diameter, may not fully reflect the functional severity of disease (Liu et al., 2025b). Computational hemodynamics, therefore, serves as a critical complementary modality, offering functional insights that fill this gap (Makropoulos et al., 2024). This Research Topic presents 16 studies that collectively demonstrate computational cardiovascular hemodynamics not merely as a theoretical method for basic research, but as an evolving clinical tool capable of complementing diagnosis, predicting progression, and optimizing intervention.A primary limitation in clinical diagnosis arises from the reliance on invasive procedures or subjective assessments (Zhang et al., 2023). Computational hemodynamics addresses this by providing non-invasive functional quantifications (Li et al., 2025). Wang et al. tackled the limitations of using invasive pressure wire to assess the hemodynamic impact of intracranial atherosclerotic stenosis. Their study demonstrated the concordance between angiography-derived quantitative flow ratio and invasive non-hyperemic pressure ratio, establishing a wire-free methodology for assessing functional ischemia.To address the challenge of interpreting complex imaging data, Guo et al. developed an echocardiographic video-driven multi-task learning model (IE-CAD) that simultaneously estimates the Gensini score and cardiac functional parameters (e.g., global longitudinal strain, left ventricular ejection fraction, global work efficiency). This approach automates the diagnosis and grading of coronary artery disease, thereby effectively overcoming the subjectivity inherent in manual visual assessment. Additionally, Fan et al. proposed a multidisciplinary framework combining numerical simulation with deep learning to enhance the hemodynamic analysis of aneurysms, demonstrating how artificial intelligence can accelerate complex diagnostic workflows. Collectively, these studies highlight a paradigm shift towards non-invasive, automated, and functionally integrated diagnostic protocols that reduce reliance on operator subjectivity and invasive instrumentation.Risk stratification relying exclusively on geometric metrics often lacks the ability to fully capture the heterogeneity of disease (Hesse et al., 2024). To address that issue, hemodynamic metrics predicted by computational models, such as wall shear stress (WSS) and its derivatives, may serve as additional biomarkers, yet their predictive accuracy is contingent upon high-fidelity biomechanical representation (Qiao et al., 2022). Goetz et al. conducted comprehensive fluid-structure interaction (FSI) analyses 101 intracranial aneurysms (AnXplore), revealing that traditional rigid-wall assumptions overestimate WSS and induce significant deviations in the prediction of oscillatory shear index. Consequently, incorporating vascular wall compliance appears to be important for the precise characterization of rupture risk metrics.Extending the pursuit of realism from passive compliance to active biological modulation, Qin et al. employed a multimodal approach involving ultrasound, histology, and wire myography in a rat model to demonstrate that a decline in arterial smooth muscle active contractile force correlates with inflammatory exacerbation and matrix degradation. Yue et al. utilized FSI analysis with a multi-layered anisotropic model to explore the biomechanical function of the intraluminal thrombus (ILT) in abdominal aortic aneurysms, finding that the ILT provides a significant ""cushioning effect"" that attenuates wall stress and mitigates stress concentrations caused by medial degradation.In addition to these methodological refinements, recent studies have validated hemodynamic metrics as sensitive biomarkers across diverse pathologies. Armour et al. demonstrated a direct correlation between wall shear stress (WSS) patterns and disease severity in pulmonary arterial hypertension, thereby substantiating the utility of flow metrics in tracking disease progression. Similarly, Chen et al. addressed the clinical discrepancy between anatomical significance and functional risk, revealing that even ""mild"" coronary stenosis induces flow disturbances critical to plaque progression. Furthermore, Yu et al. elucidated the compression mechanics inherent to myocardial bridging, while Lv et al. quantified cerebral blood flow regulation defects in patients with an incomplete circle of Willis. Taken together, these findings indicate that computational modeling offers a quantitative framework to evaluate the hemodynamic impact of complex anatomical features and mechanical properties, thereby better assessing the dysfunctional severity or predict the progression of cardiovascular disease.The final phase of clinical management focuses on precise intervention and long-term prognosis, where computational modeling provide a robust platform for pre-operation planning, device optimization, and post-operation surveillance (Luan et al., 2023;Liu et al., 2025a). Šeman et al. reviewed the utility of computational modeling in managing valvular heart disease, highlighting its capacity to bridge the gap between clinical observation and theoretical prediction in complex pathologies like mixed valvular disease. By forecasting post-procedural hemodynamic profiles, these models can serve as a useful tool for reducing diagnostic uncertainty.Building upon its predictive capability, device-specific modeling is essential for optimizing interventional procedure. Yin et al. developed a fully coupled FSI model for bioprosthetic aortic valves and elucidated that kinematic parameters, especially wall shear stress and leaflet deformation undetectable by standard imaging, may provide critical insights for identifying the mechanical precursors of structural deterioration. Yang et al. demonstrated that the Niagara catheter's novel helical flow inducer significantly enhances perfusion efficiency. Through computational fluid dynamics, they confirmed that the induced helical flow suppresses stagnant zones, thereby mitigating thrombogenic risk.Effective clinical management extends beyond the immediate success of intervention, necessitating post-procedural assessment to monitor functional recovery and hemodynamic stability. Lv et al. highlighted the importance of integrating lifestyle into post-stenting care by investigating the combined effects of stent design and patient exercise intensity. Their findings revealed that exercise-induced hemodynamic variations significantly alter wall shear stress profiles, suggesting that physical activity levels can be prescribed to minimize restenosis risk. Paparella et al. utilized 2D speckle-tracking echocardiography (2D-STE) to quantify cardiac mechanics following AF ablation, identifying functional recovery and reverse remodeling that standard volumetric assessments fail to capture. Jensen et al. systematically quantified hemodynamics after aortic coarctation repair, demonstrating that despite anatomical correction, abnormal flow patterns often persist.The studies compiled in this Topic highlight the potential clinical significance of shifting from static structural assessment to dynamic functional evaluation in cardiovascular medicine. By validating non-invasive diagnostic tools, elucidating biomechanical risk factors, optimizing interventional devices and predicting long-term postoperative outcomes, computational hemodynamics is demonstrating its value as an indispensable component of precise patient management."

OpenAlex,aortic stenosis,Diagnostic agreement of volume and Agatston scoring for aortic valve calcification on non–ECG-gated computed tomography in severe aortic stenosis,Kotaro Ouchi; Toru Sakuma; Shu Okubo; Ayumi Nojiri; Hiroya Ojiri,10.1097/mca.0000000000001623,2026-02-18,Coronary Artery Disease,"Objectives To assess whether non–ECG-gated computed tomography (CT) reliably quantifies aortic valve calcification (AVC) for diagnosing severe aortic stenosis and to compare the agreement and diagnostic performance of Agatston versus volume scoring. Methods In this retrospective single-centre study, 129 consecutive patients with echocardiographically confirmed severe aortic stenosis (mean age, 83.1 ± 6.3 years; 46 men, 83 women) underwent same-session ECG-gated (3 mm) and Non–ECG-gated (5 mm) non-contrast CT between 21 March 2020 and 16 April 2025. AVC was quantified using Agatston and volume methods. Agreement between non-gated and gated scores was assessed by Pearson correlation, Bland–Altman analysis, and Deming regression. Diagnostic performance for sex-specific Agatston thresholds (≥2000 units men, ≥1300 units women) was evaluated using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis. Results Volume scores on non–ECG-gated CT correlated more strongly with ECG-gated CT scores than Agatston scores ( r = 0.95 vs. 0.69, P &lt; 0.001). Bland–Altman analysis demonstrated substantial negative bias and proportional error for Agatston scores (mean difference, −921.1 units; limits of agreement, −2900.8 to +1058.6), while volume scores showed minimal bias and no proportional error (+16.5 mm 3 ; −648.5 to +681.4). Deming regression confirmed closer agreement for volume scores (slope, 1.02; R 2 = 0.90). ROC analysis showed higher area under the curve values for volume scores (0.976 for men, 0.975 for women) than for Agatston scores (0.946 and 0.967, respectively). Conclusion Non–ECG-gated CT enables reliable quantification of aortic valve calcium in severe aortic stenosis. Volume scoring demonstrates superior agreement and diagnostic performance compared with Agatston scoring, supporting its use as a robust, density-independent metric for opportunistic assessment of AVC on routine chest CT."
OpenAlex,aortic stenosis,A Predictive Analysis of Readmission in Older Adults After Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement,Chae-Eun Lee; Hyang Yuol Lee; Myoung Shik Choi; Sun-mi Lee,10.1097/jcn.0000000000001309,2026-02-17,The Journal of Cardiovascular Nursing,"Background: Aortic valve stenosis in older adults presents a growing healthcare challenge, with transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) being widely used in patients aged ≥75 years owing to its minimally invasive approach. Despite its benefits, readmission remains common and is associated with adverse outcomes. However, evidence from rapidly aging countries such as South Korea is limited, highlighting the need for context-specific strategies. Objective: To identify the key predictors associated with hospital readmission in older adults after TAVR. Methods: This retrospective study analyzed the clinical data of 558 older adults who underwent TAVR between 2018 and 2023 at a tertiary hospital in Seoul. Statistical analyses included descriptive statistics, chi-square tests, and logistic regression using Statistical Package for Social Sciences 29. Results: Of the 558 patients, 21.7% were readmitted. Significant predictors included male sex, hospital stay exceeding 10 days, high N-terminal pro B-type natriuretic peptide levels, and elevated age-adjusted Charlson comorbidity index scores. Conclusions: This study emphasizes the role of patient severity in predicting readmission after TAVR in older adults. Key risk factors include elevated cardiac biomarkers, high comorbidity, prolonged hospitalization, and male sex. Integrating these into discharge planning may enhance nurse-led interventions and support safer care transition."
OpenAlex,aortic stenosis,Barthel index in TAVR patients – a novel use of an old score,Magda Haum; Lukas Weyde; Julius Steffen; J Fischer; Kornelia Löw; Sebastian Sadoni; Hans Theiß; Konstantin Stark; Konstantinos Rizas; Jörg Hausleiter; S Massberg; Kathrin Krieg,10.1007/s00392-026-02854-1,2026-02-17,Clinical Research in Cardiology,"Abstract Background Transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) has become a well-established therapy for aortic stenosis (AS). With rising TAVR numbers, appropriate patient selection becomes more important. Identifying patients with the highest long-term benefit from the procedure is especially challenging in this elderly patient cohort. Barthel Index (BI) is a commonly used tool to assess the patients’ capability of activities of daily life. Methods and results In this single-center study, we analyzed BI of patients receiving TAVR for severe symptomatic AS at our center in 2018 and 2019. BI had been collected by nursing personnel during clinical routine and 475 patients could be analyzed. Median BI was 90 points and was used as cut-off to define two groups of patients: lesser frail patients with higher BI (≥ 90; n = 255) and more frail patients with lower BI (&lt; 90; n = 220). Patients with lower BI were older (83 vs. 80 years; p &lt; 0.01) with higher surgical risk score (STS-score 4.1% vs. 2.5%; p &lt; 0.01), and worse renal function (CKD in 49.5% vs. 31.8%; p &lt; 0.01). Long-term survival differed significantly: only 117 patients (53.1%) in the low BI group were still alive 4-years after TAVR vs. 204 patients (80.0%) in the higher BI group. Further analyses revealed that combining STS score and BI significantly improved mortality prediction (C index for STS score 0.626; C index for combined STS score and BI 0.683; p &lt; 0.01). Conclusions This is the first analysis evaluating the prognostic value of BI on long-term survival after TAVR. Albeit assessing only the patient’s functional status and no detailed medical history, BI is a strong discriminator for frail patients. Moreover, it allows identification of patients at higher risk of mortality within the first 4 years after TAVR and should therefore be considered for evaluation of patients with severe AS.

Cardiac damage staging systems may better characterize myocardial and extracardiac involvement. We aim to evaluate the presence and progression of cardiac damage across the clinical course of AS. Methods: A single-center retrospective cohort study was conducted, which included consecutive patients who ultimately underwent TAVR and had retrievable serial echocardiograms at moderate AS, first severe AS, and pre-TAVR symptomatic severe AS (2017–2021). A total of 179 patients were evaluated (mean age 82.7 [5.9] years at moderate AS; 46% male, p = 0.27). Cardiac damage was classified according to two established staging systems. Results: The median time from moderate to severe AS was 32 months (IQR 18–48). Most echocardiographic parameters deteriorated primarily at symptom onset, whereas moderate AS and first severe (asymptomatic) AS showed broadly similar profiles. However, left ventricular global longitudinal strain (LV GLS) was already impaired at the first severe stage, and right ventricular–arterial coupling (RVAc, TAPSE/sPAP) progressively worsened as AS advanced to the severe stage, independently of symptom status (LV GLS −18.1%, n = 163; −17.1%, n = 143; and −14.9%, n = 143; RVAc 1.0, n = 131; 0.8, n = 130; and 0.7, n = 130), respectively; overall p &lt; 0.05. Both staging systems demonstrated increasing cardiac damage with AS progression. Conclusions: Cardiac damage may occur early in AS. The marked deterioration at symptom onset underscores the importance of systematic myocardial assessment and supports prospective studies to evaluate whether integrating LV GLS and RVAc as sensitive early markers of disease progression improves risk stratification."

Here, we present the first data indicating a role for caldesmon-1 (CALD1) in calcified aortic valve disease (CAVD) pathogenesis. Analysis of publicly available single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) datasets revealed that CALD1 shows prominent upregulation in aortic valve stenosis (AS) cases when compared to normal subjects. Histological examination demonstrated that CALD1 protein expression is elevated in calcified AS valves and co-localises with α-smooth muscle actin (a myofibroblast biomarker) and vimentin, indicating its association with activated valvular interstitial cells (VICs). Bioinformatic analysis showed that CALD1-positive cells predominantly synthesize extracellular matrix components, including COL1A1 . Functional experiments using CALD1-depleted VICs revealed that CALD1 is required for maintaining spindle-shaped morphology, actin polymerisation, and proliferative capacity. Moreover, CALD1 loss significantly impaired osteoblast differentiation and attenuated VIC calcification. Bulk RNA-seq combined with pathway analysis demonstrated that CALD1-mediated actin polymerisation positively regulates key osteogenic and valvulopathy-related genes, including RUNX2 and ALPL . Collectively, these findings identify CALD1 as a novel regulator of VIC phenotypic plasticity and osteogenic transition during CAVD progression, providing mechanistic insight and a target for potential AS therapy."
OpenAlex,aortic stenosis,Time-robust myocardial [68Ga]Ga-FAPI PET biomarker reflects aortic stenosis severity and predicts post-TAVI outcomes,Song Xue; Qianling Ye; Aleksa Lazarević; Kevin Hamzaraj; Patrick Binder; Christian Nitsche; Attila Kiss; Bruno K Podesser; Marcus Hacker; Xiang Li; René Rettl,10.1007/s00259-026-07815-4,2026-02-16,European Journal of Nuclear Medicine and Molecular Imaging,"Abstract Background Aortic stenosis (AS) induces myocardial remodeling and fibroblast activation, yet modifiable biomarkers capable of capturing active fibrogenesis and predicting post-transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) recovery are currently scarce. Fibroblast activation protein (FAP)–targeted PET serves as a noninvasive tool to visualize activated fibroblasts in vivo. We evaluated a time-robust, blood-pool–normalized myocardial [ 68 Ga]Ga-FAPI PET imaging biomarker that reflects AS burden and predicts outcomes after TAVI. Methods Nineteen patients with severe symptomatic AS underwent [ 68 Ga]Ga-FAPI-04 PET/CT at 60, 70, and 120 min. Using an in-house semi-automatic pipeline, the left ventricular (LV) myocardium was segmented, and regions of elevated fibroblast activity (EFM) were delineated using a blood-pool–anchored, time-point–specific threshold. We quantified myocardial SUV mean , blood-pool SUV mean , and a normalized myocardium-to-blood index, TBR(EFM), and assessed associations with N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) and left-ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF). One-year outcomes ( n = 11) were assessed using a predefined composite clinical response. Results Blood-pool SUV mean declined from 60 to 120 min, whereas myocardial SUV mean decreased less, yielding stable TBR(EFM) across time points (60/70/120 min: 2.2 ± 0.8, 2.1 ± 0.9, 2.3 ± 0.9; ANOVA p = 0.596). By contrast, myocardial SUV mean fell from 3.8 ± 0.7 (60 min) to 2.1 ± 0.9 (120 min; p &lt; 0.001). TBR(EFM) correlated with NT-proBNP at all time-points (60 min r = 0.65, p = 0.007; 120 min r = 0.72, p = 0.003), whereas SUV mean did not (60 min p = 0.576; 120 min p = 0.109). Baseline TBR(EFM) was significantly lower in one-year responders than non-responders (1.7 ± 0.2 vs. 2.9 ± 0.9; p = 0.013), with separation present at each time point ( p &lt; 0.05). Higher baseline TBR(EFM) associated with lower reductions in NT-proBNP at one year ( p &lt; 0.05). Conclusions Myocardial [ 68 Ga]Ga-FAPI TBR may provide a time-robust index of active fibroblast signaling that relates to myocardial hemodynamic stress and stratifies one-year clinical response after TAVI. A single 60-minute acquisition with TBR quantification may be sufficient for myocardial [ 68 Ga]Ga-FAPI assessment. These hypothesis-generating findings require validation in larger, multicenter cohorts. Graphical abstract"
OpenAlex,aortic stenosis,Impact of Iron Deficiency Anemia on Outcomes After Transcatheter Aortic Valve Implantation: Insights From the Nationwide Readmission Database From 2016 to 2021,Siddharth P. Agrawal; Shubhadarshini G. Pawar; Debankur Dey; Dhruvi Kalpesh Joshi; Maharshi Raval; Hritvik Jain; Sajid Siddiq,10.1002/ccd.70504,2026-02-15,Catheterization and Cardiovascular Interventions,"ABSTRACT Background Transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) has become an established intervention for severe symptomatic aortic stenosis, particularly in high‐risk and elderly patients. Although anemia is frequently encountered in this population, the specific role of iron deficiency anemia (IDA) in influencing outcomes following TAVI remains underexplored. Aims This study aims to evaluate the impact of iron deficiency anemia on clinical outcomes, resource utilization and readmission rates following TAVI using a large national database. Methods We conducted a retrospective, observational study using the Nationwide Readmission Database (NRD) from 2016 to 2021. Patients undergoing TAVI were identified by relevant ICD‐10‐Procedure Coding System (PCS) codes, and IDA was defined using ICD‐10‐Clinical Modification (CM) codes. Outcomes included in‐hospital mortality, 30‐day readmission, length of stay (LOS), transfusion requirements, and a range of complications. A 1:1 propensity score‐matched analysis was performed to account for potential confounders (e.g., demographics, comorbidities, hospital characteristics). Results Among 213,453 patients who underwent TAVI, 8993 (4.2%) had a documented diagnosis of IDA. Compared with non‐IDA patients, those with IDA experienced significantly higher rates of blood transfusion (14.75% vs. 5.33%; adjusted OR: 3.12, 95% CI: 2.78, 3.51; p &lt; 0.001) and a greater incidence of post‐procedure bleeding (14.38% vs. 11.62%; adjusted OR: 1.29, 95% CI: 1.17, 1.41; p &lt; 0.001). Although in‐hospital mortality did not differ significantly between the two groups (1.31% vs. 1.47%; p = 0.42), IDA was associated with a longer median LOS and higher 30‐day readmission rates (11.95% vs. 9.84%; adjusted OR: 1.27, 95% CI: 1.15, 1.41; p &lt; 0.001). Advancing age, the presence of heart failure, and greater comorbidity burden (Elixhauser comorbidity index ≥ 7) emerged as key predictors of in‐hospital death. Conclusion Baseline IDA in patients undergoing TAVI is associated with increased transfusion requirements, prolonged hospitalization, and higher rates of 30‐day readmission, underscoring the clinical and economic burden of this modifiable risk factor. Its association with greater resource utilization and complications supports the need for more proactive identification and management of iron deficiency in TAVI candidates. Future randomized trials are needed to clarify whether preprocedural correction of IDA can reduce adverse events and improve long‐term outcomes in this population."
OpenAlex,deep learning,Combating Data and Target Shifts in Visual Tasks,Zhaorui Tan,10.17638/03194353,2031-01-01,University of Liverpool,"The rapid advancement of deep learning models for visual tasks has led to significant progress in many domains. However, a key challenge remains: ensuring that models can generalize effectively to unseen samples or novel classes, especially in real-world scenarios where training data-target pairs are often limited or unavailable, and test data may exhibit shifts in both data and targets. This thesis addresses the problem of shifts across data and targets, proposing novel methods to improve model generalization and transferability in complex settings. The thesis identifies the different shift scenarios for visual tasks and presents their problem forms. The research first relaxes the static target distribution assumption in Multi-Domain Generalization (mDG) tasks, introducing the General Multi-Domain Generalization (GMDG) objective to improve generalization under varying data shifts. Specifically, Extensive experiments validate that GMDG is feasible for classification, segmentation, and regression tasks. Further considering extreme target distribution shifts where even unknown novel classes emerge, the study also explores logical regularization techniques for tasks such as Generalized Category Discovery (GCD), mDG+GCD, and Class Incremental Learning (CIL), proposing a sample-based logical regularization term (L-Reg) to enhance data-, target-, and all-shift generalization. Additionally, a partial logic framework is introduced to address challenges in CIL, enabling models to retain room for unknown classes during training. This is further extended by the Partial-Logic Regularization (PL-Reg), which improves generalization across GCD, mDG+GCD, and transferability for CIL tasks. Furthermore, the thesis proposes a novel Semantic-aware Data Augmentation (SADA) framework for cross-modality generalization in text-to-image synthesis (T2Isyn), text-image retrieval (TIR), and image-text retrieval (ITR) tasks. This framework ensures semantic preservation across text and image modalities, improving both semantic consistency and image quality in cross-modality tasks. The methods proposed in this thesis offer significant advancements in visual generalization and transfer scenarios, providing theoretical insights and practical solutions for handling data shifts, target shifts, and multi-modalities in complex scenarios. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of the proposed methods, demonstrating their superior performance across a range of tasks."
OpenAlex,deep learning,Antecedents and consequences of Green-tech FDI in emerging markets,Zhuoran Liu,10.17638/03195308,2031-01-01,University of Liverpool,"As environmental pressures intensify, attracting sustainable foreign direct investment (FDI), particularly green-tech FDI, has become a critical pathway for emerging markets to achieve environmental sustainability. However, existing research remains fragmented, offering limited insights into why green-tech FDI enters emerging markets and how it affects regional green innovation. This thesis addresses these gaps by systematically examining both the antecedents and consequences of green-tech FDI through three empirical studies using regional data from China. Study 1 and Study 2 focus on the antecedents of green-tech FDI. Study 1 examines how host-country conditions can attract green-tech FDI, highlighting the role of environmental management information disclosure (EMID) by domestic firms in reducing information gaps and strengthening green market–seeking motives. Study 2 shifts attention to the active decision-making of green-tech FDI, showing that under uncertainty, green-tech foreign investors engage in identity-based bandwagon learning by imitating peers with similar green identities, thereby mitigating investment risks. Study 3 turns to the consequences of green-tech FDI. It demonstrates that, due to the technological complexity of green innovation and limited absorptive capacity in emerging markets, green-tech FDI may generate crowding-out effects rather than purely positive spillovers. Adopting a network perspective, the study further finds that universities play a key moderating role: through broad linkages and deep collaborations, they help mitigate negative spillovers and facilitate the diffusion of green technologies. Together, the three studies advance the literature on sustainable FDI by differentiating green-tech FDI from general FDI and identifying the specific mechanisms that shape its entry decisions and local innovation outcomes. Practically, the findings provide guidance for emerging-market governments and firms on how to attract and manage sustainable investment, balance growth with environmental objectives, and strengthen local innovation ecosystems."
OpenAlex,deep learning,A UAV-Based Framework for Community-Scale Residential Building Energy Modelling in China,Mengfan Jin,10.17638/03195460,2029-01-01,University of Liverpool,"With increasing emphasis on energy efficiency and carbon emission reduction in the building sector, rapid and scalable energy modelling of existing buildings is critical for retrofit projects and policy development. Conventional surveys, data collection and energy modelling processes remain labour-intensive and impractical for large-scale applications, and energy modelling often dominates project time and cost. Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) equipped with high-resolution and infrared cameras now offer fast and safe exterior surveys, showing great potential in building energy assessments. Yet, a systematic framework for UAV integration, from image capture through processing to inputs for building energy simulation, has not been established. This research addresses these challenges by developing a structured framework for community-scale building energy modelling, which integrates UAV photogrammetry to accelerate data acquisition, reduce labour, and shorten energy modelling time for retrofit projects. The framework is designed to minimise prior data requirements while maximising automation and retaining sufficient accuracy and reliability. It also addressed systemic issues, such as the lack of data necessary to fully exploit the potential of available technologies in the context of this study. To achieve this research objective, a mixed-methodology approach, combining desk studies and fieldwork, was adopted. First, a comprehensive review of UAV-based building energy studies mapped the current applications and available tools, proposing a preliminary framework. Fieldwork then encompassed a pilot study and a detailed case study. In the pilot test, a single building was surveyed to identify an optimal toolchain for flight planning, image capture, photogrammetric reconstruction, model generation, and selection of a simulation platform. The resulting refined framework was applied to a case study of a 39-building community, and it was demonstrated that further automation was necessary. The potential for automation was then further explored. Geomatic algorithms, machine learning, and deep learning techniques were compared, and the combination that best balanced accuracy and processing time was selected for 3D model generation and window-to-wall ratio (WWR) extraction. In parallel, an archetype library of residential buildings in the Hot Summer Cold Winter (HSCW) zone in China was compiled to facilitate the assignment of thermal parameters. Finally, a reusable community-scale building energy modelling (CBEM) workflow was assembled in Grasshopper using Ladybug Tools components to process the aforementioned inputs. In conclusion, this study integrates UAV photogrammetry, GIS-based geomatic algorithms, machine learning, and graphical programming to develop an UAV-CBEM framework. The outcomes establish a foundation for scalable UAV-based building energy assessments, enhancing applicability in data-limited and large-scale settings worldwide."

OpenAlex,deep learning,Unsupervised Deep-learning Methods for Low-dose Computed Tomography Reconstruction,Ran An,10.17638/03194237,2027-01-01,University of Liverpool,"Computed tomography (CT) has become an indispensable imaging technique in medical diagnostics and industrial applications, owing to its non-invasive nature and high resolution in visualizing object internal structures. While X-ray CT (X-ray computed tomography) significantly enhances lesion detection capabilities, excessive exposure to X-ray radiation raises substantial health concerns, including elevated cancer risks and potential genetic damage. Although low-dose CT (LDCT) protocols reduce radiation safety concerns, they inevitably introduce severe noise and artifacts, which might compromise diagnostic accuracy. Recent advances in supervised deep learning approaches have demonstrated remarkable success in LDCT reconstruction. However, the reliance on paired training data severely limits their deployment in practical CT applications. This fundamental constraint highlights the critical importance of developing unsupervised reconstruction methods. Although existing unsupervised LDCT methods have made notable progress, they still face challenges requiring systematic solutions. This thesis makes three contributions to advance the field of unsupervised LDCT reconstruction: 1. Current dual-domain self-supervised LDCT denoising methods typically neglect the heterogeneity of the non-stationary Gaussian noise levels in low-dose sinograms and usually treat them as common images without appropriately controlling the denoising strength. The denoisers employed by them, which are based on classic convolutional neural networks (CNN), will lead to blurring artifacts in the reconstructed images if directly used for sinogram denoising. In addition, the denoising strength in the sinogram and image domains must be well-balanced to avoid introducing over-blurring or secondary artifacts in the reconstructed images, but existing approaches do not focus on this crucial point. To address these limitations, this thesis proposes a novel end-to-end dual-domain self-supervised framework for LDCT denoising. It employs Dropblock layers to adaptively localize the effect of convolution for sinogram denoising and sets a weighted average between the denoised sinograms and their noisy counterparts to better control the denoising strength, thus effectively reducing the blurring artifacts and leading to a well-balanced dual-domain denoising. Numerical experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and superior performance of the proposed method. 2. Existing normalizing flows (NFs)-based unsupervised LDCT reconstruction methods face challenges in both image quality and computational efficiency. On one hand, they typically utilize a two-way transformation strategy between noisy images and latent variables, which could easily lead to detail loss and secondary artifacts in the reconstructed images. On the other hand, training NFs on high-resolution CT images is computationally intensive. Although conditional normalizing flows (CNFs) can mitigate computational costs by learning conditional probabilities, existing approaches rely on labeled data for conditionalization, leaving unsupervised CNFs-based LDCT reconstruction a challenge. To tackle these issues, this thesis proposes a novel unsupervised LDCT iterative reconstruction algorithm based on CNFs. The proposed method employs a strict one-way transformation strategy during the alternating optimization in the dual spaces to prevent detail loss and secondary artifacts, and proposes a novel unsupervised conditionalization strategy for CNFs, thus achieving efficient training and inference on high-resolution images. The proposed method illustrates high-quality and relatively fast unsupervised reconstruction. Experiments across two datasets demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed method by rivaling several state-of-the-art methods. 3. Current diffusion model-based LDCT reconstruction methods solely employ the prior distributions learned from normal-dose CT data but neglect the valuable priors in low-dose data, which contain information about the characteristics of low-dose noise and artifacts. In addition, their reconstruction speed suffers from multiple sampling steps, presenting low efficiency. Breaking new ground in prior utilization, this thesis proposes a novel unsupervised LDCT iterative reconstruction algorithm based on dual denoising diffusion probabilistic models (DDPM), which leverages both normal-dose and low-dose priors. Specifically, the proposed method employs two DDPMs to learn the prior distributions from normal-dose and low-dose images, respectively, and incorporates them into a joint iterative reconstruction framework. To accelerate the reconstruction, partial diffusion sampling and single-pass deterministic reconstruction strategy are utilized in the proposed method, as well as the spaced OS-SART approaches. Experiments at different dose levels demonstrate the outstanding performance and fast speed of the proposed reconstruction algorithm. Through these innovations and contributions, this thesis addresses some significant challenges in current deep-learning-based unsupervised LDCT reconstruction methods, and proposes three novel unsupervised reconstruction algorithms. The proposed methods effectively improve the performance and efficiency of LDCT reconstruction under different unsupervised learning conditions, and provide some new perspectives and inspirations for future research."
OpenAlex,deep learning,From Sparse to Dense: Label-Efficient Weakly Supervised Segmentation for Images and Videos,Jian Wang,10.17638/03195330,2027-01-01,University of Liverpool,"Obtaining high-quality annotated data has become a primary bottleneck for training deep learning models, particularly for dense prediction tasks like semantic segmentation and video salient object segmentation. The demand for meticulous, pixel-level labeling makes fully-supervised approaches prohibitively expensive and limits their scalability. This thesis directly confronts this issue by proposing and systematically investigating a label-efficient ""sparse-to-dense'' paradigm. The core objective is to develop innovative frameworks that can learn from sparse, inexpensive weak supervision—such as image-level tags or scribbles—and intelligently propagate this minimal information to generate complete, pixel-accurate dense predictions. The major part of this thesis focuses on the ""sparse-to-dense'' challenge within Weakly Supervised Semantic Segmentation (WSSS) for images, where models learn from only image-level tags. Dominant approaches rely on Class Activation Maps (CAMs) as initial object seeds. However, CAMs inherently activate only the most discriminative object regions, leading to incomplete pseudo-labels. This gives rise to the central problem of activation densification: the critical process of expanding these sparse activations to cover the full extent of an object. Our research addresses this challenge through a progressive, multi-faceted strategy. Our exploration begins with a foundational framework (C3) designed to rectify the intrinsic flaws of initial CAMs. We propose a synergistic mutual calibration method. This method leverages the discrepancies between the two maps to generate local prototypes, which are simultaneously utilized to complete missing object parts and suppress background noise, yielding a significantly more accurate and complete initial seed. This foundational work immediately reveals the limitation of single-prototype instability and its inability to capture diverse features. Building on this foundation, we then develop architecture-specific strategies to address deeper limitations of the prototype-based approach. For Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) (C4), the use of a single prototype proves insufficient to capture significant intra-class variation. In response, we introduce an Optimal Transport (OT)-assisted framework that effectively mines multiple, diverse prototypes, thereby yielding more comprehensive activation maps. However, while C4 solves the intra-class diversity problem, the inherent local context constraint of the CNN architecture becomes the new bottleneck, fundamentally limiting the quality of globally-aware feature extraction needed for optimal multi-prototype assignment. This limitation necessitates a shift in architectural focus from CNNs to Vision Transformers. In the ViT architecture (C5), a new challenge arises where the token gap between the discriminative class token and varied patch tokens leads to incomplete activation. To bridge this gap, we leverage a tailored application of Optimal Transport, where the algorithm is tasked with learning a comprehensive proxy to ensure complete object activation. Despite these architectural advances (C3-C5), the overall WSSS performance hit a ceiling. This is fundamentally limited by the sparse supervision of class labels, which cannot provide precise boundary information. To break this ceiling, our WSSS exploration culminates in a universal enhancement strategy (C6) that transcends architecture-specific designs by leveraging Visual Foundation Models (VFMs). We resolve the conflict between the discriminative nature of initial CAMs and the VFM's need for holistic prompts. By modeling the CAM foreground as a graph and employing spectral analysis, our method intelligently selects a diverse set of prompt points that represent the overall structure of the foreground object. This guides the VFM to generate superior, boundary-aware supervision that can universally enhance any WSSS pipeline. Subsequently, the thesis extends the ""sparse-to-dense'' paradigm to the dynamic domain of video, addressing Weakly Supervised Video Salient Object Segmentation (WSVSOS) (C7) from sparse scribble annotations. In this specific context, the challenge evolves into spatio-temporal densification, which requires both full-object coverage within each frame and temporal consistency across the video sequences. To this end, we introduce the core CFMR framework, which utilizes Spatio-Temporal co-regulation. This framework is subsequently enhanced (CFMR+) by integrating the VFM guidance strategy from C6, which provides high-quality spatial priors essential for ensuring both high spatial detail and inter-frame consistency. By enforcing both intra-frame and cross-frame consistency between these two streams, our method effectively propagates the sparse initial signal to generate dense and temporally coherent saliency masks. In conclusion, this thesis presents a comprehensive and cohesive investigation into label-efficient segmentation tasks, offering a suite of innovative and effective strategies for the ""sparse-to-dense'' challenge. Our work establishes a progressive roadmap that systematically overcomes architectural and semantic limitations, culminating in highly robust and generalized densification pipelines. Our extensive experimental results on standard benchmarks validate the state-of-the-art performance of these methods, providing robust solutions to a long-standing problem in the computer vision field."

OpenAlex,deep learning,Diseño y construcción de un sistema predictivo de congestión de tráfico basado en aprendizaje automático,Zehan Li,,2026-07-17,UPM Digital Archive (Technical University of Madrid),"Resumen: Este proyecto desarrolla un sistema de predicción de la intensidad del tráfico urbano mediante técnicas de aprendizaje profundo, con el objetivo de mejorar la toma de decisiones de movilidad. A diferencia de otras plataformas centradas en la visualización del estado actual, la solución propuesta busca anticipar comportamientos futuros, y se plantea como una alternativa abierta, replicable y específicamente orientada a la predicción. Para lograrlo, se ha diseñado una arquitectura modular basada en el lenguaje Python, capaz de integrar múltiples fuentes de datos abiertos: registros históricos del tráfico, datos históricos de situación meteorológica, y coordenadas espaciales de los sensores de medición. El sistema aplica un proceso de limpieza, interpolación temporal y transformación de variables, incluyendo la codificación cíclica del tiempo y la conversión espacial a coordenadas UTM, lo que permite una fusión precisa entre datos geográficos y meteorológicos mediante técnicas como la ponderación por distancia inversa (IDW). El modelo predictivo se basa en una red neuronal LSTM, especialmente adaptada para secuencias temporales multivariables. Se entrena utilizando una estrategia de ventana deslizante a 32 muestras (7 horas y 45 minutos) para predecir la intensidad de tráfico en el siguiente intervalo. El sistema incorpora además mecanismo de IterableDataset para manejar grandes volúmenes de datos de entrenamiento sin comprometer la estabilidad del entorno. Los resultados obtenidos muestran una precisión robusta en escenarios de validación, con errores de predicción (MAE y RMSE) aceptable. Además, se ha desarrollado una interfaz web interactiva, que permite el despliegue local del sistema, con capacidad de ingestión de datos en tiempo real y visualización directa de las predicciones. Ente trabajo demuestra la viabilidad técnica y operativa de aplicar aprendizaje profundo al análisis de tráfico urbano, y sienta las bases para su evolución futura hacia sistemas más generalizables, robustos y útiles en contexto reales de ciudad inteligente. Abstract This Project develops an urban traffic intensity prediction system using deep learning techniques, with the aim of improving mobility decision-making. Unlike other platforms focused on visualizing the current state, the proposed solution seeks to anticipate future behaviors, and is positioned as an open, replicable alternative specifically oriented towards prediction. To achieve this, a modular architecture based on the Python language has been designed, capable of integrating multiple open data sources: historical traffic records, historical weather situation data, and spatial coordinates of measurement sensors. The system applies a process of cleaning, temporal interpolation, and variable transformation, including cyclic encoding of time and spatial conversion to UTM coordinates, allowing for precise fusion between geographical and meteorological data through techniques such as inverse distance weighting (IDW). The predictive model is based on an LSTM neural network, especially adapted for multivariate time sequences. It is trained using a sliding window strategy of 32 samples (7 hours and 45 minutes) to predict traffic intensity in the next interval. The system additionally incorporates an IterableDataset mechanism to handle large volumes of training data without compromising the stability of the environment. The obtained results show robust accuracy in validation scenarios, with acceptable prediction errors (MAE and RMSE). Furthermore, an interactive web interface has been developed, allowing for the local deployment of the system, with the capacity for real-time data ingestion and direct visualization of predictions. This work demonstrates the technical and operational feasibility of applying deep learning to urban traffic analysis and lays the groundwork for its future evolution towards more generalizable, robust, and useful systems in real smart city contexts."
OpenAlex,deep learning,Deep Learning-Based Data Hiding Technique for Medical Images,Hadjer SAIDI,,2026-06-26,University of Biskra Theses Repository (University of Biskra),"This thesis introduces novel deep learning-based frameworks for secure medical image steganography, addressing the critical challenge of protecting sensitive patient information while preserving diagnostic quality. Medical images present unique security requirements due to their dual nature: containing both critical visual data for diagnosis and sensitive patient metadata, which conventional steganographic techniques do not adequately address. Our work presents two complementary approaches to this challenge. First, we develop a Mask-RCNN based framework that intelligently identifies diagnostically insignificant regions within medical images for strategic data embedding. By combining this regionaware detection with Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) embedding in the frequency domain, our method achieves remarkable imperceptibility with Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR) values exceeding 115 dB while maintaining high payload capacity. Second, we propose a clinical quality-aware convolutional neural network architecture that leverages an encoder-decoder framework for end-to-end steganography. This approach employs parallel processing paths with scaled residual learning to embed secret medical images within cover images while preserving diagnostic features. Extensive experimentation across multiple medical imaging modalities (CT, MRI) from datasets including MIDRC-RICORD-1B, and IQ-OTH/NCCD, demonstrates that our method achieves a good trade-off between payload and imperceptibility. The frameworks developed in this thesis achieve an optimal balance between embedding capacity, imperceptibility, and robust secret recovery, providing healthcare institutions with effective tools for safeguarding patient privacy while maintaining the integrity of medical diagnostics. This work significantly advances the field of medical image security and establishes a foundation for future innovations in secure healthcare information systems."
OpenAlex,deep learning,A Novel Deep-Learning-Based Approach for Estimating High-Resolution InSAR Parameters,"Dell Amore, Luca; Carcereri, Daniel; Demir, Begüm; Rizzoli, Paola",,2026-06-01,elib (German Aerospace Center),"Nowadays, SAR Interferometry (InSAR) represents one of the most powerful tools to perform complex tasks, such as retrieving Earth’s surface topography and monitoring its deformations. However, denoising strategies are crucial for the generation of reliable and high-quality InSAR products. In this framework, we propose a complete and generalized theoretical and statistical model to physically describe and simulate a noise-free interferogram, together with its corresponding noisy version, starting from the knowledge of the InSAR acquisition geometry and of the underlying topography. A deep-learning-based model is then trained in a fully-supervised manner to estimate high-resolution InSAR parameters, i.e. coherence and interferometric phase, leveraging the proposed statistical model. In particular, an accurate assessment of the network’s estimation performance is conducted by comparing it to state-of-the-art denoising filters, such as Boxcar and Phi-Net and showing the added value of the proposed theoretical modifications to the state-of-the-art literature."
