PubMed,aortic stenosis,1-Year Outcomes of TAVR With ACURATE neo2 vs SAPIEN/Evolut: A SWEDEHEART Target Trial Emulation Study.,Andreas Rück; Magnus Settergren; Nawzad Saleh; Ulrik Sartipy; Dinos Verouhis; Rickard Linder; Natalie Glaser; Michael Dismorr,10.1016/j.jcin.2025.09.025,2025-11-24,JACC. Cardiovascular interventions,"The ACURATE IDE trial demonstrated increased death, stroke, and rehospitalization at 1 year with ACURATE neo2 transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) devices compared with control devices, possibly caused by suboptimal pre- and postdilatation.
The aim of this study was to investigate clinical outcomes of TAVR with ACURATE neo2 vs control valves using rigorous pre- and postdilatation.
The nationwide SWEDEHEART (Swedish Web-System for Enhancement and Development of Evidence-Based Care in Heart Disease Evaluated According to Recommended Therapies) registry to emulate a target trial comparing TAVR with the ACURATE neo2 vs SAPIEN or Evolut in Sweden, using the same inclusion and exclusion criteria as the investigational device exemption trial. The primary outcome was mortality, stroke, and heart failure hospitalization combined at 1 year. Adjustment by balancing weighting was used.
The ACURATE neo2 was used in 644 patients (33%) and control prostheses in 1,299 patients (67%). With the ACURATE neo2, predilatation was used in 100% and postdilatation in 45% (n = 288). Balloons undersized ≤1 mm were used in 47% (n = 304) of the predilatations and 74% (n = 214) of the postdilatations with the ACURATE neo2. Median follow-up duration was 352 days (Q1-Q3: 193.5-365 days). There was no difference between the ACURATE neo2 and control at 12 months in the primary endpoint (adjusted HR: 0.97; 95% CI: 0.75-1.23), as individual outcomes, or for myocardial infarction, percutaneous intervention, or major bleeding. Within the ACURATE neo2 group, postdilatation was not significantly associated with adverse outcomes.
There was no difference in clinical outcomes at 1 year between the ACURATE neo2 and the Evolut or SAPIEN valves. The discrepancy with the investigational device exemption trial findings may be explained by more rigorous pre- and postdilatation."

Cardiovascular interventions,"Public reporting of transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) outcomes by U.S. News & World Report (USNWR) began in August 2020. The impact of these ratings on case selection has not been studied.
The aim of this study was to evaluate the impact of USNWR hospital TAVR ratings on patient risk profile.
Medicare fee-for-service beneficiaries undergoing TAVR at rated hospitals before and after the release of the USNWR ratings were identified. The causal effect of hospital ratings on patient risk profile (Elixhauser comorbidity score) was estimated using a difference-in-difference analysis comparing lower rated hospitals (average or below average) to high-performing hospitals.
There were 138,147 TAVR patients in the prerating period and 50,650 patients in the postrating period treated at 618 hospitals. Prior to ratings release, all hospitals had similar yearly trends in TAVR patient risk profile. After ratings release, patients treated at lower rated hospitals exhibited a significantly greater decline in Elixhauser comorbidity score compared with those treated at higher rated hospitals (difference-in-difference estimator = -0.48; 95% CI: -0.66 to -0.31; P < 0.0001). Similarly, although all hospitals exhibited declines in the number of high-risk TAVR cases (Elixhauser comorbidity score > 20), lower rated hospitals exhibited a significantly greater decline (incidence rate ratio: 0.56; 95% CI: 0.51-0.62; P < 0.0001).
Since 2020, there has been a substantial decline in the number of high-risk patients receiving TAVR across the United States, driven predominantly by hospitals that received lower USNWR TAVR ratings. This is likely, in part, driven by risk aversion, however, further research is required to understand the reasons behind this decline and identify mitigation strategies."

Cardiovascular interventions,"For patients with asymptomatic, severe aortic stenosis (AS), the EARLY TAVR (Evaluation of TAVR Compared to Surveillance for Patients With Asymptomatic Severe Aortic Stenosis) trial demonstrated that early transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) was superior to clinical surveillance (CS) with respect to the primary endpoint in the intention-to-treat population.
The aim of this study was to compare postprocedural outcomes in the valve implant population.
The valve implant population comprised patients randomized to early TAVR who underwent the procedure and those randomized to CS who underwent delayed aortic valve replacement (AVR). The impact of the clinical presentation at time of delayed AVR was also assessed as progressive valve syndrome (eg, NYHA functional class II) vs acute valve syndrome (AVS; eg, NYHA functional class III or IV, syncope). The primary outcome was the composite of death, stroke, or heart failure hospitalization 2 years postprocedure.
Across 75 sites, 97.6% of early TAVR patients (444 of 455) underwent the index procedure, and 87.0% of CS patients (388 of 446) underwent delayed AVR through 5 years; 39.2% presented with AVS and 58.5% with progressive valve syndrome (median time to delayed AVR 11.1 months). Early TAVR demonstrated a benefit compared with delayed AVR for the primary composite (adjusted HR [aHR]: 0.61; 95% CI: 0.38-0.99; P = 0.045). When examined by clinical presentation, delayed AVR with AVS was significantly associated with worse outcomes compared with early TAVR (aHR: 2.12; 95% CI: 1.19-3.78; P = 0.01), driven largely by stroke (aHR: 2.92; 95% CI: 1.26-6.76; P = 0.01).
Among patients with asymptomatic, severe AS, delayed AVR with AVS is associated with higher rates of death, stroke, or heart failure hospitalization compared with early TAVR, highlighting a benefit for early TAVR before symptoms develop given the unpredictability of AS progression.

Cardiovascular interventions,"The Valve Academic Research Consortium recently expanded its bleeding endpoint definition, recommending that any procedure-related blood loss should be classified as bleeding, even in the absence of a clinically evident source. However, the lack of specific reference thresholds for hemoglobin decline limits the ability to discriminate clinically relevant events and the prognostic utility of these criteria.
To evaluate the incidence, predictors, and prognostic implications of hemoglobin declines without overt bleeding in patients undergoing transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR).
In this multicenter study, 9,759 TAVR patients were stratified according to the presence or absence of overt bleeding during hospitalization. Among patients without overt bleeding, hemoglobin decrease was classified according to baseline and nadir in-hospital values as minimal (>1 and <3 g/dL), minor (≥3 and <5 g/dL), or major (≥5 g/dL). The median follow-up duration was 28 months (Q1-Q3: 12-48 months).
Hemoglobin decreases occurred in 5,645 patients (57.8%), classified as minimal in 79.1%, minor in 18.3%, and major in 2.6%. Female sex, dual antiplatelet therapy, chronic kidney disease, and higher baseline hemoglobin determined an increased risk for significant decline (P < 0.01 for all), whereas radial secondary access acted as a protective factor (P = 0.001). A major hemoglobin decline significantly increased 30-day mortality (adjusted HR [aHR]: 3.05; 95% CI: 1.15-8.96). At 1 year, both minor (aHR: 1.42; 95% CI: 1.09-1.86) and major (aHR: 1.85; 95% CI: 1.13-3.03) declines were independently associated with up to a 2-fold increase in mortality risk.
An in-hospital hemoglobin decrease ≥3 g/dL after TAVR, even in the absence of overt bleeding, was very common and independently associated with worse outcomes. Stratifying periprocedural hemoglobin loss may support early risk identification, guide postprocedural management, and refine future endpoint definitions."

Cardiovascular interventions,"Single antiplatelet therapy (SAPT) is the standard treatment after transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR). However, valve-in-valve TAVR to treat surgical bioprosthesis dysfunction carries an increased thrombotic risk and may benefit from more intensive antithrombotic treatment.
The aim of this study was to compare the outcomes of patients treated with dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) or SAPT in the first year after valve-in-valve TAVR.
Patients treated with valve-in-valve TAVR at 10 participating centers were included and grouped according to treatment with DAPT or SAPT, while those treated with oral anticoagulant therapy were excluded. Both clinical and echocardiographic outcomes were analyzed at 1-year follow-up. A propensity score was developed, then inverse probability of treatment weighting was applied in HR estimation to account for confounders.
A total of 278 patients were included. No differences between groups were observed for major adverse cardiac and cerebrovascular events (HR: 0.499, 95% CI: 0.182-1.371; P = 0.178), major bleeding (HR: 0.776; 95% CI: 0.172-3.504; P = 0.741), and death (HR: 0.907; 95% CI: 0.272-3.022; P = 0.874). Fewer strokes were observed in patients treated with DAPT (HR: 0.093; 95% CI: 0.010-0.831; P = 0.033). Additionally, there was no significant difference in moderate or severe structural valve deterioration (1.9% vs 6.0%; P = 0.161).
DAPT after valve-in-valve TAVR may be associated with a lower 1-year incidence of stroke, whereas no significant difference was observed for other major ischemic and bleeding outcomes or for premature valve deterioration."

Cardiovascular interventions,"Inflammation is common in response to transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR), resulting from endothelial damage, procedure-related hypoperfusion, and immunogenicity against the bioprosthesis. The systemic inflammatory response after TAVR comprises a spectrum ranging from asymptomatic biomarker elevation to dramatic clinical manifestations. Although local inflammation post-TAVR is part of physiological healing, a hyperinflammatory response increases the risk for conduction disturbances, new-onset atrial fibrillation, acute kidney injury, prolonged hospitalization, mortality, and subclinical leaflet thrombosis. Unfavorable monocyte and T helper cell signatures can predispose to worse outcomes in connection with hyperinflammation. Strategies are needed to control key drivers of hyperinflammation after TAVR (eg, avoiding prolonged hypotension during transcatheter aortic valve deployment, periprocedural colchicine or glucocorticoids, targeted monoclonal antibodies, a healthy gut microbiome) and to identify patients in whom modulation of inflammatory pathways may optimize outcomes. This review provides a detailed description of the epidemiology, pathophysiology, and consequences of the inflammatory response to TAVR and discusses emerging treatment pathways."

However, bleeding complications may require the administration of packed red blood cell units (PRBCs). The aim of this study was to investigate the prevalence of bleeding complications and PRBC administrations over the last 13 years, and their impact on long-term outcomes in patients with severe AS undergoing TAVI.
All patients undergoing TAVI in Switzerland have been consecutively included in a nationwide prospective registry, the Swiss TAVI Registry. PRBC-administration was tracked until hospital discharge. The primary outcome of the present analysis was all-cause mortality at five years. Secondary outcomes included all-cause mortality at one year, as well as in-hospital complications.
In total, 14'765 patients who underwent TAVI from 2011 to December 2023 were included. A total of 1411 patients (9.5%) received PRBCs during hospitalization. All-cause mortality was significantly higher among patients receiving PRBC at one year (16.8% vs. 8.4%, HR 2.1, 95% CI 1.8 - 2.5) and five years (58.5% vs. 44.2%, HR 1.67, 95% CI 1.5 - 1.8, p<0.001). PRBC was identified as an independent predictor of mortality at five years (aHR 1.20, 95%CI 1.10-1.32, p<0.001).
Bleeding complications remain prevalent in patients undergoing TAVI. Patients requiring PRBC-administration during their hospitalization for TAVI had a 1.5-fold higher mortality up to five years."

This systematic review and meta-analysis aim to synthesize available evidence to guide clinical decision-making. A systematic search of PubMed, Embase, and Web of Science was conducted. Risk ratios (RRs) and mean differences were pooled using a random-effects model. Thirteen studies comprising 2174 patients were included. BEVs were associated with a significantly higher risk of annulus rupture (RR = 3.00, 95% CI, 1.13-7.94, P = 0.03), while procedural and 30-day mortality rates were comparable between BEVs and SEVs. The need for new pacemaker implantation at 30 days was significantly lower in the BEV group (RR = 0.64, 95% CI, 0.49-0.83, P = 0.0009). Postdilation was reduced considerably with BEVs following sensitivity analysis (RR = 0.35, 95% CI, 0.24-0.52, P < 0.0001). In summary, both BEVs and SEVs demonstrated acceptable safety profiles, with BEVs carrying a higher risk of annular rupture but potential advantages in device success and postdilation rates. Large-scale randomized trials remain essential to refine patient selection and procedural strategies."

Materials and Methods: A retrospective analysis was conducted on 607 male patients (mean age: 72 years) who underwent prostate MRI between 2018 and 2023 at a single center. Two radiologists reviewed in consensus the scans for incidental findings during multiparametric MRI of the prostate. The findings were classified according to their clinical relevance, organ group and patient age. Results: Among 607 male patients (mean age: 72 years), 665 incidental findings were identified in 410 patients (67.5%; 95% CI 63.7-71.1). This corresponds to an average of 1.10 incidental findings per patient across the entire cohort. Of the 665 findings, 12 (1.8%; 95% CI 0.9-3.1) were classified as clinically significant. These included cases of sarcoma, rectal carcinoma, hydronephrosis, aortic aneurysm, avascular necrosis of the femoral head and high-grade disc protrusion with spinal canal stenosis and diverticulitis. Conclusions: Our data indicate that incidental findings are common in prostate mpMRI examinations; however, only a small proportion are clinically significant. This underscores the need for awareness of such findings, while avoiding unnecessary follow-up for those without clinical relevance."

To date, only a limited number of single-center studies have specifically addressed the untreated baseline aortic valve disease long-term progression and reoperation rate. Thus, we conducted a meta and landmark analysis to systematically review the issue. (2) Methods: This study investigated the long-term prognostic of baseline mild aortic valve disease in patients undergoing rheumatic mitral valve surgery, based on evidence from PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library, and Web of Science databases. (3) Results: Meta analysis revealed that patients with mild aortic valve disease had a higher risk of disease progression, with a 3.3-fold risk in the 0-5-year follow-up, which jumped to a hazard ratio of 6.42 in longer-term follow-up (5-25 years). Patients with aortic stenosis had an 8.37-fold risk of progression compared with aortic regurgitation and appeared to be poorly related to the time cut-off. Similarly, higher reoperation rates at long-term follow-up were seen in aortic stenosis patients. (4) Conclusions: This study suggests that patients with mild aortic valve disease at baseline have poorer long-term aortic valve-related progression and reoperation rates, especially aortic stenosis. For those with concomitant aortic stenosis, further investigation of the impact of lesion progression is warranted."

Pacemaker need in these patients ranges from 9.5% to 20%; however, its prevalence and clinical relevance in patients with unexplained cardiac conduction defects remain unclear.
This retrospective, single-center cohort study evaluated 1107 patients who underwent intracardiac device implantation for unexplained cardiac conduction defects between 2015 and 2024. Patients with secondary conduction defects or known cardiomyopathy were excluded. The prognostic value of the T-AMYLO score and associated red flag findings were assessed in relation to the composite primary endpoint: all-cause mortality, non-fatal myocardial infarction, and non-fatal stroke.
Over a median of 58 months for follow-up, 460 patients experienced a primary event, including 346 deaths. Higher event rates were observed in older males, those with atrioventricular block, and patients receiving single-lead ventricular devices. T-AMYLO score and the presence of red flag findings, particularly aortic valve disease, AV block, peripheral neuropathy, low voltages and increased septal thickness were significantly associated with adverse outcomes. Multivariate Cox regression identified elevated T-AMYLO score (HR: 1.06, p = 0.012), aortic valve disease (HR: 1.29, p = 0.016), and AV block (HR: 1.43, p = 0.009) as independent predictors of mortality. Survival analyses confirmed a stepwise decline in prognosis with an increasing T-AMYLO risk group and red flag burden (p < 0.001).
These findings highlight the importance of incorporating T-AMYLO scoring and red flags assessment in patients with conduction defects to improve early detection of cardiac amyloidosis and guide risk stratification for outcomes."

Candida species are the most common isolated pathogens involved in fungal endocarditis. Diagnosis is suspected in patients with underlying conditions such as cancer, myelodysplastic syndrome, diabetes, or intravascular catheters, where the modified Duke criteria apply. Management of the patient requires a multidisciplinary team (cardiologist, infectious diseases consultant, cardiac surgeon) along with antifungal treatment. We present the case of a 60-year-old male with biological prosthetic aortic valve replacement in the previous year for bicuspid aortic stenosis, admitted for a 5-day history of fever, nausea and minor urinary symptoms. The blood cultures were positive for Candida parapsilosis. Transthoracic cardiac ultrasound revealed a hypoechogenic mass attached to the aortic valve at the prosthetic fixation site. Although diagnosis was rapidly confirmed and treatment was administered shortly after first suspected, the patient developed, at first, cavernous sinus thrombosis and, later, fatal ST elevation myocardial infarction. The patient died despite efficient antifungal therapy, initially with Anidulafungin in monotherapy and later in combination with Fluconazole. The reported case emphasizes the importance of managing fungal endocarditis, the need for urgent diagnostic attention and multidisciplinary team approach by infectious diseases specialist, cardiologist, neurologist and heart surgeon."

This study aimed to assess whether plasma from patients with AS induces oxidative stress and contributes to valvular endothelial cells (VECs) dysfunction.
Human plasma samples were obtained from patients with severe AS (AS+, n=110), patients with cardiovascular risk factors without AS (n=30), and healthy individuals (n=15). Plasma levels of proinflammatory cytokines (IL [interleukin]-1β, IL-6, TNF [tumor necrosis factor]-α, and factor Xa [FXa]) were measured. Porcine aortic VECs were then incubated with plasma (10%, 24 hours). Oxidative stress levels were assessed using dihydroethidium staining, NO formation with 4-amino-5-methylamino-2',7'-difluororescein diacetate, mRNA expression by quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction, and protein expression levels by Western blot analyses. Platelets and monocytes adhesion as well as thrombin generation were determined. Different pharmacological inhibitors were used to explore the underlying pathways.
Plasma from patients with AS+ exhibited elevated levels of IL-1β, IL-6, TNF-α, and FXa activity. Incubation of VECs with AS+ plasma induced a pro-oxidant response mediated by proinflammatory cytokines, the angiotensin system-SGLT2 (sodium-glucose transport protein 2) pathway, and FXa. AS+ plasma also triggered VEC dysfunction, inflammation, monocytes and platelets adhesion, and thrombin generation. These detrimental effects were mitigated by empagliflozin, losartan, neutralizing antibodies targeting proinflammatory cytokines, and dabigatran and rivaroxaban.
Patients with AS displayed subclinical systemic inflammation and increased FXa activity. These processes contributed to aortic VEC dysfunction, inflammation, monocytes and platelets adhesion, and thrombin generation upon exposure to AS+ plasma."

Degenerative aortic valve stenosis (AVS), a prototypical cardiovascular age-related disorder resulting from calcification and inflammation processes for which no medical treatment is currently available, has become the subject of scientific research in this field. In this review we describe the clinical relevance of CHIP in patients with AVS, as well as its effects on left ventricular dysfunction and heart failure, particularly about compensatory hypertrophy and diastolic dysfunction assessed by echocardiographic parameters. CHIP-driver mutations DNMT3A and TET2 have been found in a third of all patients with severe AVS undergoing transcatheter aortic valve replacement in most studies; and several short-term and long-term studies have reported an increased mortality rate associated with the presence of CHIP in these patients. Additionally, we discuss potential mechanistic insights involving inflammatory pathways both from a clinical and from an experimental approach. These include primarily fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) analyses or single-cell RNA sequencing (sc-RNA-seq) analyses from circulating leukocytes of patients with AVS, showing an increase in proinflammatory interleukines, and analyses on valve tissue exhibiting higher transcript levels of immunoglobulins, as well as murine models mimicking the consequences of AVS that could shed some light on potential causal link between CHIP and AVS. Lastly, we summarize prospects for novel therapeutic strategies, with efforts focusing on developing both general and more specific inflammatory therapies targeting inflammatory pathways. Future research will need to assess the incidence and progression of milder stages of aortic stenosis and evaluate potential interactions with different types of acquired mutations."

Emergent balloon aortic valvuloplasty (BAV) is a treatment option for salvage and recent studies have reported that early release of valve obstruction by emergent BAV could improve prognosis. This study aimed to assess the efficacy and safety of emergent BAV for severe AS with cardiogenic shock.
Among 8,230 patients hospitalized for heart failure, 7924 patients with heart failure unrelated to severe AS were excluded. Among the remaining 306 patients, 256 patients who developed cardiogenic shock due to other causes except severe AS were further excluded. Finally, a total of 41 patients with severe AS in cardiogenic shock were enrolled and divided into the emergent (underwent BAV within 6 h of admission, n = 9) and non-emergent (underwent BAV more than 6 h after admission, n = 16) groups, after excluding 16 patients who did not undergo BAV. The primary endpoints were the 30-day mortality rate and procedural complications. The secondary endpoints were days to withdrawal from the mechanical support device, days to initial rehabilitation, and clinical frailty scale (CFS) score at discharge.
In the emergent group, the time from admission to BAV was 3.0 ± 1.4 h, whereas BAV was performed 4.5 days (median) after admission in the non-emergent group. The 30-day mortality rate was not significantly different between the emergent and non-emergent groups (0% vs. 25%, p = 0.260); furthermore, there was no statistically significant difference regarding the incidence of procedural complications (0% in the emergent vs. 12.5% in the non-emergent group, p = 0.520). The days to withdrawal from mechanical support device and to start rehabilitation were earlier in emergent group (2.9 ± 1.2 days vs. 7.8 ± 4.6 days; p = 0.008, 4.2 ± 1.9 days vs. 10.8 ± 6.5 days; p = 0.004). The CFS score at discharge in the emergent group was maintained compared to before admission (from 3.8 ± 1.0 to 3.9 ± 1.1; p = 0.347), whereas worsened in the non-emergent group (from 3.8 ± 0.9 to 4.6 ± 1.2; p = 0.032).
Emergent BAV for cardiogenic shock is feasible, and earlier BAV may support faster recovery and help prevent deterioration of frailty."

Evidence suggests that this should change to provide optimal long-term survival for this growing population. We reviewed our current practice in valve repair in congenital heart disease and analyzed its outcomes.
A total of 90 patients (30 semilunar valve, 60 atrioventricular valve) underwent valve repair between September 2020 and December 2024. Operative data and follow-up information were gathered retrospectively. Kaplan-Meier calculations were used for survival and freedom from reoperation analysis. Cox regression analysis was used to assess risk factors for mortality (single ventricle physiology, age and weight at time of surgery, bicuspid aortic valve, and complexity of repair). Complexity of repair was defined as the application of three or more repair techniques.
Estimated survival at 12 months for semilunar and AV valve groups was 95.2% and 95%, respectively. Estimated freedom from reoperation at 12 months for repair of semilunar and AV valves was 95.8% and 95.6%, respectively. Single ventricle morphology (HR: 5.2, 95% CI 1.3-20.8; p = 0.0198) and younger age at time of surgery (HR: 0.7, 95% CI 0.6-0.9; p = 0.0223) were associated with increased risk of mortality.
Valve repair in congenital heart disease provides reliable early outcomes in this complex population. The worst outcomes are expected in patients with single ventricle requiring surgery in early life."

Forty-two asymptomatic TOF patients who underwent preoperative cardiac catheterization at a median age of 4.7 months interquartile range [IQR], 4.0-5.3) between 2013 and 2023 were enrolled. Asymptomatic TOF was defined as room air oxygen saturation ≥85% without duct-dependent circulation. Left ventricular end-diastolic volume (LVEDV) as a percentage of predicted normal (LVEDV%N) was measured using the single-plane area-length method. Correlation with echocardiographic parameters was assessed.
The median LVEDV%N was 107% (IQR, 87.5-139.5). Five patients (11.6%) had LVEDV%N ≤80%. One patient with the lowest LVEDV%N (62%) underwent a modified Blalock-Taussig shunt instead of primary repair. The remaining four patients had a small pulmonary valve annulus (PVA) (Z-score -4.2 to -6.6) and underwent transannular patch repair. Seven additional patients underwent transannular patch repair due to total conal ventricular septal defect (n = 5) or patent ductus arteriosus with small PVA (n = 2). LVEDV%N showed a weak correlation with 1-month echocardiographic parameters (R2 = 0.27-0.347).
Left ventricular volume assessment prior to primary repair is essential in asymptomatic TOF patients. There were cases with small LV for whom primary repair was deferred, or whose PVA was also small; therefore, transannular patch repair was selected."

The principal focus of clinical surveillance and research is the aortic root aneurysm. However, with cardiovascular factors being the main sources of morbidity and mortality, they necessitate equal consideration. This narrative review provides a comprehensive overview of the pathophysiology, range of cardiac involvement, advancements in diagnosis, and therapeutic approaches. Certain forms of FBN1 mutations affect the risk and rate of progression of aortic root dilatation. Marfan syndrome is also characterized by valvular diseases, such as tricuspid and mitral valve prolapse, the latter of which may be an early indicator of serious pediatric illness. Independent of valvular disease, new data also indicate intrinsic cardiac dysfunction and an increased risk of ventricular arrhythmias. Echocardiography is used for diagnosis, and new measures such as the aortic root ratio improve screening for children. For the detection of mitral annular disjunction and myocardial fibrosis, cardiac magnetic resonance imaging is essential. Given the strong links between genotype and phenotype, genetic testing helps with risk stratification and verifies the diagnosis. Prophylactic aortic surgery based on predetermined thresholds, beta-blocker or angiotensin-receptor blocker medication, and lifelong observation are all part of management. This narrative review emphasizes that to enhance outcomes and quality of life for patients with Marfan syndrome, comprehensive cardiac treatment necessitates a multidisciplinary approach and vigilance for the complete range of cardiovascular sequelae."

Right ventricular dysfunction (RVD) has been observed in up to 22% of patients undergoing T-TEER. Currently, the determinants of RVD recovery are not sufficiently understood.
All patients in four German tertiary cardiac centers scheduled for T-TEER were included for analysis. Patients were divided according to concomitant RVD at the time of T-TEER. RVD was defined as impairment of either tricuspid plane systolic excursion (TAPSE) or right ventricular fractional area change (RV-FAC). The primary endpoint of the study was recovery from RVD during follow-up 3 months after T-TEER. Predictors of RVD recovery were identified via univariable and multivariable logistic regression analyses.
A total of 105 patients were included. Concomitant RVD was present in 43.8% of the patients (46/105). Recovery from RVD was observed in 47.8% (22/46) of patients, particularly in patients with mild RVD at baseline according to the TAPSE. A sufficient reduction in tricuspid valve regurgitation to mild severity likewise constituted a predictor of RVD recovery and emerged as a surrogate parameter of reduced right ventricular volume overload.
Recovery from RVD was most likely in patients who presented with mild RVD and a sufficient reduction in tricuspid valve regurgitation to mild severity according to T-TEER. Early identification and interventional treatment of today's patients with high-grade tricuspid valve regurgitation and RVD represent key factors in providing relief for this particular cohort of patients."

Although intravenous (IV) iron supplementation is well studied in HF with reduced ejection fraction, its impact on coexisting significant valvular disease remains poorly understood.
A 67-year-old female with a known history of coronary artery disease, diabetes, hypertension, hypothyroidism, and chronic kidney disease presented with exertional breathlessness and fatigue. Workup revealed severe anemia (hemoglobin 6.1 gm/dL), reduced left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF 45%), severe mitral regurgitation (MR), and mild tricuspid regurgitation (TR). She was managed conservatively with IV iron and two units of leukocyte-depleted packed red blood cells (LD PRBCs). Over the next few days, the patient experienced marked clinical improvement. Repeat echocardiography demonstrated normalization of LVEF, downgrading of MR severity from severe to mild, regression of TR, and complete resolution of pericardial effusion. Her hemoglobin improved to 8.0 gm/dL.
This case underscores the role of severe anemia as a modifiable factor contributing to cardiac dysfunction, including reversible valvular insufficiency and reduced systolic performance. Restoration of hemoglobin levels led to significant clinical and echocardiographic recovery, pointing to anemia as a potential therapeutic target in such cases. The use of IV iron proved beneficial in facilitating this improvement.
In older patients with multiple comorbidities and new or worsening cardiac dysfunction, severe anemia should be considered a treatable cause. Early diagnosis and targeted therapy using IV iron and transfusion can result in substantial clinical gains and may help avoid unnecessary invasive procedures."

Phase I/II resulted in 27 candidate criteria organized into six clinical and laboratory domains. Here, we summarize early Phase III efforts to better define and structure candidate criteria within clinical and laboratory domains.
Using comprehensive literature reviews and expert consensus, domain subcommittees developed definitions for candidate criteria. Prevalence information was incorporated when available. Definitions were finalized and approved by the Steering Committee for future use during real-world case collection (derivation cohort), multi-criteria decision analysis, and validation. Clinical domain items defined were: (a) macrovascular thrombosis (venous thromboembolism including superficial venous thrombosis, arterial thrombosis, and transient ischemic attack) and associated provoking risk factors; (b) microvascular disease (livedo racemosa, livedoid vasculopathy, antiphospholipid-antibody-nephropathy, diffuse alveolar hemorrhage, cardiac microthrombosis, adrenal hemorrhage, and acute ischemic encephalopathy); (c) pregnancy morbidity (pre-fetal death, fetal death, and pre-eclampsia and placental insufficiency with severe features); (d) cardiac valve disease (thickening or vegetation); and (e) thrombocytopenia. Laboratory domain items defined were coagulation-based functional assay (lupus anticoagulant) and solid phase-based assays (anticardiolipin antibody IgG/M and anti-β2-Glycoportein-I antibody IgG/M). Based on comprehensive literature review and Steering Committee consensus, we defined and structured APS clinical and laboratory domains. Preliminary definitions were subsequently evaluated and confirmed in late Phase III using the derivation cohort and multicriteria decision analysis prior to validation the 2023 ACR/EULAR APS Classification Criteria."

Historically neglected and often misclassified as functional, primary TR has recently gained attention due to advances in multimodality imaging and increased awareness of its pathophysiological complexity and adverse outcomes. A major challenge that remains is the accurate diagnosis of primary TR, as well as the optimal timing for intervention, particularly in asymptomatic patients. While surgical repair or replacement has been the traditional approach, recent developments in transcatheter therapies, such as tricuspid edge-to-edge repair, have broadened the therapeutic landscape for patients considered at high surgical risk. In this context, personalized medicine has emerged as a central paradigm in the management of this valvular disease. Tailored therapeutic decisions should include anatomical, functional, and clinical parameters, as well as patient-specific risk factors such as age and comorbidities. Advanced imaging modalities, including 3D echocardiography and cardiac magnetic resonance, are essential for guiding this individualized approach. This review summarizes the current understanding of the etiology, pathophysiology, diagnostic tools, and treatment strategies for primary TR, highlighting the critical role of personalized treatment pathways in optimizing clinical outcomes."

It contributes to coronary artery disease (CAD) through local inflammation, while its metabolic activity, including the expression of uncoupling protein-1 (UCP-1) and incretin receptors (GLP-1R, GIPR), may exert protective effects. The relationship between EAT immunohistochemical features and imaging-derived volume remains unclear.
We prospectively studied 50 patients undergoing cardiac surgery: 25 with CAD undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting and 25 without CAD undergoing valve replacement. EAT samples were immunohistochemically stained for CD3, CD68, MPO, UCP-1, GLP-1R, and GIPR. Preoperative CT was used to quantify EAT volume.
Patients with CAD more frequently had higher CD3 immunopositivity compared to the control group (84.0 vs. 58.3%, p = 0.047), with no difference in MPO and CD68 immunoexpression. UCP-1 expression was elevated in CAD patients (p = 0.004), whereas GLP-1R and GIPR immunopositivity were similar. EAT volume did not differ between CAD and non-CAD patients (102.87 cm3 vs. 99.38 cm3, p = 0.964) but correlated modestly with BMI (rs = 0.325, p = 0.021). UCP-1 and GLP-1R immunopositivity, as well as larger LVEDD (left ventricular end-diastolic diameter), were positively associated with greater EAT volume.

PH was verified by right heart catheterization before defect correction. In 26 patients with MV defect and PH and 12 patients without PH, intraoperative lung tissue puncture biopsy samples were collected to assess changes in the lung parenchyma and microvasculature.Results    In patients with MV defect and PH, the condition of arterioles was characterized by a larger area of intimal hyperplasia and predominantly the presence of thrombosis (34.6%). In patients with MV defect without PH, partial thrombosis of arterioles was more often found (41.66%), and plethoric arterioles were observed in 41.66%. During morphometry of pulmonary vessels, it was noted that the a calculated systolic pressure in the pulmonary artery of &gt;38 mm Hg according to preoperative echocardiography (EchoCG) had a moderate inverse correlation with the area of the vascular wall (Kendall's rank correlation coefficient tau (τ) = -0.34; p=0.01) and a moderate direct association with the greatest thickness at the site of arteriolar intimal hyperplasia (τ = 0.39; p = 0.04). A moderate inverse correlation was found between the systolic excursion of the tricuspid valve annulus (1.7 cm or more) and the greatest thickness at the site of arteriolar intimal hyperplasia (τ= -0.47; p=0.04). MV stenosis was associated with the presence of thrombosed capillaries (odds ratio (OR) 8.75; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.1-69.5; p=0.029) and focal interstitial fibrosis (OR 10.66; 95% CI 0.89-126.78; p=0.046).

This condition is associated with delayed diagnosis and high comorbidity burden since patients often present at a younger age with advanced disease. Echocardiography plays a central role in identifying structural abnormalities and prognostic markers. This study aimed to evaluate the clinical and echocardiographic profile of patients with HFrEF and assess outcome predictors in a tertiary care center.
A retrospective observational study was conducted at Madras Medical College from May 2024 to May 2025, including 75 patients diagnosed with HFrEF (left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) ≤40%). Clinical data on demographics, comorbidities, and New York Heart Association (NYHA) functional class were collected along with echocardiographic parameters such as left ventricular dimensions, diastolic dysfunction, valvular lesions, right ventricular function, and pulmonary artery systolic pressure (PASP). Outcomes assessed included mortality, hospital stay, and readmission.
The mean age was 58.4 ± 11.2 years, with males comprising 45 patients (60%). Hypertension (42 patients, 56%), diabetes (36 patients, 48%), and ischemic cardiomyopathy (39 patients, 52%) were predominant. Most patients presented in NYHA class III or IV (55 patients, 73%). Echocardiography revealed a mean LVEF of 31.6 ± 5.8, LV dilatation in 48 patients (64%), diastolic dysfunction in 60 patients (80%), and moderate-to-severe mitral regurgitation in 25 patients (33%). Patients with EF <25% had significantly higher mortality (five patients, 15%) and readmission (10 patients, 29%) rates. PASP >40 mmHg independently predicted readmissions, while right ventricular dysfunction and mitral regurgitation were associated with adverse outcomes on univariate analysis.
This study highlights that severe left ventricular dysfunction and elevated PASP are strong prognostic markers in HFrEF. Comprehensive echocardiographic evaluation is essential for risk stratification, and early intervention is crucial to improve outcomes in Indian patients with HFrEF."

These parameters need to be considered when cut-off values indicating the need for&#x0D; treatment or even surgery are established. The aim of present work is to study the relation of&#x0D; weight of the heart with age and weight of cadaver.&#x0D; Material and Methods: The study was performed in the Department of Anatomy, Shri Ram&#x0D; Murti Smarak Institute of Medical Sciences, Bareilly on 30 hearts from embalmed cadavers.&#x0D; The hearts were procured from the cadavers available in our department. The heart was&#x0D; thoroughly cleaned and measurements were taken.&#x0D; Results: The mean heart weight was 223.37 ± 57.78 g. Significant relationship between age of&#x0D; the cadaver and weight of the heart (p=0.0004), weight of cadaver and weight of heart&#x0D; (p=0.0001) was observed.&#x0D; Conclusion: The above study provides valuable data of the heart in our geographical location,&#x0D; which may be useful for cardiac surgeons and physicians."
