Advances,"Patients undergoing transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) have a high risk of adverse cardiovascular outcomes due to comorbid conditions such as congestive heart failure (CHF). Recent trials show promising results of sodium glucose co-transporter 2 inhibitors in CHF patients.
In this observational cohort study, we aim to explore the cardiovascular outcomes of SGLT2 inhibitors vs standard care in CHF patients undergoing TAVR using a large research network database.
A retrospective cohort analysis of deidentified, aggregate patient data from the TriNETX research network was conducted. Subjects with CHF who underwent a TAVR procedure, were ≥18 years old, and received either SGLT2 inhibitors or standard of care were included in the analysis. After propensity score matching, outcomes were reported at 6-month and 1-year follow-up. The primary outcome was a composite of acute myocardial infarction, stroke, all-cause mortality, and acute CHF.
A total of 21,828 CHF patients undergoing TAVR were identified, of whom 2,464 were on SGLT2 inhibitors therapy. Following propensity score matching, 2,039 patients were included in each group. The primary composite outcome was not statistically different at 6 months among patients receiving SGLT2 inhibitors compared to those receiving standard care (HR: 0.79; P = 0.067). SGLT2 inhibitors use was associated with a significantly lower risk of acute myocardial infarction (HR: 0.69; P = 0.043) and all-cause hospitalization/emergency room visits (HR: 0.69; P < 0.001). At 1 year, no significant differences were observed for the primary and individual endpoints except for all-cause hospitalizations (HR: 0.73; P < 0.001) and urinary tract infections (HR: 0.77; P = 0.009).
Among CHF patients undergoing TAVR, SGLT2i use was not associated with a reduced risk of the primary composite outcome at 6-months and 1-year intervals."

The relevance of this signal to long-term prognosis remains unclear. We aim to assess predictors of long-term mortality with focus on diffuse fibrosis.
Single-centre prospective observational cohort study of patients with severe, symptomatic AS undergoing AVR. Patients were assessed using echocardiography, high-sensitivity cardiac troponin T (hs-cTnT), N-terminal pro-B type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) and CMR including T1 mapping for ECV% quantification. All-cause mortality was identified using the NHS National Spine Database. Univariable and multivariable Cox regression models were fitted to assess all-cause mortality associations. 168 patients (age 72 [65-77] years, 55% male) underwent CMR. Over a follow-up period of 9.7 (6.8-10.9) years, 76 deaths occurred. Patients who died had higher ECV% (29.9% vs 27.6%, p=0.014) and greater LGE (3.9% vs 2.0%, p=0.013). Univariable predictors of mortality were age, atrial fibrillation (AF), left atrial area, left atrial volume, total cholesterol, triglycerides, HDL:LDL ratio, non-bicuspid aortic valve, hs-cTnT, NT-proBNP, EuroSCORE II and ECV%. On multivariable regression, age, AF and ECV% remained significant predictors of mortality, independently of sex. AIC indicated that the model with four covariates was preferable to the one also including EuroSCORE II and coronary artery disease, and this result was confirmed by a likelihood ratio test (p=0.387).
In the longest follow-up cohort of T1 mapping in severe AS, we demonstrate diffuse fibrosis remains an independent predictor of long-term mortality. Integration of ECV% in baseline risk stratification should be explored further in patients with AS undergoing AVR."

Adults with successfully treated COA exhibit significantly higher incidence of hypertension. The objective of this study was to measure differences in the structure and mechanics of proximal and distal aortic tissue from the first age-appropriate, physiologically relevant growing porcine model of COA. This animal model also enabled the evaluation of a cutting-edge serially dilatable stent. Quantitative histologic analysis measured structural changes and the mechanical properties were investigated through uniaxial, shear lap, and peel tests of tissue from sham, control COA, and treated COA animals. Our original hypothesis that proximal aortic tissue from control and treated COA groups would be thicker and have less elastin was false. There were no significant differences in elastin content, collagen content, lumen area, or lumen-to-tissue area between groups. Mechanically, distal tissue also exhibited no difference in either uniaxial or shear lap stiffness, failure stress, or failure strain between groups. Distal tissue from the COA control and treated COA groups however, exhibited, a lower circumferential failure peel tension, suggesting interlamellar strength was reduced. When compared with other previously published animal models of COA, a clear distinction was timing - our growing porcine model is the first for which COA was induced and treated at physiologically relevant time points. Our results indicated minimal adverse vascular remodeling in either the COA control or treated COA groups, however, it is unclear if this was due to a lack of severity, if elastinogenesis compensated for damage, or if another unknown mechanism prevented remodeling. STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCE: Coarctation of the aorta is one of the most common congenital heart diseases, yet the mechanisms behind it and its associated comorbidities remain poorly understood. To our knowledge, this was the first study to characterize tissue from a growing porcine model, with coarctation induced and treated at a physiologically relevant ages. Additionally, we investigated a new and emerging technology to treat coarctation and correlated the mechanical characterization of the aortic tissue with structural changes observed via quantitative histologic analysis."
PubMed,aortic stenosis,Psychometric properties of health-related quality of life patient reported outcome measures for common cardiovascular conditions: a scoping review and COSMIN analysis.,Asad Bhatty; Adam B Smith; Martijn Scherrenberg; Mohammad Haris; Chris Wilkinson; Chris P Gale; Theresa Munyombwe,10.1093/eurjcn/zvaf217,2026-01-18,European journal of cardiovascular nursing,"Health-related quality of life (HRQoL) is an important measure of disease status and represents a holistic approach to delivering patient-centered care. We conducted a scoping review of HRQoL patient reported outcome measures (PROMs) for cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) and evaluated their psychometric properties.
Randomized trials and observational studies that developed and validated HRQoL PROMs for adults with ischaemic heart disease (IHD), aortic stenosis (AS), atrial fibrillation (AF), heart failure (HF), or generic CVD were included, published from inception of databases to 8 February 2025 using PubMed, Web of Science, and Embase. Independent reviewers selected and extracted the psychometric properties of each PROM in accordance with the Consensus-based Standards for the selection of health Measurement Instruments (COSMIN) checklist: content validity, reliability, internal consistency, structural validity, criterion/convergent, cross-cultural validity, measurement error, hypothesis testing, and responsiveness. Each PROM was graded using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation approach. Of 9430 articles, 220 studies for 38 different PROMs were included (HF n = 17, 45%; AF n = 11, 29%; IHD n = 7, 18%; generic n = 2, 5%; AS n = 1, 3%). Eleven PROMs (29%) satisfied all nine COSMIN criteria; the majority (n = 19, 50%) required further validation and eight were deemed inadequate for clinical use (21%).
This scoping review of HRQoL PROMs in individuals with common CVDs found evidence that many PROMs do not fulfill all nine COSMIN criteria for methodological quality, and for some CVDs there is a limited choice of suitable PROMs for HRQoL measurement. There is an opportunity to improve HRQoL evaluation for use within routine care and research."

There have been recent publications regarding improved diagnostic criteria for apical hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, shift towards ""excessive trabeculations"" rather than historically termed non-compaction, and expanding knowledge of arrhythmogenic cardiomyopathies. Exercise induced cardiac remodeling can be mistaken for these pathologies, among others. As the evaluation of cardiomyopathies changes with the growing understanding of the pathology, it is important that these updates are compared to the potential physiologic adaptation seen in athletic training. It is imperative for the practicing cardiologist to remain knowledgeable of these evolving guidelines."

Given that women are more frequently referred for TAVI, clarifying the role of sex in procedural outcomes is clinically relevant.
To systematically evaluate and summarise randomised clinical trial (RCT) evidence comparing TAVI outcomes between women and men.
A systematic review was conducted following Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines and registered in PROSPERO (CRD42024510202). PubMed, EMBASE and Web of Science were searched for English-language RCTs up to 1 July 2024. Studies comparing TAVI outcomes by sex were included. The primary outcome was all-cause mortality. Secondary outcomes included cardiovascular mortality, stroke or transient ischaemic attack (TIA), major bleeding and permanent pacemaker implantation (PPI). Pooled ORs were calculated using Mantel-Haenszel random-effects models.
14 RCTs with a total of 15 225 participants were included. No overall difference in all-cause mortality was observed between sexes (OR: 0.83; 95% CI 0.65 to 1.06), though a significant protective effect for female sex was found among intermediate-risk patients (OR: 0.64; 95% CI 0.49 to 0.84; I²=0%). Women had a significantly higher risk of major bleeding (OR: 1.35; 95% CI 1.21 to 1.52; I²=15%). No significant sex-based differences were identified in cardiovascular mortality (OR: 0.98), stroke/TIA (OR: 0.96) or PPI (OR: 1.05).
Female sex was associated with a lower all-cause mortality among intermediate-risk patients undergoing TAVI, but also with a higher overall risk of major bleeding. These findings suggest the need for further investigation into sex-related anatomical and procedural factors.

Despite this, aortic valve replacement rates remain low for patients with severe AS due to challenges in identifying clinically significant AS in time. This has prompted the need to develop and investigate novel diagnostic modalities. The objective of this study was to develop and validate novel, non-invasive diagnostic algorithm leveraging seismocardiography (SCG) data to detect severe AS.
A device capable of collecting a single-lead ECG and a three-dimensional SCG signal using a microelectromechanical-based accelerometer was used to collect sensor data. Phase 1 data were collected for training and validation of an algorithm for AS detection. Phase 2 data were collected as a blinded independent test set with age-matched and sex-matched patients as controls.
In phase 1 of the study, 115 subjects (n=56 AS patients and n=59 controls; mean age 73.8±10.4 years) were collected for training and validation of an algorithm for AS detection. Once model development was complete, the frozen model was then evaluated in a fully independent, single blinded phase 2 cohort of 99 subjects (n=50 AS patients and n=49 controls; mean age 76.8±6.4 years) for final analysis. The algorithm accurately classified 89 out of 99 patients, with four true AS cases misclassified as controls and six true control cases misclassified as AS. The sensitivity, specificity and area under the curve of the model were 92% (95% CI 84.5% to 99.5%), 87.8% (95% CI 78.6% to 96.9%), and 96% (95% CI 91.9% to 99.9%), respectively.
This SCG-based algorithm to detect severe AS demonstrated high sensitivity and specificity when tested in a blinded, age-matched and sex-matched cohort. These findings suggest that this technology may hold potential as a low-cost diagnostic tool for the detection of AS."

While a subset of AVSc patients progresses to AS, reported rates vary widely. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to better define the natural history of AVSc progression.
Following Preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses (PRISMA) guidelines, we searched PubMed, Scopus and Web of Science through July 2025 for observational studies reporting AS development in AVSc patients. Primary outcomes were progression to any degree of AS and to severe AS. Pooled event rates were calculated using a random-effects model. Heterogeneity and publication bias were assessed using standard statistical methods. Meta-regression explored associations with clinical and demographic variables.
Eight studies (n=12 388 patients) reported on the progression of AVSc patients to any AS stage, and nine studies (n=19 486 patients) on the progression to severe AS. Over a median follow-up of 4.0 years, 14.1% of AVSc patients progressed to any AS stage (effect size: 0.14; 95% CI 0.02 to 0.53), and 2.0% to severe AS (effect size: 0.02; 95% CI 0.003 to 0.094). Heterogeneity was high, but no publication bias was detected. Meta-regression found no significant predictors of progression.
Approximately one in six AVSc patients progresses to AS within 4 years, and 2% develop a severe disease. These findings underscore the importance of structured echocardiographic surveillance and support AVSc as a clinically relevant marker of systemic cardiovascular risk."

This study aimed to evaluate the prognostic impact of overall calcification burden in patients with severe AS undergoing AVR.
A retrospective analysis of 313 patients with severe AS undergoing CCT before AVR between 2016 and 2019 was conducted. MAC, CAC, AVC were quantified using established scoring methods. For TAC, a total thoracic aortic (TTA) score was developed by evaluating calcifications in the ascending, descending and aortic arch. MAC, CAC, AVC, and TTA were integrated into a comprehensive scoring system, the New Total Calcium (NTC) score, using Random Forest models. Outcomes considered included MACE, all-cause mortality, and non-cardiovascular mortality over a 60-month follow-up.
Among 313 patients (mean age 81 years), 93% underwent transcatheter AVR. Severe CAC and MAC were observed in 11% and 7.7% of patients, respectively. During follow-up, 48% of patients died, with non-cardiovascular deaths accounting for 34% and MACE occurring in 43%. In this predominantly TAVR population, the TTA score predicted MACE (p = 0.01), all-cause mortality (p = 0.01), and non-cardiovascular mortality (p = 0.005). The NTC score demonstrated high prognostic accuracy for MACE at 1-, 2-, and 3-years, with AUC values of 0.91, 0.80, and 0.81, respectively. Validation in an external cohort of 100 patients confirmed its robustness.
In this predominantly transcatheter AVR cohort, the NTC score is a promising tool for risk stratification in patients with severe AS. These findings are primarily applicable to transcatheter AVR patients, and further validation in SAVR populations is warranted."

Despite its high prevalence, affecting an estimated 20% of Canadians, Lp(a) remains under-recognized and under-measured in clinical practice. This paper provides guidance on the assessment and management of Lp(a) in primary and secondary prevention in the Canadian context. It outlines when and how to measure Lp(a), with a recommendation for universal, one-time testing in adulthood. The paper summarizes the pathophysiologic role of Lp(a) in promoting atherosclerosis, thrombosis, and AS, and highlights significant ethnic variability in Lp(a) levels and associated risk. It also addresses the limitations of existing cardiovascular risk calculators that omit Lp(a) and discusses the potential role of emerging imaging and treatment strategies, including novel Lp(a)-lowering therapies. Special attention is given to clinical interpretation of Lp(a) values, the role of cascade screening in families and recommendations for preventive interventions, with an emphasis on current approaches for managing patients with elevated Lp(a) while awaiting the availability of targeted therapies. The goal of this paper is to support clinicians in identifying at-risk individuals earlier and guiding appropriate risk reduction strategies in primary and secondary prevention settings."

This single-center observational study (Zhongshan Hospital, China; Oct 2024-Apr 2025) enrolled 72 symptomatic oHCM patients (NYHA II/III, LVEF ≥ 55%, resting/Valsalva-provoked LVOT gradient [LVOTG] ≥ 30 mmHg). All patients initiated mavacamten 2.5 mg once daily. Doses were adjusted at Weeks 4, 8, and 12 based on LVEF and LVOTG. Primary outcomes were changes in resting/provoked LVOTG, NT-proBNP, and NYHA class at Week 12. Safety outcomes included LVEF < 50%, cardiac hospitalization, and death.Significant reductions from baseline to Week 12 were observed: Resting LVOTG (52.4 ± 28.7 to 32.1 ± 23.1 mmHg, p < 0.001), Valsalva-provoked LVOTG (74.1 ± 24.4 to 48.7 ± 25.4 mmHg, p < 0.001), NT-proBNP (1102.7 ± 1114.9 to 320.2 ± 406.2 pg/mL, p < 0.001). LVEF remained stable. NYHA class improved by ≥ 1 class in 83.3% (60/72) of patients.Subgroup analyses revealed significantly greater LVOTG reductions in patients with classic HCM (vs. apical HCM, p < 0.001) and high baseline resting LVOTG (≥ 50 mmHg vs. < 50 mmHg, p < 0.001/p = 0.04). NYHA improvement was consistent across subgroups.Twenty-two patients escalated to 5 mg at Week 12, achieving further significant LVOTG reductions (p < 0.001), particularly in apical HCM and high-baseline-gradient subgroups, with stable LVEF.No safety events occurred (LVEF < 50%, arrhythmias, hospitalization, and death). Four patients reported transient minor adverse events (dizziness, nausea, and fatigue).
In this first Chinese real-world study, initiating mavacamten at 2.5 mg significantly improved haemodynamics (LVOTG), biomarkers (NT-proBNP), and functional status (NYHA) in oHCM patients over 12 weeks with an excellent safety profile. Greater haemodynamic efficacy was observed in classic HCM and high-baseline-gradient patients. Escalation to 5 mg provided additional benefit. Mavacamten is an effective and safe therapy for oHCM in this Asian population."

Prosthetic valve stenosis is a life-threatening condition and can significantly alter the maternal and fetal outcome without treatment. We report a case of a pregnant woman with twin gestation who developed prosthetic valve stenosis due to pannus formation and requiring redo AVR.
A 31-year-old woman, pregnant with dichorionic diamniotic twins at 14 weeks, presented with worsening dyspnea. She had undergone mechanical AVR at 11 years of age and was on warfarin; however, she stopped taking warfarin since 2014. Echocardiography revealed prosthetic aortic valve stenosis, with severely elevated transvalvular gradients. She underwent redo AVR with a 21 mm On-X mechanical valve following aortic root enlargement. Postoperatively, she developed complete atrioventricular dissociation, requiring a permanent pacemaker. Multidisciplinary care ensured fetal viability, and she was discharged in stable condition with appropriate anticoagulation management.
Redo AVR during pregnancy requires meticulous planning, balancing maternal and fetal risks. This case highlights the complexities of anticoagulation strategies, surgical execution, and maternal-fetal monitoring.
A multidisciplinary approach is essential to optimize outcomes in pregnant patients undergoing redo AVR. Long-term follow-up is crucial for continued surveillance of prosthetic valve function and maternal health."

The Naples Prognostic Score (NPS), which integrates inflammatory and nutritional markers, has shown promise in cardiovascular disease prognosis. This study investigated the relationship between preprocedural NPS and 30-day mortality in patients undergoing TAVI.
This retrospective, single-center study analyzed 308 patients aged ≥ 65 years who underwent elective transfemoral TAVI between August 2012 and December 2022. NPS was calculated using the neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio, lymphocyte-to-monocyte ratio, serum albumin, and total cholesterol levels. Patients were stratified into low NPS (0-2) and high NPS (3-4) groups. The primary endpoint was 30-day all-cause mortality.
The mean age was 79.81 +- 7.68 years, and 54.9% patients were female. The high NPS group comprised 191 patients (62.0%), while 117 patients (38.0%) were in the low NPS group. Thirty-day mortality was significantly higher in patients with high NPS (16.8% vs. 4.3%, P < 0.001), representing nearly a four-fold increased risk. NPS demonstrated good discriminative ability for mortality prediction (area under the curve: 0.692, 95% confidence interval: 0.611-0.774, P < 0.001), performing comparably to established surgical risk scores. Independent predictors of mortality included age (odds ratio [OR] 1.067, P = 0.039), neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (OR 1.062, P = 0.048), and pulmonary artery pressure (OR 1.039, P = 0.006).
The Naples Prognostic Score is a significant predictor of early mortality following TAVI and offers a simple, readily available tool for preoperative risk stratification. Patients with high NPS may benefit from enhanced perioperative monitoring and targeted interventions."

In the Fractional Flow Reserve versus Angiography for Multivessel Evaluation 2 trial, patients with hemodynamically significant stenoses (fractional flow reserve (FFR) ≤ 0.80) were randomized to receive FFR-guided percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) plus medical therapy (n = 447) or medical therapy alone (n = 441). At 5 years, FFR-guided PCI reduced the risk of the primary composite outcome of time to death, myocardial infarction or urgent revascularization, largely because of fewer urgent revascularizations. We now report the long-term clinical outcomes from this trial. Sixteen hospitals, contributing 748 randomized patients (161 women, 21.5%), participated in the long-term follow-up. The primary composite outcome was analyzed hierarchically using the unstratified win ratio, which addressed differential missingness of data on nonfatal outcomes in deceased patients by prioritizing comparisons on time to death. At a median follow-up of 11.2 years, the primary endpoint occurred in 150 of 447 patients (33.6%) in the PCI group versus 182 of 441 (41.3%) in the medical therapy group. PCI was superior in 29.2% of comparisons, medical therapy in 23.3%, and the two groups were tied in 47.5%, resulting in a win ratio of 1.25 in favor of PCI (95% confidence interval (CI) 1.01-1.56, P = 0.043). The corresponding win difference was 5.9% (95% CI 0.2-11.6), and the number needed to treat was 17 (95% CI 9-500). Win ratios were 0.88 for all-cause death (95% CI 0.66-1.17), 1.50 for myocardial infarction (95% CI 0.98-2.31) and 4.57 for urgent revascularization (95% CI 2.53-8.24). During long-term follow-up, FFR-guided PCI in patients with stable CAD and hemodynamically significant stenoses reduced the composite of death, myocardial infarction or urgent revascularization, primarily because of fewer urgent revascularizations. These long-term findings reaffirm the efficacy of FFR-guided PCI over medical therapy in patients with stable CAD. ClinicalTrials.gov registration: NCT06159231 ."

Methods: This was a retrospective cohort study. A total of 96 fetuses diagnosed with CPS-IVS or PA-IVS at the Women and Children's Hospital, Qingdao University between July 2018 and June 2021 were included. Fetuses who did not undergo FPV constituted the modeling cohort, while those who underwent FPV constituted the validation cohort. Fetuses were classified into biventricular and non-biventricular circulation groups based on postnatal circulatory outcomes, and prenatal fetal echocardiographic parameters were compared. Inter-group comparisons were performed using the t test, Mann-Whitney U test, χ2 test or Fisher exact test. Based on inter-group differences, parameters associated with postnatal circulatory outcomes were screened in the modeling cohort. For continuous variables, optimal cut-off values were determined using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves and the Youden index and then dichotomized. Right ventricular endocardial fibroelastosis (EFE) was graded as 0, 1 or 2 according to severity. OR of each parameter were calculated, and a multiparametric scoring system was constructed. ROC curves were used to evaluate its predictive performance. Post-FPV outcome improvement was assessed in the validation cohort. Results: Among the 96 fetuses, 78 were assigned to the modeling cohort and 18 to the validation cohort. Postnatally, biventricular circulation was achieved in 56 cases (72%) in the modeling cohort and 13 cases in the validation cohort. In the modeling cohort, the right ventricular long-axis/left ventricular long-axis (RV/LV), tricuspid annulus diameter/mitral annulus diameter (TV/MV) and pulmonary valve annulus/aortic valve annulus (PV/AV) in the non-biventricular group were lower than that in the biventricular group (all P<0.05). The optimal cut-off values for predicting postnatal circulatory outcomes were 0.65, 0.82 and 0.78, respectively. There was statistically significant difference in the distribution of circulatory outcomes between fetuses with grade 2 EFE and those with no or grade 1 EFE (χ2=21.28, P<0.001). Therefore, right ventricular EFE was dichotomized in the model as ""none or grade 1"" versus ""grade 2"". Each parameter was assigned a corresponding weight based on its OR value, and an integer score was obtained to construct the scoring system: grade 2 right ventricular EFE was assigned 5 points, RV/LV≤0.65 was assigned 2 points, TV/MV≤0.82 was assigned 2 points, and PV/AV≤0.78 was assigned 1 point, with a maximum total score of 10 points. At cut-off scores of 3, 4, and 5 points, the areas under the curve were 0.88, 0.91, and 0.88, respectively, with the highest specificity (0.95, 95% CI 0.84-0.99) observed at a score threshold of 5 points. In the validation cohort, 15 fetuses had scores ≥5 points, among whom 10 fetuses achieved biventricular circulation after birth, whereas in the modeling cohort, only 1 of 18 fetuses (scores≥5 points) achieved biventricular circulation. Conclusions: A multiparametric scoring system based on prenatal fetal echocardiographic parameters can effectively predict non-biventricular postnatal outcomes in fetuses with CPS-IVS and PA-IVS. By identifying high-risk patients, the indications for FPV can be optimized."

European guidelines consider aortic valve replacement (AVR) a Class IIa indication for asymptomatic patients with an LVEF of less than 55%, whereas American guidelines recommend AVR when the LVEF is less than 50%. The authors assessed outcomes of AVR vs conservative management in this range where guidelines differ.
A registry was created for individuals with severe high-gradient AS (AVA ≤ 1 cm²), an LVEF of 50% to 54%, and a mean gradient greater than or equal to 40 mm Hg from 2000 to 2022 using queries of transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) reports. Only asymptomatic cases were included; time-zero was defined as the time of the index TTE, and both AVR (considered as a time-dependent covariate) and mortality could occur at any point after. Proportional hazard modeling assessed the AVR-mortality association, with subset analyses for individuals with AVAs of less than 0.9 cm² and less than or equal to 0.75 cm².
Among 693 included individuals, 83 were asymptomatic at their index TTE. Of these, 38 (45.8%) underwent AVR within 2 years. After adjusting for immortal time, individuals with AVR had a trend toward decreased mortality (HR, 0.56; 95% CI, 0.31-1.01; P = .054). Among individuals with AVAs of less than 0.9 cm² and less than or equal to 0.75 cm², AVR was associated with improved survival (HR, 0.42; 95% CI, 0.21-0.84; P less tan .01 and HR, 0.33; 95% CI, 0.15-0.75; P less than .008, respectively).

A retrospective review of 23 patients treated surgically between 2007 and 2023 was conducted. Patients were categorized into infants (<1 year) and older patients (>1 year). Clinical, operative, and echocardiographic data were analyzed, including left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) and mitral regurgitation (MR). Follow-up evaluations were performed at 1 and 6 months postoperatively.
The median age at surgery was 9 months. Early mortality occurred in 17.4%, with no late deaths during follow-up. Preoperative LVEF was significantly lower in infants than in older patients (p = 0.013). Among 19 survivors, LVEF improved markedly by 1 month and normalized in all patients by 6 months. MR was present in 89.5% preoperatively, with 47.3% showing moderate to severe grades. At 6 months, MR improved in most cases, with only 2 patients exhibiting residual moderate regurgitation and no severe cases.

We sought to evaluate trends in CVD during pregnancy and maternal, obstetric, and fetal outcomes in pregnant women with CVD in the Kaiser Permanente Northern California (KPNC) integrated healthcare system. This retrospective cohort study included adult KPNC members with moderate or greater valvular heart disease, cardiomyopathy, congenital heart disease, or ischemic heart disease during pregnancy from 2010-2021. Bivariate analyses and multivariable logistic regression were used to evaluate associations between demographic and clinical risk factors and maternal outcomes in pregnant patients with CVD. Of 320,902 pregnancies, 763 (0.24%) were identified with clinically significant CVD. The prevalence of CVD increased from 0.19% to 0.34% over the decade, predominantly due to an increase in prevalence of women with congenital heart disease. Mean gestational age at delivery was 36.7 weeks with 19.5% experiencing preterm delivery. Cesarean section, pre-eclampsia or eclampsia, and postpartum hemorrhage rates were 29.5%, 20.8%, and 9.7%, respectively. Fetal loss beyond the first trimester occurred in 7.1% pregnancies. Adverse maternal cardiac outcomes occurred in 55 (7.2%) of patients, predominantly driven by congestive heart failure hospitalizations. There were 4 deaths (0.5%) during pregnancy or within 1 year postpartum. Pre-existing CVD (aOR 0.20, p=0.002) and cardiac medication use (aOR 4.13, p<0.001) were significant predictors of adverse maternal outcomes. Higher left ventricular ejection fraction (aOR 0.95, p=0.018) was associated with lower odds of adverse maternal outcomes. In conclusion, understanding risk factors for adverse pregnancy outcomes in a diverse, contemporary population of patients with CVD can help refine cardio-obstetric risk assessment and preconception counseling."

LASr is typically assessed using speckle-tracking echocardiography (STE), which was developed to measure strain in the left ventricle. Despite its strength demonstrated in several clinical studies, the application of STE to the left atrium presents well-known limitations: thin walls, anatomical discontinuities, far-field location, and inter-vendor variability. The present study aims to evaluate the efficacy of an alternative method for assessing LASr, based on the percentage shortening of the atrial wall contour, by directly comparing it with STE-derived LASr values.
We retrospectively analyzed 246 patients in sinus rhythm with severe organic mitral regurgitation. The 2D contour strain method quantifies changes in the length of the two-dimensional (2D) endocardial atrial wall contour between end-systolic and end-diastolic frames. The peak strain value is calculated as: (maximum perimeter length-minimum perimeter length)/maximum perimeter length × 100.
2D contour strain measurements were feasible in all patients. A strong correlation was observed between STE-derived and 2D contour-derived LASr values, with an R-value of 0.93. On average, 2D contour strain measurements underestimated LA peak strain by approximately 1% compared to STE. The consistency of 2D contour LA strain measurements, as assessed by inter- and intra-observer reproducibility, was excellent.
These findings suggest that 2D contour LA strain is a feasible and reliable alternative to STE for assessing LASr. This approach is particularly valuable in echocardiography labs where STE software for LA is unavailable."

The surgical indication for LVD remains controversial.
A 31-year-old man was diagnosed with LVD through multimodality imaging that involved electrocardiogram, transesophageal echocardiography, cardiac computed tomography angiography, and magnetic resonance imaging. Intracardiac echocardiography and electrophysiological mapping confirmed the arrhythmia originating inside the diverticular cavity. With ineffective conservative treatment, surgery became the preferable option. The surgical approach was guided by preoperative three-dimensional printed reconstruction. The procedure involved diverticulum patch repair combined with radiofrequency ablation and, unexpectedly, mitral valve replacement. The patient recovered well.
VT originating from an LVD is a rare and catastrophic complication, with multimodal imaging essential for diagnosis. Surgical repair and radiofrequency ablation are effective treatments for LVD complicated by arrhythmia.
Treatment with medication alone may be insufficient for LVD with VT, and surgery is recommended."

However, the prognostic relevance of left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) in this population remains unclear.
We analyzed data from 821 patients undergoing M-TEER at four German tertiary care centers between 2011 and 2022. Patients were stratified into heart failure subgroups based on LVEF: heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF, LVEF ≥50%), mildly reduced ejection fraction (HFmrEF, LVEF 41-49%), and reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF, LVEF ≤40%). Propensity score matching was used to balance baseline characteristics. The primary endpoint was all-cause mortality, with secondary endpoints including cardiovascular mortality and major adverse cardiac and cerebrovascular events (MACCE).
HFrEF patients exhibited greater comorbid burden, including higher rates of coronary artery disease and functional MR. Despite these differences, no significant association was observed between LVEF and long-term mortality, even after propensity score matching. Long-term survival rates at three years were similar across subgroups: 50.8% for HFrEF, 60.6% for HFmrEF, and 58.9% for HFpEF (p=0.2). Patients with HFrEF experienced higher in-hospital mortality (5.2%) than HFmrEF (0%) and HFpEF (2.5%), primarily due to non-cardiac causes. The overall rate of major adverse cardiac and cerebrovascular events (MACCE) was low at 3.8% (31/821) without significant difference between the respective subgroups. Multivariable analysis identified high-grade tricuspid regurgitation, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and impaired renal function as stronger predictors of mortality than LVEF.
LVEF demonstrated limited prognostic value for long-term outcomes following M-TEER, challenging its role as a standalone marker in this population. Procedural safety and efficacy were consistent across subgroups, underscoring the viability of M-TEER in surgically inoperable patients. Given the significant higher in-hospital mortality rate due to non-cardiac causes in the HFrEF subgroup, tailored therapeutic strategies addressing the underlying diseases should be pursued to optimize outcomes. Future studies should explore possible improvements in risk assessment and patient selection, for example by integrating emerging imaging modalities and accounting for comorbidities, to improve treatment outcomes."

Focused transthoracic echocardiography (FTTE) may help diagnose or rule out a cardiac cause of the clinical dilemma. We studied the diagnostic and therapeutic impact of FTTE in post-CS patients in the ICU.
In this prospective observational study, 60 post-CS patients in the ICU requiring FTTE were studied for indications for FTTE. Following FTTE, the hemodynamic cause of hypotension was differentiated as hypovolemia, cardiac failure due to underlying cardiac conditions such as cardiomyopathy or valvular heart disease, sepsis, pulmonary embolism, and myocardial infarction. In respiratory distress, FTTE differentiated pulmonary edema secondary to cardiac causes from non-cardiac causes. FTTE was considered to have a diagnostic impact whenever, in a clinically unsuspected case, it diagnosed a new cardiac disorder, thus helping to narrow down to a single cause out of multiple differential diagnoses or ruled out a cardiac cause in a clinically suspected case. FTTE was considered to have a therapeutic impact whenever it led to an alteration in management.
FTTE diagnosed a new cardiac pathology in 18 (30%) patients and ruled out a worsening of existing cardiac function in 18 (30%) patients with known cardiac disease. An underlying cardiac condition was ruled out in 22 (36.66%) patients, supporting an alternate diagnosis. FTTE led to a change in the management of 45 (75%) patients.

Two- and three-dimensional Transesophageal echocardiography (2D and 3D TEE) can precisely diagnose the mechanisms, location and scallops causing MR, identify the mechanisms of repair failure, identify the predictors of SAM, and help decide when to return to bypass and address the residual lesion. The review comprehensively describes 2D and 3D TEE imaging methods relevant for evaluating the mechanisms of MR, identification of the location of MR, and the predictors of SAM prior to valve repair; and describes imaging methods to identify the presence of mitral stenosis and SAM post-repair. Further, the review discusses the importance of more-than-mild residual MR, describes the evaluation of residual MR and discusses pitfalls in differentiating mild and more- than-mild residual MR."

The physical examination skills of clinicians are insufficient for accurate diagnosis, making complementary tests generally necessary. Despite being commonly requested, electrocardiography and chest radiography present low positive and negative likelihood ratios. Incipient studies involving artificial intelligence have shown promising opportunities to support the diagnosis. In addition, solid current evidence demonstrates that point-of-care ultrasound enhances bedside diagnosis of several cardiovascular conditions. Echocardiographic skills can be acquired after only a few hours of training, which encourages routine bedside use with handling equipment. Despite the routine use of sonography in emergencies, large-scale simplified screening protocols for valvular disease remain lacking. Therefore, improving the accuracy of valvular heart disease diagnosis by integrating all bedside modalities needs to be better understood. We propose a simple, reproducible five-step point-of-care ultrasound protocol for diagnosing valvular heart disease (the ValvUS approach), applicable to all patients. The proposed visual assessment involves evaluating valvular movement, thickness, regurgitant flow, aliasing, and chamber dimensions. This evaluation should be interpreted in the context of traditional clinical probability to ensure the most accurate bedside diagnosis. Typical findings of severe valvular disease on electrocardiography and chest radiography, and particularly on point-of-care ultrasound, may improve the accuracy of bedside diagnosis after clinical assessment in the near future."

Therefore, this research aimed to study the connection of LDL-C levels with the incidence of adverse clinical outcomes in patients undergoing CVS.
1,304 patients undergoing first-time CVS were identified from the MIMIC-IV database. Participants were split into two groups based on admission LDL-C levels: a low LDL-C group (< 1.4 mmol/L, n = 215) as well as a high LDL-C one (≥ 1.4 mmol/L, n = 1,089). The main endpoint was 30-day all-cause mortality (ACM), with secondary endpoints including in-hospital, 90-, 180- and 365-day ACM rates. The connection between preoperative LDL-C levels and clinical outcomes was evaluated via survival analysis, mediation analysis, and subgroup analyses.
Multivariable Cox regression analysis demonstrated preoperative LDL-C level served as an independent protective factor against 30-day ACM following cardiac valve surgery (adjusted HR: 0.594; 95% CI: 0.368-0.960). In stratified analysis, patients in the higher LDL-C tertile exhibited a remarkably lower mortality risk (HR: 0.285; 95% CI: 0.134-0.604). Consistent subgroup analyses validated these findings' robustness across all clinically relevant subgroups. Notably, mediation analysis provided mechanistic evidence that the mortality-increasing effect of lower LDL-C levels may be partially mediated through activation of systemic inflammation.
Lower preoperative LDL-C levels are independently related with higher 30-day mortality following cardiac valve surgery, potentially mediated by the activation of inflammatory pathways."

Cardiovascular interventions,"Small multicenter studies have shown that transcatheter pulmonary valve replacement (TPVR) can be performed with good procedural and early hemodynamic results in patients weighing <30 kg; little is known about longer term outcomes.
The aim of this study was to characterize long-term outcomes after Melody valve placement in patients weighing ≤30 kg.
Selected centers participating in prior registry studies provided updated outcome data.
Between April 2009 and April 2019, 199 patients weighing ≤30kg underwent successful Melody valve placement across 10 centers. During a median follow-up period of nearly 8 years, 78 patients underwent initial reintervention with balloon dilation (n = 20), transcatheter valve-in-valve (n = 30), or explantation (n = 28). Among patients who had not undergone reintervention, 81% of those with available echocardiograms had good valve function. Thirty-two patients developed endocarditis, 20 with predisposing factors; 9 were managed medically. Estimated freedom from pulmonary valve reintervention at 10 years was 46% (95% CI: 36%-55%). On age- and weight-adjusted multivariable Cox regression, right ventricular systolic pressure immediately after implantation (HR: 1.03; 95% CI: 1.00-1.05; P = 0.026) was associated with freedom from reintervention. Freedom from Melody valve explantation at 10 years was 78% (95% CI: 69%-85%), and freedom from endocarditis was 79% (95% CI: 71%-86%). These outcomes did not vary significantly according to weight, delivery system, or era of implantation.
In this large multicenter study, longer term survival and freedom from reintervention or explantation after TPVR were similar to previously reported data for small patients with a surgical pulmonary conduit or bioprosthetic valve. These findings support the utility of TPVR with a Melody valve for delaying surgical valve replacement in small patients."

In a prospective registry, consecutive TAVR patients with HFrEF were stratified into 4 groups (quadruple, triple, double, or single or no therapy) according to prescription of HF-GDMT at discharge post-TAVR and after a 3-month GDMT optimization period. Major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) were defined as a composite of cardiovascular mortality or hospitalization for heart failure. The median follow-up time was 699 days (Q1-Q3: 510-961 days).

Following a 3-month HF-GDMT optimization period, 2-year MACE rates were lower in patients taking quadruple (15.0%; 95% CI: 5.2%-24.8%) compared with triple (22.6%; 95% CI: 10.4%-34.8%), double (24.2%; 95% CI: 13.8%-34.6%), and single or no therapy (43.6%; 95% CI: 31.8%-55.4%; log-rank P < 0.001).
HF-GDMT is underused in patients with HFrEF who undergo TAVR, and suboptimal HF-GDMT is associated with increased MACE in this setting. Strategies to improve the initiation and up-titration of HF-GDMT in TAVR patients with HFrEF are needed."

With a focus on the prevalent psychological complications following the onset of this condition, this study aimed to explore the correlation between antenatal depression and Corona disease anxiety, personality traits, and postpartum depression during the COVID-19 pandemic.                                                           Materials and Methods:                     This cross-sectional descriptive-analytical study investigated women receiving care at health centers affiliated with Kerman University of Medical Sciences during the last month of their pregnancy and the postpartum period in 2022. Following the acquisition of informed consent, participants were assessed using various measures, including demographic and obstetric information, the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale, the Corona Disease Anxiety Scale (CDAS), and the NEO Personality Inventory-Revised during their third trimester of pregnancy. The same group of participants completed the Edinburgh Depression Scale and the Corona Disease Anxiety Scale (CDAS) 4-6 weeks after childbirth.                                                           Results and Discussion:                     There was a significant correlation between family income, unwanted pregnancy as perceived by both the mother and father, and antenatal depression. Additionally, marital satisfaction played a significant role in postpartum depression. Furthermore, antenatal depression was significantly associated with neuroticism, agreeableness, and physical symptoms related to Corona disease anxiety. Personality traits, with the exception of extroversion and conscientiousness, and various domains of Corona disease anxiety, excluding psychological symptoms, were also significantly associated with postpartum depression.                                                           Conclusion:                     During pandemics or epidemics, such as the COVID-19 outbreak, experiencing mental distress during pregnancy can contribute to mental health issues during the postpartum period. This risk is particularly true in individuals with unique personality traits, emphasizing the need for increased focus on mental health within prenatal care during these crises."

Method:                     This cross-sectional study was conducted in Kerman, Iran. Data were collected from patients who visited Afzalipour Hospital in Kerman more than twice during the COVID-19 epidemic from the end of February 2020 to March 21, 2021. We conducted two key analyses: 1. Mixed effect logistic regression was used to check the relationship between the variables and COVID-19 severity. 2. Mixed effect linear regression was used to check the relationship between the variables and the length of stay in the hospital.                                                           Results:                     The findings indicated that the most important risk factors for the severity of COVID-19 were heart diseases (OR=1.67,95%CI:1.20-2.30), increasing age (OR=2.23 for age&gt;54, 95%CI:1.70- 2.90), male gender (OR=1.47,95%CI:1.10-1.96), respiratory diseases other than asthma, and frequency of admission (OR=1.60,95%CI:1.20-2.15). All patients who underwent readmission experienced a shorter duration of hospitalization during their subsequent admission (OR=0.94,95%CI:0.91,0.96) and had a higher mortality rate (30% within 14 days, 26.6% between 14-90 days). Patients readmitted at intervals of 14-90 days and greater than 90 days exhibited lower disease severity compared to those readmitted within the 0-14 day period.                                                           Conclusion:                     Examining readmissions, the severity of COVID-19, and the length of hospital stay in affected patients are important factors for planning and allocating resources for COVID-19 management and treatment. These factors can help policymakers develop effective clinical guidelines for hospitalization or outpatient treatment of COVID-19 patients and contribute to reducing the burden of disease in the community."

Kinovea, as an accessible motion-analysis software, provides both visual and quantitative feedback. However, its application in supporting technique development among beginner athletes remains insufficiently explored. Aim: This study aims to describe the use of Kinovea in biomechanics training and examine its contribution to the awareness of kinematic characteristics and movement techniques among beginner athletes. Methods: A descriptive qualitative design involved 72 beginner athletes aged 18–25 years selected through purposive sampling. Data were collected over 16 weeks through interviews, field observations, and motion video recordings analyzed using Kinovea. Kinematic data focused on joint angles, stride behavior, and movement phases during walking, running, and the flight phase. Qualitative data were analyzed using content analysis with NVivo 12, while kinematic results were interpreted descriptively to identify performance patterns and areas for technical refinement. Result: Kinematic analysis showed coordinated joint-angle patterns across all phases. Walking analysis identified arm swing angles of 50.9°–58.8° and leg separation angles of 64.3°–67.2°, indicating a stable gait rhythm. The running analysis revealed knee angles of 68.8°–69.8° and elbow angles of 87.6°–89.1°, indicating efficient propulsive mechanics. The flight phase demonstrated knee angles of 81.2°–87.8° and elbow angles of 80.4°–88.3°, suggesting effective momentum use and postural stability. These measurements supported stride-efficiency assessment and technique evaluation. Qualitative findings revealed that Kinovea enabled athletes to interpret movement phases and identify technical inefficiencies through slow-motion and frame-by-frame visualization. Conclusion: Kinovea supports basic motion analysis by providing clear kinematic information and helping beginner athletes observe and refine their movement techniques. The findings also offer practical value for coaches by enabling more precise identification of inefficient patterns and guiding targeted corrections during early-stage training."

Integrated care pathways (ICPs) supported by structured data systems may improve safety and outcomes, but real-world evidence in AS remains limited. We aimed to characterize a contemporary cohort of patients with severe AS managed within an ICP at a tertiary hospital, comparing profiles and outcomes by treatment strategy, and to describe diagnostic procedures and the implementation of cardiac rehabilitation (CR) interventions embedded in the pathway. Methods Prospective observational study of all consecutive patients with AS evaluated by a multidisciplinary heart team between 2018 and 2022. Baseline characteristics and frailty, diagnostic tests, CR interventions, procedural details, and outcomes were collected via an interoperable data management platform and compared across treatment groups: surgical (SAVR) or transcatheter (TAVR) valve replacement, or conservative management. Early survival was assessed using Kaplan–Meier analysis with log-rank testing. Results Among 984 patients (median age 78 years, 42% women), 43.9% underwent SAVR, 49.8% TAVR, and 6.3% were managed conservatively. TAVR and conservative groups were older, frailer, and had higher comorbidity. Device success at 30 days was high (≈91%), with periprocedural death at 2.5% for interventions, vs. 9.7% early mortality for conservative management ( p &amp;lt; 0.001). Early survival differed significantly (log-rank p = 0.004). TAVR had higher permanent pacemaker implantation (21.7% vs. 7.4% for SAVR, p &amp;lt; 0.001) and major vascular complications (4.1% vs. 0.2%, p &amp;lt; 0.001), while SAVR had more reoperations (8.3% vs. 0.2%, p &amp;lt; 0.001) and atrial fibrillation (18.9% vs. 10.1%, p = 0.001). Prehabilitation was implemented in 64.6% of candidates, while postprocedural CR remained underutilized (11.3%). Conclusions Integrated care for a cohort of patients with AS, supported by structured data management, enabled comprehensive profiling, systematic outcome monitoring, and identification of improvement areas. Both SAVR and TAVR achieved high success with low early mortality, while conservative management had poor survival."

OpenAlex,aortic stenosis,The Value of HALP Score in Predicting Adverse In-Hospital Clinical Outcomes in Patients Undergoing Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement,Ömer Faruk Çiçek; Mustafa Çetin; Ali Palice,10.3390/diagnostics16020276,2026-01-15,Diagnostics,"Background: Transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) is widely used in patients with severe aortic stenosis. The HALP (hemoglobin, albumin, lymphocyte, and platelet) score is an easily obtainable composite index that reflects nutritional status and systemic inflammation. Methods: In this single-center retrospective study, 140 patients who underwent TAVR between 1 April 2021, and 31 October 2024, were included. Patients were stratified according to the median HALP score (32.65) into low (&lt;32.65)- and high (≥32.65)-HALP groups. In-hospital outcomes were mortality, bleeding requiring transfusion of &gt;5 units of red blood cells, acute kidney injury (AKI), need for mechanical ventilation &gt;24 h, and length of hospital stay. Associations between the HALP score and clinical outcomes were evaluated using multivariable regression analyses, and the discriminatory performance of HALP was assessed using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves. Results: Patients with low HALP scores had higher rates of in-hospital mortality (11.4% vs. 4.2%; p = 0.002), bleeding (28.6% vs. 5.7%; p &lt; 0.001), AKI (11.4% vs. 2.9%; p &lt; 0.001), and need for mechanical ventilation &gt;24 h (25.7% vs. 14.4%; p = 0.002), as well as longer hospital stay (4.82 ± 1.50 vs. 3.62 ± 1.94 days; p = 0.001) compared with the high-HALP group. In multivariable models, a lower HALP score remained independently associated with all adverse in-hospital outcomes. ROC analysis showed good discriminatory ability of the HALP score for mortality (area under the curve [AUC] = 0.816; cut-off = 20.16), bleeding (AUC = 0.798; cut-off = 24.94), AKI (AUC = 0.737; cut-off = 26.21), and need for mechanical ventilation (AUC = 0.735; cut-off = 27.36). Conclusions: The HALP score is independently associated with adverse in-hospital clinical outcomes in patients undergoing TAVR and may serve as a simple and practical tool for early risk stratification in this population."

Bisson; Amandine Granier; Mélanie Burban; Anne Bernard; Laurent Fauchier,10.3390/jcm15020714,2026-01-15,Journal of Clinical Medicine,"Background: Sodium–glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors (SGLT2 inhibitors), initially developed for glycemic control in type 2 diabetes, have demonstrated robust cardiovascular and renal benefits. Emerging evidence suggests that these agents may also affect valvular pathobiology, particularly in degenerative aortic stenosis (AS), through anti-inflammatory and antifibrotic mechanisms. Objectives: This study evaluated whether SGLT2 inhibitor use is associated with improved clinical outcomes in degenerative AS, including all-cause mortality and the need for SAVR or TAVR, recognizing that these endpoints represent surrogate rather than direct measures of valve hemodynamic progression. Methods: A retrospective cohort analysis was conducted using TriNetX, a federated electronic medical record-based research network. Diagnoses are captured using ICD-9/ICD-10-CM codes and medications using ATC codes. Adults with non-rheumatic AS were stratified by SGLT2 inhibitors use. Propensity score matching (1:1) was performed to balance baseline characteristics between treated and untreated groups (n = 10,912 per group). Primary outcomes included all-cause mortality, TAVR, and SAVR during follow-up. Echocardiographic parameters (AVA, Vmax, mean gradient) were not systematically available. Results: After adjustment for comorbidities, SGLT2 inhibitor use was independently associated with lower all-cause mortality (6.15% vs. 9.34% HR 0.595; 95% CI 0.552–0.641; p &lt; 0.001), TAVR (2.81% vs. 2.89% HR 0.835; 95% CI 0.746–0.934; p = 0.002), SAVR (1.28% vs. 1.90% HR 0.514; 95% CI 0.442–0.599; p &lt; 0.001), cardiac arrest (0.82% vs. 1.21% HR 0.71; 95% CI 0.582–0.867; p &lt; 0.001), and end-stage kidney disease (0.40% vs. 1.0% HR 0.292; 95% CI 0.222–0.384; p &lt; 0.001). Although these associations may suggest slower disease progression, interpretation is limited by the lack of systematic echocardiographic follow-up. Conclusions: In addition to their established benefits in heart failure and renal protection, SGLT2 inhibitors may have valve-preserving effects in degenerative AS. Because true hemodynamic progression could not be evaluated, these results should be viewed as associations with surrogate clinical endpoints. Prospective studies with standardized imaging are required to determine whether SGLT2 inhibition can directly alter the course of this currently untreatable disease"
OpenAlex,aortic stenosis,Mid-Term Results of the Multicenter CAMPARI Registry Using the E-Liac Iliac Branch Device for Aorto-Iliac Aneurysms,Francesca Noce; Giulio Accarino; Domenico Angiletta; Del Guercio L; Sergio Zacá; Mafalda Massara; Pietro Volpe; Antonio Peluso; Loris Flora; Nicola De Rosi; Umberto Marcello Bracale,10.3390/jcdd13010048,2026-01-15,Journal of Cardiovascular Development and Disease,"Background: Intentional occlusion of the internal iliac artery (IIA) during endovascular repair of aorto-iliac aneurysms may predispose patients to pelvic ischemic complications such as gluteal claudication, erectile dysfunction, and bowel ischemia. Iliac branch devices (IBDs) have been developed to preserve hypogastric perfusion. E-Liac (Artivion/Jotec) is one of the latest modular IBDs yet reports on mid-term performance are limited to small single-center cohorts with short follow-up. The CAMpania PugliA bRanch IliaC (CAMPARI) study is a multicenter investigation of E-Liac outcomes. Methods: A retrospective observational cohort study was conducted across five Italian vascular centers. All consecutive patients undergoing E-Liac implantation for aorto-iliac or isolated iliac aneurysms between January 2015 and December 2024 were identified from prospectively maintained registries. Inclusion criteria comprised elective or urgent endovascular repair of aorto-iliac aneurysms in which an adequate distal sealing zone was not available without covering the IIA and suitability for the E-Liac device according to its instructions for use (IFU). Patients with a life expectancy &lt; 1 year or hostile anatomy incompatible with the IFU were excluded. The primary end point was freedom from branch instability (occlusion/stenosis, kinking, or detachment of the bridging stent). Secondary end points included freedom from any endoleak, freedom from device-related reintervention, freedom from gluteal claudication, aneurysm-related and all-cause mortality, acute renal failure, and sac regression &gt; 5 mm. Results: A total of 69 consecutive patients (68 male, 1 female, median age 72.0 years) received 74 E-Liac devices, including 5 bilateral implantations. The mean infrarenal aortic diameter was 45 mm and the mean CIA diameter 34 mm; 14 patients (20.0%) had a concomitant IIA aneurysm (&gt;20 mm). Concomitant fenestrated or branched aortic repair was performed in 23% of procedures. Two patients received a standalone IBD without implantation of a proximal aortic endograft. Technical success was achieved in 71/74 cases (96.0%); three failures occurred due to inability to catheterize the IIA. Distal landing was in the main IIA trunk in 58 cases and in the posterior branch in 13 cases. Over a median follow-up of 18 (6; 36) months, there were four branch instability events (5.4%): three occlusions and one bridging stent detachment. Seven patients (9.5%) developed endoleaks (one type Ib, two type II, two type IIIa, and two type IIIc). Five patients (6.8%) required reintervention, and five (6.8%) reported gluteal claudication. There were seven all-cause deaths (10%), none within 30 days or related to aneurysm rupture; causes included COVID-19 pneumonia, acute coronary syndrome, melanoma, gastric cancer, and stroke. No acute renal or respiratory failure occurred. Kaplan–Meier analysis showed 92% (95% CI 77–100) freedom from branch instability in the main-trunk group and 89% (60–100) in the posterior-branch group (log-rank p = 0.69). Freedom from any endoleak at 48 months was 87% (95% CI 75–95), and freedom from reintervention was 93% (95% CI 83–98). Conclusions: In this multicenter cohort, the E-Liac branched endograft demonstrated high technical success and favorable early–mid-term outcomes. Preservation of hypogastric perfusion using E-Liac was associated with low rates of branch instability, endoleak, and reintervention, with no 30-day mortality or aneurysm-related deaths. These findings support the safety and efficacy of E-Liac for aorto-iliac aneurysm management, although larger prospective studies with longer follow-up are needed."
OpenAlex,aortic stenosis,Anesthetic and procedural strategy for coexisting severe aortic stenosis and carotid artery stenosis: A case report,Yuri Okada; Rio Oishi; Satoshi Kimura; Moritoki Egi,10.5412/wjsp.v16.i1.115792,2026-01-15,World Journal of Surgical Procedures,"BACKGROUND Aortic stenosis (AS) often coexists with carotid artery stenosis. However, clear guidelines for the optimal treatment strategy and sequencing of interventions in patients with both conditions are lacking. CASE SUMMARY A 79-year-old man with a history of hypertension presented with right-sided paralysis and pain. Magnetic resonance imaging revealed multiple infarctions in the left cerebral hemisphere and severe stenosis of the left carotid artery. Transthoracic echocardiography also identified coexisting severe AS. Carotid artery stenosis increases the risk of stroke during aortic valve manipulation; therefore, carotid intervention may be recommended prior to aortic valve treatment. However, perioperative hypotension and bradycardia associated with carotid intervention can precipitate circulatory collapse in patients with severe AS. After a multidisciplinary conference, the decision was made to first perform transcatheter aortic valve implantation under general anesthesia, followed by carotid endarterectomy 4 months later. Both procedures were completed successfully without complications. CONCLUSION Treatment strategy should be individualized, balancing perioperative risks and benefits in patients with severe AS and carotid artery stenosis."

A total of 96 fetuses diagnosed with CPS-IVS or PA-IVS at the Women and Children's Hospital, Qingdao University between July 2018 and June 2021 were included. Fetuses who did not undergo FPV constituted the modeling cohort, while those who underwent FPV constituted the validation cohort. Fetuses were classified into biventricular and non-biventricular circulation groups based on postnatal circulatory outcomes, and prenatal fetal echocardiographic parameters were compared. Inter-group comparisons were performed using the <i>t</i> test, Mann-Whitney <i>U</i> test, <i>χ</i><sup>2</sup> test or Fisher exact test. Based on inter-group differences, parameters associated with postnatal circulatory outcomes were screened in the modeling cohort. For continuous variables, optimal cut-off values were determined using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves and the Youden index and then dichotomized. Right ventricular endocardial fibroelastosis (EFE) was graded as 0, 1 or 2 according to severity. <i>OR</i> of each parameter were calculated, and a multiparametric scoring system was constructed. ROC curves were used to evaluate its predictive performance. Post-FPV outcome improvement was assessed in the validation cohort. <b>Results:</b> Among the 96 fetuses, 78 were assigned to the modeling cohort and 18 to the validation cohort. Postnatally, biventricular circulation was achieved in 56 cases (72%) in the modeling cohort and 13 cases in the validation cohort. In the modeling cohort, the right ventricular long-axis/left ventricular long-axis (RV/LV), tricuspid annulus diameter/mitral annulus diameter (TV/MV) and pulmonary valve annulus/aortic valve annulus (PV/AV) in the non-biventricular group were lower than that in the biventricular group (all <i>P</i><0.05). The optimal cut-off values for predicting postnatal circulatory outcomes were 0.65, 0.82 and 0.78, respectively. There was statistically significant difference in the distribution of circulatory outcomes between fetuses with grade 2 EFE and those with no or grade 1 EFE (<i>χ</i><sup>2</sup>=21.28, <i>P</i><0.001). Therefore, right ventricular EFE was dichotomized in the model as ""none or grade 1"" versus ""grade 2"". Each parameter was assigned a corresponding weight based on its <i>OR</i> value, and an integer score was obtained to construct the scoring system: grade 2 right ventricular EFE was assigned 5 points, RV/LV≤0.65 was assigned 2 points, TV/MV≤0.82 was assigned 2 points, and PV/AV≤0.78 was assigned 1 point, with a maximum total score of 10 points. At cut-off scores of 3, 4, and 5 points, the areas under the curve were 0.88, 0.91, and 0.88, respectively, with the highest specificity (0.95, 95% <i>CI</i> 0.84-0.99) observed at a score threshold of 5 points. In the validation cohort, 15 fetuses had scores ≥5 points, among whom 10 fetuses achieved biventricular circulation after birth, whereas in the modeling cohort, only 1 of 18 fetuses (scores≥5 points) achieved biventricular circulation. <b>Conclusions:</b> A multiparametric scoring system based on prenatal fetal echocardiographic parameters can effectively predict non-biventricular postnatal outcomes in fetuses with CPS-IVS and PA-IVS. By identifying high-risk patients, the indications for FPV can be optimized."
OpenAlex,aortic stenosis,Importance of digital media in patient education for transcatheter aortic valve implantation,Florian Genske; Anna Riepe; Elias Rawish; Thomas Stiermaier; Ingo Eitel; Christian Frerker; Tobias Schmidt,10.4330/wjc.v18.i1.113783,2026-01-15,World Journal of Cardiology,"BACKGROUND Patient consent discussion is an essential part of preoperative patient preparation. It is the main basis of decision making for the patient. Transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) has been established as the standard treatment option for symptomatic aortic stenosis-patients. Current guidelines recommend transfemoral TAVI for patients aged 70 years or older, independently of the surgical risk and for patients below 70 years of age if they are at high surgical risk. AIM To evaluate beneficial aspects of an explanatory video in addition to conventional medical counseling. METHODS The study was conducted as a prospective, single-arm, monocentric cohort study. Eligible patients received conventional medical counseling, followed by an educational video. Evaluation of the conventional counseling and the educational video was obtained through a 32-item questionnaire. Two hypotheses were tested: Hypothesis 1: Showing an explanatory video in addition to the standard patient consent discussion improves the mediation of medical facts; and hypothesis 2: Showing an explanatory video in addition to the standard patient consent discussion improves patient satisfaction and confidence. RESULTS In total, 66 patients, scheduled for transfemoral TAVI were included, 59% of them were male and 41% female, averaging 81 ± 6.1 years old. Conventional medical counseling by the attending physician was the major criterium for overall patient satisfaction and had more influence on the absence of preprocedural tension than the transfer of additional factual knowledge through the video. Nearly two-thirds (61%) reported that the video enhanced their understanding of the procedure’s benefits, while 42% indicated a better understanding of the potential risks and 56% felt that watching the video contributed to decreased preprocedural tension. CONCLUSION Conventional medical counseling was most important for overall patient satisfaction. Educational videos aid in information transfer, in the reduction of preprocedural tension and were strongly sought after by the patients."
OpenAlex,aortic stenosis,CMR FEATURE TRACKING GLOBAL LONGLUTONAL STRAIN: A Novel Tool to Refine Sudden Cardiac Death Risk Prediction in Hypertrophic Cardiomomply,MD/PhD Camilo Fernández Bravo,10.5281/zenodo.18244930,2026-01-14,Zenodo (CERN European Organization for Nuclear Research),"Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) stands as one of the most common inherited cardiac disorders, characterized by abnormal thickening of the heart muscle, particularly the left ventricular (LV) myocardium, in the absence of other identifiable causes such as hypertension or aortic stenosis. First described in the mid-20th century, HCM has since been recognized as a heterogeneous condition with a broad spectrum of clinical presentations, ranging from asymptomatic individuals to those experiencing severe symptoms like heart failure, arrhythmias, and sudden cardiac death (SCD). The prevalence of HCM is estimated at approximately 1 in 500 individuals in the general population, though recent genetic and imaging studies suggest it may be as high as 1 in 200 when including subclinical cases. This makes HCM not only a significant public health concern but also a leading cause of SCD in young adults and athletes. Genetically, HCM is primarily an autosomal dominant disorder, with mutations in genes encoding sarcomeric proteins—such as myosin heavy chain (MYH7), myosin-binding protein C (MYBPC3), and troponin T (TNNT2)—accounting for the majority of cases. These mutations disrupt the normal architecture and function of cardiac myocytes, leading to myocardial hypertrophy, disarray, and fibrosis. The hypertrophy is often asymmetric, most commonly affecting the interventricular septum, but it can involve other regions like the apex or be concentric in nature. This structural remodeling impairs diastolic relaxation, increases LV outflow tract (LVOT) obstruction in a subset of patients (obstructive HCM), and predisposes the heart to electrical instability. Clinically, patients with HCM may present with symptoms such as dyspnea, chest pain, syncope, or palpitations, often exacerbated by exercise. However, a substantial proportion remain asymptomatic until a catastrophic event occurs. Diagnosis typically involves a combination of family history, electrocardiography (ECG) showing LV hypertrophy patterns, and imaging modalities like echocardiography, which reveals wall thickness greater than 15 mm in adults (or 13 mm in those with a family history). Cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) imaging has become indispensable for detailed tissue characterization, identifying fibrosis via late gadolinium enhancement (LGE), which is a hallmark of adverse remodeling. Despite advances in management, including beta-blockers, calcium channel blockers, septal myectomy, alcohol septal ablation, and implantable cardioverter-defibrillators (ICDs), the unpredictable nature of SCD remains a central challenge in HCM care. SCD, often due to ventricular arrhythmias like ventricular tachycardia or fibrillation, accounts for up to 1% annual mortality in HCM cohorts, with higher rates in younger patients. Identifying those at highest risk is crucial to guide preventive therapies, yet current strategies fall short in precision."
OpenAlex,aortic stenosis,Assessment of the Genetic Relationship Between Circulating Cytokines and Calcific Aortic Valvular Stenosis Using a Bidirectional Mendelian Randomization Analysis,Junyi He; Boao Chen; Junling Mao; Ni Xia; Lingfeng Zha,10.1096/fj.202502613r,2026-01-14,The FASEB Journal,"ABSTRACT Available studies have found associations between several cytokines and calcific aortic valvular stenosis (CAVS). To better comprehend the causal link between circulating cytokines and CAVS, we performed a bidirectional Mendelian randomization (MR) study. Genetic variants associated with 41 cytokines were obtained from public genome‐wide association study (GWAS), and summary statistics for GWAS of CAVS were obtained from the FinnGen consortium. Forward MR analysis was conducted to determine the impacts of 41 cytokines on CAVS risk and reverse MR analysis was used to determine whether genetic susceptibility to CAVS altered the levels of these cytokines. Inverse‐variance weighting (IVW) was implemented as the primary method, and several different sensitivity analyses were used to verify the reliability of the findings. Our results found no significant association between 41 cytokines and CAVS risk. However, increased levels of interleukin‐18 (IL‐18) (odds ratio [OR] = 1.080, 95% CI: 1.024–1.139) and interferon‐gamma (IFN‐γ) (OR = 1.157, 95% CI: 1.028–1.302) had suggestive connections with an elevated risk of CAVS, and increased levels of IL‐13 (OR = 0.942, 95% CI: 0.890–0.997) and IL‐5 (OR = 0.892, 95% CI: 0.804–0.990) had suggestive associations with a reduced risk of CAVS. A reverse MR analysis found that CAVS had a suggestive relationship with a reduced level of platelet‐derived growth factor BB (PDGF‐BB) (OR = 0.920, 95% CI: 0.853–0.993) and IL‐4 (OR = 0.925, 95% CI: 0.856–1.000). Our findings suggest the causal effects of IL‐18, IFN‐γ, IL‐13, and IL‐5 on CAVS risk, and genetic predisposition of CAVS may reduce the levels of PDGF‐BB and IL‐4."
OpenAlex,aortic stenosis,Temporal Cardiorenal Dynamics and Mortality Prediction After TAVR: The Prognostic Value of the 48–72 h BUN/EF Ratio,Aykan Çelik; Tuncay Kırış; Fatma Esin; Semih Babacan; Harun Erdem; Mustafa Karaca,10.3390/jcm15020676,2026-01-14,Journal of Clinical Medicine,"Background: Renal and cardiac dysfunction are major determinants of adverse outcomes following transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR). The ratio of blood urea nitrogen to left ventricular ejection fraction (BUN/EF) integrates renal and cardiac status into a single physiological index. This study aimed to evaluate the prognostic value of both baseline and temporal (48–72 h) BUN/EF ratios for predicting mortality after TAVR. Methods: A total of 429 patients (mean age 76 ± 8 years; 51% female) who underwent TAVR for severe aortic stenosis between 2017 and 2025 were retrospectively analyzed. The primary endpoint was long-term all-cause mortality; in-hospital mortality was secondary. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves, Cox regression, and reclassification metrics (NRI, IDI) assessed prognostic performance. Restricted cubic spline (RCS) analysis explored non-linear associations. Results: During a median follow-up of 733 days, overall and in-hospital mortality rates were 37.8% and 7.9%, respectively. Both baseline and 48–72 h BUN/EF ratios were independently associated with mortality (HR = 3.46 and 3.79 per 1 SD increase; both p &lt; 0.001). The temporal ratio showed superior discrimination for in-hospital mortality (AUC = 0.826 vs. 0.743, p = 0.007). Adding baseline BUN/EF to EuroSCORE II significantly improved model performance (AUC 0.712 vs. 0.668, p = 0.031; NRI = 0.33; IDI = 0.067). RCS analysis revealed a linear relationship for baseline and a steep, non-linear association for temporal ratios with mortality risk. Conclusions: The 48–72 h BUN/EF ratio is a robust dynamic biomarker that predicts early mortality after TAVR, while baseline BUN/EF identifies patients at long-term risk. Integrating this simple bedside index into risk algorithms may refine postoperative monitoring and improve outcome prediction in TAVR populations."
