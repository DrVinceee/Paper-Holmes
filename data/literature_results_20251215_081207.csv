To compare the long-term outcomes between the BE-THV and SE-THV.
We retrospectively analyzed 1054 patients undergoing transfemoral transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) for tricuspid aortic valve stenosis with LAA, defined as an annulus area > 430 mm2, using either a BE-THV (SAPIEN 3, Edwards Life Sciences) or SE-THV (Evolut R/PRO, Medtronic). The 7-year cumulative incidences of all-cause mortality and bioprosthetic valve failure (BVF) were evaluated in the overall cohort and the propensity score (PS)-matched cohort.
Among the 1054 patients with LAA, 829 (78.7 %) received a BE-THV. The PS-matched population resulted in 218 pairs. The cumulative incidence of all-cause mortality 7 years after TAVI was comparable between the BE-THV and SE-THV groups in the overall cohort (58.6 % vs. 67.6 %, log-rank P = 0.848) and the PS-matched cohort (53.2 % vs. 69.9 %, log-rank P = 0.173). In the overall cohort, the BE-THV group demonstrated a lower exposure-adjusted BVF rate as compared with the SE-THV, although the difference was not significant (6.1 vs. 9.6 events per 1000 patient-years, P = 0.258). This trend became pronounced after PS matching (3.3 vs. 9.9 events per 1000 patient-years, P = 0.017), which was also confirmed by Gray's test (P = 0.032).
In the current analysis focusing on patients with LAA, the BE-THV and SE-THV groups had a comparable long-term prognosis, but the BE-THV group had a lower BVF rate than did the SE-THV group.

This study aimed to characterize the specific causes of LF, their prevalence, and prognostic significance.
In 408 patients with severe LFAS included, the aetiology of LF was identified. The primary endpoint was the composite of all-cause death and hospitalizations for heart failure (HF) up to 36 months. Secondary endpoints included individual components of the primary endpoint and cardiovascular mortality.
The most common LF cause was reduced LVEF (n = 228, 55.9%), while preserved LVEF included five aetiologies: (1)mixed aetiologies (n = 65, 36.1%), (2)small LV cavity (n = 58, 32.2%), (3)significant isolated mitral regurgitation (n = 39, 21.7%), (4)significant isolated tricuspid regurgitation (n = 13, 7.2%), (5)significant isolated mitral stenosis (n = 5, 2.8%). Over a median follow-up of 15 (IQR 6 - 36) months obtained in 302 patients, 159 (52.6%) reached the primary composite endpoint, 108 (35.8%) died and 91 (30.8%) were hospitalized due to HF. LF aetiology was not associated with outcomes. Independent predictors of the primary endpoint were severe MR (adj.HR 1.71, p = 0.04) and TR (adj.HR 1.47, p = 0.04). Aortic valve replacement (adj.HR 0.76, p < 0.001) and mean transvalvular gradient ≥ 40 mmHg (adj.HR 0.39, p < 0.001) were protective.
The main cause of LFAS is reduced LVEF, while in preserved LVEF mixed causes and small LV volume prevailed, without association with the outcome. Severe mitral and tricuspid regurgitation were strongly associated with worse outcomes, while valve replacement and mean transvalvular gradient ≥ 40 mmHg emerged as protective factors."

However, temporal trends in mortality remains poorly understood. This study aimed to compare survival after urgent versus elective TAVR using a reconstructed individual patient data (IPD) meta-analysis.
PubMed, Embase, and Scopus were searched through August 2025. Studies reporting Kaplan-Meier (KM) survival curves for urgent versus elective TAVR were included. Survival data were digitally extracted from published KM curves, and IPD were reconstructed algorithmically using a two-stage approach. Kaplan-Meier curves and Cox frailty models estimated survival and hazard ratios (HRs). Landmark analysis at one-year post-procedure and restricted mean survival time (RMST) were also employed to compare survival.
Eleven studies including 77,108 patients were identified. Kaplan-Meier curves were available for 76,108 patients (urgent: 5,683; elective: 71,425) and used for reconstructed IPD analysis. Urgent TAVR was associated with higher early mortality (HR 1.83, 95% CI: 1.73-1.93; p < 0.001), with convergence beyond one year (HR 1.01, 95% CI: 0.84-1.22; p = 0.83). RMST analysis demonstrated a 6.5-month overall survival advantage in favor of elective TAVR (p = 0.001).
Urgent TAVR is associated with significantly increased early mortality compared with elective TAVR. These findings highlight the prognostic implications of procedural timing and support early referral for elective intervention in patients with severe AS."

As indications expand toward younger, low-risk and asymptomatic patients, the clinical paradigm is shifting from isolated valvular intervention to lifetime valve management. This requires balancing procedural planning to optimize the index procedure with long-term considerations, including prosthesis durability, coronary re-accessibility, need for TAVI-in-TAVI, and risk of patient-prosthesis mismatch and conduction abnormalities. Prosthesis and patient-related challenges remain central. Bicuspid aortic valve and small aortic annulus are anatomical features associated with an increased post-TAVI risk of paravalvular leak, patient-prosthesis mismatch, and conduction disturbances, though outcomes have improved with new-generation devices and meticulous preprocedural planning. Durability concerns are particularly relevant in younger patients, with TAVI-in-TAVI offering a feasible reintervention strategy yet raising issues of coronary re-access and potential patient-prosthesis mismatch. Conduction disturbances and permanent pacemaker implantation remain frequent after TAVI, underscoring the importance of implantation techniques and physiologic pacing strategies. Furthermore, concomitant coronary artery disease requires individualized revascularization strategies, with an increasing role of invasive physiological assessment. Beyond device-related factors, medical therapy may favourably influence clinical outcomes in patients undergoing TAVI, both in pre- and post-procedural setting. In this era of expanding indications, achieving durable, favourable outcomes requires a comprehensive approach that integrates anatomical and clinical considerations, individualized device selection, careful lifetime planning, and optimization of pharmacologic therapy."

Left atrial (LA) dysfunction is an established prognostic marker in various clinical settings. This study aimed to evaluate the correlation between LA function, assessed by strain parameters, and the incidence of permanent pacemaker (PPM) implantation or major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) in patients with SAS undergoing TAVI. A total of 157 patients with SAS treated with TAVI between January 2019 and April 2021 were screened. Patients with pre-existing cardiac implanted devices or permanent atrial fibrillation were excluded. The mean follow-up was 24 ± 13 months. LA function was assessed using transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) by measuring three strain parameters: LA reservoir strain (LASr), LA conduit strain (LASct), and LA contractile strain (LAScd). The study endpoints were the association between these strain parameters and the occurrence of PPM implantation or MACE during follow-up. Ninety-nine patients were included in the analysis. During follow-up, 43 patients experienced MACE. Mean values for LASr, LASct, and LAScd were 29.5 ± 12.7%, -18.7 ± 11.0%, and - 18.5 ± 7.3%, respectively. Patients requiring PPM implantation showed significantly reduced LA strain values compared to those who did not (LASr: 13.1% vs. 33.2%; LASct: -10.1% vs. -21.0%; LAScd: -6.7% vs. -21.6%, p < 0.001). Similarly, patients who developed MACE had reduced strain values compared to those without events (LASr: 21.9% vs. 35.4%; LASct: -14.3% vs. -21.8%; LAScd: -9.9% vs. -25.5%, p < 0.001). Pre-TAVI LA dysfunction, assessed through LA strain, is closely associated with increased risk of PPM implantation and MACE."

This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to quantify the peri-operative risks in patients with aortic stenosis undergoing non-cardiac surgery.
Following the development of our search strategy, we searched databases for relevant studies. The primary endpoint was all-cause in-hospital or 30-day mortality associated with aortic stenosis in patients undergoing non-cardiac surgery. Secondary endpoints included: myocardial infarction; heart failure; stroke; delirium; venous thromboembolism; and acute kidney injury.
Nineteen studies involving 100,486 patients were included. The estimated all-cause mortality was 3.8% (95%CI 3.7-3.9%) for patients with any degree of aortic stenosis and 9.6% (95%CI 7.7-12.1%) for those with severe aortic stenosis. A meta-analysis of 14 comparative studies involving 2,885,254 patients revealed significantly increased mortality in patients with aortic stenosis compared with those without aortic stenosis (relative risk 1.58, 95%CI 1.18-2.12, p < 0.001). Aortic stenosis was also associated with an elevated risk of postoperative myocardial infarction (relative risk 1.79, 95%CI 1.2-2.67, p < 0.001) and heart failure (relative risk 2.06, 95%CI 1.19-3.59, p < 0.001).
Aortic stenosis in patients undergoing non-cardiac surgery is associated with a three-fold relative increase in the risk of mortality. These results highlight the need for further delineation of which surgical procedures are associated with the greatest risk of poor peri-operative outcomes to guide heightened surveillance protocols, optimised peri-operative management and thresholds for pre-operative intervention."
PubMed,aortic stenosis,A ruptured dissecting aneurysm of the anterior radiculomedullary artery caused by hypoplastic vertebral artery angiography: case report.,Wenwen Chen; Xiu Shen; Yindan Yao,10.1186/s12883-025-04517-6,2025-12-12,BMC neurology,"Cerebral digital subtraction angiography (DSA) is increasingly utilized in the diagnosis of cerebrovascular disorders. We report a rare case of a ruptured dissecting aneurysm involving the anterior radiculomedullary artery of the cervical spinal cord, precipitated by angiography of a hypoplastic vertebral artery.
Cerebral computed tomography angiography (CTA) revealed severe stenosis of the M1 segment of the right middle cerebral artery in a 70-year-old woman who presented with paroxysmal weakness affecting the left upper and lower limbs. Dual antiplatelet therapy with aspirin and clopidogrel was initiated. On day 3, cerebral digital subtraction angiography (DSA) was performed. During continuous contrast injection into the right hypoplastic vertebral artery, the anterior radiculomedullary artery-a branch of the vertebral artery at the C6 vertebral level-underwent luminal dilation and subsequently ruptured, resulting in extensive extravasation of contrast medium into the spinal subarachnoid space. Non-contrast head CT confirmed widespread subarachnoid hemorrhage. Following 10 days of conservative medical management, follow-up head CT demonstrated complete resolution of the hemorrhage. The patient was discharged without significant neurological deficits and remained free of recurrent subarachnoid hemorrhage during a 3-year clinical follow-up period.
The occurrence of a ruptured dissecting aneurysm of the anterior radiculomedullary artery induced by vertebral angiography is exceedingly rare. We hypothesize that the sustained high-pressure and high-volume injection of contrast medium was responsible for the arterial dissection and subsequent rupture. During interventional procedures, neurointerventional radiologists should avoid selective angiography of small, hypoplastic vertebral arteries whenever possible to minimize the risk of such complications."

The role of angiographic lesion characteristics in predicting this discordance remains unclear.
To identify angiographic predictors of FFR/iFR discordance and define distinct angiographic phenotypes using unsupervised machine learning.
This prospective, single-center registry evaluated 401 intermediate coronary lesions from 221 patients with severe AS (aortic valve area < 1.0 cm2, mean gradient >40 mmHg) using FFR and iFR. Quantitative coronary angiography measured percent diameter stenosis (%DS), lesion length (LL), and other parameters. The primary outcome was FFR/iFR discordance. Receiver operating characteristic and decision curve analyses evaluated %DS predictive utility. K-means clustering was applied to %DS and LL to identify lesion phenotypes.
FFR/iFR discordance occurred in 30 lesions (7.5 %), exclusively as FFR-negative/iFR-positive pattern. Higher %DS was the only independent angiographic predictor of discordance (adjusted OR 1.35 per 10 % increase; 95 % CI 1.12-1.64; p = 0.002), with modest discriminative ability (AUC = 0.69). Cluster analysis identified three phenotypes: Cluster 0 (High %DS [median 75.0 %]/Intermediate LL [median 15.0 mm], n = 103); Cluster 1 (Low %DS [median 49.0 %]/Short-Intermediate LL [median 13.6 mm], n = 220); and Cluster 2 (Intermediate %DS [median 63.5 %]/Long LL [median 32.4 mm], n = 78). Discordance incidence was highest in Cluster 0 (16.5 %) versus Clusters 1 (2.7 %) and 2 (9.0 %) (p < 0.001).
In severe AS, FFR/iFR discordance manifests solely as FFR-negative/iFR-positive pattern. While %DS modestly predicts this mismatch, unsupervised clustering reveals that ""High %DS / Intermediate Length"" lesions primarily drive physiological discordance, identifying cases where iFR may overestimate severity due to AS-related hemodynamics."

Case reports,"Balloon entrapment during transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) is a rare but serious complication, especially in patients with severe valve calcification.
A 78-year-old woman with symptomatic severe aortic stenosis (peak velocity 7.23 m/s, preserved left ventricular ejection fraction 70%) underwent TAVR. After valve deployment, the balloon became entrapped within the prosthesis. Controlled postdilation was performed to disrupt the valve frame mesh, successfully releasing the balloon. The patient recovered well; at nearly 3 years of follow-up, she remains asymptomatic without rehospitalization for heart failure or neurologic events.
This case highlights the role of controlled postdilation as a safe and effective bailout strategy for balloon entrapment during TAVR. Reviewing the literature, balloon entrapment is rare but potentially life-threatening, and prompt recognition with appropriate technical solutions is critical for favorable outcomes.
Balloon entrapment during TAVR is rare but can be effectively managed with controlled postdilation, particularly in patients with severe calcification. Ensuring correct guidewire position in the left ventricle, confirmed by multiple fluoroscopic views, helps prevent balloon entrapment by avoiding passage through the stent mesh."

Suboptimal valve seating can elevate the transvalvular pressure gradient, while valve orientation and size may produce flow jets that impinge on the ascending aorta, potentially weakening the vessel wall. Such hemodynamic complications can compromise valve performance and patient outcomes. This study presents a computational fluid dynamics framework, derived from medical CT images, for preprocedural hemodynamic assessment of aortic valve replacement. The framework minimizes user input and delivers rapid results, enabling efficient evaluation of valve types, orientations, and their hemodynamic impact. The results demonstrate that non-optimal implantation angles substantially increase pressure drop across the valve, thereby imposing higher workload on the heart. This automated and efficient simulation framework demonstrates strong potential for clinical application, supporting precise planning and execution of valve implantation procedures to improve patient care."

The current report from the LANDMARK trial describes clinical outcomes, hemodynamic performances, and quality of life at 1 year.
This open-label, noninferiority trial enrolled 768 participants across 31 hospitals in Europe, New Zealand, and Brazil. Participants were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive either a Myval THV series or a contemporary THV (SAPIEN or Evolut series). The composite endpoint at 1 year included all-cause mortality, all strokes, and procedure- or valve-related hospitalizations. Clinical efficacy was defined as freedom from the composite endpoint. As recommended in Valve Academic Research Consortium-3, the previous composite endpoint combined with the assessment of quality of life at baseline and 1 year with the 12-Item Short Form Health Survey was reported as an extended composite endpoint. The noninferiority hypothesis was prespecified for the assessment of the primary endpoint at 30 days. Considering the specific 1-year composite endpoints of Valve Academic Research Consortium-3 and the event rate of 27.23% derived from recent studies, an a posteriori descriptive and exploratory noninferiority hypothesis was introduced with a noninferiority margin of 10.89%. The analysis was performed in the intention-to-treat population.
The mean age was 80 years, 48% were women, and the median Society of Thoracic Surgeons Predicted Risk of Mortality score was 2.6%. There was no significant difference in the Kaplan-Meier estimates of freedom from the composite endpoint at 365 days (Myval THV 87.0% vs contemporary THVs 86.9%). The Myval THV series was noninferior to the contemporary THVs for the composite endpoint (difference: -0.1%; 1-sided 95% CI: 3.9%; Pnoninferiority < 0.0001). Similarly, there were no significant differences in freedom from the extended composite endpoint (80.5% vs 77.3%; difference: 3.2%; 95% CI: -2.9% to 9.2%; P = 0.33).

Commonly used therapeutics include diuretics for CHF and antithrombotics 2 to reduce the risk of arterial thromboembolism (ATE), which do not directly affect myocardial function. This review summarizes the evidence for the use of pimobendan, a phosphodiesterase III inhibitor and calcium channel sensitizer, in feline cardiomyopathies. Potential benefits of pimobendan in cats include improved left ventricular systolic and diastolic function, reduced platelet aggregation, reduction in left atrial size, and improved left atrial and auricular systolic function.Drug details:Pimobendan is indicated for the treatment of CHF in conditions associated with systolic dysfunction (including dilated cardiomyopathy, restrictive cardiomyopathy, arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy and some cases with non-specific phenotypes) and has been used in the treatment of CHF secondary to hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. A dosage of pimobendan of 0.25 mg/kg PO q12h is generally well tolerated, and an approved oral solution is now available in the UK, EU, USA, Japan and Australia, which may facilitate administration in some cats; it should be noted, however, that pimobendan is not licensed for use in cats and marketing authorizations may vary between countries. Adverse events are uncommon with pimobendan but include gastrointestinal upset (anorexia, vomiting), transient changes in heart rate and possible worsening arrhythmias at higher doses. The use of pimobendan is contraindicated in cats with fixed obstructions of the left or right ventricular outflow tract (ie, congenital heart disease - pulmonic or aortic valvular stenosis).
This article reviews the use of pimobendan in cats for primary care veterinarians and includes practical case examples that reflect the typical use and recommendations for usage of pimobendan by the authors."
PubMed,aortic stenosis,VAPB Promotes Osteogenic Differentiation in Aortic Valve Interstitial Cells via Activation of the SMAD Signaling Pathway.,Xiaolin Liu; Kai Xing; Qiang Zheng; Ting Li; Xiaochun Ma; Tao Zhang; Jun Sun; Jian Song; Zhengjun Wang,10.2174/0109298673355591250121085134,2026,Current medicinal chemistry,"Prior studies have associated vesicle-associated membrane protein- associated protein B (VAPB) with various cardiovascular diseases, yet its role in calcific Aortic Valve Disease (CAVD) is not fully understood. This study aims to elucidate the relationship between VAPB and aortic valve calcification at both tissue and cellular molecular levels, exploring potential regulatory mechanisms.
The expression levels of VAPB in calcified valve tissues were assessed using immunohistochemical analysis. Osteogenic differentiation and calcification levels of valve interstitial cells (VICs) were evaluated by alizarin red staining, calcium content quantification, and the detection of the osteogenic markers. Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) was used to identify downstream pathways regulated by VAPB, immunoblotting was used to detect the expression of key molecules of SMAD signaling, and immunoprecipitation was performed to detect interactions between VAPB and SMAD1/5/9.
VAPB expression was significantly upregulated in the aortic valve leaflets of patients with CAVD. VICs with VAPB overexpression exhibited a significant increase in calcium content (p < 0.001) and upregulation of osteogenic markers RUNX2, osteocalcin, and osteopontin (p <0. 01). Conversely, VAPB knockdown reduced osteogenic differentiation in VICs. Furthermore, VAPB overexpression led to the enhanced expression of p-SMAD1/5/9 through activation of the SMAD signaling pathway (p < 0.05), while inhibition of the SMAD pathway abrogated the pro-calcification effects of VAPB. Dual immunofluorescence staining demonstrated colocalization of VAPB with SMAD1/5/9, and immunoprecipitation confirmed an interaction between VAPB and SMAD1/5/9.
The findings indicate that VAPB promotes osteogenic differentiation in aortic valve interstitial cells by activating the SMAD signaling pathway."
PubMed,aortic stenosis,Impact of mitral annular calcification in mitral valve surgery: 25-year Mayo Clinic experience.,Arman Arghami; Behrooz Banivaheb; Hartzell V Schaff,10.21037/acs-2025-mac-0187,2025-11-30,Annals of cardiothoracic surgery,"Annular calcification [mitral annular calcification (MAC)] may complicate mitral valve (MV) surgery, and long‑term outcome data are limited.
We reviewed adult patients undergoing MV surgery at our Clinic between January 2000 and December 2024. MAC was identified on preoperative imaging, and operative strategy prioritized repair when feasible and employed conservative debridement when necessary. Patients with MAC were matched 1:1 with patients without MAC using a propensity score.
Among 11,350 MV operations with or without concomitant procedures, 1,603 patients (14.1%) had MAC, the median age was 72.6 years [interquartile range (IQR), 65.3-78.6 years], 54.8% were female. In the MAC cohort, 21% of patients had a prior sternotomy. Concomitant aortic valve replacement (AVR) and coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) were performed in 32% and 24% of cases, respectively. Compared with propensity-matched controls, MAC patients did not exhibit significantly prolonged cardiopulmonary bypass times (115 vs. 112 minutes, P=0.485) or aortic cross-clamp durations (86 vs. 81 minutes, P=0.273). The 30-day hospital readmission rate was significantly higher among MAC patients (15.9% vs. 9.9%, P<0.001). Although 30-day mortality was elevated in the MAC group (5.8% vs. 4.2%), the difference was not statistically significant (P=0.171). In a subgroup analysis of matched groups undergoing primary isolated MV surgery, early mortality was 2.7% in patients with MAC and 0.5% in patients without MAC (P=0.111). Long-term, 10-year survival was significantly lower in MAC patients (43.6%) compared to matched controls (49.6%, P<0.001).
In this large single-center series, patients with MAC often had associated aortic valve and coronary artery disease, and 21% of them were undergoing a second procedure. Compared to matched patients without MAC, long-term survival was reduced in patients with MAC. This experience highlights the importance of accurate preoperative assessment and tailored surgical strategy to achieve acceptable outcomes of MV surgery in the presence of MAC."
PubMed,aortic stenosis,Echo-Vision-FM: a pre-training and fine-tuning framework for echocardiogram video vision foundation model.,Ziyang Zhang; Qinxin Wu; Sirui Ding; Xiaolong Wang; Jiancheng Ye,10.1038/s41467-025-66340-4,2025-12-11,Nature communications,"We introduce and evaluate Echo-Vision-FM (Echocardiogram Video Vision Foundation Model), a self-supervised video learning framework designed to pre-train a video encoder on large-scale, unlabeled echocardiogram data. The framework aims to generate robust, transferable video representations that enhance downstream performance across diverse echocardiogram datasets and clinical scenarios. Leveraging the publicly available MIMIC-IV-ECHO dataset, we employ an advanced masked auto-encoding strategy with 85% mask ratio to pre-train our echo-video encoder without requiring manual annotations. To further improve the learned representations, we introduce Spatial-Temporal Fusion Network (STF-Net), which integrates spatial and temporal correlations from the learned video representations through dual pathways that process joint and disjoint space-time features. Echo-Vision-FM demonstrated outstanding performance in heart function diagnosis, achieving an accuracy of 0.905, an F1 score of 0.941, and an Area Under the Curve (AUC) of 0.931 on EchoNet-Dynamic dataset, while reaching an AUC of 0.849 for aortic stenosis diagnosis on TMED dataset. In cardiac morphological value estimation, Echo-Vision-FM outperformed state-of-the-art models, achieving a mean absolute error of 3.87% and an r² value of 0.825 in left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) prediction on EchoNet-Dynamic dataset. The model also showed substantial improvements in estimating end-systolic and end-diastolic volumes, with r² values of 0.782 and 0.742, respectively. On the CAMUS dataset, our end-to-end approach achieved a Pearson correlation coefficient of 86.49% for LVEF estimation, significantly outperforming traditional segmentation-based methods while eliminating the need for intermediate post-processing steps. Incorporating STF-Net resulted in further performance improvements across all tasks, with consistent gains observed when combined with both randomly initialized and pre-trained encoders. Echo-Vision-FM provides a powerful, scalable approach to echocardiogram analysis, with significant potential for clinical diagnostics and research, demonstrating robust cross-institutional generalizability and data efficiency in low-resource settings."

With a focus on the prevalent psychological complications following the onset of this condition, this study aimed to explore the correlation between antenatal depression and Corona disease anxiety, personality traits, and postpartum depression during the COVID-19 pandemic.                                                           Materials and Methods:                     This cross-sectional descriptive-analytical study investigated women receiving care at health centers affiliated with Kerman University of Medical Sciences during the last month of their pregnancy and the postpartum period in 2022. Following the acquisition of informed consent, participants were assessed using various measures, including demographic and obstetric information, the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale, the Corona Disease Anxiety Scale (CDAS), and the NEO Personality Inventory-Revised during their third trimester of pregnancy. The same group of participants completed the Edinburgh Depression Scale and the Corona Disease Anxiety Scale (CDAS) 4-6 weeks after childbirth.                                                           Results and Discussion:                     There was a significant correlation between family income, unwanted pregnancy as perceived by both the mother and father, and antenatal depression. Additionally, marital satisfaction played a significant role in postpartum depression. Furthermore, antenatal depression was significantly associated with neuroticism, agreeableness, and physical symptoms related to Corona disease anxiety. Personality traits, with the exception of extroversion and conscientiousness, and various domains of Corona disease anxiety, excluding psychological symptoms, were also significantly associated with postpartum depression.                                                           Conclusion:                     During pandemics or epidemics, such as the COVID-19 outbreak, experiencing mental distress during pregnancy can contribute to mental health issues during the postpartum period. This risk is particularly true in individuals with unique personality traits, emphasizing the need for increased focus on mental health within prenatal care during these crises."
Crossref,valvular heart disease,The Severity of Disease and Hospital Length of Stay for the First and Second Admission of COVID-19 Patients: An Observational Study from Southeastern Iran,Milad Ahmadi Gohari; Mohammad Hossein Mehrolhassani; Shoboo Rahmati; Elham Sharifpoor; Hossein Mirzaei; Yunes Jahani,10.2174/0126667975341163241129050027,2026-10,Coronaviruses,"Background:                     This study aimed to investigate the severity of disease and length of hospital stay for COVID-19 patients admitted to a hospital in southeastern Iran.                                                           Method:                     This cross-sectional study was conducted in Kerman, Iran. Data were collected from patients who visited Afzalipour Hospital in Kerman more than twice during the COVID-19 epidemic from the end of February 2020 to March 21, 2021. We conducted two key analyses: 1. Mixed effect logistic regression was used to check the relationship between the variables and COVID-19 severity. 2. Mixed effect linear regression was used to check the relationship between the variables and the length of stay in the hospital.                                                           Results:                     The findings indicated that the most important risk factors for the severity of COVID-19 were heart diseases (OR=1.67,95%CI:1.20-2.30), increasing age (OR=2.23 for age&gt;54, 95%CI:1.70- 2.90), male gender (OR=1.47,95%CI:1.10-1.96), respiratory diseases other than asthma, and frequency of admission (OR=1.60,95%CI:1.20-2.15). All patients who underwent readmission experienced a shorter duration of hospitalization during their subsequent admission (OR=0.94,95%CI:0.91,0.96) and had a higher mortality rate (30% within 14 days, 26.6% between 14-90 days). Patients readmitted at intervals of 14-90 days and greater than 90 days exhibited lower disease severity compared to those readmitted within the 0-14 day period.                                                           Conclusion:                     Examining readmissions, the severity of COVID-19, and the length of hospital stay in affected patients are important factors for planning and allocating resources for COVID-19 management and treatment. These factors can help policymakers develop effective clinical guidelines for hospitalization or outpatient treatment of COVID-19 patients and contribute to reducing the burden of disease in the community."

Kinovea, as an accessible motion-analysis software, provides both visual and quantitative feedback. However, its application in supporting technique development among beginner athletes remains insufficiently explored. Aim: This study aims to describe the use of Kinovea in biomechanics training and examine its contribution to the awareness of kinematic characteristics and movement techniques among beginner athletes. Methods: A descriptive qualitative design involved 72 beginner athletes aged 18–25 years selected through purposive sampling. Data were collected over 16 weeks through interviews, field observations, and motion video recordings analyzed using Kinovea. Kinematic data focused on joint angles, stride behavior, and movement phases during walking, running, and the flight phase. Qualitative data were analyzed using content analysis with NVivo 12, while kinematic results were interpreted descriptively to identify performance patterns and areas for technical refinement. Result: Kinematic analysis showed coordinated joint-angle patterns across all phases. Walking analysis identified arm swing angles of 50.9°–58.8° and leg separation angles of 64.3°–67.2°, indicating a stable gait rhythm. The running analysis revealed knee angles of 68.8°–69.8° and elbow angles of 87.6°–89.1°, indicating efficient propulsive mechanics. The flight phase demonstrated knee angles of 81.2°–87.8° and elbow angles of 80.4°–88.3°, suggesting effective momentum use and postural stability. These measurements supported stride-efficiency assessment and technique evaluation. Qualitative findings revealed that Kinovea enabled athletes to interpret movement phases and identify technical inefficiencies through slow-motion and frame-by-frame visualization. Conclusion: Kinovea supports basic motion analysis by providing clear kinematic information and helping beginner athletes observe and refine their movement techniques. The findings also offer practical value for coaches by enabling more precise identification of inefficient patterns and guiding targeted corrections during early-stage training."
