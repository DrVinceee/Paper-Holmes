PubMed,aortic stenosis,2-[18F]FDG PET identifies metabolic substrates of sudden cardiac death in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.,Patrícia Marques-Alves; Maria João Vidigal Ferreira; Rodolfo Silva; Andreia Gomes; Antero Abrunhosa; Miguel Castelo-Branco; Lino Gonçalves,10.1038/s41598-025-25140-y,2025-11-21,Scientific reports,"Risk stratification for sudden cardiac death (SCD) in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) remains challenging. Enhanced imaging techniques could improve prognostic accuracy. This study investigates myocardial resting perfusion and metabolism using [13N]-NH3 and 2-[18F]FDG PET/CT and their correlation with HCM SCD risk scores. Thirty non-obstructive HCM patients (mean age 54 years, 57% male) with a mean SCD risk score of 3.7 ± 2.5% were evaluated. Myocardial 2-[18F]FDG metabolism and rest [13N]-NH3 perfusion PET/CT were analyzed. Hypermetabolism (2-[18F]FDG uptake with normal perfusion) occurred in 53% of cases (mean extension 11.8 ± 17.2%), while fibrosis (reduced perfusion without 2-[18F]FDG uptake) averaged 10.3 ± 10.2%. Mean rest myocardial blood flow (MBF) was 0.75 ± 0.21 ml/min/g, increasing with hypermetabolism extension (0.83 ± 0.32 ml/min/g for ≥ 20%, p = 0.019) but decreasing with SCD scores ≥ 6% (0.58 ± 0.05 ml/min/g, p = 0.034). Hypermetabolism correlated moderately with SCD risk scores (rho = 0.38, p = 0.036), with hypermetabolism peaking at intermediate risk (23.5 ± 27.1%) before declining. Fibrosis extension consistently increased with SCD risk (rho = 0.38, p = 0.039). In conclusion, our findings identify important correlations between myocardial hypermetabolism and fibrosis and SCD risk in HCM. Hypermetabolism peaks in intermediate-risk patients, reflecting earlier disease stages, while fibrosis increases with higher SCD risk, signaling disease progression and structural damage."

Adventitial lymphatic vessels employ lymphatic valves to eliminate infiltrated harmful substances from arterial walls, thereby preserving vascular wall integrity. The traditional Chinese medicine ""Gualou-Xiebai"" (GLXB) has been shown to have a definite therapeutic effect on AS by inhibiting aortic plaque deposition and reducing vascular damage. However, whether the effect of GLXB on ameliorating vascular damage in AS is related to lymphatic drainage and lymphatic valves formation has not been clarified.
To investigate whether GLXB alleviates the plaque lesions of AS by regulating the function of lymphatic drainage and its potential mechanism.
Doppler ultrasound imaging were used to validate AS lesions to confirm successful model establishment. HE staining and morphological photography were used to evaluate the plaque area. The bilateral branches of the left common carotid artery were ligation to block the lymphatic drainage of the aortic ventricular duct in AS mice, and the mouse lymphatic vessel blockade model was established. The lymphatic vessel contraction frequency and leakage were detected by near-infrared two-zone imaging and Evans blue staining, and the lymphatic drainage function was evaluated. Lymphatic valve formation was evaluated through immunofluorescence analysis of specific biomarker expression. After lymphatic endothelial cells (LECs) were treated with serum containing GLXB or transfected with VEGFR3 in LECs, the proliferation and migration of LECs were evaluated by CCK8 method, transwell and immunofluorescent staining of Ki67. The expression of lymphatic-associated proteins was detected by Western blot, and the expression of IL-1β and IL-18 in serum was detected by ELISA kit.
GLXB promotes lymphatic drainage in the adventitia and ameliorates vasculopathy in AS mice by maintaining lymphatic drainage function, which is related to the promotion of lymphatic valve formation. Meanwhile, GLXB promotes lymphatic valve formation based on the fact that GLXB promoted the proliferation and migration of LECs, while also the expression of various markers of lymphatic valve formation in LECs. Mechanistically, we demonstrated that VEGFR3 is a key target of GLXB in promoting LECs development and maintaining the function of adventiolar lymphatic drainage to improve vasculopathy in AS. Rutin, and Kaempferol-3-O-β-rutinoside are the key active components of GLXB targeting VEGFR3 to improve the proliferation and migration of LECs after injury.
GLXB inhibits LECs injury by targeting VEGFR3, promotes lymphatic valve formation, maintains lymphatic drainage function, and reduces AS."

Patients who underwent AVR between 2012 and 2021 at our center were retrospectively analyzed in two groups, AS and AR. The final 278 samples possessed detailed clinical information of the patients. The six items were measured in preoperative CT and compared in significant difference in number.
No significant differences were found in the patients' characteristics between the AS and AR groups except for age, sex and body surface area. The number of younger and male patients was higher in the AR group than in the AS group (P <  0.01), including a larger body surface area (P <  0.01). The AR group had larger rightward laterality aorta and third ICS (AS vs AR - 3.9 ± 8.9 vs 0.6 ± 8.9 mm, P < 0.01; 14.2 ± 1.3 vs 15 ± 1.6 cm, P <  0.01, respectively).
Preoperative CT revealed thoracic anatomical differences between AS and AR patients undergoing MIAVR. Although no direct correlation with cross-clamp time was observed except for AP distance in both AR and AS, surgeons should be aware that these anatomical features-particularly the rightward aorta and deeper and more caudally positioned AV in AR patients to make surgical decision making, surgical planning. CT-based evaluation is a valuable tool for guiding approach strategy and patient selection in MIAVR."

Case reports,"Left ventricular (LV) thrombus is traditionally a contraindication to transcatheter aortic valve replacement due to embolic risk. Consequently, management of valvular cardiogenic shock complicated by LV thrombus identifies unique challenges that require innovative strategies.
A 58-year-old woman with critical bioprosthetic aortic stenosis, cardiogenic shock, and large LV thrombus (2.8 × 2.6 cm) underwent successful valve-in-valve transcatheter aortic valve replacement after systemic fibrinolysis bridge therapy.
Current guidelines contraindicate transcatheter aortic valve replacement in patients with LV thrombus. This case demonstrates the novel use of low-dose, slow infusion tissue plasminogen activator as a bridge therapy to enable life-saving intervention.
Pulsed delivery of small doses of systemic fibrinolytic with hemodynamic and echocardiographic monitoring may be suitable as a bridge to definitive management in valvular shock patients with LV thrombus. Minimizing instrumentation during structural heart procedures complicated by LV thrombus is critical.
Low-dose, slow-infusion fibrinolysis coupled with echocardiographic monitoring may serve as bridge therapy to urgent structural cardiology intervention in carefully selected patients with LV thrombus and cardiogenic shock."
PubMed,aortic stenosis,Does Left Atrial Size and E/e' Predict Outcomes in Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy?,Brandon Tillson; Stephen Lord; Christopher Eggett,10.1111/echo.70345,2025-11,"Echocardiography (Mount Kisco, N.Y.)","Atrial arrhythmia is prevalent in patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) and is prognostically deleterious. Catheter ablation (CA) has poor efficacy in HCM, making predictors of outcome valuable. Left atrial size is associated with morbidity and mortality, and E/e' has been proposed. The current study evaluates whether these predict non-paroxysmal atrial arrhythmia, interventions for atrial arrhythmia and all-cause mortality.
233 patients from the echocardiography database were included; patients with any mitral annular calcification were excluded. Medical records were reviewed for sample characteristics. Survival analysis was performed for left atrial diameter (LAD), left atrial volume index (LAVi, by area-length method), and E/e' with respect to endpoints, namely: non-paroxysmal atrial arrhythmia; atrial intervention (composite of CA and pace-and-ablate); and all-cause mortality. If LAD or LAVi were significant in multivariate analysis, ROC analysis and DeLong's test were performed to evaluate and compare their discriminative power.
Over a median follow-up of 8 years (median age 53, 73% male), the overall prevalence of non-paroxysmal atrial arrhythmia was 31%. In multivariate models, LAVi was predictive of non-paroxysmal atrial arrhythmia and atrial intervention; LAD was only predictive of arrhythmia. LAVi demonstrated greater discriminative power for predicting atrial intervention. E/e' was not predictive of any outcome. No echocardiographic variable predicted death in multivariate analysis.
LAVi may have greater clinical utility compared to two-dimensional measurements like LAD. Future work should clarify which measures of left atrial size are most appropriate in clinical practice."

However, RV echocardiographic assessment is challenging due to RV geometric changes. Currently, a 3D-derived RV assessment is recommended. Previous studies have shown that RV function is reduced more in surgical aortic valve replacement (SAVR) than in transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR); however, RV assessment in these studies was mostly performed using 2-dimensional echocardiography. Moreover, very few studies have assessed the difference in RV function between full sternotomy (full-SAVR) and mini-sternotomy AVR (mini-SAVR). This study assessed RV function in three types of AVR using 3D RV ejection fraction (RVEF), tricuspid annular plane systolic excursion (TAPSE), and RV fractional area change (RVFAC).
This is a prospective, observational study at a university hospital setting. Participants are adult patients who underwent TAVR, mini-SAVR, and full-SAVR.
Sixty-seven patients were enrolled in this study (22, 22, and 23 patients in the TAVR, mini-SAVR, and full-SAVR groups, respectively). The % change (pre- and post-procedure) in 3D RVEF, RVFAC, and TPASE in TAVR, mini-SAVR, and full-SAVR were as follows: 3D RVEF: 4.51 ± 10.89 (TAVR), -13.67 ± 19.81 (mini-SAVR), and -8.36 ± 18.24 (full-SAVR) (p = 0.003).
4.35 ± 12.33 (TAVR), -8.28 ± 23.88 (mini-SAVR), and -9.49 ± 20.92 (full-SAVR) (p < 0.001).
10.46 ± 24.17 (TAVR), -22.14 ± 32.48 (mini-SAVR), and -32.48 ± 31.81 (full-SAVR) (p < 0.001). Comparisons were adjusted for age, gender, central venous pressure, catecholamine amount, and each preoperative RV index.
There was significantly more worsening of 3D RVEF, RVFAC and TAPSE after full-SAVR and mini-SAVR than after TAVR."

MW has been widely used to assess LV function after TAVI in patients with aortic stenosis (AS); however, its application in this context for pure aortic regurgitation (AR) remains rare. This study aims to (1) assess the specific and overall trends of conventional echocardiographic and MW indices after TAVI in patients with pure AR, providing insight into the process and mid-term outcomes of post-TAVI LV functional improvement in this population; (2) evaluate the post-TAVI functional recovery patterns in patients with preserved vs. reduced left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF); and (3) explore the relationship between MW indices and LV reverse remodeling (LVRR) following TAVI in patients with pure AR.
In this prospective cohort study, 43 patients with pure AR who underwent TAVI between January 2023 and July 2024 were enrolled. Serial transthoracic echocardiography was performed at baseline and at 1 week, 1 month, 3 months, and 6 months post-TAVI. Conventional echocardiographic parameters and noninvasive MW indices were analyzed offline.
LVEF, LVGLS, LVGWI, LVGCW, and LVGWE exhibited an overall trend of initial decline followed by subsequent improvement after TAVI, whereas GWW showed an initial increase followed by a decrease. In contrast, LVEDD and LVEDV demonstrated a continuous decline throughout the follow-up period. At 6 months post-TAVI, LVGWI, LVGCW, and LVGWE were significantly reduced, while LVGWW was significantly increased compared with baseline (all p < 0.05). At baseline, post-TAVI, and at 6-month follow-up, LVGLS, LVGWI, and LVGCW were all significantly higher in the LVRR group compared to the non-LVRR group (p < 0.05).
TAVI effectively improves LV function in pure AR, irrespective of baseline LVEF. Noninvasive MW analysis proved to be an effective tool for assessing postoperative improvements in LV myocardial function. The reduction in MW indices at 6 months post-TAVI may reflect partial recovery rather than functional deterioration. Better MW indices at baseline may be associated with LVRR."

Following stabilization, staged TAVR was performed within 15 hours through the same femoral access. The patient was discharged on day 12 with complete left ventricular recovery (ejection fraction, 65% to 70%) at 6 months.

Echocardiography revealed a peak/mean pressure gradient of 101/61 mm Hg and a membranous ventricular septal aneurysm protruding into the right ventricular outflow tract without shunt flow. Right heart catheterization demonstrated right ventricular outflow tract obstruction with a peak pressure gradient of 11 mm Hg. Aortic valve replacement using a bioprosthetic valve and enfolding repair of the membranous ventricular septal aneurysm were performed. The folded aneurysmal tissue was compressed and reinforced with double-applied patches from both the left and right ventricular sides via aortotomy and right atriotomy, respectively. The postoperative course was uneventful. This novel Bi-Patch Enfolding Repair, termed the ""egg muffin technique,"" provides a simple and effective method for volume reduction of aneurysmal tissue. Unlike aneurysm resection with defect closure, it mitigates the risk of iatrogenic shunt formation and atrioventricular block."

Ultra-high resolution (UHR) photon-counting detector CT (PCD-CT) reduces calcium blooming. This study aimed to evaluate the diagnostic performance of UHR CCTA with PCD-CT for detecting coronary stenoses in patients with a high coronary calcium burden compared to invasive coronary angiography (ICA).
In this IRB-approved single-center study, patients with Agatston scores > 600 were included, who underwent ICA and coronary UHR PCD-CT angiography within 2 months. 94% of patients underwent CT prior to transcatheter aortic valve replacement. Coronary arteries were graded for diameter stenosis severity (> 50, > 70%) by two blinded, independent readers. Accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity of CCTA were calculated using ICA as the reference standard. Subgroup analyses were performed across Agatston score groups (600-999, 1000-1999, 2000-2999, and > 3000).
62 patients (mean age, 76 ± 9 years, 16 women) were included. The median Agatston score was 2423 (IQR: 1085-3340). Across all Agatston categories, CCTA demonstrated high diagnostic accuracy and strong agreement with ICA (Cohen's kappa 0.71-1.00). In patients with Agatston scores > 3000 (n = 18), the diagnostic performance of coronary UHR PCD-CT angiography for detecting > 50% (sensitivity 92-100%, specificity 83-100%) and > 70% diameter stenosis (sensitivity 88-100%, specificity 89-100%) remained high for both readers. There was no correlation between the Agatston score and diagnostic error (p > 0.05).
UHR CCTA with PCD-CT provides high diagnostic performance even in patients with extensive coronary calcifications.
Question In patients with severe coronary calcification, conventional coronary CT angiography often suffers from blooming artifacts, reducing accuracy and causing unnecessary invasive procedures. Findings Ultra-high resolution coronary angiography with photon-counting detector CT showed high sensitivity and specificity for detecting stenoses, even at Agatston scores > 3000. Clinical relevance Ultra-high resolution coronary CT angiography enables accurate noninvasive detection of stenoses in heavily calcified vessels, potentially reducing invasive coronary angiography."

This study aimed to compare outcomes of TAVR between patients with MMAVD and those with isolated severe AS. Between January 2019 and June 2024, 848 patients who underwent TAVR at our center were identified for analysis, including 75 with MMAVD and 773 with isolated severe AS. To minimize confounding, 73 MMAVD patients were matched with 264 isolated AS patients using 1:4 propensity score matching for comparative analysis. The primary endpoint was all-cause mortality; secondary endpoints included heart failure rehospitalization, left ventricular (LV) reverse remodeling, and procedural complications. Continuous variables were compared using independent samples t-tests, categorical variables using chi-square or Fisher's exact tests, and survival using Kaplan-Meier curves with log-rank tests. At baseline, MMAVD patients exhibited greater LV dilation (LV end-diastolic diameter [LVEDD]: 56.07±9.04 vs. 50.68±7.70, p<0.001) and hypertrophy (LV mass index [LVMI]: 163.68±50.17 vs. 151.59±44.38, p=0.026). Post-TAVR, MMAVD showed superior reverse remodeling (ΔLVEDD: -7.18±9.75 vs. -2.52±7.64, p<0.001), though LVEF recovery was comparable (ΔLVEF: 5.47±13.98 vs. 6.88±15.20, p=0.52). Survival rates were similar (log-rank p=0.370), but MMAVD had higher 1-year heart failure rehospitalization (5.97% vs. 0.96%, p=0.032). In conclusion, TAVR with self-expandable valves yields comparable survival in MMAVD and isolated AS, with more pronounced reverse remodeling in MMAVD despite advanced baseline disease."

The purpose of this study was to compare simulated mechanical metrics post-TAVR between BAV and trileaflet patients with calcific aortic stenosis.
Pre-TAVR computed tomography scans of trileaflet (n = 22) and BAV (n = 25) were used to segment the aortic valve. Simulated balloon-expandable stent deployment was performed from a previously developed protocol. The bioprosthetic leaflets were then pressurized under a physiological pressure. Stent waist expansion ratio, aspect ratio (AR), leaflet systolic normalized geometric orifice area (GOA), and maximum leaflet diastolic stress were measured.
BAVs had lower waist expansion ratio (87.8% ± 2.6% vs 89.4% ± 1.4%; P < 0.001), lower waist AR (94.6% ± 2.8% vs 98.2% ± 1.0%; P < 0.001), lower normalized GOA (88.9% ± 0.8% vs 89.5% ± 0.7%; P < 0.01), and higher maximum stress (2.81 ± 0.44 vs 2.29 ± 0.25 MPa; P < 0.001) on average compared to trileaflet patients, respectively. Within the BAV group, calcium volume was correlated with waist AR (r = -0.75, P < 0.001), normalized GOA (r = -0.68, P < 0.001), and maximum stress (r = 0.66, P < 0.001).
Balloon-expandable TAVR for BAV has worse simulated mechanical metrics compared to TAVR for trileaflet aortic valve patients and is associated with high calcium volume."

Limited evidence exists on whether early postprocedural administration of atrioventricular (AV) nodal blocking medications impacts these outcomes.
This study aimed to evaluate the safety of AV nodal blocker use within the first 48 h after TAVR.
A retrospective cohort study was conducted in adults who underwent TAVR from January 1, 2016 to April 2, 2024. The population was divided into two cohorts based on administration of an AV nodal blocker within the first 48 h. The primary endpoint was the rate of second-degree or higher AVB at 30 days.
A total of 756 patients met the study criteria, with 381 (50.4%) receiving an AV nodal blocker within 48 h. The primary outcome occurred in 2.7% of patients who did not receive an AV nodal blocker and 1.6% of those who did (p = 0.297). No significant difference was observed in second-degree or higher AVB at discharge, PPM placement at 30 days, or hospital length of stay. All-cause mortality at 30 days was significantly higher in the AV nodal blocker group (2.4% vs. 0.3%, p = 0.011), but this difference did not remain significant after adjusting for covariates.
AV nodal blocker use within 48 h following TAVR was not associated with an increased rate of second-degree or higher AVB or PPM placement. These findings suggest that AV nodal blockers may be considered in the immediate post-TAVR period based on risk-benefit assessment."

Current tissue-based transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) devices are designed for TAV anatomy and merely approved for BAV, leading to poor annular fit, paravalvular leak, thrombosis, and limited durability-especially problematic for younger BAV patients. This study presents PolyV-B, a first-of-its-kind polymeric TAVR device tailored to BAV anatomy, aimed at improving durability, hemodynamics, and outcomes through advanced computational modeling.
PolyV-B features a sutureless, eccentric valve with asymmetric xSIBS polymeric leaflets and a fatigue-optimized nitinol stent with a centerline groove. The 29-mm device incorporates a rhombic stent profile and large cells to enhance anchoring and coronary access. Developed on the 3DExperience platform, it was virtually deployed in six patient-specific BAV anatomies. Its performance was compared to the Evolut R using finite element modeling and fluid-structure interaction (FSI) simulations.
Simulations demonstrated that PolyV-B offers a 50% strain reduction during crimping, improved annular fit, enhanced sealing, and reduced thrombogenic risk. Flow simulations confirmed superior hemodynamics and a larger orifice area compared to Evolut R.
The PolyV-B TAVR device introduces design innovations that enhance durability, hemodynamics, and usability. Simulations in six patient-specific BAV anatomies demonstrated advantages over the Evolut R device. Optimization enabled efficient feasibility assessment, supporting the development of a tailored, clinically impactful solution for the BAV patient population facing unmet clinical needs."

The aim of this study is to describe long-term outcomes after the ASO in patients with TGA, and to explore anatomical and clinical factors potentially associated with adverse outcomes, comparing simple and complex TGA. Since December 2001 to October 2023, 233 patients underwent arterial switch operation (158 simple TGA and 75 complex TGA). Kaplan-Meier analysis assessed survival and reoperation risk, Chi-square test and T-student test have been performed in order to analyse pre-, intra- and post-operative data among the two groups. In-hospital mortality was 1.7%. Overall survival rates were 97.9%, 96.8% and 96.8% at 5, 10 and 15 years, respectively. Freedom from surgical reoperation at 15 years was 98.3% in simple TGA and 91% in complex TGA at 15 years (p = 0.039). Reinterventions were infrequent and mainly related to pacemaker implantation and right ventricular outflow tract obstruction. Coronary artery stenosis occurred in 5 patients (2.2%). Risk factors analysis suggested that anatomical complexity such as intramural coronary artery (p = 0.003), aortic arch hypoplasia (p = 0.004), aortic arch interruption (p = < 0.001) and coronary reimplantation with button technique (p = 0.018) are predictive factors for mortality. In addition, complex TGA (p = 0.022) and post-operative aortic regurgitation (p < 0.001) are identified as potential predictive factors for reintervention. Arterial switch operation provides excellent long-term survival and low reintervention rates in TGA. These results support tailored long-term surveillance, particularly for patients with complex anatomy or coronary anomalies."

Case reports,"This clinical vignette introduces the frame overlap technique (FOT), which uses 2 large stent frames (LSFs) of the Evolut FX+ (Medtronic) valve to facilitate coronary ostial visualization after transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI).
An 82-year-old woman with severe aortic stenosis and coronary artery disease underwent successful TAVI with Evolut FX+. The FOT clarified the spatial relationship between the left coronary ostium and the LSF, enabling selective coronary cannulation.
The FOT provides a quick, angiography-guided method to evaluate coronary access after Evolut FX+ implantation, which is particularly valuable when rapid access is required in patients with coronary artery disease."

While certain LMNA gene mutations are known to cause cardiomyopathy and conduction system disease, severe early-onset calcific valvular heart disease is not conventionally considered a typical feature of MADA. This report describes two brothers from a consanguineous Han Chinese family who presented with classical MADA phenotypes alongside severe, early-onset cardiac valvular calcification. Genetic investigation revealed that both affected brothers carried a homozygous missense mutation, c.785A &amp;gt; G (p.Glu262Gly), in the LMNA gene. The elder brother, aged 41, successfully underwent transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) due to severe aortic valve stenosis. This finding represents the first association, to our knowledge, between the homozygous LMNA c.785A &amp;gt; G (p.Glu262Gly) mutation and significant severe early-onset cardiac valvular calcification manifesting as a prominent feature within the MADA phenotype, thus expanding the clinical spectrum associated with MADA and this specific LMNA variant. This case highlights a potentially underrecognized cardiovascular manifestation in MADA patients and underscores the importance of comprehensive cardiac assessment in affected individuals, particularly those from consanguineous families."
OpenAlex,valvular heart disease,Burden of non-rheumatic valvular heart disease globally and in China from 1990 to 2021: a systematic analysis for the global burden of disease study 2021,Wen Chen; Jiyong Wei; Zheng Xiaoyu; Yanni Lan; Baoshi Zheng,10.3389/fcvm.2025.1641448,2025-11-20,Frontiers in Cardiovascular Medicine,"Background Non-rheumatic valvular heart disease (NRVHD), driven by aging populations and epidemiological transitions, has become the dominant form of valvular heart disease globally, yet its burden trends and demographic disparities remain undercharacterized. This study quantifies the global and Chinese burden of NRVHD from 1990 to 2021, analyzing age-sex disparities and temporal trends. Methods Using data from the Global Burden of Disease (GBD) 2021 Study. First, the number of incidence, prevalence, deaths, and disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) cases, along with their corresponding age-standardized rates (ASRs), were reported globally and in China, stratified by different sub-types in 2021. These sub-types included sex and age groups. Second, to explore the temporal trend of the disease burden, data from 1990 to 2021 were analyzed both globally and by sub-types. The estimated annual percentage change (EAPC) value was calculated using a linear regression model. Results In 2021, NRVHD caused 2,206,928 global incidence cases (ASR: 25.0/100,000) and 28.4 million prevalence cases (ASR: 335.3/100,000), with 181,078 deaths (ASR: 2.31/100,000) and 3.24 million DALYs (ASR: 39.7/100,000). China accounted for 292,215 incidence cases (ASR: 12.8/100,000) and 3.28 million prevalence cases (ASR: 156.2/100,000), demonstrating lower deaths cases (ASDR: 0.13 vs. global 2.31/100,000) but accelerated burden growth. From 1990 to 2021, global incidence rose 129%, while China's surged 220%. Age-standardized deaths rate declined globally and in China, contrasting with rising prevalence. Males bore higher burdens globally and in China, with elderly populations disproportionately affected. Conclusion NRVHD burden has escalated globally, characterized by rising morbidity amid declining mortality, a paradox amplified in China. While therapeutic advances and hypertension control contributed to mortality reductions, persistent sex-age disparities and rural-urban inequities demand targeted strategies. China's rapid epidemiological transition underscores the urgency of integrating primary prevention, equitable technology access, and enhanced surveillance to address aging-related valvulopathies."

As the most serious sequel of acute rheumatic fever (ARF) caused by Streptococcus pyogenes, RHD arises from molecular mimicry that drives autoimmune damage of cardiac valves. We systematically reviewed human studies (1977–2025) following PRISMA to clarify systemic immune signatures associated with valvular pathology. Searches of PubMed, LILACS, ScienceDirect, and Web of Science found 29 studies: 22 RHD and 7 ARF. In ARF, elevations in IL-6, IL-8, IL-17F, GM-CSF, TNF-a, and CXCL10 occurred alongside increased activity of CD4+ Th1 and MAIT cells. In RHD, a consistent inflammatory–fibrotic profile emerged with raised IL-17, IFN-γ, TNF-a, TGF-β1, Tenascin-C, and prothymosin alpha (ProTα) in blood and valve tissue. CD4+ and CD8+ T cells were implicated in valve injury; ProTα correlated with cytotoxic activity of circulating CD8+ T cells. Several mediators (IL-6, TNF-a, IL-8, CXCL10, CCL2, CCL19) were identified in RHD studies as being associated with inflammation, cell recruitment, and clinical severity. Systemic dysregulation mirrored local valve inflammation, suggesting circulating molecules may index ongoing cardiac damage. These findings underscore a central role for T cells and pro-inflammatory cytokines in RHD and highlight candidate prognostic markers and therapeutic targets to inform translational studies and trials."

DeSimone; Abhishek Deshmukh,10.1111/jce.70192,2025-11-17,Journal of Cardiovascular Electrophysiology,"ABSTRACT Background Transvenous lead removal (TLR) in patients with a history of mediastinal radiation poses unique challenges due to potential radiation‐induced fibrosis, vascular changes, and anatomical distortion, which may increase procedural complexity and complication risk. However, contemporary data on clinical outcomes in this population remain limited. Methods We analyzed the National Readmissions Database (2016–2021) to identify adults (≥ 18 years) undergoing TLR. Patients were stratified by prior mediastinal radiation. Baseline characteristics were compared using standard statistical tests. Multivariable logistic regression was used to evaluate the association between prior mediastinal radiation and in‐hospital outcomes, 30‐day mortality, and 30‐day readmissions after adjustment for demographics and comorbidities. Results A total of 48,985 patients underwent TLR, of whom 735 (1.5%) had a history of mediastinal radiation. Compared with patients without radiation, those with prior radiation were older (70.1 vs. 66.2 years, p &lt; 0.01), were more frequently females (38.2% vs. 31.6%, p &lt; 0.01), and had higher rates of valvular heart disease, atrial fibrillation, and peripheral vascular disease. Adjusted analyses demonstrated no increased risk of in‐hospital mortality (2.3% vs. 3.4%; adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 0.65, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.41–1.18, p = 0.29) or major complications, including cardiac arrest, pericardial complications, vascular injury, pulmonary complications, or embolic events. Similarly, (3.6% vs. 5.3%; aOR 0.76, 95% CI 0.48–1.43, p = 0.35) and 30‐day all‐cause readmissions (8.7% vs. 9.1%; aOR 0.81, 95% CI 0.64–1.28, p = 0.70) were not significantly different between groups. Subgroup analyses by indication for TLR (infection vs. mechanical complication) revealed no differences in outcomes. Conclusion Despite theoretical concerns, prior mediastinal radiation was not associated with excess procedural risk or worse short‐term outcomes after TLR. These findings may inform procedural planning and risk counseling in clinical practice."

Lung disease often causes increased right ventricular load, leading to RHF. Therefore, it is very important to screen out patients with cor pulmonale who develop RHF from people with underlying lung diseases. In this work, we propose a self-supervised representation learning method to early detecting RHF from patients with cor pulmonale, which uses spirogram time series to predict patients with RHF at an early stage. The proposed model is divided into two stages. The first stage is the self-supervised representation learning-based spirogram embedding (SLSE) network training process, where the encoder of the Variational autoencoder (VAE-encoder) learns a robust low-dimensional representation of the spirogram time series from the data-augmented unlabeled data. Second, this low-dimensional representation is fused with demographic information and fed into a CatBoost classifier for the downstream RHF prediction task. Trained and tested on a carefully selected subset of 26,617 individuals from the UK Biobank, our model achieved an AUROC of 0.7501 in detecting RHF, demonstrating strong population-level distinction ability. We further evaluated the model on high-risk clinical subgroups, achieving AUROC values of 0.8194 on a test set of 74 patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) and 0.8413 on a set of 64 patients with valvular heart disease (VHD). These results highlight the model's potential utility in predicting RHF among clinically elevated-risk populations. In conclusion, this study presents a self-supervised representation learning approach combining spirogram time series and demographic data, demonstrating promising potential for early RHF detection in clinical practice."

Methods and Results Patients in the Swedish Heart Failure (HF) Registry who met the guidelines’ recommendation for CRT between 2014 and 2022 were included. The primary endpoint was the composite of time to first HF hospitalization or cardiovascular (CV) death. Secondary endpoints were its individual components, all-cause death, and total number of HF hospitalizations. Out of 3,530 patients with HFrEF and an indication for CRT, 24.7% received a CRT. A history of or concomitant AF were observed in 51.6% of patients. AF was not associated with the likelihood of receiving a CRT, and the patient characteristics independently associated with CRT were consistent regardless of AF, except for CRT being less likely implanted in patients with valvular disease without AF, and more likely among those with AF and university (vs compulsory) education. Regardless of AF, CRT use was associated with a lower adjusted risk of CV death/first HF hospitalization [hazard ratio (HR): 0.71, 95% Confidence Interval (CI) 0.64-0.79], of its individual components, and of all-cause death (HR: 0.72, 95% CI 0.64-0.81), but not with total number of HF hospitalizations. Conclusions A diagnosis of AF was not associated with the likelihood of receiving CRT in real-world HF care, nor did it affect the association between CRT and lower risk of clinical outcomes."

Caval valve implantation with the TricValve system is one of the transcatheter treatment options proposed for TR symptom reduction. With this prospective registry, we aim to summarize our early experience with TricValve system implantation. Methods: Registry participants, selected out of patients who were referred for TR treatment but who were not eligible for the transcatheter tricuspid edge-to-edge valve repair (T-TEER), were qualified for the caval valve implantation following a HeartTeam discussion. Results: Four patients (four women; median age 71 years; 67.5–77 years) in whom a one-year follow-up was completed were included in the study. The patients were highly symptomatic in the NYHA class III despite intensive diuretic treatment; all of them were considered a high-mortality risk during conventional cardiac surgery. The TricValve system was successfully implanted in all patients. At 6-month follow-up, we observed a reduction in symptoms in three out of four patients. Up to 12 months, only one patient survived, with a reduction in symptoms of NYHA class II; two patients died because of heart failure; one died due to a progression in neoplastic disease. Conclusions: In highly symptomatic TR patients who were not eligible for the T-TEER and who had a prohibitive risk of cardiac surgery, TricValve implantation led to a reduction in symptoms in a 6-month perspective. Long-term survival was limited mainly by heart failure progression and severe concomitant disorders. Further studies are needed to fully elucidate the role of caval valve implantation in the treatment of TR patients."

Its causes can be divided into two large groups: those of genetic origin and those of nongenetic origin, which include infectious, toxic, and autoimmune disease causes, among others. Its natural course varies significantly based on the different etiologies and its diagnosis can influence the disease's management and prognosis. Clinical case: 29-year-old male, with a history of having suffered from Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia at the age of 4 with complete remission of the disease demonstrated at that time by bone marrow aspirate and immunophenotype, having been treated with anthracyclines. On this occasion, he attended due to the presence of sudden onset dyspnea and hemoptysis, for which in the first instance, due to the previously mentioned history, an attempt was made to rule out pulmonary thromboembolism with chest Angio tomography, which was corroborated by said study and demonstrating the presence of two intracavitary thrombi. Therefore, a transthoracic echocardiogram was performed, highlighting severe dilation of the left ventricle. Management for heart failure was adjusted based on structural alteration demonstrated by echocardiography, with favorable clinical evolution. Conclusions: The natural history of dilated cardiomyopathy is not easy to establish due to the wide heterogeneity of its etiology and the different rates of progression depending on it. In some cases, there may be functional recovery after acute myocardial damage, for example, in cardiomyopathy induced by tachycardia or in that induced by cardiotoxic drugs. In other cases, stabilization of the disease and systolic dysfunction and, in others, sudden death may be observed."

Although these findings can significantly support clinical decision-making, the large number of available studies renders an overview of this topic challenging. In this review, we provide a comprehensive overview of the currently identified factors associated with increased mortality after TEER. We also summarize the current evidence on published risk scores that stratify mortality risk after M-TEER and T-TEER.

OpenAlex,valvular heart disease,Characterization of Left Ventricular Hemodynamic Forces in Mitral Regurgitation Using 4-Dimensional-Flow Magnetic Resonance Imaging,Monisha Ghosh Srabanti; Ali Fatehi Hassanabad; Lyes Kadem; Julio Garcia,10.1177/30494826251395620,2025-11-13,Journal of the Heart Valve Society,"Background: Mitral regurgitation (MR) is one of the most common valvular heart diseases. Despite the recognized importance of hemodynamic force (HDF) in cardiology, its exploration in MR has been limited. Therefore, using a retrospective observational study design, we aimed to investigate the potential of noninvasively assessed systolic and diastolic HDF derived from 4-dimensional-flow magnetic resonance imaging (4D-flow MRI) as markers for determining MR. Method: The study cohort included 15 controls (19-61 years) and 26 MR patients (20 with primary and 6 cases with secondary MR, 33-75 years) classified into trivial-to-severe MR through cardiac MRI. The 3 T/4D-flow MRI sequence was used to assess left ventricular (LV) HDF (integral of intraventricular pressure gradients over the LV cavity) in 3 directions (lateral-septal, inferior-anterior, and apical-basal) using “Segment,” v2.2 R6410. Results: A negative coefficient for peak-systolic apical-basal HDF corresponded to decreased ejection fraction (β = −8.1, SE = 3.3, t = −2.5, P = .03), and a positive association was found between LV mass index and peak-systolic apical-basal HDF (β = 25.6, SE = 11.1, t = 2.3, P = .04). Peak-systolic apical-basal and E-wave apical-basal (diastolic HDF at E-wave time point) HDF emerged as significant predictors in detecting severe MR (Estimate = 2.2, P = .007; Estimate = 1.8, P = .015, respectively). The peak-systolic apical-basal HDF was also notably correlated with age in moderate-severe MR ( r = 0.88, P = .022). Conclusion: Mitral regurgitation affects early diastolic filling and peak systolic ejection, indicated by peak-systolic and E-wave HDF in the apical-basal direction, offering insights into dynamic flow patterns and LV remodeling. Hemodynamic force analysis could enhance risk stratification and guide therapeutic decisions, complementing traditional diagnostic methods for improved MR management."

Veeken,"Abstract Objectives Autoantibodies represent a serological hallmark of systemic sclerosis (SSc). Heart involvement in SSc patients includes diastolic dysfunction, conduction block, pericardial effusion, altered left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF), valvular pathology, as well as myocardial inflammation and/or fibrosis. To characterize the role of anti-RNA polymerase III (RNAPIII) antibody positivity in the pathophysiology of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)-related cardiac involvement in SSc patients. Method We retrospectively analyzed four SSc patients with anti-RNAPIII antibodies who developed cardiac complications after COVID-19. This study was approved by the University of Osaka Clinical Research Review Board. Results All patients were female and had been diagnosed within the past 3 years. Case 1 presented with elevated myocardial enzymes and severe cardiac injury requiring mechanical circulatory support. The diagnosis of COVID-19-related fulminant myocarditis was made. The other three patients did not have elevated myocardial enzymes but had elevated brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) or N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) and pericardial effusion or decreased LVEF and respiratory distress, suggesting the appearance of COVID-19-induced cardiac dysfunction. Conclusion Patients with anti-RNAPIII-positive SSc may have an increased risk of developing cardiac complications after COVID-19. The pathogenesis may involve angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2)-mediated mechanisms, which may include reducing ACE2 expression, leading to increased angiotensin II activity and induce cytokine storm. These results underline the importance of understanding the interplay between autoimmune diseases and infections in promoting immune-mediated cardiac injury. Further investigation is needed to characterize the role of anti-RNAPIII antibodies in the pathophysiology of COVID-19-related cardiac involvement."
OpenAlex,valvular heart disease,Temporal Prognostic Factors in Elderly Patients with Acute Heart Failure: A Cohort Study from a Spanish Emergency Department,Itziar Ostolaza Tazón; Héctor Alonso Valle; Pedro Muñoz Cacho,10.20944/preprints202511.0861.v1,2025-11-13,Preprints.org,"Background/Objectives: Acute heart failure (AHF) is a common cause of hospitalization in older adults, associated with high morbidity and mortality. In this population, frailty, comorbidity, and functional variability significantly influence prognosis. This study evaluated short-term (30-day) and long-term (1-year) mortality predictors in elderly patients with AHF treated in the emergency department (HED), considering clinical variables, comorbidities, and precipitating factors (PFs). Materials and Methods: An observational cohort study was conducted based on a secondary analysis of older patients with AHF included in the Epidemiology of Acute Heart Failure in Emergency Departments (EAHFE) registry, treated at Hospital Universitario Marqués de Valdecilla (HUMV) between 2007 and 2022. Clinical, laboratory, and PF-related variables were collected. The primary outcome was all-cause mortality at 30 days and 1 year. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were performed. Results: A total of 548 patients were included (mean age: 80.7 years), of whom 78.6% required hospitalization, mainly in the Internal Medicine department. Mortality was 11.1% at 30 days and 29.9% at 1 year. Age, valvular heart disease, dementia, and elevated creatinine levels were independently associated with higher mortality. Hypoxemia and low-output symptoms were linked to short-term mortality, while NYHA class III and anemia were associated with long-term mortality. Among PFs, acute coronary syndrome (ACS) was related to worse short-term outcomes, whereas rapid atrial fibrillation (AF) was inversely associated with long-term mortality. Conclusions: The prognostic relevance of risk factors differs between short- and long-term outcomes in older patients with AHF. Incorporating clinical characteristics and PFs into risk stratification models may support individualized management and guide follow-up strategies tailored to the geriatric profile. This multidimensional approach is essential to improve clinical decision-making and outcomes in a highly vulnerable population."

Using a prospective multicentre cohort of patients treated for IE, we compared the performance of the 2023 ESC classification to that of 2015 ESC, 2019 European Heart Rhythm Association (EHRA) and 2023 Duke-International Society for Cardiovascular Infectious Diseases (ISCVID) classifications in patients with or without cardiac implantable electronic devices (CIEDs). Methods A total of 1180 patients treated for IE between January 2017 and October 2022 were categorised as having either definite or possible/rejected IE within each classification. The gold standard diagnosis of IE was independently adjudicated by experts as ‘certain’ or not. Definite and ‘certain’ cases of IE were cross-tabulated to calculate sensitivity, specificity and accuracy. Suspicion of lead IE was defined by specific anatomical or metabolic features of cardiac lead infection on imaging; or by pulmonary embolism without valvular vegetation; or by positive culture of a lead extracted during open-heart surgery. Results In the 269 patients with CIEDs, 208 (77.3%) were adjudicated as ‘certain IE’; 2023 Duke-ISCVID and 2023 ESC classifications achieved higher sensitivity (97.1% and 93.8%, respectively) but markedly lower specificity (31.1% and 41.0%, respectively) than 2015 ESC and 2019 EHRA classifications. In the 159 patients with CIEDs and lead IE (78.6% ‘certain IE’), while sensitivity remained high for all classifications, specificity dropped for 2023 Duke-ISCVID and 2023 ESC classifications (11.8% and 32.4%, respectively), but not for 2019 EHRA classification (67.6%). In the 911 patients without CIEDs (81.0% ‘certain IE’), sensitivity was higher than 96% for all classifications and specificity was 55.5%, 52.6% and 48.0% for 2015 ESC, 2023 Duke-ISCVID and 2023 ESC classifications, respectively. Conclusions The 2023 ESC and 2023 Duke-ISCVID classifications had a higher sensitivity but a lower specificity than the 2015 ESC classification in patients with CIEDs, especially among those with lead IE. In patients with CIEDs, the 2019 EHRA classification was the most accurate."
