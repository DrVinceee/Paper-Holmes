PubMed,aortic stenosis,The effectiveness and safety of oral anticoagulation therapy in patients undergoing transcatheter aortic valve replacement: a systematic review/meta-analysis.,Qiang Zhou; Xiang Liu; Shuyu Liu; Xian Yang; Yanzi Wu; Yingying Tao; Meng Wei,10.1007/s00228-025-03970-z,2026-01-23,European journal of clinical pharmacology,"Patients undergoing transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) often require anticoagulation therapy due to various comorbidities. However, the decision to continue anticoagulation therapy during the TAVR perioperative period and the optimal regimen for postoperative anticoagulation therapy remain debatable.
We searched the PubMed, EMBASE, MEDLINE, and Cochrane Library databases from their date of establishment to September 2024. We evaluated the choice of anticoagulation regimen in the TAVR perioperative and postoperative period. The primary outcomes were stroke, major bleeding, all-cause death, and net adverse clinical events (NACEs). The secondary outcomes were any bleeding, life-threatening bleeding, thrombotic events, and cardiovascular death. We conducted a meta-analysis with a RR and 95% CI. We performed subgroup analyses based on the follow-up duration, study design, and whether oral antiplatelet drugs (OAP) were used.
We compared four studies with peri-procedural continuation or discontinuation of oral anticoagulants (OACs). We did not observe a difference between the two groups with major bleeding, stroke, all-cause death, and NACEs (P > 0.05). Seventeen studies compared the effects of direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) and vitamin K antagonists (VKAs) after TAVR. The risk of NACEs (RR: 0.84, 95% CI :0.71-0.99, P = 0.04) and cardiovascular death (RR: 0.78, 95% CI: 0.69-0.87, P < 0.0001) was significantly lower in the DOACs than in the VKAs, but there were no statistically significant differences between the two groups with other outcomes. In the subgroup analysis, the beneficial effects of DOACs on NACEs were observed in the early postoperative (P < 0.05). During the long-term follow-up time after TAVR, DOACs had a lower risk of all-cause mortality and cardiovascular death compared to VKAs (P < 0.05), but an increased risk of any bleeding (P < 0.05). In RCTs, the risk of any bleeding owing to DOACs was higher (P < 0.05). In cohort studies, DOACs led to lower NACEs and cardiovascular death (P < 0.05). When administered in combination with OAP drugs, DOACs posed a lower risk for cardiovascular death and all-cause death than VKAs (P < 0.05). If not administered in combination with OAP drugs, DOACs posed a lower risk for all-cause death (P < 0.05).
In patients undergoing TAVR with established indications for OACs, periprocedural continuation of OACs may offer comparable clinical outcomes to temporary discontinuation. Furthermore, DOACs after TAVR appear to be associated with more favorable clinical outcomes than VKAs, although this benefit must be weighed against a potentially increased risk of bleeding. Further large-scale RCTs are warranted to validate these findings."

Despite advances, stroke remains a serious complication, impacting morbidity, mortality, and long-term cognitive function, thus the need for effective prevention strategies.
Based on a targeted review of the PubMed literature, this review addresses mechanisms and risk factors for stroke after TAVR and evaluates current preventive approaches. Cerebral embolic protection devices (CEPDs), particularly the Sentinel system, are discussed alongside other devices. Antithrombotic strategies before, during, and after TAVR are also reviewed, emphasizing the balance between thromboembolic protection and bleeding risk in an elderly population.
While some studies suggest CEPDs may reduce stroke, randomized trials have not confirmed broad and robust benefit, and high cost limits routine adoption. Future work should focus on high-risk subgroups, device refinement, and large-scale trials. For now, individualized antithrombotic therapy and selective CEPD use remain central to stroke prevention in TAVR."
PubMed,aortic stenosis,Factors influencing the decision to accept or decline aortic valve replacement for asymptomatic aortic stenosis: a nested longitudinal qualitative substudy of the EASY-AS randomised trial.,Peter Allmark; Bethany Taylor; Angela Mary Tod; Tony Ryan; Marc Dweck; Gerry P McCann; Anvesha Singh,10.1136/bmjopen-2025-106485,2026-01-22,BMJ open,"To examine how patients and family members decide whether to accept a highly invasive intervention (aortic valve replacement (AVR)) when their condition (aortic stenosis (AS)) is asymptomatic and its course uncertain.
Nested, longitudinal, qualitative substudy of an ongoing randomised controlled trial (RCT) (NCT04204915) testing early intervention (EI) versus watchful waiting (WW) in patients with asymptomatic severe AS.
Six select UK sites of the RCT.
Select participants of the RCT, their next-of-kin and some who declined RCT participation.
73 interviews were conducted, with 41 participants.Few knew much about AS before diagnosis. Uncertainty and the need for reliable information regarding symptoms and progress was a significant problem.While some expressed unease at a major intervention for an asymptomatic condition, there were no outright objections to the idea.Those who declined participation in the RCT did so for personal reasons, for example, their home circumstances did not permit the required period of recovery or they felt too old to risk intervention.Reasons for accepting early intervention included the belief that the condition was serious and likely to deteriorate, and so better to have the intervention before such deterioration, as well as avoiding long waiting lists. Trusting clinicians' judgement played a part in some decisions. Patients also wanted choice in the type of intervention received.The longitudinal interviews (n=32) showed satisfaction in the early intervention group despite some problems in the the early recovery phase, especially for those undergoing surgical AVR.
Where evidence supports major intervention for an asymptomatic condition, patients are likely to accept the offer, although personal circumstances play an important role in decision-making. Where a condition is not well known to the public, such as AS, patients rely on clinicians and other resources to help decide. Liaison with patient groups in developing shared decision-making resources may help with complex decisions.

It demonstrates that not all aortic diseases are amenable to endovascular treatment and that open surgical treatment remains highly important, especially in younger patients with hereditary aortic diseases."

Cardiovascular Imaging,"Assessing cardiac function is critical for managing cardiovascular disease, guiding treatment, monitoring progression, and risk stratification. While left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) is firmly established, it has limitations. Myocardial contraction fraction (MCF) - the ratio of stroke volume to myocardial volume, is simple to compute without additional analysis and offers a promising alternative to LVEF.
MCF was assessed across four datasets spanning healthy controls and chronic structural cardiac disease, with direct comparison to LVEF. Association between age, sex and MCF were investigated in 3,541 healthy subjects from the UK Biobank and sex-specific reference ranges derived. Several cohorts were recruited to investigate the discriminative power of MCF and LVEF between health and physiological adaption (n=278 veteran athletes), pathological hypertrophy (hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, amyloid, Fabry, severe aortic stenosis, and hypertension; n=633) and dilatation (n=103 dilated cardiomyopathy). Ability to track disease severity was assessed by looking at 41,558 subjects from the UK Biobank. Finally, prognostication was assessed on 1,277 consecutive patients from an independent external dataset. All images were analysed using the same validated AI algorithm.
MCF varied with sex (mean MCF: 0.94 male; 1.1 female) but not age. Sex-specific reference ranges were established: [0.68-1.20] for male, [0.82-1.38] for female. MCF decreased in pathological disease (e.g. mean MCF: 0.72 HCM; 0.69 severe AS; 0.5 amyloid; 0.9 hypertension) but there was no significant decrease in LVEF other than in amyloid (mean EF: 76% HCM; 64% severe AS; amyloid 56%; 65% hypertension). Both MCF and EF decreased in DCM (EF 34%; MCF 0.58). MCF decreased with worsening hypertension, whereas LVEF increased (P<0.05). MCF had superior prognostic ability to LVEF (MCF vs LVEF: HR=0.772 vs HR=0.816; χ²=198 vs χ²=151; p<0.001).
We established MCF reference ranges, showing superior performance for detecting early disease and tracking progression compared to LVEF. MCF offers enhanced prognostic utility, complementing established metrics of LV function."

This study sought to investigate 5-year clinical outcomes in patients with severe aortic stenosis with a small annulus compared with those with a large annulus following transcatheter aortic valve replacement with newer-generation balloon-expandable valves.
A total of 3182 patients with aortic stenosis treated with balloon-expandable valves were divided into small-annulus (≤430 mm2) and large-annulus (>430 mm2) groups. A 1:1 propensity-matched analysis was performed to adjust baseline differences. The primary end point was all-cause death at 5-year follow-up. Secondary end points included heart failure hospitalization, bioprosthetic valve failure, and aortic valve reintervention.
Among 533 matched pairs, compared with the large-annulus group, the small-annulus group had higher rates of aortic valve mean gradients ≥20 mm Hg (14.1% versus 2.9%; P<0.001) and severe prosthesis-patient mismatch (9.8% versus 5.2%; P=0.019). At 5 years, there were no significant differences in all-cause death (hazard ratio, 0.75 [95% CI, 0.52-1.09]; P=0.13). The incidence of heart failure rehospitalization, bioprosthetic valve failure, and aortic valve reintervention were similar between groups. Both groups achieved similar sustained improvements in New York Heart Association functional class and Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire-Overall Summary scores.
Despite higher transvalvular gradients and a greater rate of severe prosthesis-patient mismatch, 5-year clinical outcomes in patients with a small annulus were comparable to those with a large annulus following transcatheter aortic valve replacement using newer-generation balloon-expandable valves."

Cardiovascular imaging,"Computed tomography based planimetric assessment of the anatomic aortic valve area (aAVACTA) in aortic stenosis is routinely performed. Unlike transthoracic echocardiography-based effective AVA by transthoracic echocardiography, it lacks clearly defined severity cutoff values, limiting clinical utility.
In this retrospective single-center analysis with computed tomography angiography data from 2013 to 2025, cutoffs were determined from 1294 transthoracic echocardiography-based conclusive severe or nonsevere patients by congruence of maximum velocity, mean pressure gradient, and effective AVA by transthoracic echocardiography. In separate receiver operator curves analyses for tricuspid and bicuspid valves, the severe stenosis likely cutoff was defined by Youden index and the unlikely cutoff by a negative likelihood ratio <0.1. Cutoffs were internally validated in 480 patients, compared with the Agatston score by net reclassification index, and tested in 190 separate normal flow-low gradient-aortic stenosis cases.
Correlation between aAVACTA and effective AVA by transthoracic echocardiography was moderate and strong in tricuspid and bicuspid valves, respectively (Pearson r 0.67 and 0.78; P<0.001). Severe stenosis was likely in tricuspid valves at aAVACTA ≤0.95 cm² (sensitivity 87%, specificity 78.9%) and unlikely at ≥1.10 cm² (negative likelihood ratio, 0.092). In bicuspid valves severe stenosis was likely at aAVACTA ≤1.08 cm² (sensitivity 88.3%, specificity 77.3%) and unlikely at ≥1.20cm2 (negative likelihood ratio, 0.091). Validation showed comparable results. Net reclassification index compared with the Agatston score was 0.16 for likely and 0.17 for unlikely cutoffs (P<0.001). Cutoffs were applied to 190 suspected severe low-gradient cases. Adding aAVACTA as an additional severity marker led to reclassification to nonsevere in 5.8% of cases.
Direct planimetry of AVA is feasible and shows utility in low gradient-aortic stenosis. However, as the hemodynamic effect is impacted by valve shape, cutoff values should differentiate between tricuspid and bicuspid valves."
PubMed,aortic stenosis,Comparative study of transcatheter aortic valve implantation versus conventional surgical aortic valve replacement in the treatment of severe aortic stenosis with reverse ventricular remodeling.,Haoyan Li; Sumin Yang; Wenlong Yan; Xiaodong Chen; Xun Chi,10.3389/fcvm.2025.1712400,2025,Frontiers in cardiovascular medicine,"This study aimed to compare echocardiographic outcomes and analyze the changes in ventricular remodeling at different time points after surgery in patients with severe aortic stenosis (AS) undergoing either surgical aortic valve replacement (SAVR) or transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR).
This retrospective study consecutively enrolled 175 patients with severe AS who underwent either SAVR or TAVR. Transthoracic echocardiograms obtained at baseline, 30 days, and 1 year after the procedure were analyzed by multiple echocardiographers at our institution.
At baseline, the TAVR group was significantly older (74 ± 7 years vs. 62 ± 9 years, p < 0.001) and had a higher prevalence of hypertension (53.5% vs. 31.0%, p = 0.003), coronary artery disease (38.4% vs. 23.0%, p = 0.028), and atrial fibrillation (16.3% vs. 2.3%, p = 0.002). Additionally, the TAVR cohort demonstrated significantly worse cardiac functional status (p < 0.001). Compared to TAVR patients, SAVR patients (N = 87) exhibited a more pronounced reduction in left ventricular end-systolic dimension (-0.5 ± 0.65 cm vs. -0.2 ± 0.47 cm, p < 0.001) and left ventricular end-diastolic dimension (-0.6 ± 0.64 cm vs. -0.3 ± 0.55 cm, p < 0.001) at the 1-month follow-up. A decrease in left ventricular mass was observed in both groups from baseline to 1 month postoperatively, with the SAVR group showing a significantly greater reduction (LV mass: -67.3 ± 59.31 g vs. -38.2 ± 46.49 g, p = 0.003; LVMI: -39.1 ± 33.93 g/m2 vs. -22.5 ± 27.08 g/m2, p = 0.005). However, these differences were not sustained at the 1-year follow-up. SAVR patients experienced a transient decline in right ventricular function at 1 month, which recovered by 1 year postoperatively. At the 1-year follow-up, the TAVR group experienced a higher incidence of Major Adverse Cardiac Events (MACE) (p = 0.01), despite showing significant improvement in the severity of both mitral and tricuspid regurgitation compared to baseline (p < 0.001). Although pulmonary artery pressure improved in both groups after AVR, the SAVR group demonstrated significantly lower pressure at 1 year (p < 0.001).
In patients with severe aortic stenosis, SAVR was associated with more significant regression of left ventricular dimensions and mass at 1 month compared to TAVR, alongside a transient impairment of right ventricular function. By 1 year postoperatively, however, no significant differences in ventricular remodeling were observed between the two groups."

To investigate the efficacy of different treatment methods. Methods: A retrospective analysis was conducted on 181 sECD patients admitted to the First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University between June 2018 and February 2025, of whom 23 had bilateral involvement, resulting in a total of 204 dissected vessels. Based on the Borgess classification, 204 dissected vessels were categorized into 2 groups: type Ⅰ (intact intima, 71 vessels) and type Ⅱ (with an intimal tear, 133 vessels). Patients were followed up at 3, 6, and 12 months, and every 12 months thereafter via outpatient visits or readmission. Demographic data, clinical manifestations, imaging features, treatment regimens, and follow-up data were collected to analyze and compare the incidence of cerebral ischemic events, cerebral hemorrhage, and mortality during hospitalization and follow-up between the 2 groups. To observe the efficacy between surgical and conservative treatments as well. Results: A total of 181 patients aged (50±11) years were included, comprising 139 males and 42 females. Compared with type Ⅱ sECD, type Ⅰ were younger [48 (40, 56) vs 51 (44, 57) years, P=0.043] and had higher National Institute of Health Stroke Scale scores at admission and discharge [2 (0, 5) vs 0 (0, 3) points, P=0.029; and 0 (0, 2) vs 0 (0, 1) points, P=0.026, respectively]. The incidence of ischemic stroke was significantly higher in type Ⅰ sECD [60.6% (43/71) vs 43.6% (58/133), P=0.021]. Type Ⅰ sECD also exhibited a higher proportion of true lumen stenosis >70% [78.9% (56/71) vs 36.8%(49/133), P<0.001]. A total of 67 patients (71 vessels) underwent surgical treatment with a 100.0% (71/71) success rate and no perioperative complications. Among 114 patients (133 vessels) receiving conservative treatment, the cerebral ischemia recurrence rate was 3.7% (2/53) for type Ⅰ and 6.3% (5/80) for type Ⅱ, with no statistically significant difference (P>0.05). However, the complete and partial healing rates were higher in type I sECD than in type Ⅱ [88.7% (47/53) vs 30.0% (24/80), P<0.001]. Conclusions: Type Ⅰ sECD is more common in younger patients and is associated with a higher risk of severe ischemic stroke, yet it exhibits better healing rates with antithrombotic therapy. Surgical treatment intervention is safe and effective for both types."

Baseline clinical, laboratory, and echocardiographic parameters were analyzed. A composite endpoint comprising cardiovascular death, heart failure hospitalization, and appropriate implantable cardioverter-defibrillator shocks was assessed. Logistic regression analyses were used to identify independent associations, and receiver operating characteristic analysis was performed to evaluate discriminative ability.ResultsThe uric acid-to-albumin ratio was higher in patients with obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy than in those with nonobstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and controls (1.56 ± 0.15 vs 1.21 ± 0.08 vs 1.15 ± 0.11; p < 0.001). Adverse events occurred in 32 patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (25.8%) and were more frequent in the obstructive group (34.5% vs 18.2%; p = 0.038). In multivariable analysis, higher uric acid-to-albumin ratio (per 0.1 increase; OR, 1.50; 95% confidence interval: 1.18-1.90; p = 0.001) and septal thickness (OR, 1.65; 95% confidence interval: 1.30-2.10; p < 0.001) were independently associated with adverse outcomes. Receiver operating characteristic analysis yielded an area under the curve of 0.717 (p < 0.001).ConclusionsElevated uric acid-to-albumin ratio was independently associated with adverse outcomes in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and may serve as a simple and inexpensive biomarker for risk stratification."

CT coronary angiography (CTA) and CT-derived fractional flow reserve (FFRCT) are tools used to assess CAD. However, adoption in the TAVR population is hindered by safety concerns with nitroglycerin and beta-blockers. The safety, accuracy, and utility of CTA and FFRCT optimised with these medications for TAVR have not been established.
This international, multi-center, prospective registry included severe AS patients referred for TAVR, assessed for CAD with CTA and FFRCT. Patients all received nitroglycerin and beta-blockers as needed to optimise image quality. Severe ventricular dysfunction, recent syncope/heart failure, critical hemodynamics, or prior revascularization were excluded. Significant CAD was defined as CTA stenosis ≥50 ​% and FFRCT≤0.75. Primary endpoint was per-patient sensitivity and negative predictive value (NPV) of CTA compared to invasive coronary angiography (ICA). Secondary endpoints included specificity and positive predictive value (PPV) of CTA and FFRCT, safety, feasibility (non-evaluable rate), and the modelled potential of CTA ​+ ​FFRCT to reduce pre-TAVR ICA.
327 patients (75.9 ​± ​9.7 years, 53 ​% male) underwent CTA. CTA was safe and well tolerated in nearly all patients, with transient hypotension in 4 (1.2 ​%). CTA was evaluable in 326 patients (99.7 ​%), with 9 (2.8 ​%) having a non-evaluable vessel. FFRCT and ICA were performed in 110 (33.6 ​%) and 133 (40.7 ​%) patients, respectively. Per-patient sensitivity, specificity, NPV, and PPV of CTA were 100 ​%, 71.4 ​%, 100 ​%, and 75.9 ​% and per-vessel 82.7 ​%, 78.9 ​%, 92.3 ​%, and 59.9 ​%. FFRCT improved specificity and PPV to 88.9 ​% and 88.0 ​% for per-patient and 95.1 ​% and 81.8 ​% for per-vessel analysis. Using a simulated triage model deferring ICA in patients with CTA <50 ​% or ≥50 ​% stenosis with FFRCT >0.75, 267 patients (81.7 ​%) could potentially have avoided ICA.
Coronary CTA performed with nitroglycerin and selective use of beta-blockers is safe and effective for assessing CAD in stable severe AS patients. Combining CTA and FFRCT enhances diagnostic accuracy, potentially reducing the need for invasive angiography and streamlining TAVR workup."

In this retrospective cohort study, we analysed 22 906 patients with HF undergoing echocardiography between 2010 and 2020. AS was classified as mild, moderate, low-gradient (LG) or severe according to guideline criteria. Outcomes were assessed using Cox regression, stratified by HF subtype and adjusted for clinical confounders. The primary endpoint was event-free survival, defined as all-cause mortality or aortic valve replacement (AVR).
Moderate AS was present in 5.5%, LG AS in 2.5% and severe AS in 6.5% of HF patients, with HF with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) being the most common HF subtype across all AS grades. Increasing AS severity was associated with a stepwise increase in adverse outcomes compared with HF patients without AS (adjusted HR 2.20 (95% CI 2.00 to 2.41) for moderate AS; 3.32 (95% CI 2.97 to 3.72) for LG AS and 6.20 (95% CI 5.74 to 6.69) for severe AS). These associations were consistent across HFpEF, HF with mildly reduced EF and HF with reduced EF. Despite established guideline indications, only 59.5% (95% CI 57% to 62%) of HF patients with severe AS underwent AVR within 2 years.
AS is common in HF and is associated with substantially worse long-term outcomes across all HF subtypes, even at non-severe stages. The high mortality risk and frequent lack of intervention highlight major treatment gaps and underscore the need for prospective trials evaluating earlier intervention strategies."

Confirmation of pathogenic gene variants can have important implications for the patient and their relatives. The UK National Genomic Test Directory (NGTD) provides strict criteria on the indications for GT; however, the European Society of Cardiology (ESC) recommends wider GT. We reviewed the prevalence of pathogenic genotypes in patients undergoing GT who did not meet the NGTD criteria.
We conducted a retrospective analysis of patients who underwent GT with a confirmed diagnosis of HCM or DCM attending the Essex Inherited Cardiac Conditions Clinic between January 2023 and January 2025.
257 patients were included in the analysis, with 136 patients with DCM (52.9%) and 121 patients with HCM (47.1%). The diagnostic yield of GT was 19.9% in DCM and 17.4% in HCM.14.8% of gene-positive patients with DCM and 14.3% of gene-positive patients with HCM did not meet current UK testing criteria, predominantly due to age of onset. All gene-positive patients in the DCM subgroup not meeting current NGTD criteria for testing had evidence of myocardial fibrosis.
A significant minority of patients (1 in 7) with cardiomyopathy and a pathogenic genotype did not meet current UK testing criteria; each patient has an average of 4 first-degree relatives at risk who will benefit from predictive GT. We propose the adoption of the wider ESC guidance, removing the strict age-related cut-offs and being guided more by the severity of the phenotype, particularly involving myocardial scarring."

Coronary angiography showed no significant stenosis, consistent with myocardial infarction with nonobstructive coronary arteries (MINOCA). Transesophageal echocardiogram revealed a 2-cm mobile thrombus on the right coronary cusp of the prosthetic aortic valve, intermittently occluding the right coronary artery ostium.
Bioprosthetic valve thrombosis typically occurs early postimplantation; this case is notable for its 15-year latency. It underscores the need to consider valve thrombosis in patients with bioprosthetic valves presenting with embolic phenomena or MINOCA, even long after surgery.
Clinicians should maintain a high suspicion for prosthetic valve thrombosis as a cause of MINOCA. Early diagnosis using comprehensive imaging, particularly transesophageal echocardiography, is critical to prevent complications."

Case reports,"Coronary artery reimplantation during aortic root replacement can be complicated by coronary ostial stenosis. Although an uncommon complication, it can cause serious sequelae including acute coronary syndrome, ventricular failure, or ventricular arrhythmias, leading to sudden cardiac death.
We present the case of a 39-year-old man with previously normal coronary arteries who underwent aortic root replacement with a mechanical valve and conduit for severe aortic regurgitation secondary to Takayasu arteritis-induced aortopathy. Coronary angiography performed 5 months after surgery for new inferior regional wall motion abnormalities showed proximal right coronary artery (RCA) stenosis. Optical coherence tomography (OCT) identified a suture through the lumen of the RCA as the cause of the stenosis. This was treated with cutting balloon dilatation followed by drug-eluting stent placement.
This is to our knowledge the first reported case of proximal RCA stenosis secondary to a suture visualized by OCT in a reimplanted coronary artery.
OCT, a high-resolution intracoronary imaging modality, can help elucidate the etiology of stenosis of a reimplanted coronary artery."

Although acceptable immediate repair results improve outcomes, late failures still occur. This study aimed to identify risk factors for suboptimal outcomes after an initially acceptable repair.
We retrospectively reviewed 287 patients undergoing primary aortic valve repair (2014-2023). Acceptable repair was defined as less than moderate aortic stenosis (AS) and mild or less aortic insufficiency (AI) after bypass. Suboptimal outcomes were defined as more than moderate AS/AI or reintervention after discharge. Cox analysis identified predictors among patients with acceptable repair, with a nomogram developed for pure AS patients.
Median age at repair was 3.5 years (interquartile range, 1.0-8.1 years). Acceptable repair was achieved in 183 of 287 (64%). Median follow-up was 2.5 years (interquartile range, 0.7-4.7 years). Acceptable repair yielded superior 4-year freedom from suboptimal outcomes vs residual lesions (75% vs 51%, P < .001). Among 121 pure AS patients with acceptable repair, independent predictors for suboptimal outcomes were smaller preoperative annulus z-score (hazard ratio [HR], 0.69; P = .007), higher preoperative peak gradient (HR, 1.02; P = .034), and prior balloon aortic valvuloplasty (HR, 5.92, P < .001). The nomogram showed good discrimination (C index = 0.78). For mixed/pure AI patients, leaflet extension/augmentation was associated with suboptimal outcomes on univariate but not multivariable analysis.
Acceptable initial repair is crucial but does not guarantee long-term success. Smaller annulus z-score, higher gradient, and prior balloon aortic valvuloplasty in pure AS independently predict subsequent valve failure despite adequate initial repair. These factors may aid risk stratification and inform surveillance intensity."

In severe aortic valve stenosis, SDM again comes to play, this time to select between transcatheter aortic valve implantation and surgical aortic valve replacement. The implementation of SDM in South Korea faces challenges, including limited patient involvement and preference for physician-driven decisions. Structural improvements cover multidisciplinary heart team discussion and patient education tools which integrate SDM well into enhancing patient-centered care by addressing these barriers to improve treatment accessibility and outcome in the South Korean healthcare system."

Asia,"Current guidelines do not include phenotypical classifications in functional mitral regurgitation (FMR).
The study sought to classify FMR into 3 morphological phenotypes and assess determinants of mortality.
We included patients with ≥moderately severe FMR from 2 tertiary centers. FMR was classified as ventricular functional mitral regurgitation with symmetrical tethering (VFMRst), ventricular functional mitral regurgitation with asymmetrical tethering (VFMRat), or atrial functional mitral regurgitation (AFMR). The primary composite endpoint was cardiovascular death and death equivalent (ie, left ventricular assist device implantation or heart transplantation).
Of 699 patients (70 years [Q1-Q3: 60-79 years], 46% female), VFMRst was the most prevalent (54%). VFMRat exhibited larger mitral regurgitation vena contracta (7.7 mm [Q1-Q3: 7-8.7 mm] vs 7.3 mm [Q1-Q3: 6.7-8.2 mm]) but smaller left ventricular end-diastolic volume index (100 mL/m2 [Q1-Q3: 83-128 mL/m2] vs 106 mL/m2 [Q1-Q3: 88-132 mL/m2]) than VFMRst (both P ≤ 0.037). AFMR with hamstrung posterior mitral valve (MV) exhibited larger left atrial volume index (96 mL/m2 [Q1-Q3: 77-145 mL/m2] vs 78 mL/m2 [Q1-Q3: 63-97 mL/m2]) and mitral regurgitation vena contracta (7.5 mm [Q1-Q3: 6.8-8.6 mm] vs 7.0 mm [Q1-Q3: 6.4-8.2] mm) than AFMR with central MV malcoaptation (both P ≤ 0.010). At a median follow-up of 2.6 years (Q1-Q3: 0.9-5 years), 193 primary endpoints occurred. Five-year event-free survival was higher in AFMR (71 ± 4%) than VFMRst (64 ± 3%) and VFMRat (63 ± 4%) (P ≤ 0.030), but adjusted outcomes were similar across groups (all P ≥ 0.139). Besides conventional markers, multivariable models demonstrated that low diastolic blood pressure (DBP), left atrial reservoir strain (LASr), and left ventricular longitudinal strain from the apical 4-chamber view (A4C-LVLS) independently linked to primary endpoints (all P ≤ 0.043). Adjusted spline curves showed increased primary endpoint risk with DBP ≤73.7 mm Hg, LASr ≤14.8%, and A4C-LVLS ≤9.3%.
VFMRat exhibited more disproportionate features than VFMRst. AFMR with hamstrung posterior MV may indicate a more advanced disease stage. Morphological phenotypes alone were not associated with adjusted outcomes. LASr, A4C-LVLS, and DBP may assist in risk stratification in FMR."

Advances,"Acute mitral regurgitation (MR) is a serious complication of takotsubo syndrome (TTS). However, its incidence and prognostic implications are still poorly investigated.
This study aimed to assess the clinical characteristics, short- and long-term outcomes of patients with TTS complicated by acute, reversible, moderate or severe MR.
The study included TTS patients from the Takotsubo Italian Network multicenter registry. The primary outcome was the composite of in-hospital acute heart failure, cardiogenic shock, and mortality. Secondary outcomes included mortality and the recurrence of TTS at the longest available follow-up. The propensity score weighting technique was performed to account for potential confounders between patients with and without acute moderate or severe MR.
The study included 1,025 patients (mean age 70 ± 11 years, 91.6% females); of them, 186 (18.2%) showed acute moderate or severe MR. Logistic regression analysis showed a significantly higher risk for the primary outcome (adjusted OR: 2.29; 95% CI: 1.83-2.88), acute heart failure (adjusted OR: 2.17; 95% CI: 1.70-2.77), and cardiogenic shock (adjusted OR: 2.46; 95% CI: 1.69-3.59) in patients with acute MR compared to those without. Also, the coexistence of left ventricular outflow tract obstruction with acute MR further increased the risk for the primary outcome (adjusted OR: 5.26; 95% CI: 3.22-8.59). At long-term follow-up (median 29 months), patients who developed acute MR during hospitalization showed a significantly higher risk of mortality (adjusted HR: 1.82; 95% CI: 1.21-2.74).
In this real-world study, acute MR was associated with a significantly higher risk of adverse events during hospitalization and long-term mortality. Early echocardiographic detection of acute MR can support prognostic stratification and management of TTS patients."

Traditionally, physiologic pacing has been achieved with biventricular pacing with a right ventricular lead and a coronary sinus branch lead. Randomized trials involving more than 10,000 patients with heart failure have shown clinical, exercise, and quality-of-life benefits associated with biventricular pacing, as well as improved LVEF and reduced mitral regurgitation and ventricular volumes. These benefits are greatest in patients with left bundle-branch block and a QRS duration of 150 msec or longer. Recent studies support targeting the His bundle or left bundle branch as an alternative cardiac physiologic pacing strategy. Ongoing randomized trials are expected to more clearly define the comparative efficacy and safety of conduction system pacing as compared with biventricular pacing."

A single-center retrospective cohort study included 54 patients who underwent mitral valve repair for mitral regurgitation between January 2020 and July 2021. We measured the distance between the mitral annulus and the LCX (ML distance) using MPR of intraoperative TEE images. As an exploratory analysis, we compared the ML distance between patients with MAD (group D: N = 11) and those without (group N: N = 43).
The LCX was closest to the mitral annulus at 70-90 degrees counterclockwise from the anteroposterior axis. No cases of LCX injury were observed. MAD was most frequently observed at P1, and all patients in group D had disjunction at P1. The minimum ML distance was significantly shorter in group D than in group N (3.2 [1.1] mm in group D, and 4.9 [2.1] mm in group N). Overall, the ML distance was shorter in group D than in group N, and was significantly shorter at 70-100 degrees.
MPR of intraoperative TEE images is a less invasive and useful tool to detect patients with a short ML distance. The area of the closest distance from the mitral annulus to the LCX is near the anterolateral commissure, especially in patients with MAD."

Data were retrieved from the multicenter European Registry of Type A Aortic Dissection (ERTAAD). Bootstrapped least absolute shrinkage and selection operator logistic regression and multilevel multivariate logistic regression were performed for variable selection to identify predictors of hospital death, and logistic regression was used for the prediction of CABG.
A total of 292 (8.04%) of 3633 patients required additional CABG. The in-hospital mortality rate was 33% for patients undergoing CABG vs 16% of non-CABG recipients (P < .001; odds ratio [OR], 2.52; 95% CI, 1.93-3.35). Dissection of the aortic root involving the right coronary cusp (P < .001; OR, 7.83; 95% CI, 5.55-11.0), a tear in the aortic root (P = .002; OR, 2.08; 95% CI, 1.29-3.32), mitral valve insufficiency (P = .034; OR, 1.33; 95% CI, 1.01-1.71), and a genetic syndrome (P < .001; OR, 3.23; 95% CI, 1.66-5.99) independently predicted the need for CABG.
The need for additional CABG is not a rare occurrence during repair of type A aortic dissection and is associated with an increased mortality risk. Intimal tear localization and right coronary sinus dissection should be carefully examined in the preoperative image evaluation to stratify the risk of revascularization and plan the most appropriate approach."

The analysis aimed to evaluate outcomes in patients with aSMR treated with MTEER from the EXPANDed studies.
One-year outcomes were assessed in patients from the EXPANDed studies (EXPAND and EXPAND G4) who met criteria for aSMR. aSMR was defined by the presence of atrial fibrillation, left ventricular ejection fraction ≥45%, and at least 1 dilated LA parameter per echocardiographic core laboratory assessment: LA volume index, LA diameter, or LA diameter index.
Of the 967 patients with SMR treated with MTEER in the EXPANDed data set, 160 (17%) met criteria for aSMR. Patients with aSMR were elderly (78±8 years), symptomatic (Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire Overall Summary score, 48±27 pts), and had small left ventricular and large LA dimensions at baseline. Acute procedural success was achieved in 97.5% of patients with aSMR, with MR reduction to ≤1+ in 95.2% at 1 year.

Patients with smaller MVA received fewer clips (1.3 ± 0.07 vs. 1.5 ± 0.04; p = 0.03). Procedural success and in-hospital outcomes were comparable. At discharge, residual MR (<moderate) and New York Heart Association class were similar, although TMPG was higher in the small group (3.9 ± 0.2 vs. 3.3 ± 0.1 mmHg; p = 0.006).

Pulmonary valve (PV) involvement is extremely rare, representing less than 8% of all PFEs. Although often asymptomatic, PFEs can present with embolic events. We report a 60-year-old man admitted with acute dyspnea, orthopnea, and lower-limb edema. Transthoracic echocardiography revealed severe left ventricular systolic dysfunction (ejection fraction: 15%), severe functional mitral regurgitation, and a mobile echogenic mass (1.0 × 0.8 cm) attached to the arterial surface of the PV consistent with a PFE. Chest computerized tomography (CT) confirmed bilateral segmental pulmonary emboli with infarctions and pulmonary artery dilation. Coronary angiography excluded ischemic disease. Given the patient's new-onset heart failure with reduced ejection fraction and high operative risk, the heart team opted for initial anticoagulation and optimized heart failure therapy, postponing surgical resection until stabilization. PV PFE is a rare but potentially fatal cause of pulmonary embolism. Multimodality imaging is crucial for diagnosis, and individualized treatment is required to balance embolic risk and surgical mortality."

Bio,"We developed a magnetically responsive Y-shaped hydrogel mitral clip for minimally invasive repair of mitral regurgitation. Fabricated through a multilayer assembly strategy, the clip integrates a polyurethane layer featuring a biomimetic inverse opal architecture to enhance tissue adhesion, a GelMA/Fe3O4 hydrogel for magnetic actuation, a flexible epoxy acrylate scaffold for mechanical compliance, and a biocompatible polydimethylsiloxane interface. The clip exhibits Janus wettability, with a hydrophilic inner surface to promote effective leaflet anchoring and a hydrophobic outer surface to minimize blood fouling, thus optimizing device-tissue and device-fluid interactions. Performance was validated through in vitro, ex vivo, and computational studies, confirming precise magnetic clamping, strong adhesion, and mechanical resilience under simulated physiological conditions. Hemocompatibility evaluations demonstrated favorable outcomes in terms of blood interaction and reduced thrombogenicity when benchmarked against commercial alternatives. This soft, adaptive device supports minimally invasive deployment and reliable leaflet fixation, offering a promising approach for next-generation transcatheter mitral valve repair with enhanced tissue integration and blood compatibility."

However, the persistence and severity of mitral regurgitation (MR) in KD are not well-known. This study examined the correlation between MR and z-values of inflammatory serum biomarkers.
Patients with KD at Korea University Hospital over 15-year period were retrospectively investigated. Echocardiography and inflammatory serum biomarkers were examined in 371 patients with KD (241 with MR and 130 without) and 144 patients with febrile illness (control). Serum biomarkers (raw and z-values) were compared among the positive, negative, all, and no MR groups during each phase of KD.
Neutrophil, z-neutrophil, lymphocyte, z-lymphocyte, neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio, hemoglobin, z-hemoglobin, C-reactive protein (CRP), and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) all differed significantly between the positive and negative MR groups and between the all and no MR groups during the acute phase (p<0.05). A part of white blood cell (WBC), z-WBC, neutrophil, z-neutrophil, neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio, hemoglobin, z-hemoglobin, CRP, ESR, aspartate transaminase, and sodium were associated with severity of MR through correlation analysis and multivariate logistic regression (p<0.05). Optimal cut-off values of neutrophils, z-neutrophils, CRP, and ESR to predict persistent MR were 8,100 /μL, 2.2, 61 mg/dL, and 77 mm/h.
A comparison of hematological z-values in KD with MR and in KD without MR is useful for predicting more severe inflammation. Neutrophils, z-neutrophils, and ESR were significant and consistently associated with pathogenesis of MR and their levels during the early inflammation can predict the persistency and severity of MR."

Due to the higher difficulty of the combined secondary bivalve procedure and the greater risk of pericardial tamponade and malignant arrhythmias, the professional demands on the surgeon and team are extremely high. It is particularly important to provide quality perioperative care for such patients.
This study reports a case of bioprosthetic valve failure after undergoing transcatheter aortic and mitral bicuspid valve-in-valve replacement.After active treatment and careful care, the patient recovered well after the operation and had a good quality of life during the 1 year follow-up period.
Valve function was measured by 3-dimensional echocardiography.
The key points of perioperative care include: close monitoring of the patient's condition and provision of first aid before surgery; close monitoring of hemodynamic parameters, management of fluid balance, provision of respiratory support and oxygen therapy management, prevention of complications and early cardiac rehabilitation after surgery.
On the 16th day after the operation, the 3-dimensional echocardiogram showed that the mitral regurgitation was slight. Mitral regurgitation was slight, and aortic valve flow velocity and differential pressure were normalized. At 1 year follow-up, there were no adverse cardiovascular events and quality of life improved.
For patients undergoing simultaneous transcatheter bivalve replacement with multiple comorbidities, focus should be placed on constructing an integrated perioperative intervention pathway to comprehensively improve clinical tolerance and control the risk of complex cases."

This study aimed to clarify whether the type of aortic root surgery, in case of at least grade 2 aortic regurgitation associated with myocardial dysfunction, affects the outcomes.
Extraction from the Heart Valve Society aortic valve database (Aortic Valve Insufficiency and ascending aorta Aneurysm InternATiOnal Registry [AVIATOR]) was performed and two groups of patients operated between July 2007 and December 2022 were identified: Group 1 including patients undergoing VSRR with ejection fraction (EF) ≤50% (n=279) and Group 2 including patients undergoing Bentall with EF ≤50% (n=46). All patients had at least grade 2 aortic regurgitation.
Similar cardiopulmonary bypass and cross-clamping time were reported. No statistically significant difference was reported between the groups in terms of postoperative bleeding, transfusion rate, reoperations, pacemaker rate implantation, ischaemic complications, and acute kidney injury. Follow-up mortality was similar between the groups, without any significant differences, and the weighted mixed-effect linear models showed improvement in EF in both groups; progressive inverse left ventricular remodelling is significantly higher in Group 2.
While both techniques can improve left ventricular function in patients with reduced EF, the Bentall procedure offers marginally better results in terms of left ventricular inverse remodelling. However, the choice between Bentall and VSRR should ultimately be determined by the surgeon's expertise and familiarity with each technique."

Risk factors primarily include those related to the mean heart dose of radiation, but with the development of modern radiotherapy techniques, this problem is optimistically decreasing. However, concurrent pharmacological anticancer therapies still significantly impact the vessels and heart. The key problem, however, is pre-existing heart disease, often based on atherosclerosis or arterial hypertension. Efforts should be made to ensure that radiotherapy produces at most permissive cardiotoxicity, which will not affect the quality of life or survival.

Clinical data of VHD patients who underwent surgical treatment in Qingdao Cardiovascular Hospital from March 2022 to February 2024 were retrospectively collected. The patients were divided into a modeling group (n = 215) and a validation group (n = 54) in an 8:2 ratio. The modeling group was further divided into an HB group (n = 73) and a non-HB group (n = 142) based on whether HB occurred within one week after surgery. Multivariable logistic regression analysis was used to analyze the risk factors for HB in VHD patients. Risk prediction nomogram models were established using R3.6.1 software, and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves and calibration curves were plotted to evaluate the predictive performance and accuracy of the nomogram models.
The results of multivariable logistic regression analysis showed that the type of surgery (OR = 4.959, 95% CI: 2.592-9.487), preoperative MELD score (OR = 4.332, 95% CI: 2.061-9.105), CPB time (OR = 3.851, 95% CI: 1.591-9.321), aortic cross-clamp time (OR = 3.667, 95% CI: 1.521-8.841), intraoperative total blood transfusion volume (OR = 4.125, 95% CI: 1.982-8.586), and mechanical ventilation time (OR = 4.089, 95% CI: 2.000-8.362) were risk factors for the occurrence of HB in the modeling group (P < 0.05). The ROC analysis results showed that the area under the curve (AUC) of the nomogram model for predicting HB in the modeling group and validation group was 0.901 and 0.904, respectively. The calibration curve analysis results showed good consistency between the predicted and actual occurrence of HB in the predictive model, with Hosmer-Lemeshow chi-square statistics of 4.32 and 1.95 and corresponding P-values of 0.821 and 0.199.

Advances,"In case of Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia (SAB), complete cardiac implantable electronic device (CIED) removal is advised by the European Heart Rhythm Association.
The objective of the study was to estimate clinical outcomes after SAB in the Danish CIED carriers.
We conducted a nationwide register-based cohort study including all patients with SAB after CIED implantation between 2000 and 2020. Cumulative incidence of device removal, SAB reinfection, and all-cause mortality were estimated and compared to sex and age-matched non-CIED controls with SAB. Landmark analysis at the time of hospital discharge estimating mortality and reinfection according to CIED removal status in surviving patients was conducted.
In total, 1,816 patients with CIED and SAB and 9,080 matched controls were included in the study (median age 77.5 years, 73.0% males). Thirty-day all-cause mortality was 34.0% (95% CI: 31.8%-36.2%) in patients with CIED and 31.0% (95% CI: 30.0%-31.9%) in controls (P = 0.019, adjusted HR: 1.11 [95% CI: 1.02-1.22]). Device removal within 30 days was performed in 286 patients (15.8%). The landmark analysis showed significantly lower 180-days cumulative incidence of SAB reinfection and all-cause mortality in patients undergoing device removal compared to those with retained CIEDs (reinfection: 2.5% vs 5.5%; mortality: 7.8% vs 31.2%). Patients who underwent CIED removal were younger and had less comorbidity compared to those with retained CIEDs.
The Danish CIED carriers had slightly higher 30-day all-cause mortality after SAB compared to matched controls. Only a minor selected proportion underwent device removal after SAB diagnosis and, after initial survival, these patients had lower 180-days reinfection rates and mortality compared to patients with retained devices."

Current guidelines recommend aortic valve surgery (AVS) using LV end-systolic diameter index (LVESDi) with a uniform threshold, irrespective of sex.

To assess sex differences in LV remodeling using linear and volumetric dimensions and their association with outcomes in AR.
This was a multicenter cohort study of patients with moderate-severe AR and preserved LV ejection fraction (LVEF) between December 2003 and December 2022, with a median (IQR) follow-up of 7 (4-11) years. The study took place at 5 centers in the Netherlands, Singapore, Hong Kong, Canada, and Romania. Patients with at least moderate-severe AR and preserved LVEF (≥50%) were included. Those with symptoms, acute AR, significant other valvular disease, or prior valve surgery were excluded. Data were analyzed from January to November 2024.
LV dilatation assessed by LVESDi and LVESVi.
All-cause mortality during medical management and following AVS.
A total of 808 patients (mean [SD] age, 56 [19] years; 488 men and 320 women) were included, 323 of whom underwent AVS. Mean (SD) baseline LVESDi did not differ between sexes (women: 20 [5] mm/m2 vs men: 20 [4] mm/m2; P = .77), whereas men had larger mean (SD) LVESVi (39 [16] mL/m2 vs 31 [15] mL/m2; P < .001). During follow-up under medical management, 74 patients died. Adjusted 6-year survival was lower in women (80% vs 89%; P = .001). Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis identified LVESDi 20 mm/m2 or greater for both sexes, LVESVi 40 mL/m2 or greater for women, and LVESVi 45 mL/m2 or greater for men as thresholds associated with mortality. These cutoffs were validated using age-adjusted cubic splines and remained associated with outcomes after multivariable adjustment, with a differential effect by sex for LVESVi but not for LVESDi. After AVS, survival did not differ by sex (85% women vs 89% men; P = .31). Only preoperative LVESVi was associated with mortality, with a significant sex interaction (HR, 1.03; 95% CI, 1.00-1.06; P = .04).
In this study among individuals with moderate-severe AR, similar LVESDi thresholds (20 mm/m2) for both sexes, but lower than currently recommended by guidelines, were independently associated with mortality. In turn, LVESVi thresholds were 40 mL/m2 for women and 45 mL/m2 for men, suggesting the need for sex-specific cutoffs to improve risk stratification."

The functional outcome of ATF4 activation is critically dependent on the context: it usually contributes to cellular adaption and survival under mild or transient stress, yet triggers cell death when stress is severe or prolonged. Dysregulation of this dichotomous function has been implicated in a variety of diseases, such as cancer, neurodegenerative disease, metabolic disease, etc., highlighting ATF4 as a potential therapeutic target. Recently, growing evidence has further underscored the dual roles of ATF4 as the guardian or executioner in cardiovascular disorders, such as coronary heart disease, cardiomyopathy, arrhythmia, valvular heart disease, heart failure and cardiovascular aging. Here in this review, we systematically decode the context-dependent opposing roles of ATF4 in cardiovascular diseases and also highlight the underlying regulatory mechanisms, thereby providing a rationale for developing context-specific therapeutic strategies targeting ATF4 for the personalized management of cardiovascular disorders."

Its coexistence with rheumatic valvular heart disease with resultant severe pulmonary hypertension is exceedingly uncommon and poses unique diagnostic and management challenges. This case underscores the importance of maintaining a broad differential diagnosis, emphasizing that new or worsening respiratory symptoms in patients with established cardiac disease should not be automatically attributed to cardiac pathology alone. We report the case of a 63-year-old gentleman with longstanding rheumatic heart disease (RHD) who presented with progressive dyspnoea. Clinical evaluation revealed features suggestive of severe pulmonary hypertension. Investigations confirmed PAM with characteristic ""sandstorm"" calcifications on chest imaging, supported by bronchoalveolar lavage demonstrating calcospherites and identification of an SLC34A2 gene mutation, alongside rheumatic mitral stenosis. The patient's pulmonary hypertension was attributed to a combination of PAM and RHD. This case illustrates a rare combination of PAM with RHD and severe pulmonary hypertension. It underlines the importance of considering dual pathology in patients with complex cardiopulmonary presentations. Early recognition of PAM, even in the presence of another disease like RHD, is crucial for appropriate management and prognostication. This report adds to the limited literature on such coexistence and highlights the need for multidisciplinary care in these patients."

A retrospective analysis was conducted over six years to identify patients with MVP and moderate mitral regurgitation who had undergone cardiac MRI. The study included 20 patients and 20 healthy controls. Functional and strain assessments of the left ventricle (LV), right ventricle (RV), and left atrium (LA) were performed and compared to those of healthy controls. LACI was determined by calculating the ratio of the LA end-diastolic volume indexed to the left ventricular end-diastolic volume indexed, and it was correlated with conventional CMR and strain parameters. Native T1 mapping was used as a non-contrast CMR technique to assess diffuse myocardial fibrosis in all patients. LACI revealed a negative correlation with left ventricular end-diastolic volume indexed to body surface area (LVEDVI) and total left atrial ejection fraction (LAEF) (r = -0.39, -0.65, P < 0.05, respectively). In addition, LACI showed a correlation with strain parameters, specifically with LA longitudinal peak positive strain rate and left ventricular global circumferential strain (LV GCS) (r = 0.35, -0.49, P < 0.05, respectively). The results from the multivariate regression analysis indicated that the left atrial longitudinal reservoir strain (ξs) was independently associated with left ventricular ejection fraction [β = 0.529; 95% confidence intervals (CI) = 0.192 to 0.866] and LV GRS [β = 0.229; 95% CI = 0.128 to 0.330]. There were statistically significant differences in LACI and LA ξs between patients who experienced clinical events such as arrhythmia and those who did not, with p-values of < 0.05. Strain parameters showed better results in evaluating LA and LV coupling in our patient group. Elevated native T1 values correlated with LACI, impaired LV, and LA strain parameters."

Beyond being an incidental finding, MAC contributes to mitral valve dysfunction, arrhythmias, systemic embolisation and elevated cardiovascular risk. In developed countries, it has now overtaken rheumatic disease as the leading cause of mitral stenosis.The pathophysiology of MAC involves chronic mechanical stress, pro-inflammatory activation and osteogenic differentiation of valvular cells. Progression is accelerated by age, chronic kidney disease and metabolic derangements. Diagnosing MAC-related valve dysfunction is challenging, as traditional echocardiographic measures often prove unreliable. Multimodality imaging-including 3D echocardiography and cardiac CT-is essential for assessing anatomy, function and procedural feasibility. Importantly, symptoms often reflect combined valvular (eg, aortic stenosis) and myocardial disease (eg, heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) phenocopy), necessitating careful haemodynamic evaluation to avoid futile interventions.Management should prioritise medical therapy for symptom control and comorbid HFpEF, reserving interventions for selected patients. Surgical and transcatheter approaches carry high risk and should be undertaken only in specialised centres.

Advances,"Transcatheter tricuspid valve intervention (TTVI) has emerged as a valuable therapeutic option for patients with severe tricuspid regurgitation. However, the impact of TTVI on right ventricular (RV) function remains incompletely understood, partly due to the limitations of conventional echocardiographic parameters.
The purpose of this study was to evaluate RV functional trajectories in patients undergoing TTVI using a deep learning model that estimates RV ejection fraction (RVEF) from two-dimensional apical four-chamber view echocardiographic videos.
This single-center analysis included 373 patients undergoing TTVI for severe tricuspid regurgitation between 2018 and 2023. A previously published and thoroughly validated deep learning model was used to predict RVEF at baseline and 1 to 3 days after the procedure. The primary endpoint was 1-year all-cause mortality.
Although the median deep learning-predicted RVEFs were similar before and after TTVI at the cohort level, individual trajectories diverged. Using maximally selected log-rank statistics, an optimal prognostic threshold of 38% for postprocedural RVEF was identified. Patients below this threshold showed significantly worse 1-year survival compared to those above it (58.4% vs 85.1%; HR: 3.12; P < 0.001). RVEF in this high-risk group had declined from 41% (IQR: 38%-44%) at baseline to 36% (IQR: 35%-37%) postprocedurally (P < 0.001).
Deep learning enabled an unbiased echocardiographic assessment of RV function after TTVI and identified a high-risk group with poor outcomes. These findings are exploratory and require external validation; if confirmed, deep learning-enhanced echocardiography may improve risk stratification and guide personalized follow-up strategies in patients undergoing TTVI."

A retrospective observational single-centre study was conducted at a tertiary care hospital, including paediatric patients who underwent contrast enema between January 2011 and December 2023, either for suspected HD or other clinical indications. A classifier based on a pretrained DNN (DenseNet121) was developed to detect HD in contrast enema images. DNN performance was assessed using balanced accuracy, sensitivity, and the area under the receiver-operating characteristic curve (AUC-ROC) and area under the precision-recall curve (AUC-PR) analyses. Rectal biopsy was the reference standard, with clinical follow-up in cases where a biopsy was not performed. The DNN classification performance was compared to historical expert radiologic assessment.
A total of 278 contrast enemas were performed in 221 patients (64.8% male, 35.2% female), mean age of 4.14 years and a median of 2.65 years. DenseNet121 achieved 75.3% balanced accuracy, 58.5% sensitivity, and 92.1% specificity per individual image, improving to 82.8%, 72.7%, and 93.0%, respectively, at the contrast enema level. The model achieved a similar AUC-ROC compared to expert radiologists in their original reports (0.830 vs 0.804), and the interobserver agreement was moderate (Cohen´s kappa = 0.475).
The DNN model demonstrated higher specificity than radiologists in the interpretation of contrast enemas in patients with suspected HD. Moderate interobserver agreement underscores the model's potential value as a tool for diagnostic support and standardisation, particularly in settings where access to experienced specialists may be limited or in borderline cases.
Question Contrast enema is commonly used to evaluate suspected HD, but its diagnostic accuracy is variable and dependent on the radiologist's expertise. Findings A deep learning model outperformed radiologists in specificity (93.0% vs 79.1%), however, the difference was not statistically significant, and the interobserver agreement was moderate (Cohen´s kappa = 0.475). Clinical relevanceA DNN trained for automated analysis of contrast enema can identify patterns suggestive of HD with performance comparable to conventional radiological assessment, underscoring its value as a tool for diagnostic support in borderline cases or when access to experienced specialists may be limited."

Targeting sleep stage-specific neurophysiologies with adaptive Deep Brain Stimulation (aDBS) may ameliorate sleep disruption. This study analyzes the efficacy of personalized machine learning approaches on classifying sleep stages from participants receiving deep brain stimulation. We acquired 283 hours of multi-night intracranial cortico-basal recordings with synchronized sleep stage labels derived from scalp EEG across 5 participants during chronic stimulation. Five-stage classification accuracy across PD subjects averaged 80.2% (±0.9% SEM). When constraining sleep classification to algorithms implementable in currently available DBS devices, e.g., binary NREM classification using linear models, an average accuracy of 85.9% (±0.4% SEM) was achieved for PD subjects. Additionally, linear models trained on unsupervised cluster labels achieved an average accuracy of 83.5% (±5.6% SEM) when discriminating NREM sleep. Overall, this demonstrates the feasibility of personalized supervised and unsupervised ML models for sleep classification using intracranial data during stimulation. The Institutional Review Board approved the parent study protocol, and the study was registered on clinicaltrials.gov (NCT0358289; IDE G180097)."

Classical Tobit models fail to handle nonlinear relationships or perform high-dimensional variable selection, whereas deep learning approaches often prioritize prediction performance but lack selection and interpretation capabilities. To address this gap, we propose an integrated deep learning framework, the Deep Tobit model, which employs the negative Tobit log-likelihood as its loss function to properly account for data censoring. A two-stage feature selection algorithm is further developed, with theoretical guarantees on convergence rate and selection consistency. Extensive simulation studies and real-data applications on left-censored aero-engine casing vibration data and HIV viral load data demonstrate that the proposed framework outperforms several state-of-the-art baselines in both variable selection and prediction accuracy."

However, existing computational approaches for kcat prediction often suffer from limited accuracy and generalization, largely because most models rely only on substrate information and neglect the role of the full reaction context. Although TurNuP partially addresses this limitation by encoding entire reactions using binary fingerprints, its two-stage design separates enzyme and reaction modeling, limiting both predictive performance and interpretability. Here, we present PMAK, a deep learning framework that integrates pre-trained representations of enzyme sequences and reaction SMILES with a residue-aware attention mechanism. By jointly modeling enzymes and reactions, PMAK captures their interactions and highlights key residues contributing to catalytic activity. Comprehensive evaluations demonstrate that PMAK consistently outperforms existing methods, achieving average R2 improvements of approximately 16.9% and 10.0% over TurNuP under new-reaction and new-enzyme settings, respectively, in five-fold cross-validation. Beyond improved accuracy, PMAK provides interpretable insights into residues associated with enzyme catalysis, offering a robust and informative tool for enzyme kinetic prediction and related applications."

These technologies can continually monitor vital signs and behavioral characteristics to identify early cognitive deterioration in patients. Clinical examinations, neuroimaging, and cognitive testing are the main ways to identify Alzheimer's, but they are difficult, expensive, and frequently miss the illness early on. Such approaches lack the sensitivity and real-time monitoring essential for early intervention. Through wearable technology and sophisticated DL approaches, Early Detection using Deep Learning Algorithm (ED-DLA) tackles these constraints. In real time, wearable sensors capture data on heart rate, sleep habits, and physical activity. DL algorithms evaluate this data to identify early Alzheimer's. Continuous and non-invasive monitoring improves detection sensitivity and accuracy. To evaluate sequential wearable device data, the suggested technique uses an RNN-based image classification model. Temporal patterns are essential for understanding AD development, and the RNN does so well. The slight changes in cognitive and physical activities may indicate early-stage dementia. The suggested AD diagnosis and management system improves early detection accuracy and real-time monitoring, making it more dependable and scalable."

We develop a deep learning radiopathomic (DLRP) signature to fuse deep features of CT images and histological whole-slide-image, aiming to predict the recurrence-free survival (RFS) in HCC patients. The multi-omics data in The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database are used to assess the potential biological interpretation. A total of 599 patients are enrolled in this study and divided into the training (n = 272), internal test (n = 120), external test (n = 174), and TCGA (n = 33) cohorts. The DLRP signature shows better prediction for RFS than radiomics signature, pathomics signature, clinical model, and Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer stage in the external test cohort (C-index, 0.799 vs 0.541-0.738; P value range, <0.001-0.042). Patients in the high-risk group show worse RFS and overall survival in three cohorts than those in the low-risk group (all P < 0.001). The multi-omics data indicate that DLRP signature is relevant to Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway and tumor immune infiltration. We conclude that the DLRP signature can efficiently predict recurrence risk in HCC patients, thereby facilitating personalized precision therapy."
PubMed,deep learning,Deep learning with fourier features for regressive flow field reconstruction from sparse sensor measurements.,Phong C H Nguyen; Joseph B Choi; Quang-Trung Luu,10.1038/s41598-026-36301-y,2026-01-22,Scientific reports,"Many applications in computational and experimental fluid mechanics require effective methods for reconstructing the flow fields from limited sensor data. However, this task remains a significant challenge because the measurement operator that provides the punctual sensor measurement for a given state of the flow field is often ill-conditioned and non-invertible. This issue impedes the feasibility of identifying the forward map, which is, theoretically, the inverse of the measurement operator, for field reconstruction purposes. While data-driven methods are available, their generalizability across different flow conditions (e.g., different Reynold numbers) remains questioned. Moreover, they frequently face the problem of spectral bias, which leads to smooth and blurry reconstructed fields, thereby decreasing the accuracy of reconstruction. We introduce FLRNet, a deep learning method for flow field reconstruction from sparse sensor measurements. FLRNet employs a variational autoencoder with Fourier feature layers and incorporates an extra perceptual loss term during training to learn a rich, low-dimensional latent representation of the flow field. The learned latent representation is then correlated to the sensor measurement using an attention-based network. We validated the reconstruction capability and the generalizability of FLRNet under various fluid flow conditions and sensor configurations, including different sensor counts and sensor layouts. Numerical experiments show that in all tested scenarios, FLRNet consistently outperformed other baselines, delivering the most accurate reconstructed flow field and being the most robust to noise."

Single-cell chromatin accessibility (scATAC-seq) atlases enable training of sequence-to-function (S2F) deep learning models to decode enhancer logic. Yet, optimal criteria for constructing training datasets, i.e., the number of cells and ATAC fragments, remain unclear. Moreover, the suitability of different scATAC-seq platforms for such models has not been systematically tested. We introduce HyDrop v2, an improved custom droplet scATAC-seq method, and perform the first benchmark of scATAC-seq platforms focusing on its capacity to train S2F models and its capacity to yield TF footprints in different species. We show that lower fragment counts can be compensated for by increased cell numbers. S2F models trained on custom or commercial data perform comparably in enhancer prediction, sequence explainability, and transcription factor footprinting. We demonstrate that integrating data from different scATAC-seq platforms enables large-scale, cost-efficient atlas construction for deep learning-based regulatory modeling."

These RRIs appear to be important for several aspects of RNA metabolism. Sequencing-based analysis of the lncRNA Lhx1os interactors validates the importance of LCRs in shaping contacts potentially involved in neuronal development. Recognizing the pivotal role of sequence determinants, we develop RIME, a deep learning model that predicts RRIs by leveraging embeddings from a nucleic acid language model.

A curated dataset of 200 3D-MRIs (85% training/validation, 15% testing) including multiple applicator types, varying treated anatomies, and manual contours of OARs (bladder, rectum, sigmoid, small bowel) by 3 physicians was utilized to develop an nnU-Net-based autocontouring model. Iterative tuning was conducted to determine the optimal hyperparameters and enhance evaluation metrics. Model performance was assessed using quantitative metrics, like geometric (e.g., Dice Coefficient (DC) and Hausdorff Distance 95th Percentile (HD95)) and dosimetric (dose-volume histograms (DVHs), dose differences (ΔD2cc)), and then correlated with qualitative physician-review (modified Turing and Likert tests).
Geometric metrics were best for bladder (e.g., mean ± SD DC|HD95(mm) 0.93 ± 0.02|2.26 ± 1.07) with greater variability exhibited for small bowel (0.62 ± 0.16|24.90 ± 14.36). Dosimetric comparisons of manual vs predicted contours showed high agreement in DVHs, with mean ΔD2cc <0.60 Gy EQD23 across all OARs. Model performance was consistent, irrespective of applicator type, OAR volume, or contourer. Quantitative scores in support of DLM were not always associated with as favorable qualitative results, yet physician-review showed clinical acceptability (80% for bladder and rectum).
The DL-based autocontouring model, trained on a heterogeneous in-house dataset, demonstrates clinical acceptability for OARs as determined by comprehensive evaluation. It also shows promise for translatability to target contouring, and adaptability to other gynecological (noncervix) brachytherapy applications. Differences in qualitative and quantitative results exist; directionality and magnitude should be considered in clinical usability assessments of brachytherapy autocontouring models."

Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) is widely used to detect brain alterations for diagnosis, but most methods rely on single-scale information. Therefore, this study proposes the multi-view feature learning framework incorporating residual block-based 3D convolutional neural network (3D-CNN) for AD diagnosis. First, tract-based spatial statistics were applied to extract voxel-based features from fractional anisotropy (FA) and mean diffusivity (MD) maps. Second, the residual block-based 3D-CNN model was employed to extract high-level deep features, enhancing model ability to capture global contextual information. Third, fiber tracking was used to construct structural connectivity networks, which served as connectivity-based features. Fourth, radiomics was applied to extract texture and shape features from FA and MD images. These four types of features were linearly combined and subsequently reduced in dimensionality using the ReliefF algorithm. Finally, an ensemble learning strategy was employed to perform three binary classification tasks among the AD, mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and normal control (NC) groups. Additionally, layer-wise relevance propagation (LRP) was utilized to improve the interpretability of the 3D-CNN model. Evaluated on 427 subjects from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative database, the framework integrates complementary multi-scale information, achieving superior performance. For the AD vs. NC classification, it attained an accuracy of 97.6%, a sensitivity of 98.0%, and an area under the curve of 0.964, outperforming several state-of-the-art methods.

PubMed,deep learning,Deep learning motion correction of quantitative stress perfusion cardiovascular magnetic resonance.,Noortje I P Schueler; Nathan C K Wong; Richard J Crawley; Josien P W Pluim; Amedeo Chiribiri; Cian M Scannell,10.1016/j.jocmr.2026.102697,2026-01-20,Journal of cardiovascular magnetic resonance : official journal of the Society for Cardiovascular Magnetic Resonance,"Quantitative stress perfusion cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) is a valuable tool for assessing myocardial ischemia. Motion correction is a crucial step in automated quantification pipelines, especially for high-resolution pixel-wise mapping. Established methods for motion correction, based on image registration, are computationally intensive and sensitive to changes in image acquisitions, necessitating more efficient and robust solutions.
This study developed and evaluated an unsupervised deep learning-based motion correction pipeline. Based on a previously described approach, it corrects motion in three steps while using (robust) principal component analysis to mitigate the effects of the dynamic contrast. The time-consuming iterative registration optimizations are replaced with an efficient one-shot estimation by trained deep learning models. The pipeline aligns the perfusion series and includes auxiliary images series: the low-resolution, short-saturation preparation time arterial input function series and the proton density-weighted images. The deep learning models were trained and validated on multivendor data from 201 patients, with 38 held out for independent testing. The performance was evaluated in terms of the temporal alignment of the image series and the derived quantitative perfusion values in comparison to a previously established optimization-based registration approach.
The deep learning approach significantly improved temporal smoothness of time-intensity curves compared to the previously published baseline (p<0.001). Temporal alignment of the myocardium (based on automated segmentations) was similar between methods and significantly improved for both as compared to before registration (mean (standard deviation) Dice = 0.92 (0.04) and Dice = 0.91 (0.05) (respectively) vs Dice = 0.80 (0.09), both p<0.001). Quantitative perfusion maps were also smoother, indicating a reduction of motion artifacts, with a median (inter-quartile range) standard deviation of 0.52 (0.39) ml/min/g in myocardial segments, than before motion correction and improved compared to the baseline method (0.55 (0.44) ml/min/g). Processing time was reduced by a factor of 15 for a representative image series using the deep learning approach in comparison to the iterative method.
The deep learning approach offers faster and more robust motion correction for stress perfusion CMR, improving accuracy for the dynamic contrast-enhanced data and the auxiliary images. It was trained with multi-vendor data and different acquisition sequence implementations, so, as well as enhancing efficiency and performance, it could facilitate broader clinical use of quantitative perfusion CMR."

Predictions can be generated based on action-outcome contingency and suppress neural responses to sensory reafference for distinguishing the origin of stimuli. The action-outcome contingency can be flexible or relatively fixed (e.g., keypress could trigger various sounds vs. articulatory gestures generate corresponding speech sounds) and can be available during the entire course of action (including stages of intention, preparation and execution). Are motor-based predictions created equally based on different types of action-outcome contingency and during distinct stages of action? We conducted three EEG experiments to determine how motor preparation modulates auditory processing using a delayed keypress paradigm in which participants prepared to press a key to trigger a sound without knowing what key to press. In Experiment 1, keypress preparation showed overall enhanced N1 responses (∼100ms), largest for syllables, but did not reveal any suppression effects. Experiment 2 replicated N1 enhancement and showed significant P2 suppression (∼200 ms) in response to auditory syllables, when participants were pianists who had extensive keypress-sound mapping experience. Experiment 3, when pianists were in their unfamiliar pairing of lab keys and familiar piano tones, again showed N1 enhancement, but the P2 suppression was absent. Together, these results suggest that preparatory motor prediction in an optional mapping can influence auditory processing in multiple directions and motivate a two-stage gain-to-attenuation hypothesis that may depend on the precision (reliability) of action-outcome associations."

Patients demonstrate symptoms including aphasia, reduced syntactic complexity, and diminished verbal fluency that reflects underlying neural pathology in language-related cortical areas. Current detection methods rely on resource-intensive neuroimaging, invasive biomarker sampling, and extensive neuropsychological testing, creating substantial barriers to early diagnosis. While researchers have explored using acoustic features, paralinguistic markers, and text-based features for AD detection, existing approaches face fundamental limitations: traditional acoustic methods fail to capture semantic-cognitive content, text transcription is labor-intensive, and automatic speech recognition quality suffers due to pronunciation variations and cognitive impairments in elderly populations. This paper introduces cognitive acoustic symbolic transformation for ALzheimer's (COASTAL), a neurobiologically-inspired framework that models hierarchical speech processing pathways. COASTAL transforms acoustic patterns into discrete symbolic elements through a specialized transformation module before applying contextual analysis that mirrors prefrontal-temporal language networks. Evaluated on the ADReSSo corpus, COASTAL achieved 70.42% accuracy, outperforming established baselines by 5.63%. Integration with complementary self-supervised approaches through hierarchical fusion improved performance to 77.46%. Analysis revealed that preserving fine-grained temporal features through shallower transformation architecture significantly enhanced diagnostic accuracy, aligning with neuropsychological evidence that subtle timing patterns in speech provide sensitive markers of cognitive decline."

PubMed,deep learning,UNISELF: A unified network with instance normalization and self-ensembled lesion fusion for multiple sclerosis lesion segmentation.,Jinwei Zhang; Lianrui Zuo; Blake E Dewey; Samuel W Remedios; Yihao Liu; Savannah P Hays; Dzung L Pham; Ellen M Mowry; Scott D Newsome; Peter A Calabresi; Shiv Saidha; Aaron Carass; Jerry L Prince,10.1016/j.media.2026.103954,2026-01-20,Medical image analysis,"Automated segmentation of multiple sclerosis (MS) lesions using multicontrast magnetic resonance (MR) images improves efficiency and reproducibility compared to manual delineation, with deep learning (DL) methods achieving state-of-the-art performance. However, these DL-based methods have yet to simultaneously optimize in-domain accuracy and out-of-domain generalization when trained on a single source with limited data, or their performance has been unsatisfactory. To fill this gap, we propose a method called UNISELF, which achieves high accuracy within a single training domain while demonstrating strong generalizability across multiple out-of-domain test datasets. UNISELF employs a novel test-time self-ensembled lesion fusion to improve segmentation accuracy, and leverages test-time instance normalization (TTIN) of latent features to address domain shifts and missing input contrasts. Trained on the ISBI 2015 longitudinal MS segmentation challenge training dataset, UNISELF ranks among the best-performing methods on the challenge test dataset. Additionally, UNISELF outperforms all benchmark methods trained on the same ISBI training data across diverse out-of-domain test datasets with domain shifts and missing contrasts, including the public MICCAI 2016 and UMCL datasets, as well as a private multisite dataset. These test datasets exhibit domain shifts and/or missing contrasts caused by variations in acquisition protocols, scanner types, and imaging artifacts arising from imperfect acquisition. Our code is available at https://github.com/Jinwei1209/UNISELF."

With a focus on the prevalent psychological complications following the onset of this condition, this study aimed to explore the correlation between antenatal depression and Corona disease anxiety, personality traits, and postpartum depression during the COVID-19 pandemic.                                                           Materials and Methods:                     This cross-sectional descriptive-analytical study investigated women receiving care at health centers affiliated with Kerman University of Medical Sciences during the last month of their pregnancy and the postpartum period in 2022. Following the acquisition of informed consent, participants were assessed using various measures, including demographic and obstetric information, the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale, the Corona Disease Anxiety Scale (CDAS), and the NEO Personality Inventory-Revised during their third trimester of pregnancy. The same group of participants completed the Edinburgh Depression Scale and the Corona Disease Anxiety Scale (CDAS) 4-6 weeks after childbirth.                                                           Results and Discussion:                     There was a significant correlation between family income, unwanted pregnancy as perceived by both the mother and father, and antenatal depression. Additionally, marital satisfaction played a significant role in postpartum depression. Furthermore, antenatal depression was significantly associated with neuroticism, agreeableness, and physical symptoms related to Corona disease anxiety. Personality traits, with the exception of extroversion and conscientiousness, and various domains of Corona disease anxiety, excluding psychological symptoms, were also significantly associated with postpartum depression.                                                           Conclusion:                     During pandemics or epidemics, such as the COVID-19 outbreak, experiencing mental distress during pregnancy can contribute to mental health issues during the postpartum period. This risk is particularly true in individuals with unique personality traits, emphasizing the need for increased focus on mental health within prenatal care during these crises."

Method:                     This cross-sectional study was conducted in Kerman, Iran. Data were collected from patients who visited Afzalipour Hospital in Kerman more than twice during the COVID-19 epidemic from the end of February 2020 to March 21, 2021. We conducted two key analyses: 1. Mixed effect logistic regression was used to check the relationship between the variables and COVID-19 severity. 2. Mixed effect linear regression was used to check the relationship between the variables and the length of stay in the hospital.                                                           Results:                     The findings indicated that the most important risk factors for the severity of COVID-19 were heart diseases (OR=1.67,95%CI:1.20-2.30), increasing age (OR=2.23 for age&gt;54, 95%CI:1.70- 2.90), male gender (OR=1.47,95%CI:1.10-1.96), respiratory diseases other than asthma, and frequency of admission (OR=1.60,95%CI:1.20-2.15). All patients who underwent readmission experienced a shorter duration of hospitalization during their subsequent admission (OR=0.94,95%CI:0.91,0.96) and had a higher mortality rate (30% within 14 days, 26.6% between 14-90 days). Patients readmitted at intervals of 14-90 days and greater than 90 days exhibited lower disease severity compared to those readmitted within the 0-14 day period.                                                           Conclusion:                     Examining readmissions, the severity of COVID-19, and the length of hospital stay in affected patients are important factors for planning and allocating resources for COVID-19 management and treatment. These factors can help policymakers develop effective clinical guidelines for hospitalization or outpatient treatment of COVID-19 patients and contribute to reducing the burden of disease in the community."

Kinovea, as an accessible motion-analysis software, provides both visual and quantitative feedback. However, its application in supporting technique development among beginner athletes remains insufficiently explored. Aim: This study aims to describe the use of Kinovea in biomechanics training and examine its contribution to the awareness of kinematic characteristics and movement techniques among beginner athletes. Methods: A descriptive qualitative design involved 72 beginner athletes aged 18–25 years selected through purposive sampling. Data were collected over 16 weeks through interviews, field observations, and motion video recordings analyzed using Kinovea. Kinematic data focused on joint angles, stride behavior, and movement phases during walking, running, and the flight phase. Qualitative data were analyzed using content analysis with NVivo 12, while kinematic results were interpreted descriptively to identify performance patterns and areas for technical refinement. Result: Kinematic analysis showed coordinated joint-angle patterns across all phases. Walking analysis identified arm swing angles of 50.9°–58.8° and leg separation angles of 64.3°–67.2°, indicating a stable gait rhythm. The running analysis revealed knee angles of 68.8°–69.8° and elbow angles of 87.6°–89.1°, indicating efficient propulsive mechanics. The flight phase demonstrated knee angles of 81.2°–87.8° and elbow angles of 80.4°–88.3°, suggesting effective momentum use and postural stability. These measurements supported stride-efficiency assessment and technique evaluation. Qualitative findings revealed that Kinovea enabled athletes to interpret movement phases and identify technical inefficiencies through slow-motion and frame-by-frame visualization. Conclusion: Kinovea supports basic motion analysis by providing clear kinematic information and helping beginner athletes observe and refine their movement techniques. The findings also offer practical value for coaches by enabling more precise identification of inefficient patterns and guiding targeted corrections during early-stage training."
