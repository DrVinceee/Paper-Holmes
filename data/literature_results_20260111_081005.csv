If treated with transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR), patients with the combined phenotype (AS-CA) have a similar survival at 1 year compared to those with lone AS. This study aims to evaluate the long-term outcomes of AS-CA compared to lone AS.
Using a prospective, multicenter, observational, case-control design, we studied patients with severe AS referred for TAVR. All underwent bone scintigraphy to differentiate between AS-CA and lone AS. Outcomes were compared between the two cohorts. Mortality (all-cause and cardiovascular [CV]) and hospitalization for heart failure (HHF) were captured as clinical endpoints for long-term outcome.
406 patients [84(80-88) years, 50 % female, EuroSCORE-II 4.2 (3.7-5.0)] were recruited, of which 47 (11.6 %) had AS-CA (all transthyretin). Over a follow-up of 5.4 (4.9-5.8) years, 244 (60.1 %) patients died. AS-CA was associated with higher all-cause mortality (crude HR 1.75, 95 % CI 1.24-2.46; log-rank, p = 0.001), which remained significant after multivariate adjustment for clinical confounders (EuroSCORE-II, valve replacement; adjusted HR 1.72, 95 % CI 1.22-2.42; p = 0.002). AS-CA was not associated with CV mortality (log-rank, p = 0.18) or time to first HHF (log-rank, p = 0.43), but the rate of HHF was significantly higher in AS-CA compared to lone AS (129 versus 65 per 1000 patient years, p = 0.022).
AS-CA is associated with an increased long-term risk of all-cause mortality and rate of hospitalization for heart failure compared to patients with AS. Further studies evaluating the role of CA-specific therapies are warranted in this population."

Cardiovascular interventions,"A novel intra-annular, self-expanding transcatheter heart valve was introduced in the U.S. market in 2023 for treating native aortic stenosis in high- or extreme-risk patients.
The authors sought to report early real-world experience with the Navitor valve (Abbott Structural Heart) from the STS/ACC TVT Registry (Society of Thoracic Surgeons/American College of Cardiology Transcatheter Valve Therapy Registry).
Baseline, procedural, and follow-up data were prospectively collected and retrospectively analyzed. The primary outcome was a composite of all-cause mortality or stroke at 30 days. Additional safety and effectiveness outcomes were reported per registry definitions.
A total of 2,958 aortic stenosis patients were treated between January 2023 and December 2024. Mean age was 81.4 ± 7.6 years; 62.4% were female. Mean STS score was 6.6% ± 5.4%. Technical success rate was 97.9%, with in-hospital mortality rate at 1.3%. Thirty-day all-cause mortality or stroke rate was 5.2% (2.8% mortality, 2.7% stroke). Major vascular complications and new permanent pacemaker implantation (PPI) occurred in 1.8% and 17.8%, respectively. At 30 days, mean transvalvular gradient was 7.3 ± 3.8 mm Hg; aortic valve area was 1.98 ± 0.64 cm2; moderate or greater PVL occurred in 1.8%. Analysis of case volume showed reduced PPI rate with site experience beyond 20 cases for Navitor Classic (19.4% vs 13.5%; P = 0.0039) and Vision (19.1% vs 10.6%; P = 0.047). Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire Overall Summary score improved by 23.8 points from 52.1 ± 24.8 at baseline to 75.9 ± 22.6 at 30 days (P < 0.0001).
Early U.S. experience with the Navitor valve demonstrates favorable early clinical and hemodynamic outcomes, with improved PPI rate associated with procedural experience."

The contribution of MRAS variants to NS pathogenesis remains poorly characterized, and infective endocarditis (IE) is extremely rare in patients with NS.
A 22-year-old woman presented with typical dysmorphic features of NS, including short stature, broad forehead, hypertelorism, low-set posteriorly rotated ears, and a broad neck. She developed fever and progressive exertional dyspnea.
Echocardiography demonstrated obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy with vegetation located in the left ventricular outflow tract. Blood cultures grew Streptococcus mutans. Whole-exome sequencing identified a heterozygous MRAS c.203C>T (p.Thr68Ile) mutation affecting a highly conserved residue among RASopathy-associated GTPases, supporting the diagnosis of MRAS-associated Noonan syndrome complicated by infective endocarditis.
Antibiotic therapy was escalated to intravenous gentamicin (60 mg daily) combined with ceftriaxone in accordance with the 2023 European Society of Cardiology guidelines for infective endocarditis.
After one month of intravenous gentamicin and ceftriaxone therapy, fever resolved, and follow-up echocardiography showed disappearance of the vegetation. Residual cardiac abnormalities persisted, including marked left ventricular hypertrophy with left ventricular outflow tract obstruction, left atrial enlargement, moderate mitral regurgitation, patent foramen ovale with minor shunting, and impaired diastolic function. Exertional dyspnea remained despite resolution of the infection.
This case expands the genotypic spectrum of Noonan syndrome by supporting MRAS mutations as pathogenic drivers. It also identifies infective endocarditis as a previously unreported complication in MRAS-associated NS with outflow tract obstruction, highlighting the importance of careful cardiac surveillance in patients with RASopathies."

An 88-year-old female with a 40-year history of paroxysmal palpitations and chest tightness, with significant worsening of symptoms over the past 20 days. Despite undergoing AF ablation 5 years ago, her symptoms and arrhythmia burden persisted.
Long-standing (24 years) AF, severe AS, and a history of failed radiofrequency catheter ablation for AF.
The patient underwent left bundle branch pacing followed by AVNA.
During the 9-month follow-up period, her palpitations completely resolved, with no recorded atrial arrhythmias. The AF's impact on quality of life score significantly improved, and her performance on the 6-minute walk test markedly increased, indicating significant functional enhancement.
This case demonstrates that left bundle branch pacing combined with AVNA is clinically effective and technically feasible for AF patients in the elderly population with severe AS, particularly when conventional rhythm control methods fail. This approach offers an effective option for symptom relief and functional improvement in this challenging patient population."

Minimally invasive aortic valve replacement (MIAVR) has emerged as a potential way to combine the durability of surgery with reduced procedural trauma. This study aims to assess the safety and feasibility of MIAVR in elderly patients. Methods: A total of 990 patients were included in this retrospective cohort study. Among them, 261 (26%) were aged 70 years or older (elderly cohort), and 729 (74%) were younger than 70 years (younger cohort). All patients were followed for at least 30 days postoperatively, with survival data collected through May 2025. Multivariable logistic regression, linear regression, and Kaplan-Meier survival analyses were performed. Results: Elderly patients were more likely to be female (51% vs. 40%, p = 0.001) and carried a heavier burden of vascular and renal comorbidity: renal impairment 33% vs. 17% and extracardiac arteriopathy 45% vs. 30% (both p < 0.001). Major bleeding occurred more frequently in the elderly cohort (7.7% vs. 4.1%; p = 0.02), as did new permanent pacemaker implantation (10% vs. 5.8%; p = 0.021) and sepsis (3.4% vs. 1.1%; p = 0.012). Rates of stroke, perioperative myocardial infarction, ECMO/right-heart failure, re-thoracotomy, and postoperative dialysis were low and comparable across age groups (all p > 0.20). Overall, 30-day mortality was 2.4% (24/990), with crude mortality approximately threefold higher among patients aged ≥70 years (4.6% vs. 1.6%). Conclusions: Our findings indicate that MIAVR is a feasible and safe surgical option across age groups; Elevated morbidity in elderly patients is primarily due to bleeding, pacemaker implantation, and sepsis, while rates of stroke, renal failure, and myocardial infarction are low."

While the 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) is a common low-cost diagnostic test, its interpretation is limited by human variability. Through machine learning with large diverse ECG data sets and artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms, ECG analysis can be automated for pattern recognition with higher accuracy. AI-augmented ECG algorithms have been demonstrated to be able to detect myocardial infarction with high accuracy and reduce door-to-balloon coronary intervention times. Similar models can be utilized to detect subtle ECG waveforms suggestive of current or future asymptomatic left ventricular dysfunction, aortic stenosis, and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. Despite these promising results, there is concern for generalizability and bias or errors in training data. As AI systems evolve to multimodal integration, AI-augmented ECG has the potential to redefine cardiovascular diagnostics and enable earlier detection, risk stratification, and precision-guided interventions."

Increasing evidence identifies lipoprotein(a) [Lp(a)] as a causal factor linking lipid metabolism, inflammation, and valve calcification. Lp(a) levels are largely genetically determined and remain stable throughout life, making them a potential therapeutic target. This review summarizes the current evidence on Lp(a) and AVS pathophysiology, the diagnostic and prognostic role of Lp(a), and the therapeutic potential of Lp(a)-lowering agents. Emerging Lp(a)-targeted therapies, including antisense oligonucleotides and siRNA-based agents, could reshape AVS management by providing the first pharmacological option to slow disease progression in selected high-risk patients."

Trace elements are involved in cellular and physiological processes, playing regulatory and signaling roles. Their concentrations may be altered in various pathological conditions. The aim of our study was to compare trace metal concentrations in patients with severe aortic stenosis with and without coexisting coronary artery disease. Methods: In 53 patients (25 male, 47.2%, median age of 78 (75-81) years) with severe aortic stenosis, CAD coexistence and progression were analyzed based on the most recent coronary angiography report and history of revascularization. Blood samples for trace element analysis were collected prior to the implantation of the prosthesis, from the peripheral artery and by the pigtail catheter at the aortic root. Results: Twenty-six patients presented any degree of CAD, and were further differentiated into more advanced disease stages. The analysis found that patients with CAD had lower median concentrations of aluminum and calcium in the peripheral blood, and manganese and selenium in the aorta. Furthermore, in most advanced CAD patients, the concentration of magnesium, calcium, nickel, and copper in peripheral blood, along with chromium and selenium in aortic blood, was found to be lower compared to non-CAD patients. Lower selenium in aortic blood samples was predictive of an advanced stage of CAD. Conclusions: Patients with severe aortic stenosis and coexisting CAD present significantly lower blood concentrations of trace elements compared to those with the isolated disease."

However, a substantial proportion of cardiovascular events occur in individuals with LDL-C levels within the normal range, highlighting the need for additional risk markers. Lipoprotein(a) [Lp(a)] has emerged as an independent and genetically determined cardiovascular risk factor that is not adequately captured by conventional lipid profiling. Elevated Lp(a) levels are associated with an increased risk of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, including coronary artery disease, ischemic stroke, and calcific aortic valve stenosis, and appear to be particularly relevant in the context of premature cardiovascular events. The pathogenicity of Lp(a) is driven by distinct mechanisms that extend beyond cholesterol transport. These include pro-atherogenic, pro-inflammatory, and pro-thrombotic effects mediated largely by oxidized phospholipids carried by the particle and by the structural properties of apolipoprotein(a), which interfere with fibrinolysis. Despite its strong and stable genetic determination, Lp(a) remains underrecognized and inconsistently measured in clinical practice, partly due to historical limitations in assay standardization and reporting. This minireview summarizes current knowledge on the pathophysiological mechanisms underlying elevated Lp(a), discusses its clinical implications for cardiovascular risk assessment, and highlights the importance of standardized Lp(a) measurement in routine practice, particularly in light of emerging Lp(a)-targeted therapies."

NAMPT expression was examined in EC CXCR4 KO (AS) mouse hearts. Six-week-old AS mice received weekly injections of NAMPT-Exo, MSC-Exo, or PBS for three weeks, followed by echocardiography and histological examination of the valves (H&E, Alizarin Red, immunofluorescence). Cardiac ECs from control, AS, and NAMPT-Exo-treated mice were analyzed for miRNA expression (miR-146a-3p/5p, miR-125b-5p, miR-142a-5p). NAMPT expression was decreased in AS hearts. Treatment with NAMPT-Exo reduced aortic valve peak velocity, valvular thickening, and microcalcifications, while improving ejection fraction, fractional shortening, and ventricular dimensions. AS endothelial cells showed elevated levels of miR-146a-3p, miR-146a-5p, and miR-142a-5p, NAMPT-Exo specifically normalized miR-146a-3p. Histology revealed EndMT in AS valves, which was diminished by NAMPT-Exo. In vitro, inhibiting miR-146a-3p suppressed TGF-β-induced EndMT. Our results demonstrate that NAMPT-enriched MSC-derived exosomes effectively slow the progression of AS. Additionally, our findings highlight miR-146a-3p as a key regulator of EndMT, suggesting it as a potential molecular target for future therapies."

The most commonly affected genes were MYBPC3 and MYH7. Notably, two patients were found to have LEOPARD syndrome due to PTPN11 gene variants. Our results indicate that patients with an identified pathogenic variant were diagnosed with HCM at a younger age and exhibited a more severe phenotype (greater septal wall thickness), although no clear correlation with family history was observed. In addition, four novel MYBPC3 variants, c.3467dup, c.1503C>G, c.2610dup, and c.1251del, were identified."

However, in a significant portion of patients, resting findings do not fully reflect the hemodynamic severity of the condition, particularly in asymptomatic individuals with severe valvular disease or those with nonspecific symptoms. In this context, stress echocardiography emerges as a vital imaging modality, providing a dynamic assessment of valvular, ventricular, and pulmonary function under hemodynamic load (from physical exercise or pharmacological agents). Methods: We conducted a comprehensive synthesis and critical evaluation of the current landscape, recent advancements, and future directions regarding the application of stress echocardiography in valvular heart disease. Results: This comprehensive review explores the incremental role of stress echocardiography in valvular heart disease, analyzing the evolution of its clinical applications, from low-flow, low-gradient aortic stenosis to the evaluation of contractile reserve and exercise-induced pulmonary hypertension in mitral stenosis and regurgitation. We discuss standardized protocols, key parameters to monitor, and the diagnostic and prognostic outcomes from major clinical trials and current guidelines. Attention is given to stress echocardiography's ability to unmask the true severity of the disease and to identify patients at high risk for adverse events, thereby guiding crucial clinical decisions, such as the optimal timing for surgical or transcatheter intervention. Conclusions: The review evaluates the limitations of modality and outlines future research directions, including its integration with new technologies like 3D echocardiography and speckle tracking techniques, to further optimize the role of stress echocardiography as a decision-making tool in the multidisciplinary management of valvular heart disease."

The study aim is to unravel the genetic basis of BAV and its complications through a high-throughput sequencing (HTS) approach and segregation analysis if family members were available. Methods: Fifty-two Italian BAV patients were analyzed by HTS using the Illumina MiSeq platform. Targeted sequencing of 97 genes known to be or plausibly associated with connective tissue disorders or aorthopathy was performed. Thirty-five first-degree relatives of N = 10 probands underwent mutational screening for variants identified in the index cases. Results: HTS identified 194 rare (MAF < 0.01) variants in 63 genes. Regarding previously reported genes, five NOTCH1 variants in four BAV patients, four FBN1 variants in two patients and one GATA5 variant in one patient were identified. Interestingly, among further loci, the possible contribution of PDIA2, LRP1 and CAPN2 was suggested by (a) the increased prevalence of rare genetic variants, independently from their ACMG classification in the whole BAV cohort, and (b) segregation analyses of variants identified in family members. Moreover, the present data also suggest the possible contribution of rare variants to BAV complications, specifically MYLK in aortic dilatation, CAPN2 in BAV calcification and VHL and AGGF1 in valve stenosis. Conclusions: Our results underline clinical and genetic diagnosis complexity in traits considered monogenic, such as BAV, but characterized by variability in disease phenotypic expression (incomplete penetrance), as well as the contribution of different major and modifier genes to the development of complications."

This study aimed to evaluate the reintervention outcomes and long-term prognosis in patients with isolated AS following their initial aortic valve (AoV) repair.
A retrospective analysis was conducted on the clinical data of all patients with isolated AS who underwent initial AoV repair between 2013 and 2024. The primary outcome was the rate of freedom from reoperation after the initial procedure and secondary surgeries.
A total of 203 patients who underwent initial AoV repair were included. The median age at initial surgery was 2.4 (0.6, 4.7) years. The 30-day mortality rate was 0.5% (1/203). The 10-year freedom from AoV reoperation rate was 50.9% (95% CI: 36.2%-65.6%; n = 48/203). The 10-year freedom from AoV replacement rate was 62.7% (95% CI: 46.0%-79.4%; n = 28/203). Among the 48 patients who underwent reoperation, 20 underwent AoV repair and 28 underwent AoV replacement. Patients in the AoV replacement group were older (9.4 ± 4.0 years vs. 6.7 ± 3.6 years, P = 0.022) and had higher body weight (32.2 ± 14.3 kg vs. 22.8 ± 12.1 kg, P = 0.021). The 10-year freedom from AoV reoperation rate after the secondary procedure was 87.9% (95% CI: 73.4%-100.0%; n = 3/45). The 10-year freedom from moderate or greater AS/ aortic regurgitation was 50.2% (95% CI: 30.8%-69.6%; n = 15/45). Compared with secondary AoV repair, AoV replacement was associated with superior long-term outcomes (P = 0.001).
Favorable outcomes are achieved in patients with AS after initial AoV repair; however, nearly half of the patients may require reoperation within 10 years. For reoperations, AoV replacement is more likely to provide desirable long-term quality of life."

AS can culminate in heart failure if left untreated. Early treatment with minimally-invasive transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) is being evaluated in clinical trials. We addressed an unmet clinical need for early detection, referral to echocardiography for AS evaluation, and possible treatments (e.g., lifestyle changes, drugs, or TAVR). As aortic valve calcification (AVC) is typically present in AS, we created a method to detect AVC in low-cost/no-cost non-contrast CT calcium score (CTCS) screening exam images. We developed a multi-task deep network to identify a cylindrical aortic valve region of interest (ROI) and applied Agatston criteria within the ROI to obtain calcifications. Predicted ROIs had good agreement with cardiologists' labels and sometimes were better, and predicted Agatston scores agreed with cardiologists (r = 1.00, paired t-test p = 0.573, t = 0.57). On a retrospective screening cohort of 2000 + patients, we found that 20.6% of men and 22.2% of women had some degree of AVC. According to guidelines, 3.53% and 9.04%, respectively, would have severe AS. These promising results indicate that further evaluation of this approach is warranted, with the potential for significant public health impact."

A study on 46 patients, who were aged ≥ 3 months and suffered TOF, was carried out over a period from May 2023 to May 2024.
All 46 patients (mean age 8.4 months, weight 7.1 ± 1.8 kg) underwent TOF repair via right vertical infra-axillary thoracotomy. Only one patient required re-intervention for electrode wire bleeding, managed through the same incision. Mean cardiopulmonary bypass and aortic clamp times were 174 ± 48 and 108 ± 35 minutes, respectively. Average postoperative hospital stay was 10.3 ± 8.6 days. The most common early complications were postoperative pneumonia (26.1%) and junctional ectopic tachycardia (23.9%). Follow-up was conducted in all patients, with an average duration of 8.1 ± 4.3 months. At the last follow-up, right ventricular outflow tract pressure gradient decreased from 63 ± 23.2 to 20 ± 9.8 mmHg, and pulmonary valve annulus size increased from 8.7 ± 1.9 to 11.6 ± 1.8 mm. No deaths occurred during follow-up. Mild and moderate right ventricular outflow tract stenosis were observed in 22 (47.8%) and 2 (4.2%) patients, respectively. One patient (2.1%) developed moderate pulmonary valve regurgitation.
The early-term result of minimally invasive cardiac surgery in the treatment of TOF is relatively positive, making this a promising alternative to the traditional method. However, further practice in a narrow space is required to reach proficiency."

The HCM myocardium exhibited the depletion of reparative M2 macrophages and Tregs; enrichment of cytotoxic CD8+ T cells; and activation of the TNFα-NFκB, IL-6-JAK-STAT3, and PI3K-Akt pathways. Machine learning biomarkers (RASD1, FCN3, and PIK3R1) exhibited diagnostic accuracy (AUC > 0.85). Drug target predictions identified ruxolitinib and celecoxib as potential immunometabolic modulators (agents predicted to modulate both immune and metabolic pathways based on gene expression signatures). Conclusions: These findings support a hypothesis that HCM may involve immunogenetic mechanisms, rather than being exclusively sarcomeric in nature, although this remains to be validated. The integration of molecular and imaging biomarkers may enable precision immunotherapy, redefining HCM from a structural cardiomyopathy to a biologically stratified condition."

CT revealed a 20 × 10 mm ascending aortic pseudoaneurysm with a neck diameter of 7 mm, located near the suture line of a previous aortic root replacement, compressing a saphenous vein graft (SVG). Given the high risk of reoperation, percutaneous catheter closure with a 9/12 mm Amplatzer Vascular Plug II (AVP II) was performed alongside drug-eluting stent (4.0 × 18 mm) implantation to address SVG stenosis. Intraoperative intracardiac echocardiography (ICE) was essential for guiding AVP II deployment and ensuring accurate placement. This case highlights the effectiveness and safety of ICE-guided percutaneous interventions in managing complex aortic pathologies in high-risk patients. Successful closure of the pseudoaneurysm and resolution of the SVG compression demonstrated the feasibility of this minimally invasive approach in patients with complex surgical histories."

The specific relationship between DM and the extent and distribution of calcification within the thoracic aorta and its segments has not been fully elucidated in the literature. We aimed to assess the association of calcification of aorta segments, including root, ascending, arch, and descending parts, with coronary atherosclerotic burden, including CAC, stenosis severity, and non-calcified plaque in patients with DM.
This retrospective study included symptomatic patients with suspected coronary artery disease who underwent a 256-slice multi-detector computed tomography angiography examination between May and December 2024.
A total of 138 symptomatic patients were enrolled in this study. The enrolled patients were categorized into two groups: DM group (n = 60, with a mean age 58 ± 12 years and 42% males) and non-DM group (n = 78, with a mean age 54 ± 11 years and 53% males). Calcification of the descending aorta was significantly associated with the presence of significant coronary stenosis (≥ 50%), and this association remained statistically significant after adjustment for conventional coronary risk factors (P = 0.020). Calcification in the aortic root (r = 0.2, P = 0.016), ascending aorta (r = 0.3, P = 0.004), and descending aorta (r = 0.3, P = 0.002) was significantly correlated with CAC. However, these associations did not remain significant in regression analysis after adjusting for coronary risk factors. Calcification at different thoracic aorta segments showed no significant association with the presence of non-calcified coronary plaque.
Calcification of the descending aorta was independently associated with significant coronary stenosis in patients with DM."

Cardiovascular interventions,"The interplay between atrial fibrillation (AF) and tricuspid regurgitation (TR) has been recognized. However, it is not simple and has not been fully investigated.
The aim of this study was to examine the association among AF, TR, and outcomes in patients undergoing mitral valve transcatheter edge-to-edge repair (M-TEER).
Patients were divided into 4 groups according to the presence of AF and postprocedural significant TR (moderate or greater): no AF and no TR, no AF with significant TR, AF and no TR, and AF with significant TR. The primary outcome was cardiovascular death or heart failure (HF) hospitalization. Right heart structure and function were also evaluated according to AF and TR status.
The numbers of patients in each group were 1,184 (no AF and no TR), 229 (no AF with significant TR), 1,423 (AF and no TR), and 830 (AF with significant TR). AF was associated with a higher prevalence of significant TR at baseline and more frequent TR progression and less common improvement during follow-up. Both AF and TR appeared to be independently associated with right-ventricular remodeling and dysfunction, with distinct patterns observed according to MR and TR pathologies. TR grade moderate or greater after M-TEER was associated with a higher adjusted risk for cardiovascular death or HF hospitalization, especially in patients with AF (Pinteraction = 0.02).
Patients with AF, compared with those without AF, experienced greater incidence and progression and less common improvement of TR after M-TEER. In addition, both AF and TR appeared to be independently associated with worse right ventricular status and an increased risk for HF outcomes."

Immunoadsorption (IA), which removes pathogenic autoantibodies, has been proposed as a potential adjunctive therapy, but its clinical use remains limited. This case illustrates the potential benefits of IA in advanced, treatment-refractory DCM.
A 53-year-old woman with a 9-year history of DCM presented with recurrent chest tightness and dyspnea. Despite long-term guideline-directed medical therapy, her symptoms progressively worsened.
The patient had chronic DCM initially diagnosed in the peripartum period, with a left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) of 11% at onset. Before IA, echocardiography demonstrated severe systolic dysfunction (LVEF 22%-24%) with significant mitral regurgitation, and laboratory evaluation showed markedly elevated pro-BNP (4454 pg/mL).
The patient underwent two sessions of immunoadsorption in September 2024, followed by high-dose intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) as per standard protocols.
Following treatment, her symptoms improved, pro-BNP decreased to 2109 pg/mL, and repeat echocardiography showed an increase in LVEF to 29.2%.
This case suggests that immunoadsorption may offer clinical benefit in patients with advanced, refractory DCM. While promising, IA remains experimental and requires further investigation in larger, controlled studies."

Notably, to the best of our knowledge and following a systematic literature search conducted by our research team, no cases of NF1 complicated by severe cardiac structural abnormalities that ultimately lead to cerebral infarction have been reported to date. Thus, it is of paramount importance to avoid missed diagnosis by performing comprehensive cardiac-related examinations in patients with NF1. Case Presentation: A 20-year-old male patient diagnosed with NF1 presented with right-sided limb weakness and was initially identified with cerebral infarction. To clarify the underlying etiology, a comprehensive clinical evaluation was performed, including cardiac imaging assessments (to characterize cardiac structural changes) and whole-exome sequencing (to identify the presence of procoagulant gene mutations). Comprehensive evaluation revealed a spectrum of cardiac structural abnormalities in the patient: aortic valve prolapse with severe regurgitation, non-infective vegetations on the aortic valve leaflets, mild-to-moderate mitral regurgitation, left ventricular hypertrophy and dilation, and left atrial dilation. Whole-exome sequencing detected exclusively a pathogenic variant in the NF1 gene, with no other pathogenic/likely pathogenic variants or thrombophilia-associated polymorphisms being found. Laboratory investigations ruled out infectious etiologies, supporting the notion that NF1-mediated cardiac structural and developmental anomalies are the primary driver of cardiac vegetation formation, given the absence of other identified contributing factors; embolization of one such vegetation ultimately led to both splenic and cerebral infarction. Conclusions: This case emphasizes the necessity of implementing early and proactive cardiac evaluations in patients with NF1. Additionally, for NF1 individuals-particularly those presenting with suggestive vascular or cardiac symptoms-a comprehensive multifactorial assessment of thrombotic risk is critical. Collectively, maintaining clinical vigilance for cardiac abnormalities in NF1 patients and avoiding diagnostic oversight is essential to reduce life-threatening risks."

This prospective study evaluated survival and echocardiographic outcomes in dogs with severe mitral regurgitation (MR) following TEER performed at one referral center.
Dogs in American College of Veterinary Internal Medicine stages B2, C, and D meeting criteria for severe MR were treated by TEER. The procedure was performed via transapical approach and guided by transesophageal echocardiography and fluoroscopy.
One hundred eleven dogs underwent TEER between January 2021 and January 2025. Technical feasibility for placing one clamp was 97.3%, with a single clamp placed in 80 of 108 / (74%) and two clamps placed in 28 of 108 (26%) dogs. In-hospital mortality was 6.3%, and 3-month survival was 86.4%. Freedom from all-cause and cardiac-related mortality was 75% and 80% at one year and 67% and 78% at two years, respectively. Mean (standard deviation) regurgitant fraction decreased from 60.6 (13.3)% to 35 (23)% post procedure and was 30.7 (24.1)% at one year. Normalized left ventricular diastolic dimension decreased from 2.07 (0.24) to 1.84 (0.3) and short-axis left atrial-to-aortic ratio decreased from 2.31 (0.41) to 2.08 (0.45) immediately post procedure; these variables remained decreased at 1.79 (0.28) and 1.94 (0.46), respectively, at 1-year follow-up (P < 0.001).
Follow-up echocardiograms were obtained by multiple centers.
Intermediate outcomes after TEER demonstrated a likely benefit in dogs with severe MR as adjunct to medical therapy. Future goals include improving consistency of MR reduction, decreasing procedural complications through experience and refined case selection, and prospectively comparing to medical therapies."

Between May 2009 and January 2023, a total of 142 patients (89 males, 53 females; mean age: 56.6±11.9 years; range, 20 to 84 years) who underwent mitral valve repair with either QR (n=69) or BR (n=73) were retrospectively analyzed. Patients were evaluated using transthoracic and transesophageal echocardiography preoperatively, intraoperatively, and during mid-term follow-up. Clinical variables, echocardiographic parameters, and surgical data were compared between groups.
Baseline characteristics and preoperative echocardiographic findings were similar between the two groups. Both techniques resulted in significant improvements in the New York Heart Association functional class, mitral regurgitation severity, and left ventricular dimensions. However, the BR group demonstrated significantly improved posterior leaflet mobility (Wilkins score 1.97±0.74 vs. 3.23±0.79; p<0.001) and lower mean mitral valve gradient (3 [range, 2 to 4] vs. 6 [range, 5 to 7] mmHg; p<0.001). Coaptation depth was also significantly reduced in the BR group, indicating a more annular-level coaptation.
Butterfly resection is a technically feasible, effective, and anatomically favorable technique for mitral valve repair in Barlow's disease. Its ability to preserve leaflet mobility and minimize mitral gradients makes it a valuable addition to the surgical armamentarium, particularly in anatomically complex cases."

HUS can be divided into 2 subtypes: typical HUS and atypical HUS (aHUS). The standard treatment for aHUS, a complement-mediated thrombotic microangiopathy, as approved in the United States and European Union involves long-term administration of eculizumab or ravulizumab with complement-mediated thrombotic microangiopathy. This report is of a 70-year-old woman with aHUS triggered by artificial mitral valve dysfunction. CASE REPORT A 70-year-old woman with history of artificial mitral valve replacement was admitted to the nephrology department with suspected HUS. She presented with malaise, dyspnea, anemia, thrombocytopenia, hemolysis, and schistocytes in blood smear. Complement factors were normal, but sC5b-9 was elevated, suggesting complement overactivation. ADAMTS-13 was >10%, ruling out thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura. Infection with a Shiga toxin-producing bacterium was ruled out. Genetic tests for complement factors revealed no pathogenic variants. The patient was treated with eculizumab, leading to significant clinical improvement. Due to her cardiac history, a comprehensive cardiologic evaluation was performed, revealing perivalvular leakage and severe dysfunction of the mitral valve prosthesis. She subsequently underwent a 2-step intravascular mitral valve repair. The administration of eculizumab resulted in clear improvement in hemolysis, renal function, and platelet count prior to mitral valve surgery, strongly supporting the diagnosis of an aHUS-type thrombotic microangiopathy. Surgical intervention was subsequently performed and contributed to long-term stabilization. CONCLUSIONS This case underscores the challenges of treating thrombotic microangiopathy in a patient with multiple comorbidities and complicated medical history."

Less is known about the operator volumes-outcomes association in the contemporary era.
To determine whether an operator-level volume-outcomes association exists for TAVR and MTEER in the contemporary era.
This cohort study examined data from patients undergoing TAVR or MTEER between January 2020 and December 2023 included in the Society of Thoracic Surgeons (STS)/American College of Cardiology (ACC) Transcatheter Valve Therapies (TVT) Registry, a national all-comers real-world registry. Consecutive patients undergoing TAVR for aortic stenosis or MTEER for mitral regurgitation were included. Data analysis was performed from October 2024 to December 2025.
TAVR or MTEER.
The primary outcome measures were (1) 30-day all-cause mortality, (2) a 30-day composite outcome, and (3) in-hospital procedural complications following TAVR or MTEER. Data from the STS/ACC TVT Registry were analyzed for patients undergoing TAVR or MTEER between 2020 and 2023. The primary analysis assessed the association between operator volume and 30-day outcomes using a 2-level random-effects logistic regression model. The interaction between operator and hospital volumes and the association between TAVR and MTEER outcomes were also evaluated.
A total of 358 943 patients underwent TAVR at 827 hospitals (7524 operators; median [IQR] annual volume, 24 [11-47]), and 51 407 patients underwent MTEER at 493 hospitals (2483 operators; median [IQR] annual volume, 12 [7-19]). For TAVR, median (IQR) patient age was 79.0 (73.0-85.0) years, and 152 186 patients (42.4%) were female; for MTEER, median (IQR) patient age was 79.0 (71.0-84.0) years, and 23 402 patients (45.5%) were female. Low-volume operators demonstrated inferior process of care measures compared with high-volume operators. In adjusted analyses, a higher risk of 30-day mortality (odds ratio [OR], 1.13; 95% CI, 1.02-1.26; P = .02) and in-hospital complications (OR, 1.09; 95% CI, 1.03-1.16; P = .005) was observed for low-volume TAVR operators (<15/y) compared with high-volume operators (>37/y). For MTEER, in-hospital complications (OR, 1.31; 95% CI, 1.11-1.56; P = .002) were higher for low-volume operators (<8/y) compared with high-volume operators (>16/y), while 30-day mortality was not different (OR, 1.16; 95% CI, 0.96-1.41; P = .12). Associations were consistent across hospital volume strata. Operator-level outcomes for TAVR and MTEER were not correlated.
In this cohort study, results from a large, contemporary US registry demonstrate a persistent inverse association between operator volume and patient outcomes for both TAVR and MTEER. These findings may help inform future policies aimed at ensuring optimal outcomes."

We aimed to determine (i) whether baseline RRI predicts survival after mitral transcatheter edge-to-edge repair (M-TEER) and (ii) whether RRI changes in response to the procedure.
In this prospective, single-center cohort we enrolled consecutive patients with severe mitral regurgitation who underwent M-TEER between October 2020 and December 2021 (trial registration number 412/20, date of registration 02.09.2020). Baseline demographics, estimated laboratory parameters, comprehensive echocardiography, and Doppler-derived RRI were collected before and 3 months after intervention. The primary endpoint was all-cause mortality. Associations were analyzed with multivariable Cox regression. Renal endpoints were not systematically collected and were therefore not included as clinical outcome measures.
Among 109 patients (53.2% women), the median baseline RRI was 0.71 (IQR 0.67-0.75) and showed no correlation with eGFR, left-ventricular ejection fraction, or echocardiographic measurements of mitral regurgitation at baseline. Higher RRI was associated with all-cause mortality, and in exploratory post hoc analyses an RRI cutoff > 0.70 remained predictive independent of baseline renal function (HR 5.37, p 0.07). RRI improved significantly 3 months after M-TEER (0.67; IQR 0.63-0.70; p < 0.001), particularly in patients with a post-procedural MR reduction of at least 1 grade. However, the change in RRI showed no correlation with mortality or changes in renal function.
A baseline RRI above 0.70 was independently associated with mortality following M-TEER, underscoring its potential prognostic relevance. The marked post-procedural decline in RRI, especially in patients with relevant MR improvement, suggests that RRI reflects hemodynamic rather than renal filtration changes. Given the limited sample size and number of events, these findings should be considered exploratory and hypothesis-generating, requiring validation in larger multicenter cohorts."

We report a case of mitral valve replacement in a 76-year-old woman with a large caseous cavity, coronary artery disease, severe mitral valve stenosis and atrial fibrillation. Preoperative computed tomography showed a large caseous cavity (3 x 3.5 cm) in the posterior annulus extending into the atrioventricular groove. After unroofing and evacuation, the cavity was excluded with a pericardial patch. The lower edge of the patch was sutured to the ventricular side of the cavity; valve sutures passed through the residual posterior leaflet, the upper edge of the patch and the atrial edge of the cavity. The mitral prosthesis was then secured. The patient was weaned from cardiopulmonary bypass without complications. Intraoperative echocardiography demonstrated a well-seated mitral prosthesis with no valvular or paravalvular leaks. Postoperative imaging confirmed successful exclusion of the cavity in the atrioventricular groove. The postoperative echocardiogram revealed a mean gradient of 4 mmHg across the mitral prosthesis and no mitral regurgitation. Patch exclusion of the caseous cavity is a safe and feasible approach to support implanting a mitral prosthesis and obliterating a cavity."

Transcatheter edge-to-edge repair (TEER) of the mitral valve has been introduced as a therapeutic alternative for individuals with LVOT obstruction and concurrent MR, but there are insufficient outcome data. We aim to perform a systematic review and patient-level meta-analysis of the studies reporting the outcomes of TEER of the mitral valve in HCM.
Original studies published in PubMed and Google Scholar were included if ​≥1 of the following pre- and post-TEER measures were reported: peak resting or provoked LVOT gradients, MR grade, mitral valve gradient, or New York Heart Association (NYHA) functional class. One unpublished case from the Minneapolis Veterans Affairs Medical Center was also included.
Nineteen publications and 37 patients (mean age 70.1 [±15.2] years, 50% male, mean follow-up time of 9.2 [±6.4] months) were analyzed. Compared to baseline measurements, there was a significant reduction in the mean peak resting and provoked LVOT gradients (69.2 [±40.3] mmHg vs. 11.7 [±8.6] mmHg and 98.2 [±53.4] mmHg vs. 14.1 [±13.9] mmHg, respectively), median MR grade (4.0 [3.0-4.0] vs. 1.0 [1.0-1.0]), and proportion of patients with an NYHA functional class ≥3 (100 vs. 7%) post-TEER (all p < 0.001). There was a significant increase in mean mitral valve gradients post-TEER (2.2 [±1.0] mmHg vs. 4.3 [±1.3] mmHg, p < ​0.001).

Cavitron ultrasonic surgical aspiration (CUSA) has been reported as a method for controlled debridement of severe MAC during mitral valve surgery, however experience in the literature is limited.
We assessed 30-day and intermediate-term outcomes in 67 consecutive patients (mean age: 72 (SD 9) years; female sex: 65.7% (44/67)) with severe MAC who underwent mitral valve repair or replacement for mitral stenosis and/or regurgitation using CUSA between 3/2021 and 12/2024. Operations included isolated mitral valve replacement (41.8% (28/67)), isolated mitral valve repair (4.5% (3/67)), mitral and aortic valve replacement (37.3% (25/67), mitral valve replacement with coronary bypass (6.0% (4/67)), and mitral and aortic valve replacement with coronary bypass (10.4% (7/67)). Intermediate survival was estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method.
Mortality rate was 6.0% (4/67), stroke was 3.0% (2/67), and new postoperative atrial fibrillation was 29.0% (20/67). There were no atrioventricular groove ruptures. At a median echocardiographic follow-up time of 361 days (IQR 112, 671) moderate paravalvular leak occurred in 3.0% (1/67). Mid-term all-cause mortality was 9.0% at a mean follow-up time of 42.5 (95% CI 39.0, 46.0) months.
The use of CUSA to debride severe mitral annular calcification in patients undergoing mitral valve surgery is associated with acceptable short-term morbidity and mortality and durable intermediate-term results. This technique allows surgical intervention in patients who may otherwise be deemed prohibitive surgical risk."

One of the advantages of the proposed LVAD is in cases where end-stage left ventricular failure is accompanied by mitral valve regurgitation and pulmonary hypertension. Another advantage is minimally invasive implantation with minimal thoracic trauma, without disrupting the breathing process, which shortens the length of hospital stay. The best drive system for converting the rotary motion of the servo motor into reciprocating motion of the piston of the suction-discharge device was chosen. Two types of drive were considered, namely a yoke mechanism and a crank mechanism that were evaluated in terms of energy efficiency of the entire device. One of the most important conclusions is that both mechanisms have comparable operating parameters for balloon inflation and similar electrical energy consumption which amounts to comparable operating times for these mechanisms. However, the energy consumption of the yoke mechanism is slightly higher. At the same time the pressure in the left ventricle and aorta is slightly lower in comparison with a yoke mechanism. Furthermore, the results of the study also showed that the balloon pressures were significantly higher with crank drive, which may cause the balloons to wear out more quickly. The mass flow rates generated by both drives are similar with a slight advantage for the yoke mechanism. Finally, typical aortic, atrial and left ventricular pressure plots during the cardiac cycle are also shown."

While her preoperative transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) did not reveal a discrete mass, it showed a mean mitral gradient of 7 mmHg; intraoperative transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) identified a 2 cm × 1.2 cm thrombus on the bioprosthetic MV. Given these findings, the surgical team decided to replace the mitral valve concurrently with LVAD implantation. Although this approach is not routine, the goal was to improve her quality of life and reduce postoperative complications. Post-procedure TEE showed an improved MV mean gradient of 3 mmHg with no evidence of paravalvular leak.

The mechanisms underlying SMR are multifactorial. While guideline-directed medical therapy and cardiac resynchronisation therapy remain the cornerstone of HFrEF management, many patients with significant SMR continue to experience significant symptoms and adverse outcomes. Managing SMR within the context of HF necessitates a multifaceted approach. Transcatheter edge-to-edge repair (TEER) has emerged as a transformative intervention, demonstrating improvements in survival, functional capacity, and HF-related hospitalisations in clinical trials and real-world registries in selected patients. This review provides a comprehensive overview of the evidence supporting TEER, focusing on procedural and follow-up outcomes, and its role in reshaping the therapeutic approach for HF patients with SMR. Additionally, we highlight the critical role of patient selection and identify predictors of poor outcomes as key determinants of TEER success."

Current prognostic assessment of AR does not include the magnitude of mitral regurgitation (MR). Cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) can integrate volumetric data to obtain a novel combined parameter, total regurgitant fraction (TRF), which could have the potential ability to measure the combined effects of AR and MR on left ventricle (LV) overload. The aim of our study was to explore the usefulness of TRF in predicting the future need of aortic valve surgery in patients with CAMR.
Patients with CAMR and prior CMR studies were retrospectively recruited. A total of 45 patients were included, of whom 10 (22%) developed surgery indications. At the median follow-up time point (3.2 years), survival without surgery indication was 95% in the group with TRF < 40% compared to 90% in the group with aortic regurgitant fraction (ARF) < 29%. In contrast, 67% of patients with TRF ≥ 40% developed surgery indications after 3.2 years compared to 55% of patients with ARF ≥ 29%. In the multivariate analysis, the model including binary TRF had the highest hazard ratio of 13.846 (2.822 to 67.939, P = 0.001).
TRF is a promising CMR parameter that could improve the prediction of the need for surgery in patients with CAMR. Further studies with larger populations should be performed to confirm these findings."

A total of 261 adults (median age 70 [62-75], 72.4% male) with EuroSCORE II <3% and additional criteria undergoing elective or urgent coronary artery bypass graft, aortic valve replacement, or mitral valve repair.
None.
UFT completion was achieved in 209 patients (80.1%). 159 (60.9%) patients were extubated in the operating room after surgery. There were 13 reintubations, 12 for the need of a reoperation, and one due to respiratory insufficiency. No patients died within 30 days, and 97% of the cohort was still alive at follow-up. Successful patients had lower postoperative troponin, creatinine, pleural/mediastinal/pericardial drain output, fewer reoperations (1.5% v 19.2%) and a shorter hospital length of stay (5 days v 6 days).
The UFT protocol including stepdown from ICU within 6 hours after surgery proved feasible and safe to implement in a carefully selected cardiac surgery population and enabled efficient ICU bed turnover without compromising clinical outcomes. This approach may support the broader implementation of fast-track strategies."

However, the long-term prognostic impact of MVHD in this population remains poorly characterized. The aim of this study was to evaluate the long-term clinical outcomes and echocardiographic evolution of MVHD in TAVR recipients.
A total of 1,918 consecutive patients with severe symptomatic aortic stenosis (AS) undergoing TAVR were included. MVHD was defined as the presence of moderate or greater mitral (MR) and/or tricuspid regurgitation (TR) prior to the procedure. Baseline, procedural, and follow-up data (median of 4.0 [2.8-5.2] years) were prospectively collected. Changes in MR and/or TR severity were assessed from baseline to the last available echocardiography RESULTS: A total of 450 (23.5%) patients had MVHD at baseline. The presence of MVHD was associated with an increased all-cause mortality (adjusted HR: 1.21, 95% CI: 1.04-1.40; p=0.011) and cardiovascular mortality (adjusted HR: 1.29, 95% CI: 1.04-1.61; p=0.018) at follow-up. After adjustment, only baseline moderate or greater TR remained independently associated with all-cause mortality (HR: 1.38; CI: 1.04-1.84; p=0.027). At discharge, MR improved in 181 patients (51.7%) with similar rates across MR mechanism (p = 0.582), while those with TR improved in 71 (40.5%). MVHD improvement was sustained over time, whereas the absence of recovery was associated with a higher risk of all-cause mortality and cardiovascular mortality up to 6 years.
Patients with MVHD exhibit worse long-term outcomes after TAVR. While TAVR provides sustained improvement of concomitant valvular lesions in about half of patients, lack of recovery at discharge, predicted poorer long-term survival, highlighting the need for comprehensive baseline assessment and close echocardiographic follow-up in this high-risk population."

No study investigated the temporal trend of patient characteristics and outcomes in comparison with the published randomized trials.
To investigate the temporal trend in baseline characteristics and outcomes of patients with secondary MR who underwent transcatheter edge-to-edge repair of the mitral valve in the real world compared with those from the published landmark trials.
A comprehensive systematic literature search was conducted using MEDLINE, EMBASE, and CENTRAL databases, and the identified observational studies were divided into two five-year recruitment periods. The first period included 36 studies that enrolled patients between 2008 and 2012, and the second period included 25 studies that recruited patients between 2013 and 2017-2018. Pooled variables of each five-year recruitment period were compared with those of the landmark trials. A random-effects model was used for statistical comparisons. RStudio and RevMan software were used for the analysis.
Overall, there were no major variations in the findings between the first and the second five-year recruitment periods. EVEREST program vs observational studies: Patients in the EVEREST program were more likely to have non-ischemic MR etiology [odds ratio (OR) = 3.59, 95% confidence interval (CI): 2.92-4.42] and atrial fibrillation (OR = 1.71, 95%CI: 1.42-2.06).

COAPT trial vs observational studies: COAPT patients were more likely to have prior myocardial infarction (OR = 1.62, 95%CI: 1.27-2.06) and renal insufficiency (OR = 2.66, 95%CI: 2.05-3.45). They were more likely to receive beta-blockers (OR = 2.54, 95%CI: 1.68-3.85) and an implanted cardiac device (OR = 2.20, 95%CI: 1.71-2.84). There was no difference in procedure success or mortality. MITRA-FR trial vs observational studies: MITRA-FR patients were less likely to have atrial fibrillation (OR = 0.49, 95%CI: 0.34-0.69) and renal insufficiency (OR = 0.18, 95%CI: 0.11-0.28) but more likely to have a history of myocardial infarction (OR = 1.48, 95%CI: 1.06-2.05) and to receive diuretics (OR = 19.81, 95%CI: 2.75-142.48) and implantable cardiac devices (OR = 1.69, 95%CI: 1.21-2.37). At hospital presentation, they were less likely to be symptomatic (OR = 0.25, 95%CI: 0.18-0.35) without a difference in MR grades 3+ and 4+. There was no difference in terms of MR grade or mortality at 12-month follow-up.
Patients in the landmark studies may have favourable or unfavourable characteristics when compared to those in the observational studies, but this did not translate into different outcomes over time."

When standard treatments are ineffective or contraindicated, stereotactic arrhythmia radioablation (STAR) has emerged as a non-invasive salvage option.
This prospective, single-center study included 19 patients with structural heart disease and recurrent VT unresponsive to conventional therapy and who were ineligible for ablation. Patients were selected by a multidisciplinary team and underwent cardiac CT and electroanatomic mapping for substrate characterization. STAR was delivered in a single 25Gy fraction using volumetric modulated arc therapy. Primary endpoints included safety (adverse events within 12 months) and efficacy (reduction in VT burden, assessed by ICD-recorded anti-tachycardia pacing [ATP] and shocks).
During a median follow-up of 14 months [IQR 9-15], STAR was associated with a significant reduction in ICD therapies, with an average decrease of 81%. Mean ATP interventions/month dropped from 4.5±6.5 to 0.8±2.3 (p=0.029), and total ICD therapies/month decreased from 4.8±7.0 to 0.9±2.5 (p=0.032). Mild pulmonary injury and pericardial effusion occurred in 22.2% of patients. Most cases were asymptomatic; one patient (5.5%) required non-urgent pericardiocentesis. No significant changes in left ventricular function, valvular status, or coronary artery disease progression (assessed by CAD-RADS and PCAT analysis) were observed. One-year mortality was 33.3%; no deaths were directly attributable to STAR.
STAR shows promise as a safe, noninvasive option for patients with refractory VT and advanced cardiomyopathy. Larger multicenter studies are needed to confirm long-term outcomes and better define its clinical role."

We conducted an 18-year nationwide cohort study of adults hospitalised with native valve IE in Korea (2006-2023). Outcomes included in-hospital and 5-year all-cause mortality, IE relapse and a composite of death or relapse. Temporal trends, mortality predictors and surgical associations across age strata were evaluated using multivariable Cox models and stratified survival analyses.
Among 18 402 patients (mean age 63.7 years), incidence declined in individuals <45 years but increased in those ≥65 years. In-hospital mortality was 25.5%, and 5-year mortality exceeded 50% overall. Advanced age, dialysis dependence, cancer and major complications predicted mortality. Valve surgery, performed in 29.1% of patients, was consistently associated with lower short- and long-term mortality across age groups, with no evidence of age-by-treatment interaction. Both early (≤7 days) and late (>7 days) surgery showed reduced mortality versus medical therapy. IE relapse was more frequent in older adults, and surgery was associated with a lower relapse risk. In the composite outcome of death or relapse, older adults had a higher event burden, whereas surgery remained associated with fewer composite events.
Native valve IE in Korea has shifted toward an elderly, multimorbid population with persistently high mortality. Despite declining utilisation, the survival benefit of surgery was preserved across the age spectrum, supporting operative consideration in appropriately selected older adults."

The present study investiged the case of a 1-year-old girl born at term with no initial clinical or physical signs of cyanosis. A subtle additional heart murmur detected during routine examination prompted referral to a cardiologist. Subsequent echocardiography and computed tomography (CT) angiography confirmed TOF with APV and absence of the left pulmonary artery (LPA). The patient later underwent corrective surgery, including pulmonary valve reconstruction and pulmonary artery plication.
Although TOF is a common cyanotic congenital heart disease, certain variants of TOF, such as TOF with APV and absent LPA, may present without the typical cyanotic or respiratory symptoms. Therefore, even the slightest additional heart murmur should be thoroughly investigated. While clinical examination, arterial oxygenation, and echocardiography are essential, definitive diagnosis and precise anatomical characterization ultimately require CT angiography."

Objectives: This study attempts to construct a predictive nomogram for MACE incidence using clinical data from a STEMI registry. Methods: Tehran Heart Center's computerized record recognized all 65-year-old STEMI primary PCI patients consecutively. This retrospective study examined demographic, laboratory, clinical, and intra-procedural factors. Post-PCI univariate and multivariate analyses identified MACE risk variables. Decision curve analysis, ROC, and calibration plots validated predictive nomograms. R Studio and R used ""tidyverse"" and ""rms"" packages for all analyses. Results: The 1946 study included 70% training and 30% testing patients. Basic demographic and clinical variables were identical for both groups. The average follow-up was 17 months. 8 factors were selected for the nomogram after univariate and multivariate analysis: left-ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF), serum creatinine, hemoglobin, and fasting blood glucose levels, presence of valvular heart disease, post-PCI TIMI flow grade, diameter of the culprit lesion stent, and presence or absence of shock after PCI. The post-PCI MACE prediction AUC was 71%. Calibration plots showed that the nomogram model was well-calibrated and close to observed outcomes. Decision curve analysis also revealed that the model predicted MACE discriminatively. Conclusion: A nomogram successfully predicts MACE risk in older STEMI patients using laboratory, clinical, and procedural parameters. This algorithm may identify vulnerable high-risk patients for more aggressive preventative interventions. Clinical trial number: not applicable."

We retrospectively analyzed 128 consecutive patients with pure AR who underwent TAVR between 2018 and 2023 and experienced an acute postprocedural LVEF reduction (≥5%). LVEF was assessed using the Simpson's biplane method at discharge and at 1 month. Patients were categorized according to a 1-month LVEF change into Rebound pattern (≥10% increase) or Decliner pattern (<10% increase). The primary endpoint was major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE); secondary endpoints included 1-year LVEF normalization, cardiovascular mortality, and all-cause mortality. Group comparisons employed standard parametric or nonparametric tests. Predictors of 1-year LVEF normalization were assessed with multivariable logistic regression, while Kaplan-Meier and Cox models were used for time-to-event outcomes.
A Rebound pattern was observed in 54.69% of patients and was strongly associated with LVEF normalization at 1 year (odds ratio, 1.88; 95% CI, 1.57-1.96). Over a median follow-up of 945 days (interquartile range, 514-1319), the Rebound group experienced significantly fewer MACE (log-rank p = 0.043) and remained an independent protective factor for MACE, cardiovascular mortality, and all-cause mortality in multivariable analyses.
In patients with pure AR and acute LVEF decline after TAVR, early postoperative LVEF trajectory within 1 month independently predicts long-term functional recovery and prognosis. Routine assessment of early LVEF patterns may enhance risk stratification and inform individualized post-TAVR management."

Retrospective cohort study with pooled cross-sectional analysis.
VA patients who lived in the USA and underwent outpatient DCA in VAF or VACC between October 2015 and June 2019 (N = 31,640) were matched on nine baseline characteristics: age, race, rurality, drive distance to nearest VA primary care site, history of ischemic heart disease, history of valvular disease, procedure fiscal year, insurance status, and Elixhauser comorbidity index. Analysis was conducted from 2023 to 2025.
Thirty-day all-cause and cardiac-related mortality. Average treatment outcomes of VACC were estimated using weighted regression adjustment to account for selection into VACC. Sub-analyses included regression models stratified by diagnosis of valvular disease and heart failure.
Among 31,640 DCAs, 28.06% were performed through VACC. VACC and VAF DCAs were well-balanced. Overall, 30-day all-cause mortality was 0.96% (2.49% in VACC and 0.37% in VAF [SMD = 0.182]), and most were cardiac-related.

Unfortunately, there is no cure for dementia, and diagnosis usually happens at later stages when symptoms have significantly progressed. Early detection and accurate staging of dementia could slow down symptom progression and improve the quality of life for affected individuals. In recent years, deep Learning algorithms have emerged as a powerful tool in the early dementia diagnosis. By utilizing MRI images, deep learning techniques can effectively classify dementia at different stages, enabling quicker and more targeted interventions.
We used an MRI dataset from Kaggle, categorized into four classes: non-dementia, very mild dementia, mild dementia, and moderate dementia. The dataset was highly imbalanced, with only 1% of images representing moderate dementia. To address this, we trained a 6-layered Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) using two approaches: (1) a standard 6-layer CNN model and (2) a CNN with SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique) to mitigate class imbalance. Model performance was evaluated using accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, confusion matrix, as well as accuracy and loss curves.
Our SMOTE-CNN model, incorporated the SMOTE technique, showed significant improvements in classifying the four categories of dementia compared to the standard CNN model. The SMOTE-CNN model achieved an overall accuracy of 99%, while the standard CNN model had an accuracy of 71%. Precision, recall, and F1-scores for the SMOTE-CNN model were also notably higher, with perfect scores (1.00) for the 'Mild-Demented' and 'Moderate-Demented' classes, and near-perfect scores (0.99) for the 'Non-Demented' and 'Very Mild-Demented' classes. These results highlight the effectiveness of SMOTE in addressing class imbalance and improving model performance for dementia stage classification.
The results highlight deep learning's potential in enhancing dementia prediction and early detection, leading to better disease staging and management. By addressing class imbalance, we significantly boosted model performance. Future work should focus on validating with independent datasets and incorporating more balanced data to improve generalizability. Additionally, applying the CNN model to real-world data could further enhance dementia prediction and public health outcomes."
PubMed,deep learning,Quantifying central canal stenosis prediction uncertainty in SpineNet with conformal prediction.,Andrea Cina; Maria Monzon; Fabio Galbusera; Catherine R Jutzeler,10.1038/s41598-026-35343-6,2026-01-10,Scientific reports,"This study applies conformal prediction (CP) to SpineNet to quantify prediction uncertainty in the classification of central canal stenosis (CCS) into four grades: normal, mild, moderate, and severe. CP provides prediction sets rather than singleton predictions with a guaranteed probability of containing the true class, offering a transparent way to assess model reliability. This makes CP particularly useful in the medical field, where reliable predictions are critical for decision-making. We analysed 1689 vertebral levels (L1/L2 to L5/S1) from 340 patients who underwent T2-weighted MRI examinations and evaluated four CP methods across multiple significance level. (α). Bootstrap resampling was used to assess robustness across calibration/test splits. Among the evaluated CP methods, the class-conditional CP method consistently achieved the desired coverage while producing the smallest prediction set siss. Top-k produced larger, uninformative prediction sets (~ 4), and Least Ambiguous Set-Valued Classifiers (LAC) and Adaptive Prediction Sets (APS) showed reduced performance, particularly in moderate and severe cases. A class- and level-specific analysis with class-conditional CP (α = 0.15) revealed smaller prediction sets for normal and mild grades (~ 1.5) and larger sets (~ 2.7-3) for less frequent moderate and severe grades, reflecting higher uncertainty in these categories. Overall class-conditional CP emerged as the most reliable and clinically informative approach for estimating uncertainty in CCS grading."

Conventional methods lack precision for individualized risk assessment. Deep learning (DL) addresses these issues by integrating diverse data to improve survival prediction and risk stratification. This study introduces OvcaSurvivor, a novel multimodal DL framework for R0-resected OC patients, integrating whole-slide images (WSI), ultrasound (US), and clinical data from 543 patients. It uses advanced neural networks (CHIEF for WSI, ResNet50 for US) and an attention-guided fusion module. OvcaSurvivor showed superior performance, with C-indices of 0.81 (internal), 0.76 (external 1), and 0.70 (external 2). Time-dependent AUCs for 1-, 3-, and 5-year survival were highly accurate. WSI features drove prediction, and the model stratified patients into high/low-risk groups, highlighting clinical utility. This multimodal fusion advances OC precision oncology, enabling robust postoperative management."

Conventional techniques are largely based on experienced dermatologists, but manual inspection is time-consuming, subjective, and liable to misinterpretation, with high false positive outputs. To address these issues, we present a unique DCNN architecture that employs the Swish activation function to effectively identify complex patterns in the skin lesion dataset. This model has remarkable performance in diagnosing skin cancer, as evidenced by a 98.31% accuracy rate, a 98.12% precision rate, a 98.01% recall rate, and an F1-score of 98.09%. Utilising several localised and global explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) approaches, we evaluate the model's predictions to ensure transparency and reliability in medical contexts. To reconcile the disparity between AI research and its use in healthcare, our findings underscore the necessity of integrating deep learning with explainability. These XAI solutions tackle critical concerns such as inclusiveness, transparency, and error control, providing medical practitioners with a comprehensible and reliable framework for assessing the model's reasoning process. The suggested technique establishes a reliable mechanism to assist physicians in the early and precise identification of skin cancer, while enhancing diagnostic accuracy. Future studies will focus on enhancing the model's computational efficiency and incorporating more datasets to ensure its durability and fairness across various demographic groupings."

While crop and weed detection has been extensively studied, existing methods focus primarily on object-level recognition and often neglect fine-grained growth point localization. To address this limitation, we propose a novel training strategy, epoch-based prior annealing (EPA), which incorporates the excess green minus excess red (ExG-ExR) index as prior knowledge and introduces schedule factor and gain factor to effectively steer keypoint regression. The experimental results show that incorporating EPA improves keypoint localization performance, with mAP50 increasing by 0.024 and mAP50:95 by 0.011, while maintaining bounding box detection performance. The parameter sensitivity experiments confirmed that both excessively strong and weak guidance can hinder training. Furthermore, analysis of parameters and computational cost shows that the additional overhead introduced by the EPA strategy accounts for less than 0.5% of the total, and be considered negligible. In summary, the proposed EPA strategy significantly improves the accuracy, robustness, and generalizability of plant and growth point detection models, offering a practical and scalable solution for precision agricultural applications."

Existing temporal reasoning methods face challenges in jointly modelling fine-grained temporal dependencies, sparse event interactions, and maintaining coherent causal orderings across multi-domain datasets. In this paper, the author proposes TempReasoner, a new neural temporal graph network, based on dynamic spatio-temporal attention and reinforced temporal reasoning, an architecture that builds automated event timelines. We combine temporal knowledge graphs with adaptive graph neural networks and a multi-scale temporal attention model that jointly represent local event dependencies and global temporal patterns. The proposed system uses a hierarchical temporal encoder with gated recurrent units and introduces a new temporal consistency loss to maintain temporal coherence. Comprehensive testing on five benchmark datasets shows that TempReasoner achieves 94.3% accuracy in ordering event timelines and operates in real time with an average latency of 127 ms per event sequence. The system performs well across various areas, such as legal investigations, news analysis, and tracking biomedical events, and can therefore be easily integrated into enterprise applications."

Secondary aim was evaluation of workflow acceleration. Model was trained on ground truth segmentations. Internal and external validation was performed. AI-generated volumes of total aneurysm, lumen, and thrombus were correlated with ground truth. Model-enabled efficiency gains and semi-automatic AAA segmentations performed by three surgeons were measured. For total aneurysm, mean Dice similarity coefficient was 0.972 ± 0.013 and 0.960 ± 0.035 in internal and external validation.

Some tumors have (epi)genetic alterations causing homologous recombination deficiency, providing opportunities for targeted therapeutics including poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase inhibitors. However, the effects of targeted treatments are variable; therefore, functional assays are needed to predict the best personalized treatment options.
We developed a high-throughput spheroid-based assay using patient-derived breast cancer xenograft models sensitive and resistant to cisplatin. Methods were developed for automatic spheroid segmentation using deep learning to measure response of spheroids to treatment with cisplatin, olaparib and radiotherapy. We developed a method to distinguish between sensitive and resistant tumors based on predicting the percentage of responding and non-responding spheroids.
Here we show that differences in treatment response between cisplatin-sensitive and resistant tumors faithfully correspond with the expected in vivo responses. The assay is able to discriminate between olaparib-sensitive and resistant tumors based on predicting the percentage of responding and non-responding spheroids.
We demonstrate that this assay, guided by automatic spheroid segmentation using deep learning, may report on the tumor's sensitivity to therapies with the potential to be applied to functional precision oncology for breast cancer."

Dementia has become a major public health challenge, exerting profound impacts on socioeconomic systems and overall human well-being. The condition progressively deteriorates cognitive abilities such as memory, judgment, comprehension, and language, eventually resulting in the loss of independent daily functioning. In addition, patients often experience neuropsychiatric symptoms that severely diminish their quality of life. This study proposes an optimized machine learning model the Flying Geese Optimization Algorithm Support Vector Regression (FGOASVR) to effectively predict trends in dementia prevalence. The empirical analysis utilizes annual dementia diagnostic data from 1998 to 2023, obtained from Taiwan's National Health Insurance Research Database (NHIRD). To validate model performance, FGOASVR was compared against three categories of forecasting models: Statistical models: Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) and Holt-Winters Exponential Smoothing (HWETS); Deep learning model: Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM); Hybrid models: Support Vector Regression (SVR), Particle Swarm Optimization SVR (PSOSVR), Differential Evolution SVR (DESVR), Whale Optimization Algorithm SVR (WOASVR), and Harris Hawk Optimization SVR (HHOSVR). Performance was assessed using standard forecasting metrics Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) and Root Mean Square Error (RMSE). The FGOASVR model achieved the highest accuracy, with average MAPE values of 3.17 and 3.42, and RMSE values of 0.69 and 0.96 for males and females, respectively. These results confirm that FGOASVR delivers superior precision and stability in forecasting dementia trends in Taiwan, demonstrating its strong potential for advancing data-driven public health prediction and policy development."

The reservoir, with its 0D van der Waals interfaces on the order of 108, or 1.0×1010 mm-3, matches the synaptic quantity and density of the fruit fly's brain. The reservoir demonstrates the capability to perform a wide range of tasks from monomodal challenges to multimodal endeavors such as speech-to-image and medical image generation. The photosensitive mimetic synaptic connections in the very large scale reservoir emulate the optogenetic modulation of neuron circuits in in-vivo biological systems.

Onsite CT-FFR systems provide near-real-time physiologic evaluation at the workstation, potentially reducing unnecessary invasive testing. This study evaluated the diagnostic performance of a novel onsite deep learning CT-FFR algorithm compared with invasive instantaneous wave-free ratio (iFR).
We retrospectively analyzed 44 patients (44 lesions) who underwent clinically indicated coronary CT angiography (CCTA) and invasive iFR. CT-FFR values were generated using an onsite deep learning algorithm (cFFR v6) 1-2 ​cm distal to visually identified stenoses. Physiologic significance was defined as CT-FFR ≤0.80 or iFR ≤0.89. Diagnostic performance metrics were calculated overall and within CCTA stenosis strata (<50 ​%, 50-70 ​%, >70 ​%). ROC analysis and Pearson correlation assessed discriminative ability and linear association. Additional comparative analyses evaluated diagnostic accuracy of CCTA ≥50 ​% and ≥70 ​% thresholds relative to iFR and quantified incremental diagnostic value of CT-FFR over CCTA alone.
Of 44 lesions, 28 (63.6 ​%) were iFR-positive and 30 (68.2 ​%) were CT-FFR-positive. CT-FFR demonstrated a sensitivity of 89.3 ​%, specificity of 68.8 ​%, positive predictive value of 83.3 ​%, negative predictive value of 78.6 ​%, and accuracy of 81.8 ​%; the area under the ROC curve was 0.79 (95 ​% CI, 0.66-0.92). CT-FFR and iFR showed a modest but significant correlation (r ​≈ ​0.37). Performance remained favorable in moderate (40-70 ​%) stenoses (AUC 0.73) and severe (>70 ​%) stenoses (AUC 0.84). In contrast, CCTA ≥50 ​% and ≥70 ​% thresholds showed limited discriminatory ability versus iFR (AUC 0.44 and 0.52, respectively). Compared with CCTA alone, CT-FFR improved both sensitivity and specificity and substantially increased AUC across both thresholds.
The onsite deep learning CT-FFR algorithm demonstrated good diagnostic agreement with invasive iFR and maintained performance across stenosis severity categories, while providing clear incremental value over CCTA stenosis assessment alone. These findings support the feasibility of rapid, workstation-integrated physiologic assessment during CCTA interpretation. Larger multicenter studies are needed to validate these results and clarify the clinical role of onsite CT-FFR."

A total of 151 CBCT scans were analyzed, comprising 105 internal dataset scans(29,478 images) and 46 external scans. Expert-annotated internal data were used for model development with 78 for training/validation and 27 for testing. Fully supervised multi-task models were trained to segment pulp, primary and permanent hard tissue structures. Six architectures (ResEncM, U-Mamba Bot/Enc, WNet, UNETR, SegResNet) were evaluated using DSC, IoU, HD95, segmentation volume, and processing time.
Within the internal dataset, 3D_fullres ResEncM achieved the highest accuracy across structures and age groups. Permanent teeth were segmented most reliably (ages 6-9: DSC 0.9859 ± 0.0086, HD95 0.2035 ± 0.0925; ages 10-13: DSC 0.9825 ± 0.0100, HD95 0.2825 ± 0.0525), while primary teeth were less accurate, particularly in older children (10-13 years: DSC 0.8855 ± 0.1557, HD95 4.4201 ± 6.5116). U-Mamba Bot and U-Mamba Enc performed well, with U-Mamba Bot excelling in pulp segmentation and U-Mamba Enc in primary structures. WNet, UNETR, and SegResNet were less consistent, especially for primary teeth in older children. In external validation, ResEncM maintained the highest DSC (0.8464 ± 0.1226) and lowest HD95 (4.9078 ± 4.9058). All models showed no significant volume bias (p > 0.05) and high volumetric correlations (ρ ≥ 0.997). UNETR was fastest (0.48 ± 0.38 min), followed by U-Mamba Bot (0.60 ± 0.40 min).
nnU-Net ResEncM showed the strongest overall performance, while U-Mamba Bot and U-Mamba Enc excelled in pulp and primary-tooth segmentation. All three models performed well across age groups, with primary tooth segmentation more accurate in younger children. External testing confirmed adequate performance, though lower than on the internal dataset, supporting the feasibility of automated CBCT segmentation.
Automated segmentation of pulp and hard dental structures can streamline CBCT assessment and enhance workflow efficiency in managing developing teeth and complex orthodontic or surgical cases. This study provides a framework for incorporating AI-assisted analysis into pediatric dental imaging by including both primary and developing permanent dentition, as well as anomalous cases."

This approach has the potential to accelerate the estimation of precise RIs, accounting for influential variables such as age, gender, and ethnicity. Most existing methods are based on traditional statistics and hand-crafted algorithms. The investigation of supervised learning, which often outperforms traditional approaches, has been impeded by the limitations of real-world data. However, previous studies have widely used synthetic data for evaluating and benchmarking indirect methods due several advantages over real-world data, including greater control, variability, accessibility, and the availability of exact ground-truth RIs. Synthetic data may also provide a pathway for developing data-driven solutions for indirect RI estimation.
In this study, we leveraged synthetic data to train two convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to predict the parameters of underlying reference distributions (RDs) in diverse real-world clinical datasets. While one model was trained for standard univariate data, the other was extended to bivariate data, enabling the prediction of covariance between clinical analytes. Trained models were evaluated using both real-world and synthetic test datasets and compared with four alternative algorithms.
Model predictions closely matched directly estimated RIs and RDs in real-world data and known RDs in synthetic data, outperforming four alternative indirect methods: GMM, refineR, reflimR, and RINetv1. Using labeled healthy and HCV-positive groups in real data, we compared established univariate RIs with predicted multivariate reference regions (MRRs). On average, the MRRs showed 1) higher coverage of healthy patients (closer to the desired 95%) and 2) smaller regions, which reduce the likelihood of including abnormal values.
Synthetic data training is a viable approach for developing accurate indirect RI estimation models for both univariate and bivariate clinical data. This strategy could help address some limitations of real-world data, direct analyses, and univariate RIs."

Global health,"Although researchers have called for participatory, equitable, and decolonial global implementation research to be conducted, practical examples on how to do so are scarce, particularly in partnership with historically marginalised groups. In this Viewpoint, we share four recommendations on how to instil systems thinking principles into global implementation research to make it more participatory and equitable. Our recommendations centre around co-learning with community partners to gain a deep understanding of their preferences and the system, to then co-creating interventions and implementation strategies that consider structural drivers of health and centre around Indigenous knowledges and practices. For each recommendation, we contrast the traditional implementation science approach with our participatory systems thinking approach. We also suggest eight phases inspired by systems thinking principles and tools that researchers can follow to align with our recommendations. We share practical examples emerging from our experiences collaborating with policy makers and Maya Indigenous community partners with lived mental health experience in co-creating mental health interventions in rural Guatemala. Drawing from our team's discussions, we reflect on the ways in which our participatory systems thinking approach has brought us closer to conducting equitable implementation research. We also reflect on how historical and structural determinants of social inequities permeate our efforts to ensure research relevance, participation, and trust among partners."

With a focus on the prevalent psychological complications following the onset of this condition, this study aimed to explore the correlation between antenatal depression and Corona disease anxiety, personality traits, and postpartum depression during the COVID-19 pandemic.                                                           Materials and Methods:                     This cross-sectional descriptive-analytical study investigated women receiving care at health centers affiliated with Kerman University of Medical Sciences during the last month of their pregnancy and the postpartum period in 2022. Following the acquisition of informed consent, participants were assessed using various measures, including demographic and obstetric information, the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale, the Corona Disease Anxiety Scale (CDAS), and the NEO Personality Inventory-Revised during their third trimester of pregnancy. The same group of participants completed the Edinburgh Depression Scale and the Corona Disease Anxiety Scale (CDAS) 4-6 weeks after childbirth.                                                           Results and Discussion:                     There was a significant correlation between family income, unwanted pregnancy as perceived by both the mother and father, and antenatal depression. Additionally, marital satisfaction played a significant role in postpartum depression. Furthermore, antenatal depression was significantly associated with neuroticism, agreeableness, and physical symptoms related to Corona disease anxiety. Personality traits, with the exception of extroversion and conscientiousness, and various domains of Corona disease anxiety, excluding psychological symptoms, were also significantly associated with postpartum depression.                                                           Conclusion:                     During pandemics or epidemics, such as the COVID-19 outbreak, experiencing mental distress during pregnancy can contribute to mental health issues during the postpartum period. This risk is particularly true in individuals with unique personality traits, emphasizing the need for increased focus on mental health within prenatal care during these crises."

Method:                     This cross-sectional study was conducted in Kerman, Iran. Data were collected from patients who visited Afzalipour Hospital in Kerman more than twice during the COVID-19 epidemic from the end of February 2020 to March 21, 2021. We conducted two key analyses: 1. Mixed effect logistic regression was used to check the relationship between the variables and COVID-19 severity. 2. Mixed effect linear regression was used to check the relationship between the variables and the length of stay in the hospital.                                                           Results:                     The findings indicated that the most important risk factors for the severity of COVID-19 were heart diseases (OR=1.67,95%CI:1.20-2.30), increasing age (OR=2.23 for age&gt;54, 95%CI:1.70- 2.90), male gender (OR=1.47,95%CI:1.10-1.96), respiratory diseases other than asthma, and frequency of admission (OR=1.60,95%CI:1.20-2.15). All patients who underwent readmission experienced a shorter duration of hospitalization during their subsequent admission (OR=0.94,95%CI:0.91,0.96) and had a higher mortality rate (30% within 14 days, 26.6% between 14-90 days). Patients readmitted at intervals of 14-90 days and greater than 90 days exhibited lower disease severity compared to those readmitted within the 0-14 day period.                                                           Conclusion:                     Examining readmissions, the severity of COVID-19, and the length of hospital stay in affected patients are important factors for planning and allocating resources for COVID-19 management and treatment. These factors can help policymakers develop effective clinical guidelines for hospitalization or outpatient treatment of COVID-19 patients and contribute to reducing the burden of disease in the community."

Aim: This study aims to describe the use of Kinovea in biomechanics training and examine its contribution to the awareness of kinematic characteristics and movement techniques among beginner athletes. Methods: A descriptive qualitative design involved 72 beginner athletes aged 18–25 years selected through purposive sampling. Data were collected over 16 weeks through interviews, field observations, and motion video recordings analyzed using Kinovea. Kinematic data focused on joint angles, stride behavior, and movement phases during walking, running, and the flight phase. Qualitative data were analyzed using content analysis with NVivo 12, while kinematic results were interpreted descriptively to identify performance patterns and areas for technical refinement. Result: Kinematic analysis showed coordinated joint-angle patterns across all phases. Walking analysis identified arm swing angles of 50.9°–58.8° and leg separation angles of 64.3°–67.2°, indicating a stable gait rhythm. The running analysis revealed knee angles of 68.8°–69.8° and elbow angles of 87.6°–89.1°, indicating efficient propulsive mechanics. The flight phase demonstrated knee angles of 81.2°–87.8° and elbow angles of 80.4°–88.3°, suggesting effective momentum use and postural stability. These measurements supported stride-efficiency assessment and technique evaluation. Qualitative findings revealed that Kinovea enabled athletes to interpret movement phases and identify technical inefficiencies through slow-motion and frame-by-frame visualization. Conclusion: Kinovea supports basic motion analysis by providing clear kinematic information and helping beginner athletes observe and refine their movement techniques. The findings also offer practical value for coaches by enabling more precise identification of inefficient patterns and guiding targeted corrections during early-stage training."

OpenAlex,mitral regurgitation,Effects of Levosimendan in Patients with Severe Mitral Insufficiency and Left Ventricular Dysfunction Undergoing Transcatheter Edge-to-Edge Repair: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis,Stephanie Gladys Kühne; Deborah Penet; Simon Wölbert; Eva Harmel; Damyan Penev; Sebastien Elvinger; Mauro Chiarito; Philip W. J. Raake; Dario Bongiovanni,10.3390/jcdd13010040,2026-01-09,Journal of Cardiovascular Development and Disease,"Severe mitral regurgitation (MR) is one of the most common valvular heart diseases and is frequently associated with advanced left ventricular (LV) systolic dysfunction. Transcatheter edge-to-edge repair (TEER) offers effective symptom relief but may induce abrupt hemodynamic changes leading to afterload mismatch and acute LV failure. Levosimendan may help mitigate this complication by improving contractility, yet evidence supporting its use in this setting is scarce. Therefore, the aim of this study was to systematically evaluate the evidence on the effects of Levosimendan in patients with severe MR and LV dysfunction undergoing TEER. We performed a comprehensive search of PubMed, Embase, Scopus, and Google Scholar. Primary outcomes were postprocedural LV ejection fraction (LVEF) and systolic pulmonary artery pressure (sPAP). Secondary outcomes included procedural success, procedure duration, and in-hospital complications. Five studies comprising 315 patients (n = 141 Levosimendan, n = 174 controls) met the inclusion criteria. Pooled analysis showed no significant difference in postprocedural LVEF between Levosimendan-treated patients and controls (mean difference 0.45%, 95% CI [−1.46–2.35] p = 0.65) and no significant change from baseline. Similarly, postprocedural sPAP did not differ significantly. Procedural success was higher with Levosimendan, and procedure duration was shorter. These hypothesis-generating findings highlight the need for larger, prospective randomized trials to clarify the role of Levosimendan in this setting."

Objectives: We aimed to study with an automatic three-dimensional transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) dedicated software patients with moderate and severe mitral regurgitation when compared to patients with no structural cardiac chamber alterations (patients with patent foramen ovale (PFO) who underwent TEE) . Methods: We employed a TEE software dedicated to automatic analysis of 34 parameters of the mitral valve apparatus comparing MVP patients with moderate and severe mitral regurgitation and patients with PFO without cardiac chamber structural alterations. Mitral valve effective regurgitant orifice (ERO) and regurgitant volume were correlated to automatic MVP parameters. Results: 59 MVP patients and 43 PFO patients were analysed. All MVP patients presented P2 mitral valve prolapse, 15 (25.4 % ) with both posterior and anterior prolapse. Twenty-seven automatic parameters (79%) were different concerning MVP and PFO patients (p&amp;lt; 0.05): diameters, area, perimeter, height, angle, coaptation width, lenght, closure line lenght, annulus. ERO was 0.43 + 0.11 cm2 , and regurgitant volume: 62.2 + 14.9 ml/beat. Automatic analysis correlated to 75 percentile ERO MVP patients (ERO&amp;gt; 0.48 cm2): Posterior Leafltet Area (r:0.74, p:0.031); Posterior Leafltet Lenght (r:0.73, p:0.032); Tenting area (r:0,41, p:0.048). Conclusions: Automatic mitral valve parameters analysis were different concerning MVP and no structural cardiac chamber (PFO) patients. 75 percentile ERO MVP patients (ERO&amp;gt; 0.48 cm2) correlated to posterior leaflet parameters.This anatomic information could be useful to planning and surgical treatment of mitral valve prolapse patients."

Methods This retrospective study consecutively enrolled 175 patients with severe AS who underwent either SAVR or TAVR. Transthoracic echocardiograms obtained at baseline, 30 days, and 1 year after the procedure were analyzed by multiple echocardiographers at our institution. Results At baseline, the TAVR group was significantly older (74 ± 7 years vs. 62 ± 9 years, p &amp;lt; 0.001) and had a higher prevalence of hypertension (53.5% vs. 31.0%, p = 0.003), coronary artery disease (38.4% vs. 23.0%, p = 0.028), and atrial fibrillation (16.3% vs. 2.3%, p = 0.002). Additionally, the TAVR cohort demonstrated significantly worse cardiac functional status ( p &amp;lt; 0.001). Compared to TAVR patients, SAVR patients ( N = 87) exhibited a more pronounced reduction in left ventricular end-systolic dimension (−0.5 ± 0.65 cm vs. −0.2 ± 0.47 cm, p &amp;lt; 0.001) and left ventricular end-diastolic dimension (−0.6 ± 0.64 cm vs. −0.3 ± 0.55 cm, p &amp;lt; 0.001) at the 1-month follow-up. A decrease in left ventricular mass was observed in both groups from baseline to 1 month postoperatively, with the SAVR group showing a significantly greater reduction (LV mass: −67.3 ± 59.31 g vs. −38.2 ± 46.49 g, p = 0.003; LVMI: −39.1 ± 33.93 g/m 2 vs. −22.5 ± 27.08 g/m 2 , p = 0.005). However, these differences were not sustained at the 1-year follow-up. SAVR patients experienced a transient decline in right ventricular function at 1 month, which recovered by 1 year postoperatively. At the 1-year follow-up, the TAVR group experienced a higher incidence of Major Adverse Cardiac Events (MACE) ( p = 0.01), despite showing significant improvement in the severity of both mitral and tricuspid regurgitation compared to baseline ( p &amp;lt; 0.001). Although pulmonary artery pressure improved in both groups after AVR, the SAVR group demonstrated significantly lower pressure at 1 year ( p &amp;lt; 0.001). Conclusion In patients with severe aortic stenosis, SAVR was associated with more significant regression of left ventricular dimensions and mass at 1 month compared to TAVR, alongside a transient impairment of right ventricular function. By 1 year postoperatively, however, no significant differences in ventricular remodeling were observed between the two groups."

We present a case where an apico-aortic conduit offered a safer alternative. Case presentation A 20-year-old woman with Type IIIc GD (homozygous D409H mutation) presented with New York Heart Association (NYHA) Class III dyspnoea, palpitations, and syncope. She had hypertension, hypothyroidism, and a sibling deceased from the same condition. On enzyme replacement therapy for 6 years, she was found to have severe calcification of the aortic valve, root, and ascending aorta, stenosis of arch vessels, grade II aortic regurgitation, mild mitral stenosis, and proximal left anterior descending artery stenosis. Intraoperatively, extensive calcification precluded root and arch reconstruction. A left ventricular apex–descending thoracic aorta conduit with a mechanical valve was constructed, combined with coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) to the left anterior descending artery and an innominate artery bypass. Recovery was uneventful, and follow-up at 13 months showed the patient in NYHA Class I with patent conduit and grafts. Conclusions An apico–aortic conduit can provide a safe and effective solution in GD with porcelain aorta, avoiding high-risk aortic manipulation. To our knowledge, this is the first reported use of a valved conduit in Gaucher-related calcification, broadening surgical options for this complex patient group."

However, denoising strategies are crucial for the generation of reliable and high-quality InSAR products. In this framework, we propose a complete and generalized theoretical and statistical model to physically describe and simulate a noise-free interferogram, together with its corresponding noisy version, starting from the knowledge of the InSAR acquisition geometry and of the underlying topography. A deep-learning-based model is then trained in a fully-supervised manner to estimate high-resolution InSAR parameters, i.e. coherence and interferometric phase, leveraging the proposed statistical model. In particular, an accurate assessment of the network’s estimation performance is conducted by comparing it to state-of-the-art denoising filters, such as Boxcar and Phi-Net and showing the added value of the proposed theoretical modifications to the state-of-the-art literature."
OpenAlex,deep learning,Assessing knowledge in policing,Tom Cockcroft; Jennifer Norman; Clare Rawdin,,2026-05-05,CLOK (University of Central Lancashire),"Assessment is one important component of effective learning design. The process of assessment can be explained as starting with an understanding of what a learner needs to know or be able to do by the end of the learning experience, what they have to do to achieve this and what method is best applied to ascertain if the learner has reached the required level (Cockcroft, 2023). Without assessment, educators and trainers would have limited awareness of the extent to which (if at all) they are cultivating learners’ knowledge, attitudes and skills, both as the learning proceeds (formative assessment) and at the end of learning (summative assessment). Traditionally, much police learning and associated assessment has been in-house / work-based. It has been delivered within local Learning and Development units, typically by former police officers (Stanko & Hohl, 2018) with portfolios predominantly used as the mode of assessment for practitioners. The embedding of a professionalisation agenda over the last decade, however, has led to a renewed focus on assessment for officers who have joined through the graduate entry routes (formally known as the Policing Education Qualifications Framework, PEQF; see Wood, 2018), and continue to join through the Police Constable Entry Pathways (PCEP). Framed by recent trends within police learning and specifically developments in the field of rape investigation, the aim of this chapter is twofold. Firstly, there is a focus on what the Soteria ‘deep dives’ revealed about the process of assessment. In this chapter the focus is focused on the the role of assessment within the portfolio-based Serious Sexual Assault Investigator’s Development Programme (SSAIDP). Secondly, an examination of what ‘best practice assessment’ might look like in the Rape and Serious Sexual Offending (RASSO) context"

OpenAlex,deep learning,A Deep Learning Based Code Loop Discriminator for GPS Spoofing Mitigation,S. Tohidi; M. R. Mosavi,,2026-03-01,DOAJ (DOAJ: Directory of Open Access Journals),"A vital part of people's daily life is the position, navigation, and time service provided by the Global Positioning System (GPS), which is always accessible globally. Consequently, the security of the GPS receivers is crucial. Occasionally, intentional and unintentional interferences cause GPS location issues. Spoofing attack is the most severe interference to the GPS receivers, which results in positional mistakes. This paper's goal is to defend against the carry-off spoofing attacks. In a carry-off spoofing attempt, the spoofer transmits signals whose code phase and carrier frequency parameters are strikingly close to the actual signal in order to change the correlation values generated in the tracking stage. Discriminator output values alter as correlation values change. As a result, the Pseudo Random Noise (PRN) code generator unit creates a local replica, which forces the tracking loop to follow the fake signal instead of the real one. It is proposed in this paper that when spoofing attacks occur, discriminator output values be generated independently of correlation values. Specifically, when a spoofing signal is detected, the conventional discriminator is replaced by a Non-linear Autoregressive Exogenous Neural Network (NARX NN)-based predictor. This strategy protects the tracking loop from the effects of the spoofing signal. The efficiency of the provided strategy was evaluated using three spoofing data sets. The results of the suggested mitigation method, based on NARAX NN, show that it mitigates spoofing attacks by an average of 95.82%."

The proposed approach integrates multiple streams of GCN, based on the lightweight MobileNet architecture. The custom dataset is preprocessed to extract key skeletal points using Mediapipe, forming the input for the multiple GCN. Experiments were conducted to evaluate the proposed model's accuracy, comparing its performance with traditional architectures such as VGG and ViT. The experimental results highlight the proposed model superior performance, achieving an accuracy of 99.94% test on the custom ViSL dataset, reach accuracy of 0.993% and 0.994% on American Sign Language (ASL) and ASL MINST dataset, respectivly. The multi-stream GCN approach significantly outperformed traditional architectures in terms of both accuracy and computational efficiency. This study demonstrates the effectiveness of using multi-stream GCNs based on MobileNet for ViSL recognition, showcasing their potential for real-world applications."

This study explores the emotional anatomy of fake news by re-annotating the widely used LIAR dataset, creating the Emotion-Labelled Fake News Dataset (ELFND). By leveraging advanced NLP methods, with a focus on VADER sentiment analysis, the dataset categorizes news articles according to emotions tone conveyed. Ensemble machine learning models, Random Forest and Gradient Boosting are employed to detect fake news by analyzing its emotional content. Furthermore, AI explainability methods, including LIME and SHAP, are utilized to offer a deeper understanding of how the model generates predictions, shedding light on how specific emotions contribute to the classification of news as fake. The findings reveal that emotions are crucial in the structure of fake news, and the use of XAI enhances transparency in misinformation detection, offering a clearer understanding of the emotional drivers behind fake news."

However, stable multi-particle levitation remains challenging due to complex acoustic dynamics and limitations of existing models. We introduce AcoustoReinforce, a reinforcement learning-based path planner that autonomously controls the motion of multiple levitated particles. Leveraging a decentralized architecture, it learns local neural policies that generate particle trajectories independently, enabling scalable, communication-free control even in densely populated acoustic fields. To ensure physical feasibility, acoustic trapping strength is incorporated as a constraint during both training and inference, producing trajectories that are collision-free, acoustically stable, and physically realizable within real-world system constraints. Experiments on a realworld levitation platform show that AcoustoReinforce outperforms state-of-the-art planners, improving task success rates by up to 130% across diverse configurations. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of learning-based decentralized control for complex multi-object acoustophoresis in real environments."
OpenAlex,deep learning,Röntgen-CT-ondersteunde datagedreven in-procesmonitoring voor metaal- Laser Powder Bed Fusion,Zhengrui Tao,,2026-01-16,Lirias (KU Leuven),"Laser Powder Bed Fusion of metals (PBF-LB/M) promises design freedom for critical aerospace and biomedical parts, yet the cost and difficulty of post-build certification constrain its industrial adoption. This thesis advances qualify as-you-build manufacturing by developing high-fidelity, data-driven surrogate models that transform in-process monitoring data into real-time predictions of sub-surface pores and surface dimensional errors. A co-axial optical monitoring system comprising a photodiode and an NIR camera captured the laser-powder interaction, with X-ray computed tomography providing ground-truth labels. For binary pore detection, a hybrid CNN-LSTM model that incorporated inter-hatch and inter-layer remelting effects achieved an area under the Receiver Operating Characteristic curve (AUROC) of 0.91 for pores exceeding 8000 µm3. To predict keyhole pore, physics-informed melt pool features integrated into a Random Forest model (AUROC = 0.95) outperformed deep learning benchmarks, delivering superior accuracy at substantially lower computational cost. In lack-of-fusion porosity regression, the CNN-LSTM surrogate model achieved high accuracy in within-scenario predictions (RMSE = 2.1 %). Domain adversarial transfer learning enhanced cross-scenario performance by up to 35 %, highlighting the potential of the surrogate model to generalize across part positions and process parameters. The hyperparameter associated with inter-layer remelting was further validated against the ratio of melt pool depth to layer thickness, ensuring alignment with process physics. Surface geometric deviation prediction was advanced through a CNN-Transformer architecture that correlates melt pool signatures with CAD referenced 3D voxel volumes, achieving RMSE values of 6.1 µm (up-skin) and 27.4 µm (down-skin). Model interpretability was provided through Grad-CAM visualizations and Transformer attention maps, highlighting critical spatial regions and temporal dependencies governing defect formation. Collectively, these contributions support the vision of first-time-right manufacturing in PBF-LB/M. By strengthening defect localization, improving predictive fidelity, and enhancing generalization, this thesis lays the foundation for digital product passports, feedback-loop control, and broader industrial adoption of in-situ quality assurance."
