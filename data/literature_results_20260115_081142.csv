PubMed,aortic stenosis,Intravascular Lithotripsy of Negatively Remodeled Calcified Abdominal Aorta to Facilitate Transfemoral Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement.,Takeshi Nishi; Jagadeesh K Kalavakunta; Abhinav Sood; Jerry W Pratt; Frank Saltiel; Vishal Gupta,10.1016/j.jaccas.2025.106527,2025-12-18,JACC. Case reports,"Transfemoral access is the preferred route for transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR), but severe calcification and luminal narrowing of the iliofemoral artery or abdominal aorta may preclude safe large-bore sheath passage. Intravascular lithotripsy (IVL) has been increasingly used for iliofemoral vessel preparation, yet its application in the abdominal aorta has been rarely reported.
An 84-year-old woman with symptomatic severe aortic stenosis was deemed high risk for transfemoral TAVR owing to severe narrowing with circumferential calcification of infrarenal aorta with luminal diameter <5 mm. To preserve transfemoral access, IVL with a 7.0-mm Shockwave balloon was performed using stepwise low-pressure inflations (1-6 atm, 300 pulses), achieving adequate luminal expansion for an 18-F sheath. A 23-mm self-expanding valve was successfully implanted without complications, and the patient was discharged the next day.
This case demonstrates that IVL can safely modify a small-caliber, circumferentially calcified iliofemoral and abdominal aorta to facilitate transfemoral TAVR.
Stepwise low-pressure inflations and meticulous procedural planning may expand the feasibility of transfemoral access in patients otherwise considered for higher-risk alternative routes."

While transthoracic echocardiography remains the diagnostic standard, deep learning-based approaches offer the potential for improved disease tracking. This study examined the longitudinal changes in a previously developed deep learning-derived index for AS continuum (DLi-ASc) and assessed its prognostic association with progression to severe AS.
We retrospectively analyzed 2373 patients (7371 transthoracic echocardiographies) from 2 tertiary hospitals. DLi-ASc (scaled 0-100), derived from parasternal long-axis and short-axis views, was tracked longitudinally. The median follow-up duration was 42.8 (interquartile range, 22.2-75.7) months.
DLi-ASc increased in parallel with worsening AS stages (P for trend<0.001) and showed strong correlations with aortic valve maximal velocity (Pearson correlation coefficient, 0.69; P<0.001) and mean pressure gradient (Pearson correlation coefficient, 0.66; P<0.001). Higher baseline DLi-ASc was associated with a faster AS progression rate (P for trend<0.001). Additionally, the annualized change in DLi-ASc, estimated using linear mixed-effect models, correlated strongly with the annualized progression of aortic valve maximal velocity (Pearson correlation coefficient, 0.71, P<0.001) and mean pressure gradient (Pearson correlation coefficient, =0.68; P<0.001). In Fine-Gray competing risk models, baseline DLi-ASc was independently associated with progression to severe AS, even after adjustment for aortic valve maximal velocity or mean pressure gradient (hazard ratios per 10-point increase, 2.38 and 2.80, respectively).
DLi-ASc increased in parallel with AS progression and was independently associated with severe AS progression. These findings support its role as a noninvasive imaging-based digital marker for longitudinal AS monitoring and risk stratification."

ARIC (Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities) study participants with protocol echocardiography at Visit 5 (V5; 2011-2013) and free of aortic valve (AV) replacement or cardiovascular disease were classified by ACC/AHA AS stages at V5 and Visit 7 (V7; 2018-2019). AS stage progression was defined as AV replacement or hospitalization, or a higher stage at V7. Associations of AS stage at V5 and AS stage progression from V5 to V7 with cardiac structure and function were assessed using multivariable linear regression. Associations of extra-AV cardiac abnormality categories with AS stage progression were assessed by multivariable logistic regression.
Of 5206 V5 participants (age 75±5 years, 40% men), AS stages A and B at V5 were associated with greater left ventricular wall thickness, mass, and filling pressure measures at both V5 and V7 compared with Stage 0. Among 1562 participants with assessable AS stage at V7, AS stage progression occurred in 370 and was associated with greater worsening of these measures (all P<0.02). The presence of both left ventricular and left atrial extra-AV abnormalities was associated with greater likelihood of AS stage progression (odds ratio 1.7 [95% CI, 1.2-2.6], P=0.009).
Early AS stages are associated with greater left ventricular mass and diastolic dysfunction, and AS stage progression is associated with worsening of these measures. The presence of both left ventricular and left atrial extra-AV abnormalities is associated with a greater likelihood of early AS stage progression."

To better comprehend the causal link between circulating cytokines and CAVS, we performed a bidirectional Mendelian randomization (MR) study. Genetic variants associated with 41 cytokines were obtained from public genome-wide association study (GWAS), and summary statistics for GWAS of CAVS were obtained from the FinnGen consortium. Forward MR analysis was conducted to determine the impacts of 41 cytokines on CAVS risk and reverse MR analysis was used to determine whether genetic susceptibility to CAVS altered the levels of these cytokines. Inverse-variance weighting (IVW) was implemented as the primary method, and several different sensitivity analyses were used to verify the reliability of the findings. Our results found no significant association between 41 cytokines and CAVS risk. However, increased levels of interleukin-18 (IL-18) (odds ratio [OR] = 1.080, 95% CI: 1.024-1.139) and interferon-gamma (IFN-γ) (OR = 1.157, 95% CI: 1.028-1.302) had suggestive connections with an elevated risk of CAVS, and increased levels of IL-13 (OR = 0.942, 95% CI: 0.890-0.997) and IL-5 (OR = 0.892, 95% CI: 0.804-0.990) had suggestive associations with a reduced risk of CAVS. A reverse MR analysis found that CAVS had a suggestive relationship with a reduced level of platelet-derived growth factor BB (PDGF-BB) (OR = 0.920, 95% CI: 0.853-0.993) and IL-4 (OR = 0.925, 95% CI: 0.856-1.000). Our findings suggest the causal effects of IL-18, IFN-γ, IL-13, and IL-5 on CAVS risk, and genetic predisposition of CAVS may reduce the levels of PDGF-BB and IL-4."

Brachial-ankle pulse wave velocity (baPWV) is an established marker of arterial stiffness and a predictor of cardiovascular events. This study investigated the association between FLI and baPWV in a general Japanese population.
This cross-sectional study included participants aged ≥18 years, excluding those with atrial fibrillation, lower extremity artery disease, severe aortic stenosis, or missing data. The primary outcome was an elevated baPWV (≥1,800 cm/s). Multivariable logistic regression analysis was performed to assess the association between FLI and elevated baPWV, considering FLI both as a categorical variable (low risk: FLI <30; moderate risk: FLI ≥30 and <60; high risk: FLI ≥60) and as a continuous variable (per 10-unit increase). The analysis included 10,122 individuals (mean age 54.3 years; 55% male). In multivariable-adjusted models, the odds of elevated baPWV were significantly higher in the moderate-risk (odds ratio [OR] 1.47; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.20-1.79) and high-risk (OR 1.78; 95% CI 1.33-2.38) groups, using the low-risk group as the reference category. Each 10-unit increase in FLI was associated with significantly higher odds of the outcome (OR 1.16; 95% CI 1.10-1.22).
FLI showed a significant association with arterial stiffness in the general Japanese population."

Factors contributing to frailty include sarcopenia (characterized by reduced muscle mass), osteopenia (characterized by decreased bone mineral density), and the newly termed osteosarcopenia, which is characterized by a simultaneous decline in muscle mass and bone mineral density. In this study, we aimed to investigate the impacts of sarcopenia, osteopenia, and osteosarcopenia on the clinical outcomes of TAVI.
We retrospectively analyzed 490 patients who underwent TAVI for aortic stenosis at Yamaguchi University Hospital between April 2014 and March 2025. Osteopenia, sarcopenia, and osteosarcopenia were diagnosed by preprocedural computed tomography. Patients were classified into normal (N), sarcopenia alone (S), osteopenia alone (O), and osteosarcopenia (OS) groups. Early clinical outcomes and 1-year survival rates exhibited no significant differences among the groups. However, the 5-year survival rates were 94.1%, 77.6%, 60.4%, and 46.5% in the N, S, O, and OS groups, respectively (P<0.05). The Cox proportional hazards model revealed osteosarcopenia as a significant risk factor for late death (hazard ratio, 2.09; P=0.0002).

PubMed,aortic stenosis,Intravascular Lithotripsy for Suprarenal Coral Reef Aorta: A Novel Endovascular Approach to Complex Calcified Disease.,Thalis Charalambous; Fotios Sousamlis; Grigorios Katsantouris; Eleftherios Gerardos; Nikolaos Zannes,10.7759/cureus.99086,2025-12,Cureus,"Coral reef aorta (CRA) is a rare atherosclerotic disease characterized by the presence of exophytic, calcified lesions protruding into the aortic lumen, causing severe stenosis of the aorta and its visceral and renal branches. Clinical presentation varies depending on the location and extent of the lesion. Treatment options include open surgery and endovascular approaches. Intravascular lithotripsy (IVL) is a novel endovascular technique that delivers acoustic shockwaves to modify calcified lesions, allowing luminal expansion. We report the case of a 76-year-old female with severe stenosis of the suprarenal aorta, right renal artery, superior and inferior mesenteric artery, and occluded left renal artery. Due to the anatomical complexity and lack of suitable landing zones, the suprarenal aorta was treated with IVL alone without stent or stent-graft placement. To preserve mesenteric perfusion, a balloon-expandable stent was deployed in the inferior mesenteric artery, which served as the dominant supply due to severe superior mesenteric artery stenosis. Following IVL, the patient reported immediate symptom resolution with no periprocedural complications. This case highlights the potential role of IVL as a safe, effective standalone treatment for complex CRA cases."

Sixty patients meeting inclusion and exclusion criteria with at least one criterion of a high risk for AV conduction disorder were enrolled in the study. All included patients were randomized 1:1 into two groups. In Group 1, TAVI was performed using a 3D navigation-guided technique, while in Group 2, the classical TAVI technique was used. The primary endpoint was the composite incidence of permanent pacemaker (PP) implantation and new-onset complete left bundle branch block (LBBB) at 6 months.Results  In the early postoperative period, the 3D navigation-guided TAVI group had a lower incidence of new-onset LBBB (10.3% vs. 33.3%; p=0.03), better parameters of intraventricular conduction according to electrophysiology study (EPS) (H-V interval 79.1±13.5 ms vs. 96.0±39.9 ms; p=0.03) and electrocardiography (QRS complex duration 108.0±16.3 ms vs. 119.0±22.6 ms; p=0.04). The incidence of PP implantation during the hospital stage, A-H interval duration, and Wenckebach point in the AV junction according to EPS did not differ significantly between the groups. The incidence of the primary endpoint (PP implantation + new-onset LBBB) during the 6-month follow-up period was 43.3% in the classical technique group and 16.7% in the 3D navigation-guided TAVI group (p=0.02). There were no statistically significant differences between the groups in the incidence of procedural complications or major adverse cardiovascular and cerebrovascular outcomes.Conclusion         This study demonstrated the efficacy and safety of a new 3D navigation-guided TAVI technique in reducing the composite rate of implantation PP and LBBB at 6 months post-procedure, with comparable rates of procedural complications and major adverse cardiac and cerebrovascular events (MACCE) during long-term follow-up. Implementation of these findings into clinical practice will enable personalization and optimization of transcatheter treatment outcomes in patients with severe AS."

From December 2016 to December 2023, 155 patients received AVNeo at the Heart Institute, while 301 underwent BioSAVR. Baseline characteristics were balanced using 1:1 propensity matching.
132 identical patient pairs were included in the analysis. Neocuspidization had longer ischemic times (98.67 ± 28.47 min vs. 66.76 ± 25.04 min, ρ < 0.001). Permanent pacemaker implantation (ρ = 0.072) and paravalvular leaks (ρ = 0.041) were more common in the BioSAVR group. Follow-up averaged 43.8 ± 27.30 months. Severe post-procedural aortic stenosis (PPAS) was more frequent after BioSAVR (3 (2.8%) vs. 1 (0.9%), ρ = 0.006), but AVNeo experienced more recurrent severe aortic regurgitation (AR) (3 (2.8%) vs. 0, ρ = 0.035). Reoperation rates were similar (AVNeo 3.1%, BioSAVR 1.5%, ρ = 0.680). Prosthetic valve endocarditis (PVE) was responsible for half (2 cases) of the AVNeo reoperations. Survival rate during follow-up was comparable: 92.8% (AVNeo) and 94.4% (BioSAVR), ρ = 0.672.
Immediate and mid-term AVNeo quality outcomes were comparable to those of BioSAVR. Transvalvular hemodynamics were better, and the incidence of PPAS was lower after AVNeo, supporting the recommendation of this procedure for patients at high risk of patient-prosthesis mismatch. During follow-up, AVNeo patients require close monitoring for recurrent AR and aggressive PVE prophylaxis. A multicenter long-term study is needed to confirm the stability of hemodynamic performance, the rate of Structural Valve Deterioration, and the incidence of PVE in AVNeo patients over the long term."

However, data on post-TAVI extremity function are limited. This sub-study of the TAVI XS trial aimed to assess extremity function after transfemoral TAVI, evaluate functional decline, compare outcomes between upper-and lower-extremity secondary access approaches and identify predictors of functional decline after TAVI.
The TAVI XS was a randomized clinical trial comparing upper- and lower-extremity secondary access during TAVI. Patients were assessed for extremity function at baseline and at 30 days using the Lower Extremity Function Scale (higher score indicating better function) and the Quick Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder, and Hand questionnaire (higher score indicating worse function).
Lower-extremity (45.0 [IQR 35.0-57.0] to 52.0 [39.0-63.0]; p < 0.001), and upper-extremity function (11.4 [2.3-25.0] to 6.8 [0-22.7]; p = 0.003) improved after TAVI. Relevant decline in lower-extremity function occurred in 20 (8.4%) patients, and in upper-extremity function in 19 (8.0%) patients. No differences in post-TAVI function were observed between upper- or lower-extremity secondary access (lower-extremity: 10.1% vs. 6.7%; p = 0.35, upper-extremity: 7.6% vs. 8.4%; p = 0.81). Predictors (OR [95% CI]) of clinically relevant decline were baseline use of dual antiplatelet therapy/oral anticoagulants (4.17 [1.39-12.49]; p = 0.01) for lower-extremity function and multiple punctures (4.05 [1.46-11.24]; p = 0.007) for upper-extremity function. Age inversely affected lower- (0.92 [0.85-0.99/year]; p = 0.02) and upper-extremity function (0.93 [0.86-0.99/year]; p = 0.04).
The incidence of clinically relevant decline in extremity function after TAVI is low. No differences in reported extremity function were observed between the upper- and lower-extremity secondary access approach. Predictors of decline were antithrombotic therapy and multiple punctures.

A 39-year-old male with Kawasaki disease at the age of 2 months underwent coronary artery bypass grafting to the right coronary artery and left anterior descending artery because of coronary artery stenoses. In the screening by thoracic-abdominal CT before the operation, calcification of the distal abdominal aorta was detected, and an abdominal aortic aneurysm with stenosis was diagnosed. He had been asymptomatic, and there were no differences in his extremities' blood pressure. Although a slight dilatation of the distal abdominal aorta had existed in his aortogram at 2 years 9 months old, the abnormal finding had been unnoticed. A 26-year-old female with coronary artery bypass grafting at the age of 23 months had hypertension. A stenosis of the orifice at the right renal artery was detected by two-dimensional echocardiography and a magnetic resonance angiogram. Her hypertension in adulthood was suspected to result from her renal artery stenosis, which acute Kawasaki vasculitis underlies. Although coronary artery lesions in both patients were diagnosed in their childhood, systemic artery lesions were not realised until adulthood. Because abdominal aortic aneurysms and renal artery stenosis are extremely rare, they were not recognised as systemic artery lesions caused by Kawasaki disease. Their lesions can occur in patients with severe acute vasculitis at a significantly younger age, less than 6 months. Systemic artery lesions in such adult patients must be carefully evaluated."

It is identified when there is impaired global longitudinal strain (GLS) with paradoxically advanced time to peak strain (TPS) in a hypertrophied apex with relative sparing of the basal segments. On a standard polar map, GLS will have a pale center while TPS will depict a more robust blue center.
While the ""Blueberry-on-Top"" pattern has been observed in a few prior reports, its true prevalence in patients with ApHCM is currently unknown. We sought to examine the prevalence of this strain pattern among patients with ApHCM.
A series of patients diagnosed with ApHCM by cardiac MRI were included and compared to a series of normal controls. All patients underwent a standard transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE). For uniform reporting, all echocardiogram studies were post-processed using Tomtec, which is a vendor-independent speckle tracking analysis software.
From a cohort of 340 patients with HCM, a total of 15 patients with ApHCM were identified and subsequently compared to 15 normal controls. The ""Blueberry-on-Top"" pattern was observed in 93% (n = 14) of patients with ApHCM, while none of the normal controls had a ""Blueberry-on-Top"" pattern. We identified a GLS ratio threshold of 1.26 and a normalized time to peak strain (NTPS) ratio threshold of 0.09. When both thresholds are met, the ""Blueberry-on-Top"" phenomenon has nearly 100% sensitivity and 93% specificity for the diagnosis of ApHCM. We suggest using these parameters as an adjunctive tool for making the clinical diagnosis of ApHCM and integrating them into a more comprehensive approach.
The newly recognized ""Blueberry-on-Top"" strain pattern is unique and can be used as a supportive diagnostic feature in ApHCM."

However, the prognostic impact of LA dysfunction in the surgical intervention for AS remains unclear.
Among the 812 patients who underwent isolated surgical aortic valve replacement (SAVR) for AS at eight institutions between 2016 and 2021, 366 with available preoperative left atrial volume index (LAVI) were included. Based on the optimal value of 40 mL/m2-derived from receiver operating characteristic curve analyses-patients were stratified into a LA enlargement group (n = 219) and a non-enlargement group (n = 147), and 5-year outcomes were investigated.
Age (76.0 vs 76.0 years, P = 0.489) and sex (male 44.3% vs 50.3%,P = 0.256) were comparable, while the LA enlargement group showed lower eGFR (52.3 vs 59.2 mL/min/1.73 m2, P = 0.002), serum albumin (3.9 vs 4.0 g/dL, P = 0.003), and ejection fraction (65.0% vs 70.0%,P < 0.001), as well as a higher tendency for atrial fibrillation (20.1% vs 12.2%,P = 0.066), and higher STS-PROM (3.10% vs 2.91%,P = 0.029). The 5-year incidence of cardiac mortality was higher in the LA enlargement group (13.4% vs 2.6%,P = 0.001). Multivariable analysis identified preoperative LA enlargement (LAVI ≥ 40 mL/m2) as an independent predictor of cardiac mortality (adjusted HR, 2.08; 95% CI, 1.01-4.82; P = 0.041). LA enlargement was also associated with higher all-cause mortality and heart failure readmission (17.4% vs 7.6%,P = 0.002; and 11.0% vs 2.8%,P = 0.013, respectively).
In patients with severe AS undergoing isolated SAVR, a preoperative LAVI ≥ 40 mL/m2 was associated with midterm mortality and heart failure, suggesting that SAVR before significant LA enlargement may improve prognosis."

This single-center, retrospective cohort study included fetuses diagnosed with DAA using fetal echocardiography and managed perinatally at Kanagawa Children's Medical Center from January 2013-December 2024. Clinical data, fetal echocardiography, postnatal contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) findings, surgical intervention, and outcomes were reviewed. Narrowest tracheal diameter (NTD) Z score in late gestation and narrowest-to-reference tracheal area (NTA/RTA) ratio on postnatal CT were measured. Primary and secondary outcomes included respiratory symptoms shortly after birth and elective surgery, respectively. Groups were compared using t-tests, and the optimal cutoff values were determined using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis. Reproducibility was assessed using intraclass correlation coefficient. Twenty-two patients were included: 5 symptomatic and 17 asymptomatic (12, prophylactic surgery; 5, observation). Symptomatic patients had significantly lower NTD Z scores (median - 1.8 vs. -1.2, P = 0.012) and NTA/RTA ratios (median 0.39 vs. 0.67, P < 0.001). NTD Z score ≤ - 1.7 (area under the ROC curve [AUC] 0.87; sensitivity 80%, specificity 88%) and NTA/RTA ratio ≤ 0.5 (AUC 0.94; sensitivity 100%, specificity 82%) were optimal thresholds for predicting early symptoms. In the asymptomatic group, NTA/RTA ratio ≥ 0.56 identified candidates for observation without surgery. The ICC values for both parameters exceeded 0.85, indicating excellent reproducibility. The prenatal NTD Z score and postnatal NTA/RTA ratio accurately predict postnatal respiratory symptoms in fetuses with DAA. These quantitative parameters may guide individualized perinatal management and surgical decision-making."

In contrast, left atrial reservoir strain (LASr), measured by speckle-tracking echocardiography, offers a sensitive and dynamic assessment of atrial mechanics, integrating atrial compliance with left ventricular diastolic interaction. Moreover, impaired LASr reflects atrial stiffness and fibrosis, and correlates with elevated filling pressures, making the LASr parameter a comprehensive biomarker of left-sided cardiac function. Indeed, LASr has demonstrated diagnostic and prognostic value across a wide spectrum of conditions. In heart failure with preserved ejection fraction, LASr refines the assessment of diastolic dysfunction and predicts hospitalization and mortality. In atrial fibrillation, reduced strain correlates with atrial fibrosis and left atrial appendage dysfunction, identifying patients at increased risk of arrhythmia recurrence and thromboembolism. In valvular disease, LASr uncovers subclinical remodeling and stratifies risk even in patients with apparently moderate aortic stenosis. Meanwhile, in addition to cardiovascular disease, LASr can detect early atrial impairment in systemic disorders such as hypertension, diabetes, obesity, and amyloidosis, often before structural enlargement becomes evident. Our group has shown that LASr predicts persistent hypertension after gestational hypertensive disorders, reveals subclinical diastolic dysfunction in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, non-invasively predicts left atrial appendage thrombus in atrial fibrillation, stratifies outcomes in moderate aortic stenosis, and provides prognostic information in acute ischemic stroke. This narrative review outlines the physiological basis, technical considerations, and clinical applications of LASr, discusses its limitations and future perspectives-including multimodality imaging and artificial intelligence-and underscores its transition from a research metric to a dynamic biomarker ready for clinical practice."

A total of 137 patients were enrolled who were treated with a self-expandable Venus A valve at our center, who underwent TAVR from January 1, 2019, to June 30, 2022. We retrospectively included patients with BAV and TAV who underwent echocardiographic follow-ups at baseline and at least 6 months after the procedure.
Patients with a BAV were younger than those with a TAV. The BAV patients had a larger aortic root diameter (ARD), although the size of valve implantation was comparable between the two groups. Patients with a BAV might experience less reverse LV remodeling post-TAVR than patients with a TAV during the one-month follow-up (140.09 ± 36.94 g/m2 vs. 126.36 ± 26.96 g/m2; p = 0.044). There were no significant differences in the LV mass index (LVMi) between the two groups throughout the 24 hours or the six-month follow-up post-TAVR. Patients with a higher mean pressure gradient (MPG) (95% confidence interval (CI): 0.112-0.581; p = 0.004) and a larger ARD (95% CI: 0.519-5.573; p = 0.019) before TAVR had favorable mid-term LV reverse remodeling (ΔLVMi within 6 months) post-TAVR. Patients with much more severe aortic stenosis (AS) had favorable mid-term LV reverse remodeling post-TAVR.
Patients with BAV might experience less reverse LV remodeling post-TAVR than patients with TAV during a short-term follow-up, but similar remodeling during mid-term follow-ups."

This study evaluated the prognostic value of the Kihon Checklist (KCL), which covers physical, cognitive, and social domains, for patients receiving TAVI.
We retrospectively analyzed data from 986 patients who underwent elective TAVI between May 2017 and September 2022. Frailty was classified according to the KCL as non-frail (for scores of 0-3), pre-frail (4-7), or frail (≥8). The primary outcome measure was all-cause mortality following discharge. Kaplan-Meier, Cox regression, and classification and regression tree (CART) analyses were used. Of the overall patient cohort, 47.4% were classified as frail. Over a mean follow-up period of 968±578 days, 18.1% died. Frailty was significantly associated with higher mortality (adjusted hazard ratio 1.771; 95% confidence interval 1.096-2.862; P<0.02). Impaired socialization and physical function were also found to represent independent predictors of mortality. CART identified socialization as the primary node in the risk stratification.
Preoperative frailty, as defined by the KCL, was found to be independently associated with mortality after TAVI. Social and physical domains were also found to have strong prognostic relevance in this context."

This is a case of a 12-year-old male with a history of bicuspid aortic valve and mild asymptomatic aortic stenosis who presented with flu-like symptoms, right-sided hemiplegia, and aphasia. Although he initially presented with symptoms of arterial ischemic stroke, he was found to have infective endocarditis (IE) secondary to Bartonella henselae, confirmed by echocardiogram and plasma microbial cell-free DNA (mcf-DNA) testing. Initial antimicrobial treatment per standard guidelines was unsuccessful. Hence, second-line antimicrobials were commenced, to which he responded appropriately. His clinical course markedly improved, with recovery of neurological function within three weeks. He continued treatment of endocarditis and bartonellosis in an outpatient setting with significant clinical response until eventual cardiac surgery for valve replacement. Although the diagnosis and management of blood culture-negative IE can be very challenging and associated with morbidity, mcf-DNA testing has been shown to be helpful in establishing an accurate diagnosis and promoting appropriate antimicrobial management."

Case reports,"The incidence of patients with cirrhosis and concurrent valvular heart disease is increasing. Moderate to severe tricuspid regurgitation (TR) is associated with increased mortality after liver transplantation (LT). Open cardiac surgery is recommended for patients with symptomatic severe TR, however LT candidates often face prohibitive surgical risk.
A 45-year-old woman with advanced cirrhosis awaiting LT was diagnosed with severe functional TR due to anatomical tricuspid valve incompetence (TVI). The tricuspid valve anatomy was unsuitable for transcatheter tricuspid edge-to-edge repair, a technique previously described in cirrhotic patients before LT. The patient underwent a transcatheter tricuspid valve replacement (TTVR) followed by LT.
LT recipients with TR secondary to anatomical TVI have significantly lower 1-year survival. Minimally invasive valve interventions are promising alternatives for patients who are not cardiac surgical candidates, such as LT recipients with advanced cirrhosis.
Transcatheter tricuspid valve replacement may facilitate LT in high-risk candidates with severe TR due to TVI."

Epicardial cysts attached to the cardiac surface with intimate coronary artery involvement are even rarer and pose significant diagnostic and surgical challenges. This case highlights a giant pericardial cyst with intimate right coronary artery involvement in a 10-month-old infant, where subtotal resection was necessary to preserve coronary integrity. A 10-month-old male infant with a pericardial cyst initially detected at 27 weeks of gestation presented with progressive compression of right heart chambers. Imaging revealed a large multiloculated cystic mass (5.3 × 3.5 × 3.9 cm) compressing the right atrium and right ventricle, with associated pulmonary valve stenosis. Intraoperatively, the cyst was found on the epicardial surface with intimate involvement of the right coronary artery. Complete excision was not feasible due to the risk of coronary injury. The main cystic mass was excised with cavity obliteration, while the portion adjacent to the right coronary artery was intentionally preserved. Concurrent pulmonary valve commissurotomy and pulmonary artery augmentation were performed. Histopathology confirmed a mesothelial-lined pericardial cyst. The patient recovered uneventfully and was discharged. This case underscores the importance of comprehensive preoperative coronary artery assessment in pericardial cysts with atypical locations. When complete excision risks vital structure injury, subtotal resection with cavity obliteration represents a safe alternative strategy."

While epidemiologically established, the underlying mechanisms remain unclear, precluding identification of therapeutic targets.
Two-month-old Yucatan pigs (males and females) underwent aortic banding to induce LV pressure overload or no operation. After 4 months, animals received a low-risk cumulative dose of doxorubicin (5 weekly 1 mg/kg intravenous injections) or vehicle, generating four groups: (i) healthy controls (no LV overload, no doxorubicin), (ii) Dox (doxorubicin, no LV overload), (iii) Banding (B: LV overload, no doxorubicin), and (iv) B + Dox (LV overload plus doxorubicin). Cardiac function, structure, and metabolism were assessed over 8 months by cardiac magnetic resonance, magnetic resonance spectroscopy, and hybrid positron emission tomography/computed tomography. At study end, proteomics and mitochondrial structure and function were analysed. Complementary in vivo and ex vivo studies examined the mechanistic role of energetic imbalance.
LV overload increased LV mass (P < .0001) and ejection fraction (P = .0081), with compensatory metabolic changes (drop in phosphocreatine (P = .022)). Low-risk Dox alone altered myocardial metabolism (increased glucose uptake, P = .014) but preserved cardiac function. In pigs with pre-existing LV pressure overload, doxorubicin increased mortality (P < .0001 vs all other groups), reduced left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) (P < .0001), increased fibrosis, and impaired mitochondrial respiration (P = .032). In HL-1 cardiomyocytes, reducing energy demand with mavacamten rescued cell viability under combined doxorubicin and hypertrophic stress.
LV pressure overload increases myocardial susceptibility to anthracycline cardiotoxicity by inducing a high-energy-demand state. Anthracycline treatment, even at a low-risk dose, disrupts compensatory mechanisms in the pressure-overloaded heart, rapidly leading to cardiac dysfunction and heart failure. Preventive strategies targeting this metabolic vulnerability are urgently needed for patients with extant LV pressure overload (e.g. hypertension or valvular heart disease) who are undergoing anthracycline therapy."

Eighty patients diagnosed with CTEPH between October 2022 and October 2024 were included in this study. These patients were divided into three groups based on the quantitative grading method for TR: mild TR (29 cases), moderate TR (30 cases), and severe TR (21 cases). Meanwhile, 24 healthy individuals who underwent physical examinations and were matched with the case group in terms of age and gender were selected as the control group. Clinical data, echocardiographic parameters, and other relevant information of all study subjects were collected. The above data were subjected to statistical analysis to explore the effects of various factors, including TR, on the reservoir function, conduit function, and booster pump function of the right atrium.
Univariate linear regression analysis showed that the related variables, including heart rate, WHO functional class, main pulmonary artery diameter, pulmonary artery systolic pressure (PASP), right ventricular basal diameter, right ventricular anterior wall thickness, right ventricular global function (RVGF), tricuspid annular diameter (TAD), tricuspid valve coaptation length (TVCL), and TR, exhibited a linear relationship with right atrial total ejection fraction (TotEF) and passive ejection fraction (PassEF), but no linear relationship with right atrial active ejection fraction (ActEF). Multivariate stepwise linear regression analysis revealed that PASP, RVGF, and TR severity were the main factors affecting right atrial TotEF and PassEF. Specifically, right atrial TotEF and PassEF gradually decreased with the increase in PASP, the decline in RVGF, and the aggravation of TR severity.
In patients with CTEPH, the reservoir function and conduit function of the right atrium gradually decrease with the aggravation of TR, the impairment of RVGF, and the elevation of PASP."

The procedure was initially performed using systems designed for mitral valve repair, which were replaced by tricuspid-dedicated devices. This retrospective study compared outcomes of tricuspid-dedicated devices (TriClip or PASCAL) with a non-dedicated device (MitraClip) used for TR treatment. MATERIAL AND METHODS We analyzed data from 44 consecutive patients (mean age 74.7±7.5 years) who underwent T-TEER (2018-2024): 22 with non-dedicated (MitraClip) and 22 with dedicated systems (TriClip or PASCAL). The primary endpoint was technical success. Secondary endpoints included post-procedural TR≤ moderate, ≥2-grade TR reduction, peri-procedural complications, and 6-month mortality. RESULTS Baseline characteristics were largely balanced, although the non-dedicated group showed greater left-ventricular dysfunction. Technical success was significantly higher with dedicated systems (100% vs 77.3%, risk ratio 1.29; 95% CI 1.03-1.63; P=0.048) Post-procedural moderate or less TR and a reduction of ≥2 grades was achieved in 68.2% of patients with dedicated devices vs 31.8% with non-dedicated devices (risk ratio 2.14, 95% CI 1.09-4.21; P=0.02). Mortality during a 6-month follow-up was comparable between both cohorts (0.0% vs 9.1%; risk ratio 1.10; 95% CI 0.96-1.26; P=0.23). CONCLUSIONS Tricuspid-dedicated systems (TriClip or PASCAL) were associated with higher procedural success rates and greater TR reduction. They improved early outcomes and enabled the application of T‑TEER in a broader population of patients with less-advanced heart failure. Given the limited sample size and retrospective design, these findings should be interpreted with caution and regarded as exploratory and hypothesis-generating."

PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science were searched for studies evaluating the prognostic impact of RVPA coupling in patients undergoing MTEER, using tricuspid annular plane systolic excursion (TAPSE)/pulmonary artery systolic pressure (PASP) or related markers. Risk of bias was assessed with the ROBINS-I tool, and meta-analyses were used to evaluate associations with clinical outcomes, including all-cause mortality, major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE), and residual mitral regurgitation (MR).
Nine studies involving 3281 patients were included. Baseline RVPA uncoupling was significantly associated with an increased incidence of MACE (risk ratio [RR] 1.75, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.40-2.19) and higher all-cause mortality (RR 1.82, 95% CI: 1.53-2.18). No significant association was observed with post-operative MR (RR 1.17, 95% CI: 0.83-1.63). Sensitivity analyses did not alter the direction of the findings.
RVPA uncoupling is associated with adverse outcomes after MTEER. Routine assessment may improve pre-procedural risk stratification. Further studies should refine diagnostic thresholds and evaluate potential therapeutic strategies in the setting of impaired RVPA coupling prior to MTEER."

One numerical model of the AAo with BAV (specifically, a left/right cusp fusion type) and a giant aneurysm was constructed using MRI medical images. The aneurysm had a diameter of 10.5 cm. Subsequently, hemodynamics in this model were simulated numerically, and flow patterns and loading distributions were investigated. To understand these characteristics, we applied the CFD method to simulate the hemodynamics and estimate the risk associated with the fully dilated aorta.
The presence of a giant aneurysm significantly influenced and altered hemodynamics within the AAo in this BAV patient case. In our model of a 10.5 cm aneurysm, the BAV-induced eccentric jet impinged on the aortic wall, generating complex, recirculating flow patterns and elevated turbulent kinetic energy within the aneurysmal sac. Hemodynamic parameters were asymmetrically distributed at the aneurysm, and the wall shear stress (WSS) in this aneurysm was pathologically low. These conditions suggest the risk of asymmetric dilation and aortic dissection, and thereafter, the risk of aneurysm rupture was further heightened, especially when the aneurysm reached 10.5 cm in size.
The CFD-based analysis method helped elucidate the biomechanical mechanisms that a BAV may contribute to the development of a giant aneurysm in the AAo, offering valuable insights for treatment strategies in patients with giant aneurysms."

Coronary angiography showed severe stenosis in the right coronary artery. After its interventional treatment, the patient's chest pain changed. Through dynamic electrocardiogram monitoring and treadmill exercise testing, he was diagnosed with Painful Left Bundle Branch Block Syndrome. After taking oral beta - blockers, his symptoms improved during follow - up. Usually, this syndrome occurs in those without coronary artery disease and can be missed in patients with coronary heart disease. This case shows that right coronary artery intervention might trigger this syndrome. We hope this case can offer new ideas for future relevant clinical work."

A case-control study was conducted at a pediatric tertiary center in central Taiwan. Children under 18 years who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 and experienced symptoms for longer than 4 weeks were recruited between July 1, 2022, and July 31, 2023, during the Omicron variant surge. Echocardiographic data were also collected from a control group, consisting of children who presented with similar symptoms and received medical care in the same pediatric tertiary center in 2018. Children with congenital or structural heart disease, inflammatory conditions, or arrhythmias were excluded. Echocardiographic images were analyzed using a ResNet-50-based deep learning model to identify cardiac abnormalities. A total of 270 children with PASC and 400 age-matched control children were included. Standard echocardiographic parameters, including EF, FS, chamber dimensions, and valvular assessment, did not reveal abnormalities in the PASC group. The deep learning model achieved an accuracy of 96.6%, sensitivity of 96.7%, specificity of 96.2%, and balanced accuracy of 96.4%. AI-assisted echocardiographic analysis demonstrated high performance in distinguishing cardiac function between PASC and controls. Deep learning models enhance the detection of subtle cardiac changes in children with PASC. Although the deep learning model demonstrated high performance in distinguishing PASC from controls, the clinical significance of these subtle image-based differences remains uncertain and requires further evaluation in large-scale studies with long-term follow-up."

Investigating the relationship between temporal QTc and EMW dynamics, and ventricular tachyarrhythmia (VT) timing in LQTS and diQTP.
47 LQTS/-VT, 18 LQTS/+VT, nine diQTP/+VT and 26 controls were included. QTc and EMW were obtained from standard 12-lead ECGs and ECG-echocardiograms at two or three time points. +VT patients were included if EMW/QTc assessments were performed within two weeks before or after VT.
In control subjects, EMW remained stably positive over time. In LQTS/-VT patients, EMW was negative without significant variation. In LQTS/+VT and diQTP/+VT patients, transient accentuations of EMW negativity were observed at the time point closest to VT (2 (1 to 7) days to arrhythmia), regardless of whether measured before or after VT. Temporary EMW negativity accentuation was driven by foreshortening of the mechanical systole despite concurrent QT prolongation. EMW recovery after VT was similar for patients with or without beta-blocker therapy. Multiple logistic regression analysis identified EMW negativity and EMW dynamics (ΔEMW) as independent predictors of imminent VT in LQTS. An EMW of -75 ms and ΔEMW of -39 ms were optimal cut-offs to predict emergent arrhythmic deterioration in the LQTS cohort.

Previous studies have largely focused on central mitral regurgitation with favorable valve anatomy or a general broad spectrum of complex mitral regurgitation. However, no established approach is currently available for M-TEER in commissural degenerative mitral regurgitation (DMR).
Therefore, this study aimed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of a novel morphology classification-guided M-TEER strategy for treating commissural DMR using the MitraClip system. This prospective, multicenter, single-arm, objective performance criteria study involved 12 experienced centers in Asia, primarily located in China. Patients with symptomatic moderate-to-severe (3+) and severe (4+) native DMR and commissural involvement were stratified into three morphological categories based on an echocardiographic core laboratory analysis, and tailored M-TEER strategies were proposed. The primary endpoint is the proportion of patients achieving a mitral regurgitation (MR) grade of ≤1+ without repeat mitral intervention at one-year follow-up. Clinical, echocardiographic, functional, and quality-of-life outcomes were assessed over one year.
Based on statistical power calculations, a total of 148 patients are required to achieve adequate power to test the primary efficacy hypothesis, accounting for an estimated 10% attrition rate at 12 months.
The morphology classification system enhances M-TEER for commissural DMR by addressing the unique challenges of this approach, enabling tailored interventions that optimize procedural success and patient outcomes.

Cardiovascular Imaging,"Valvular heart disease (VHD) is traditionally assessed through gradients, regurgitant volumes, and ejection fraction-but these valve-centric indices miss the earliest and most decisive signal: myocardial injury. Contemporary evidence shows that VHD is a myocardial disease, where outcomes are driven far more by the ventricle's biological response than by the valve lesion itself. This state-of-the-art review redefines VHD through a myocardium-first lens, highlighting tools that expose dysfunction long before conventional thresholds fail. A focused triad-LV global longitudinal strain (LV-GLS), RV strain with RV-PA coupling, and LA reservoir strain-detects injury at its inception and sharply improves prognostic precision. Cardiac magnetic resonance adds mechanistic depth through native T1, extracellular volume, and late gadolinium enhancement, identifying diffuse and focal fibrosis that dictate timing and reversibility of remodeling. Next-generation technologies extend this paradigm: CT-derived ECV as a scalable fibrosis surrogate, molecular imaging revealing active calcification and fibro-inflammation, and AI-driven models that fuse imaging, biomarkers, and clinical variables into personalized risk trajectories. We propose a serial, multiparametric, AI-enhanced strategy centered on myocardial protection-using LV-GLS tracking, RV-PA coupling, atrial mechanics, and fibrosis imaging to intervene during the true therapeutic window. This review positions a simple but transformative concept: managing VHD means managing the myocardium. Adopting this shift is essential for preserving cardiac health-not merely correcting valve anatomy."

At their core, these are statistical prediction models that infer conditional probabilities for clinical events from data and are therefore, in principle, ideally suited for risk-based decision making. This review article focuses on risk stratification in ACS, with particular emphasis on the detection of type 1 or occlusive myocardial infarction (MI). Models based on clinical variables and high-sensitivity troponin measurements use continuous troponin values in combination with patient characteristics to estimate individual probabilities of MI instead of relying on fixed troponin thresholds. In retrospective studies, they reduce the ""observe zone"", enable faster and safer rule-out decisions, and have the potential to relieve pressure on emergency departments. However, they remain dependent on laboratory assays and currently lack prospective evidence of improvements in patient relevant outcomes. Electrocardiogram (ECG)-based approaches promise greater clinical impact: classical machine learning (ML) on preselected ECG features already yields interpretable models that quantify ischemic patterns and can detect occlusive MI even in the absence of ST-segment elevation. Deep learning models applied directly to raw ECG signals additionally exploit subtle spatiotemporal changes and have outperformed conventional ECG interpretation in early studies. Prospective data on the detection of ST segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) indicate that this can shorten the time to reperfusion."

Static machine learning methods struggle to address the challenge of early DVT diagnosis due to their inability to adapt to heterogeneous data across patients. In contrast, Dynamic Ensemble Selection (DES) improves clinical decision-making and therapeutic interventions by dynamically adapting to variations in data characteristics. Here, we developed and validated a risk prediction model for DVT using electronic medical record data from fracture patients upon admission. By employing the DES method to optimize the prediction process, the model generates patient-specific probabilities of DVT occurrence, enabling personalized clinical risk assessment. Validation results showed that the DES model achieved strong performance in predicting DVT, with an accuracy of 0.875 and an Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve (AUC) of 0.906. Notably, it demonstrated a high recall of 0.918 for DVT. Furthermore, in the prospective test set, DES exhibited excellent generalization capability, maintaining robust performance with an accuracy of 0.813 and an AUC of 0.876. We further developed an interactive clinical tool based on the DES algorithm to facilitate model interpretation and implementation. By integrating this user-friendly solution into clinical workflows, DES not only improves early DVT detection but also optimizes the allocation of healthcare resources."

This study aimed to develop a hierarchical deep learning framework for the stepwise classification of ampullary lesions using white-light (WL) and narrow-band endoscopic images (NBI).
The framework employs three sequential binary classifications: (1) normal vs. abnormal, (2) adenoma vs. cancer, and (3) high-grade dysplasia (HGD) vs. low-grade dysplasia (LGD) within adenomas. Each stage uses EfficientNet-B4 classifiers trained independently on WL and NBI. Predictions are integrated using confidence-based voting. To overcome data scarcity and class imbalance, for HGD and cancer, we used StyleGAN2-ADA to generate synthetic images. The hierarchical model was developed using 4244 endoscopic images from 464 patients collected at Seoul National University Hospital (2693/833/718 for train/validation/test).
The hierarchical model achieved stage-specific accuracies of 95.6% (normal vs. abnormal), 94.4% (adenoma vs. cancer), and 92.7% (LGD vs. HGD), resulting in overall diagnostic accuracy of 92.2%. The model demonstrated excellent sensitivity of 83.3% for HGD and 87.5% for cancer, with specificities exceeding 98%. The confidence-based dual-modality approach (AUROC: 0.921) significantly outperformed single-modality approaches using WL alone (AUROC: 0.866) or NBI alone (AUROC: 0.895), by integrating their complementary diagnostic strengths. Generative adversarial network-based augmentation substantially improved sensitivity for cancer (from 87.5% to 91.7%) and HGD (from 83.3% to 86.5%), while overall accuracy increased from 94.5% to 95.1%.

Three representative case studies are examined to illustrate common applications and practices, while highlighting recurring challenges such as limited data availability, inconsistent annotations, and obstacles to submodel integration that constrain reproducibility and scalability. A set of domain-specific strategies is proposed to address these challenges, covering task decomposition, dataset refinement, annotation and label management, image preprocessing, data augmentation, architecture selection, and submodel integration.

Histopathological analysis holds promise for postsurgical risk stratification and guiding adjuvant chemotherapy (ACT) decisions. The aim of this study was to use deep learning to extract explainable tissue biomarkers from whole-slide images.
In this retrospective cohort study, we developed and validated SurvFinder, an interpretable deep learning framework designed to autonomously identify tissue-based risk biomarkers from hematoxylin and eosin (H&E)-stained slides. The framework aims to support individualized risk stratification and explore associations with treatment outcomes. The present study included 6,950 H&E slides from 1,604 patients with stage II CRC across four independent cohorts in China. Patients were enrolled from 2012 to 2018 and followed for a minimum of 24 months. The primary outcome of the study was relapse-free survival (RFS). Our analyses identified tertiary lymphoid structures (TLSs) as critical prognostic features in stage II CRC. The multi-view integration of TLS characteristics by SurvFinder consistently demonstrated superior predictive and prognostic accuracy across four multicenter datasets (AUROC with 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.827 [0.789,0.864], 0.805 [0.749,0.860], 0.805 [0.748,0.861], and 0.712 [0.621,0.804]), surpassing traditional clinical prognostic parameters (hazard ratio [HR]: 8.23, 95% CI: 5.43-12.47; p < 0.001). Using explainable AI (XAI) methods, we ensured model transparency and identified key TLS features-such as their location at the tumor periphery and their maturity state-as significant factors influencing prognosis and the efficacy of adjuvant therapy. The retrospective design without prospective validation and real-world clinical deployment is the main limitation of this study.
Together, these results highlight the potential utility of deep learning-based histopathological analysis for automated risk stratification in stage II CRC. In particular, our findings support the relevance of TLSs as a histological biomarker with potential implications for personalizing ACT decisions."

We evaluated an independently developed noninvasive near-infrared hyperspectral imaging (NIR-HSI) system to assess hepatic steatosis, ischemia-reperfusion (I/R) injury, and inflammatory biomarkers in animal models and transplant recipients. Deep learning integration enhanced spectral discrimination, improving classification and regression accuracy.
NIR-HSI data were used in conjunction with a one-dimensional convolutional neural network (1D-CNN) to classify the degree of hepatic steatosis and hepatic I/R injury. Additionally, least squares support vector machines (LSSVM) were utilized to evaluate the lipid content and inflammatory markers in mice and human liver tissue. NIR-HSI was also used to evaluate the degree of I/R injury and early allograft dysfunction (EAD) of liver transplant recipients enrolled in a retrospective cohort study.
NIR-HSI revealed significant differences in the severity of both fatty liver and I/R injury, specifically in the spectral range of 900-1700 nm. By integrating 1D-CNN into the spectral data analysis, we established a confusion matrix to assess the degrees of pathological changes in fatty liver and I/R injury, achieving high accuracy (all precision > 0.95) and F1 scores exceeding 0.90. Moreover, our model based on LSSVM demonstrated good normalized root mean square errors (NRMSE) for predicting total cholesterol, triglyceride, IL-1β, TNF-α, and HMGB1 levels (all NRMSE < 0.10), along with high coefficients of determination (all R2 > 0.9). Notably, NIR-HSI demonstrated a strong capacity to predict the presence of EAD following liver transplantation (LT). Targeted lipid metabolomics was used to explore the underlying mechanism of the association between spectral sensitive metabolites and metabolome.

We propose a novel physics-informed deep learning based AI dose calculation method that is able to calculate the plan dose of clinical many field VMAT and IMRT plans to high accuracy and with high speed.
A novel two-stage approach is introduced. In stage one, incoming fluence from all fields is propagated using a Beer-Lambert law approach and accumulated per voxel in spherical harmonics coefficients. These coefficients together with the CT volume constitute the input to the stage two image-to-image neural network that predicts the actual dose. We performed large scale data generation on 1641 clinical plans from three different body sites. Using a special data augmentation scheme, over 100 000 training input/outputs were used for training.
The model was evaluated on clinical plans from multiple body regions using several gamma pass rates, relative and absolute errors as well as dose profiles. At a run-time of 1.6 s on a RTX 4090, the average gamma pass rate over all sites was 99.1% for 2%/2 mm and 94.4% for 1%/1 mm.

Severe cases may cause neonatal shock or heart failure. Accurate prenatal diagnosis is critical to reducing mortality and enabling timely medical intervention. Fetal echocardiography is widely used for prenatal CoA detection, but its diagnostic performance is limited by relatively high false-positive and false-negative rates. Recent advances have proposed deep learning to assist diagnosis. However, current approaches struggle to extract meaningful features from the complex distributions of fetal echocardiographic images. These limitations emphasize the urgent need for more advanced methodologies to improve diagnostic accuracy in this field.
To develop a deep learning network that effectively integrates local and global features for extracting discriminative characteristics from fetal echocardiograms, thereby enabling precise prenatal diagnosis of fetal CoA.
This study introduces CoA-Net, a multi-stage deep learning network for prenatal CoA diagnosis through local-global feature integration. CoA-Net includes four sequential stages, each equipped with a local feature extractor and a global feature extractor to ensure comprehensive feature extraction. The local extractor adopts lightweight convolutional layers and a local attention mechanism-this mechanism assigns input-adaptive importance weights, allowing accurate lesion localization and detailed local feature extraction. The global extractor incorporates a sparse global attention mechanism to capture the most discriminative global features, supporting reliable contextual modeling between the aortic arch and adjacent structures. To validate CoA-Net, a dataset of 488 samples (including CoA cases and healthy controls) was constructed, with five-fold cross-validation for train-test partitioning. Extensive experiments were conducted on this dataset to evaluate model performance, using multiple state-of-the-art deep learning classification methods. Results were also compared with clinician diagnoses. Cross-validation t-tests were used to determine significant differences between CoA-Net and other approaches, and the Benjamini-Hochberg False Discovery Rate (BH-FDR) method was applied to correct for multiple comparisons when analyzing significant results.
CoA-Net outperforms other state-of-the-art networks, with statistically significant improvements in balanced accuracy, F1 score, and Matthews correlation coefficient (MCC) (p < 0.05 after BH-FDR correction) and a large effect size (Effect Size > 0.8). This indicates CoA-Net not only has statistical superiority but also delivers substantial, perceptible improvements in CoA diagnostic accuracy. Specifically, CoA-Net achieves 82.63% balanced accuracy, 68.81% F1 score, 69.73% MCC, and 0.867 area under the curve (AUC). To further evaluate the clinical utility of CoA-Net, we compared its performance against diagnoses made by experienced clinicians. The clinicians achieved a balanced accuracy of 77.11%, an F1 score of 53.76%, an MCC of 44.54%, and an AUC of 0.863. Notably, CoA-Net demonstrated comparable or even superior performance across these metrics, underscoring its potential as an effective decision-support tool in real-world clinical settings. Finally, ablation studies conclusively validated the indispensable role of the proposed local and global feature extractors, confirming that their synergistic contribution is critical to the model's overall high performance.
This study proposes CoA-Net for fetal CoA diagnosis. The model exhibits excellent classification performance and holds potential to support clinicians in achieving more precise and reliable fetal CoA diagnoses."

Traditional global optimization algorithms often struggled with slow convergence and a tendency to become trapped in local minima. Here, we present a deep reinforcement learning framework called the Deepcluster, which employs an agent that autonomously navigate the intricate potential energy landscapes to identify the most stable structures of nanoclusters. Our approach leverages an actor-critic network guided by the Trust Region Policy Optimization (TRPO) algorithm to intelligently balance the exploration of new configurations with the exploitation of low-energy regions. This framework combines advanced decision-making of reinforcement learning (RL) with deep learning to intelligently balance the exploration of new configurations against the exploitation of low-energy regions. Unlike supervised methods that rely on static datasets, our on-policy Deepcluster agent autonomously explores the configuration space through trial and error, trained in real-time from an initial random structure generated by the Birmingham parallel genetic algorithm. By forgoing the need for a predefined structural dataset, the agent learns to optimize configurations dynamically. This is achieved through a comprehensive state embedding that incorporates atom-centered symmetry functions (ACSFs) alongside energy, forces, and structural flags. A deep neural actor network-based on multi-layer perceptrons-then proposes optimal atomic displacements. Resulting configurations are subsequently optimized using the Effective Medium Theory (EMT) potential in conjunction with the BFGS algorithm, enabling the Deepcluster agent to efficiently navigate the energy landscape without dependence on a vast training set of pre-optimized structures. We demonstrated the power and generality of this framework by discovering the global minima (GM) structures of a series of nickel nanoclusters (Ni10, Ni13, Ni20, Ni38). The structural and thermodynamic stability of the stable strucutures identified from the Deepcluster framework is validated by first-principles calculations, including strongly negative binding energies and thermal stability from ab initio molecular dynamics simulations at 300 K. Crucially, the identified global minima show exact agreement with independent genetic algorithm searches, providing compelling cross-methodological validation. The Deepcluster agent establishes a robust, scalable, and efficient paradigm that transcends the limitations of traditional approaches, paving the way for the accelerated discovery of complex functional nanomaterials for catalysis and energy applications."

Multicenter prospective cohort study.
A total of 2225 eyes from 1911 cataract patients were enrolled, including 1304 participants from Zhongshan Ophthalmic Center for model development and 607 from 6 hospitals across China for external testing.
All participants underwent standardized preoperative examinations including macular OCT and clinical data collection, followed by phacoemulsification and intraocular lens implantation. Postoperative best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) was assessed at 4 weeks after surgery. A multimodal model was constructed using deep learning techniques, combining image features extracted via InceptionResNetV2 and structured metadata processed by fully connected layers. Model performance was assessed using mean absolute error (MAE) and root mean square error (RMSE) and compared with traditional laser interferometry and ophthalmologist predictions. Subgroup analysis and explainability assessments were conducted to evaluate generalizability and model attention.
Prediction error of postoperative BCVA (logarithm of the minimum angle of resolution [logMAR]) measured by MAE and RMSE.
In the internal test data set, OCT-PRO achieved improved performance, with lower MAE and RMSE (0.128 and 0.211 logMAR) compared with the OCT-only model (0.138 and 0.226 logMAR), metadata-only model (0.161 and 0.234 logMAR) and laser interferometry (0.381 and 0.554 logMAR). In the external test data set, OCT-PRO achieved an MAE of 0.168 logMAR, significantly outperforming the OCT-only (0.183 logMAR, P = 0.003) and metadata-only models (0.229 logMAR, P < 0.001). Subgroup analyses confirmed consistent advantages of OCT-PRO across different cataract subtypes and baseline preoperative BCVA groups. Model interpretability analysis highlighted the importance of preoperative BCVA, age, and macular foveal structure, with greater reliance on OCT features than clinical metadata-especially in complex or low preoperative BCVA cases. In a head-to-head comparison, the model consistently outperformed both junior and senior ophthalmologists in predictive accuracy across various clinical subtypes.
OCT-PRO enables accurate prediction of postoperative visual outcomes in cataract surgery, outperforming conventional methods and ophthalmologists. It holds promise as a valuable decision-support tool to assist surgical decision-making and improve health care resource allocation.

High-NA objectives provide fine structural detail at the cost of reduced spatial coverage and slower scanning as compared to a low-NA objective, while low-NA objectives offer wide fields of view but compromised resolution. Here, we introduce LensPlus, a deep learning-based framework that enhances the SBP of quantitative phase imaging (QPI) without requiring hardware modifications. By training on paired datasets acquired with low-NA and high-NA objectives, LensPlus learns to recover high-frequency features lost in low-NA measurements, effectively bridging the resolution gap while preserving the large field of view, thereby increasing the SBP. We demonstrate that LensPlus can transform images acquired with a 10x/0.3 NA objective (40x/0.95 NA for another model) to a quality comparable to that obtained using a 40x/0.95 NA objective (100x/1.45NA for the second model), resulting in a 2D-SBP improvement of approximately 3.5x (2.04x for the second model). Importantly, unlike adversarial models, LensPlus employs a non-generative model to minimize image hallucinations and ensure quantitative fidelity as verified through spectral analysis. Beyond QPI, LensPlus is broadly applicable to other lens-based imaging modalities, enabling wide-field, high-resolution imaging for time-lapse studies, large-area tissue mapping, and applications where high-NA oil objectives are impractical."

We aim to develop an automated deep learning model to separate excellent-quality from suboptimal-quality volumes in a quantitative and objective manner. Existing works use supervised classifiers trained on 2D en face images, which 1) represent quality as rigid and discrete classes, 2) require large amounts of labeled data for every type of artifact to generalize effectively, and 3) discard valuable depth information from the original volume. We propose OCTA-GAN, an efficient 3D generative adversarial network architecture that incorporates multi-scale processing layers to assess the quality of scans by fusing fine vasculature details with larger anatomical context. The unsupervised model learns patterns associated with excellent-quality volumes and accurately determines the quality of unseen volumes. Experimental results show OCTA-GAN's discriminator distinguishes excellent-quality from suboptimal-quality volumes with an AUC of 0.92, a sensitivity of 95.7%, and a specificity of 76.6%, surpassing the baseline 3D architecture (AUC = 0.55, sensitivity = 97.8%, specificity = 12.8%). Further analysis attributes the improved performance to the synergy between the generator model and discriminator architecture, whose robust feature representations effectively capture the intricate vasculature. Comparison with state-of-the-art 2D supervised en face classifiers demonstrates OCTA-GAN's ability to generalize across diverse artifacts and provides an interpretable organization of the output scores based on severity."
PubMed,deep learning,Electroencephalography-Based Machine and Deep Learning Approaches for the Diagnosis of Dissociative Disorders: A Comprehensive Review.,Hassan Jubair,10.1016/j.bpsgos.2025.100654,2026-03,Biological psychiatry global open science,"Dissociative disorders (DDs), including dissociative identity disorder and depersonalization disorder, are complex and often misdiagnosed psychiatric conditions due to their overlapping symptoms with other mental illnesses. Electroencephalography (EEG), a low-cost and noninvasive neuroimaging tool, is a valuable means of examining the neurophysiological signatures associated with DDs. In this review, we aim to systematically evaluate how machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) methods are applied to EEG data for the diagnosis and monitoring of DDs, highlighting their effectiveness, limitations, and future research directions. We reviewed and synthesized studies involving EEG-based ML and DL models applied to DD-related data. The analysis focused on EEG biomarkers, model architecture (e.g., support vector machines, convolutional neural networks [CNNs], recurrent neural networks [RNNs]), feature types (raw vs. handcrafted), performance metrics, and reported challenges. Findings indicate that DL models, especially CNN and RNN, outperform traditional ML models by learning complex spatiotemporal EEG patterns. Key EEG biomarkers identified include altered frontal EEG power, disrupted theta and alpha rhythms, and attenuated P300 components. Hybrid and raw feature-based DL approaches yielded the highest classification accuracies (up to 98.3%) in related neuropsychiatric tasks. EEG-based DL techniques offer promising advancements in diagnosing DDs. However, challenges such as data scarcity, model interpretability, and generalizability persist. Future research should focus on explainable artificial intelligence, multimodal integration, transfer learning, and personalized EEG biomarkers to bridge the gap between research and clinical application."
PubMed,deep learning,Automated Detection and Monitoring of Ground-Nesting Bee Nests Using Drone Imagery and Deep Learning.,Philippe Tschanz; Thomas Renggli; Jonas Winizki; Achim Walter; Matthias Albrecht; Thomas Keller,10.1002/ece3.72856,2026-01,Ecology and evolution,"Bees that nest in the soil in self-excavated burrows comprise the majority of wild bee species and provide important pollination and soil functions, yet many species are threatened. Conservation efforts for ground-nesting bees are often hindered by limited knowledge of their nesting habitat requirements, in part because nests are difficult to locate and efficient methods for monitoring nesting sites are lacking. Automated detection and monitoring of soil mounds (tumuli) produced by ground-nesting bees, indicating nest presence, could provide new insights into bee nesting biology and population dynamics while also providing crucial data to support conservation and management. Image-based methods, such as the automated acquisition of high-resolution aerial imagery using drones combined with modern computer vision techniques, offer a promising path toward scalable systems for detecting and monitoring bee nest tumuli across large areas. Here, we evaluate the feasibility of integrating drone-based image acquisition with deep learning to detect tumuli representing bee nests and to distinguish them from other soil surface deposits, such as earthworm casts. We demonstrate this approach on a 120 m2 area of a densely populated nesting aggregation of Lasioglossum malachurum on bare soil containing numerous earthworm casts. Our model reliably detected bee nest tumuli, achieving an F 1 score of 0.90 (precision: 0.89, recall: 0.91). Misclassifications mainly arose from atypically shaped tumuli (e.g., new and incomplete or damaged), and from cases where tumuli overlapped, but no earthworm casts were confused for bee nest tumuli. This pilot study represents a step toward more efficient monitoring of ground-nesting bees and demonstrates the potential of this approach under specific conditions. Future work could evaluate its applicability across additional habitats and species and explore alternative methods, such as image segmentation, which may be better suited for cases with less distinct tumuli or extensive overlap among soil mounds."
PubMed,deep learning,Explainable artificial intelligence for molecular design in pharmaceutical research.,Alec Lamens; Jürgen Bajorath,10.1039/d5sc08461j,2026-01-12,Chemical science,"The rise of artificial intelligence (AI) has taken machine learning (ML) in molecular design to a new level. As ML increasingly relies on complex deep learning frameworks, the inability to understand predictions of black-box models has become a topical issue. Consequently, there is strong interest in the field of explainable AI (XAI) to bridge the gap between black-box models and the acceptance of their predictions, especially at interfaces with experimental disciplines. Therefore, XAI methods must go beyond extracting learning patterns from ML models and present explanations of predictions in a human-centered, transparent, and interpretable manner. In this Perspective, we examine current challenges and opportunities for XAI in molecular design and evaluate the benefits of incorporating domain-specific knowledge into XAI approaches for model refinement, experimental design, and hypothesis testing. In this context, we also discuss the current limitations in evaluating results from chemical language models that are increasingly used in molecular design and drug discovery."

With a focus on the prevalent psychological complications following the onset of this condition, this study aimed to explore the correlation between antenatal depression and Corona disease anxiety, personality traits, and postpartum depression during the COVID-19 pandemic.                                                           Materials and Methods:                     This cross-sectional descriptive-analytical study investigated women receiving care at health centers affiliated with Kerman University of Medical Sciences during the last month of their pregnancy and the postpartum period in 2022. Following the acquisition of informed consent, participants were assessed using various measures, including demographic and obstetric information, the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale, the Corona Disease Anxiety Scale (CDAS), and the NEO Personality Inventory-Revised during their third trimester of pregnancy. The same group of participants completed the Edinburgh Depression Scale and the Corona Disease Anxiety Scale (CDAS) 4-6 weeks after childbirth.                                                           Results and Discussion:                     There was a significant correlation between family income, unwanted pregnancy as perceived by both the mother and father, and antenatal depression. Additionally, marital satisfaction played a significant role in postpartum depression. Furthermore, antenatal depression was significantly associated with neuroticism, agreeableness, and physical symptoms related to Corona disease anxiety. Personality traits, with the exception of extroversion and conscientiousness, and various domains of Corona disease anxiety, excluding psychological symptoms, were also significantly associated with postpartum depression.                                                           Conclusion:                     During pandemics or epidemics, such as the COVID-19 outbreak, experiencing mental distress during pregnancy can contribute to mental health issues during the postpartum period. This risk is particularly true in individuals with unique personality traits, emphasizing the need for increased focus on mental health within prenatal care during these crises."

Method:                     This cross-sectional study was conducted in Kerman, Iran. Data were collected from patients who visited Afzalipour Hospital in Kerman more than twice during the COVID-19 epidemic from the end of February 2020 to March 21, 2021. We conducted two key analyses: 1. Mixed effect logistic regression was used to check the relationship between the variables and COVID-19 severity. 2. Mixed effect linear regression was used to check the relationship between the variables and the length of stay in the hospital.                                                           Results:                     The findings indicated that the most important risk factors for the severity of COVID-19 were heart diseases (OR=1.67,95%CI:1.20-2.30), increasing age (OR=2.23 for age&gt;54, 95%CI:1.70- 2.90), male gender (OR=1.47,95%CI:1.10-1.96), respiratory diseases other than asthma, and frequency of admission (OR=1.60,95%CI:1.20-2.15). All patients who underwent readmission experienced a shorter duration of hospitalization during their subsequent admission (OR=0.94,95%CI:0.91,0.96) and had a higher mortality rate (30% within 14 days, 26.6% between 14-90 days). Patients readmitted at intervals of 14-90 days and greater than 90 days exhibited lower disease severity compared to those readmitted within the 0-14 day period.                                                           Conclusion:                     Examining readmissions, the severity of COVID-19, and the length of hospital stay in affected patients are important factors for planning and allocating resources for COVID-19 management and treatment. These factors can help policymakers develop effective clinical guidelines for hospitalization or outpatient treatment of COVID-19 patients and contribute to reducing the burden of disease in the community."

Kinovea, as an accessible motion-analysis software, provides both visual and quantitative feedback. However, its application in supporting technique development among beginner athletes remains insufficiently explored. Aim: This study aims to describe the use of Kinovea in biomechanics training and examine its contribution to the awareness of kinematic characteristics and movement techniques among beginner athletes. Methods: A descriptive qualitative design involved 72 beginner athletes aged 18–25 years selected through purposive sampling. Data were collected over 16 weeks through interviews, field observations, and motion video recordings analyzed using Kinovea. Kinematic data focused on joint angles, stride behavior, and movement phases during walking, running, and the flight phase. Qualitative data were analyzed using content analysis with NVivo 12, while kinematic results were interpreted descriptively to identify performance patterns and areas for technical refinement. Result: Kinematic analysis showed coordinated joint-angle patterns across all phases. Walking analysis identified arm swing angles of 50.9°–58.8° and leg separation angles of 64.3°–67.2°, indicating a stable gait rhythm. The running analysis revealed knee angles of 68.8°–69.8° and elbow angles of 87.6°–89.1°, indicating efficient propulsive mechanics. The flight phase demonstrated knee angles of 81.2°–87.8° and elbow angles of 80.4°–88.3°, suggesting effective momentum use and postural stability. These measurements supported stride-efficiency assessment and technique evaluation. Qualitative findings revealed that Kinovea enabled athletes to interpret movement phases and identify technical inefficiencies through slow-motion and frame-by-frame visualization. Conclusion: Kinovea supports basic motion analysis by providing clear kinematic information and helping beginner athletes observe and refine their movement techniques. The findings also offer practical value for coaches by enabling more precise identification of inefficient patterns and guiding targeted corrections during early-stage training."

Approximately 45% of patients with VHD have been diagnosed with HTN. This association increases with age, but cannot be explained solely by the rising prevalence of both conditions. HTN promotes the onset or worsening of VHD by mechanically stressing the valves and by modified blood flow dynamics through increased filling pressures and afterload. It has been shown that a 20 mmHg rise in BP triples the risk of aortic valvular disease and mitral regurgitation. This review will address the impact of HTN on the occurrence and progression of valvular lesions, its effect on the prognosis of patients with VHD, and the available data on blood pressure management. As long as relatively well-documented data on aortic valve disease are available, studies are still needed to clarify target blood pressure values under therapy and the most appropriate drug classes for mitral regurgitation, especially in its primary forms."
OpenAlex,mitral regurgitation,Silent cardiac burden: Echocardiographic abnormalities and their predictors in kidney transplant candidates and their impact on graft function,Nihal Mohammed Sadagah; Muhammad Abdul Mabood Khalil; Hinda Hassan Khideer Mahmood; Ibtisam Ali Alghamdi; Ghada Abdulrahman Buridi; Salem H Al-Qurashi,10.5500/wjt.v16.i1.110628,2026-01-14,World Journal of Transplantation,"BACKGROUND An echocardiogram is an essential tool in the evaluation of potential kidney transplant recipients (KTRs). Despite cardiac clearance, potential KTRs still have structural and functional abnormalities. Identifying the prevalence of these abnormalities and understanding their predictors is vital for optimizing pre-transplant risk stratification and improving post-transplant outcomes. AIM To determine the prevalence of left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH), left ventricular systolic dysfunction (LVSD), diastolic dysfunction (DD), pulmonary hypertension (PH), and their predictors, and to assess their impact on graft function in pre-transplant candidates. METHODS The study included all successful transplant candidates older than 14 who had a baseline echocardiogram. Binary logistic regression models were constructed to identify factors associated with LVH, LVSD, DD, and PH. RESULTS Out of 259 patients, LVH was present in 64% (166), 12% (31) had LVSD, 27.5% (71) had DD, and 66 (25.5%) had PH. Independent predictors of LVH included male gender [odds ratio (OR): 2.51; 95%CI: 1.17–5.41 P = 0.02], PH (OR = 2.07; 95%CI: 1.11–3.86; P = 0.02), DD (OR: 2.47; 95%CI: 1.29–4.73; P = 0.006), and dyslipidemia (OR = 1.94; 95%CI: 1.07–3.53; P = 0.03). Predictors for LVSD included patients with DD (OR = 3.3, 95% CI: 1.41–7.81; P = 0.006) and a family history of coronary artery disease (OR = 4.50, 95%CI: 1.33–15.20; P = 0.015). Peritoneal dialysis was an independent predictor for DD (OR = 10.03; 95%CI: 1.71-58.94, P = 0.011). The presence of LVH (OR = 3.32, 95%CI: 1.05–10.55, P = 0.04) and mild to moderate or moderate to severe mitral regurgitation (OR = 4.63, 95%CI: 1.45–14.78, P = 0.01) were significant factors associated with PH. These abnormalities had no significant impact on estimated glomerular filtration at discharge, 6 months, 1 year, or 2 years post-transplant. CONCLUSION Significant echocardiographic abnormalities persist in a potential transplant candidate despite cardiac clearance, although they don’t affect future graft function. Understanding the risk factors associated with these abnormalities may help clinicians address these factors pre- and post-transplant to achieve better outcomes."

Falk; Henryk Dreger; Christoph Klein; Hristian Hinkov; Axel Unbehaun,10.1093/ejcts/ezag031,2026-01-13,European Journal of Cardio-Thoracic Surgery,"Abstract Objectives Transcatheter mitral valve implantation (TMVI) is increasingly used in failed bioprostheses and annuloplasty rings as a less invasive alternative to redo surgery in selected patients, with promising results. This retrospective single-centre study aims to provide additional insight into clinical outcomes and its determinants following TMVI. Methods Data of all TMVI procedures (n = 88) performed between February 2014 and June 2024 were retrospectively analyzed. The primary endpoints were 1-year mortality and the Mitral Valve Academic Research Consortium (MVARC) composite endpoints. Secondary outcomes included complications and echocardiographic outcomes. Results Overall, in-hospital, 30-day, and 1-year mortality rates were 6.8%, 5.8%, and 16.5%, respectively. No significant differences were observed between transseptal and transapical approach (20.0 vs 13.2%, p = 0.439) or between valve-in-valve and valve-in-ring procedure (16.3 vs 18.2%, p = 0.828). At 1-year follow-up, only one patient presented with mitral regurgitation ≥ grade 2. However, a post-procedural mean pressure gradient (MPG) ≥5 mmHg was observed in 51 patients (58%). In multivariate analysis, higher post-procedural MPG was associated with increased mortality risk (p = 0.047, HR = 1.23, 95% CI: 1.00–1.51), whereas technical success was associated with reduced mortality risk (p = 0.014, HR = 0.12, 95% CI: 0.02–0.65). Conclusions TMVI provided acceptable mid-term mortality irrespective of procedure type and access route, with excellent technical success. Furthermore, mid-term follow-up showed near-complete elimination of mitral regurgitation. However, a high rate of post-procedural relevant mitral stenosis was observed, which may have an impact on mortality. In the light of the anticipated increase in TMVI procedures, we advocate for larger prospective studies to investigate the long-term determinants of mortality."
OpenAlex,mitral regurgitation,Case Report: Emergency mitral valve plasty in an unstable dog with left atrial rupture secondary to myxomatous mitral valve disease,Tomoki Wada; Ryosuke TAKEMURA; Hideki Yotsuida; M Ohashi; Naoki Miyashita; On Uezawa; Takuya Mori,10.3389/fvets.2025.1653646,2026-01-12,Frontiers in Veterinary Science,"Objective To describe the medical and surgical management of recurrent left atrial rupture (LAR) in a dog with severe mitral regurgitation (MR). This report focuses on challenges encountered with pericardiocentesis, the role of hemodynamic support, and the importance of invasive blood pressure monitoring. Case summary An 11-year-old, weighing 2.9 kg, male Chihuahua was scheduled for mitral valve plasty due to severe MR. The dog developed acute collapse and dyspnea and was diagnosed with LAR and pulmonary edema; pericardiocentesis was withheld due to relatively stable hemodynamics. Despite inotropic support and diuretics administration, a second LAR occurred the following day during transport for echocardiographic examination, with a large intrapericardial clot preventing pericardiocentesis and causing shock. Although fluid therapy and ephedrine administration improved blood pressure, invasive blood pressure monitoring and strict rest were subsequently employed to maintain a lower systolic pressure, enabling safe anesthetic induction. Under cardiopulmonary bypass, clot removal was performed. Intraoperatively, due to inadequate venous return, the heart enlarged and a third LAR occurred, necessitating repair of the rupture site with a pericardial patch under cardioplegic arrest alongside chordae tendineae reconstruction. Postoperatively, the dog developed dyspnea potentially related to lung injury, transfusion effects, or residual pulmonary edema, which resolved with medical management. Marked thrombocytopenia emerged soon after switching antibiotics but improved rapidly following corticosteroid administration and discontinuation of the suspected antibiotic. The dog was discharged in good condition and remained clinically stable 1 year later. Conclusion This case provides a detailed account for the stepwise medical and anesthetic management of recurrent LAR secondary to severe MR. During conservative treatment, pericardiocentesis was not always effective, particularly in the presence of intrapericardial clots, which might have interfered with drainage. In the setting of cardiac tamponade, increasing pre- and after-load along with positive inotropic support appeared to contribute to temporary hemodynamic stabilization. Invasive arterial pressure monitoring allowed for stable hemodynamic control and safe anesthetic induction, underscoring its importance for preoperative management. Furthermore, the third intraoperative rupture was successfully repaired using a pericardial patch, which achieved effective hemostasis and demonstrated its potential value as a surgical option for LAR repair."

Adult presentations are uncommon and often underdiagnosed. Case Description: A 35-year-old male presented with exertional dyspnea. ETT demonstrated severe mitral stenosis, reduced ejection fraction, bicuspid aortic valve, and pulmonary hypertension. Intraoperative findings confirmed true PMV. Due to anatomical complexity, a 27-mm mechanical prosthesis replacement was performed successfully, with rapid postoperative recovery. Conclusion: Adult PMV requires high clinical suspicion and often surgical confirmation. Valve replacement is effective in complex cases, emphasizing the importance of early diagnosis and intervention."

Artificial intelligence (AI) may enable rapid, point-of-care cardiac assessment using simplified imaging protocols. Objectives To evaluate whether a deep learning model can accurately detect significant valvular and ventricular dysfunction using only a single two-dimensional apical four-chamber echocardiographic view, including images acquired by non-cardiologists with handheld ultrasound devices. Methods We retrospectively analyzed 120,127 echocardiographic studies from a tertiary medical center to train and validate a deep learning model for identifying moderate-or-greater mitral or tricuspid regurgitation, right ventricular dysfunction, and reduced left ventricular ejection fraction (≤40%). A prospective cohort of 209 patients underwent handheld point-of-care cardiac ultrasound performed by non-cardiologist physicians, with same-hospitalization comprehensive echocardiography as the reference standard. Results In retrospective testing, model areas under the curve (AUCs) were 0.883 for mitral regurgitation, 0.913 for tricuspid regurgitation, 0.940 for right ventricular dysfunction, and 0.982 for reduced ejection fraction. In the prospective cohort, AUCs were 0.72, 0.87, 0.95, and 0.97 for the same respective targets. Conclusions A single-view deep learning model demonstrated strong diagnostic accuracy for detecting significant valvular and ventricular dysfunction across both standard and handheld ultrasound acquisitions. This approach may facilitate rapid, scalable cardiac function screening by non-cardiologists in diverse clinical environments. Clinical Trial Registration identifier NCT05455541."

Therefore, this study aimed to comprehensively assess the outcomes of mitral valve repair across different MR etiologies, including primary MR, left ventricle functional MR (LVFMR), ischemic MR, left atrial functional MR (LAFMR), and rheumatic MR, by examining in-hospital, short-term, and medium-term outcomes, as well as the change in cardiac function through echocardiographic parameters and strain analysis. Methods This retrospective study included 911 patients who underwent mitral valve repair at a single center from 2015 to 2021. Echocardiographic and strain analyses were performed preoperatively and at 6 months post-surgery. Mortality outcomes were assessed at in-hospital and at 6, 12, and 51 months postoperatively. Results There were significant differences in outcomes across MR etiologies. The primary and rheumatic groups demonstrated the lowest mortality rates, whereas the LVFMR, LAFMR, and ischemic groups exhibited markedly higher mortality, both in the early postoperative period and during long-term follow-up. Echocardiographic analysis showed improvements in cardiac dimensions and volumes, but concurrent declines in myocardial function, particularly in ejection fraction, global longitudinal strain, and left atrial reservoir strain. Discussion This study highlights the importance of etiology-specific risk stratification. While mitral valve repair effectively reduces MR, myocardial recovery may be delayed or insufficient in certain subgroups, especially those with pre-existing myocardial dysfunction. Tailored therapeutic strategies that address the multifactorial nature of functional and ischemic MR are warranted to improve long-term outcomes."

We report a case of transcatheter closure of a residual mid‐leaflet mitral valve cleft in a 19‐year‐old patient with moderate mitral regurgitation through two defects in the anterior leaflet of a repaired cleft mitral valve using a retrograde approach and a novel device, a Siege Vascular Plug (Merit Medical Systems Inc, UT, USA), with favorable results."
OpenAlex,mitral regurgitation,Successful use of immunoadsorption therapy in advanced dilated cardiomyopathy: A case report,Rendan Zhang; Lvwen Ning; Y. M. Liu; Zhixiong Tan; Lu Kong; Xiaoqing Quan; Xiehui Chen,10.1097/md.0000000000047080,2026-01-09,Medicine,"Rationale: Dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) is a major cause of chronic heart failure, and some patients continue to deteriorate despite guideline-directed medical therapy. Immunoadsorption (IA), which removes pathogenic autoantibodies, has been proposed as a potential adjunctive therapy, but its clinical use remains limited. This case illustrates the potential benefits of IA in advanced, treatment-refractory DCM. Patient concerns: A 53-year-old woman with a 9-year history of DCM presented with recurrent chest tightness and dyspnea. Despite long-term guideline-directed medical therapy, her symptoms progressively worsened. Diagnoses: The patient had chronic DCM initially diagnosed in the peripartum period, with a left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) of 11% at onset. Before IA, echocardiography demonstrated severe systolic dysfunction (LVEF 22%–24%) with significant mitral regurgitation, and laboratory evaluation showed markedly elevated pro-BNP (4454 pg/mL). Interventions: The patient underwent two sessions of immunoadsorption in September 2024, followed by high-dose intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) as per standard protocols. Outcomes: Following treatment, her symptoms improved, pro-BNP decreased to 2109 pg/mL, and repeat echocardiography showed an increase in LVEF to 29.2%. Lessons: This case suggests that immunoadsorption may offer clinical benefit in patients with advanced, refractory DCM. While promising, IA remains experimental and requires further investigation in larger, controlled studies."
OpenAlex,mitral regurgitation,ACC/AHA vs ESC/EACT Guidelines on valvular heart disease: EJPC Guideline comparison review,Maciej Dębski; Vasiliki Tsampasian; Joseph Zacharias; Liam Ring; Vassiliou,10.1093/eurjpc/zwag015,2026-01-09,European Journal of Preventive Cardiology,"Abstract Valvular heart disease poses persistent challenges for clinical decision-making, and international guidelines provide essential frameworks for its management. The American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association last issued a full update in 2020 and an expert consensus on tricuspid regurgitation in 2025. The European Society of Cardiology/European Association for Cardio-Thoracic Surgery released their updated guidelines in 2025. Although there is broad alignment in principles of intervention, prosthesis choice, and the role of Heart Teams, the European document incorporates substantial new trial evidence. Key areas of divergence include thresholds for earlier intervention in aortic stenosis and regurgitation, expanded recommendations for transcatheter edge-to-edge repair and mitral replacement, formal integration of tricuspid repair and transcatheter therapies, evolving strategies for coronary assessment in transcatheter aortic valve implantation, and sex-specific considerations. This review highlights consistencies, discrepancies, and priorities for future research."
OpenAlex,mitral regurgitation,Novel characterization of MRAS mutation-associated Noonan syndrome: Mild adult-onset hypertrophic cardiomyopathy combined with infective endocarditis: A case report,Xiaoli Mou; Yong Liu; Y Z Zhang; Xinhe Cheng; Junshuai Feng,10.1097/md.0000000000046340,2026-01-09,Medicine,"Rationale: Noonan syndrome (NS) is a RASopathy most frequently associated with mutations in HRAS, NRAS, KRAS, and RRAS2. The contribution of MRAS variants to NS pathogenesis remains poorly characterized, and infective endocarditis (IE) is extremely rare in patients with NS. Patient concerns: A 22-year-old woman presented with typical dysmorphic features of NS, including short stature, broad forehead, hypertelorism, low-set posteriorly rotated ears, and a broad neck. She developed fever and progressive exertional dyspnea. Diagnoses: Echocardiography demonstrated obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy with vegetation located in the left ventricular outflow tract. Blood cultures grew Streptococcus mutans. Whole-exome sequencing identified a heterozygous MRAS c.203C&gt;T (p.Thr68Ile) mutation affecting a highly conserved residue among RASopathy-associated GTPases, supporting the diagnosis of MRAS-associated Noonan syndrome complicated by infective endocarditis. Interventions: Antibiotic therapy was escalated to intravenous gentamicin (60 mg daily) combined with ceftriaxone in accordance with the 2023 European Society of Cardiology guidelines for infective endocarditis. Outcomes: After one month of intravenous gentamicin and ceftriaxone therapy, fever resolved, and follow-up echocardiography showed disappearance of the vegetation. Residual cardiac abnormalities persisted, including marked left ventricular hypertrophy with left ventricular outflow tract obstruction, left atrial enlargement, moderate mitral regurgitation, patent foramen ovale with minor shunting, and impaired diastolic function. Exertional dyspnea remained despite resolution of the infection. Lessons: This case expands the genotypic spectrum of Noonan syndrome by supporting MRAS mutations as pathogenic drivers. It also identifies infective endocarditis as a previously unreported complication in MRAS-associated NS with outflow tract obstruction, highlighting the importance of careful cardiac surveillance in patients with RASopathies."
OpenAlex,mitral regurgitation,Effects of Levosimendan in Patients with Severe Mitral Insufficiency and Left Ventricular Dysfunction Undergoing Transcatheter Edge-to-Edge Repair: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis,Stephanie Gladys Kühne; Deborah Penet; Simon Wölbert; Eva Harmel; Damyan Penev; Sebastien Elvinger; Mauro Chiarito; Philip W. J. Raake; Dario Bongiovanni,10.3390/jcdd13010040,2026-01-09,Journal of Cardiovascular Development and Disease,"Severe mitral regurgitation (MR) is one of the most common valvular heart diseases and is frequently associated with advanced left ventricular (LV) systolic dysfunction. Transcatheter edge-to-edge repair (TEER) offers effective symptom relief but may induce abrupt hemodynamic changes leading to afterload mismatch and acute LV failure. Levosimendan may help mitigate this complication by improving contractility, yet evidence supporting its use in this setting is scarce. Therefore, the aim of this study was to systematically evaluate the evidence on the effects of Levosimendan in patients with severe MR and LV dysfunction undergoing TEER. We performed a comprehensive search of PubMed, Embase, Scopus, and Google Scholar. Primary outcomes were postprocedural LV ejection fraction (LVEF) and systolic pulmonary artery pressure (sPAP). Secondary outcomes included procedural success, procedure duration, and in-hospital complications. Five studies comprising 315 patients (n = 141 Levosimendan, n = 174 controls) met the inclusion criteria. Pooled analysis showed no significant difference in postprocedural LVEF between Levosimendan-treated patients and controls (mean difference 0.45%, 95% CI [−1.46–2.35] p = 0.65) and no significant change from baseline. Similarly, postprocedural sPAP did not differ significantly. Procedural success was higher with Levosimendan, and procedure duration was shorter. These hypothesis-generating findings highlight the need for larger, prospective randomized trials to clarify the role of Levosimendan in this setting."

Traditional management strategies follow a step-by-step approach, prioritizing guideline-directed medical therapy (GDMT) and reserving interventional (surgical or percutaneous) options only in case of persistent symptoms or worsening HF after GDMT. However, greater experience with the use of percutaneous procedures, even in high-risk patients, could support a more integrated approach, which exploits the synergistic effects of medical and interventional therapies to increase the tolerability of one vs the other, thereby improving quality of life and outcomes through their synergic effects. This expert opinion paper summarizes current data and evolving practices in the management of VHD in patients with HF, including secondary mitral regurgitation, aortic stenosis, aortic regurgitation, and tricuspid regurgitation."

Less is known about the operator volumes–outcomes association in the contemporary era. Objective To determine whether an operator-level volume-outcomes association exists for TAVR and MTEER in the contemporary era. Design, Setting, and Participants This cohort study examined data from patients undergoing TAVR or MTEER between January 2020 and December 2023 included in the Society of Thoracic Surgeons (STS)/American College of Cardiology (ACC) Transcatheter Valve Therapies (TVT) Registry, a national all-comers real-world registry. Consecutive patients undergoing TAVR for aortic stenosis or MTEER for mitral regurgitation were included. Data analysis was performed from October 2024 to December 2025. Exposure TAVR or MTEER. Main Outcomes and Measures The primary outcome measures were (1) 30-day all-cause mortality, (2) a 30-day composite outcome, and (3) in-hospital procedural complications following TAVR or MTEER. Data from the STS/ACC TVT Registry were analyzed for patients undergoing TAVR or MTEER between 2020 and 2023. The primary analysis assessed the association between operator volume and 30-day outcomes using a 2-level random-effects logistic regression model. The interaction between operator and hospital volumes and the association between TAVR and MTEER outcomes were also evaluated. Results A total of 358 943 patients underwent TAVR at 827 hospitals (7524 operators; median [IQR] annual volume, 24 [11-47]), and 51 407 patients underwent MTEER at 493 hospitals (2483 operators; median [IQR] annual volume, 12 [7-19]). For TAVR, median (IQR) patient age was 79.0 (73.0-85.0) years, and 152 186 patients (42.4%) were female; for MTEER, median (IQR) patient age was 79.0 (71.0-84.0) years, and 23 402 patients (45.5%) were female. Low-volume operators demonstrated inferior process of care measures compared with high-volume operators. In adjusted analyses, a higher risk of 30-day mortality (odds ratio [OR], 1.13; 95% CI, 1.02-1.26; P = .02) and in-hospital complications (OR, 1.09; 95% CI, 1.03-1.16; P = .005) was observed for low-volume TAVR operators (&amp;amp;lt;15/y) compared with high-volume operators (&amp;amp;gt;37/y). For MTEER, in-hospital complications (OR, 1.31; 95% CI, 1.11-1.56; P = .002) were higher for low-volume operators (&amp;amp;lt;8/y) compared with high-volume operators (&amp;amp;gt;16/y), while 30-day mortality was not different (OR, 1.16; 95% CI, 0.96-1.41; P = .12). Associations were consistent across hospital volume strata. Operator-level outcomes for TAVR and MTEER were not correlated. Conclusions and Relevance In this cohort study, results from a large, contemporary US registry demonstrate a persistent inverse association between operator volume and patient outcomes for both TAVR and MTEER. These findings may help inform future policies aimed at ensuring optimal outcomes."
OpenAlex,mitral regurgitation,Renal resistive index for risk stratification and functional evaluation after transcatheter mitral valve repair: the ReRISE study,Hannah Billig; Sophie Hofmann; Marc Ulrich Becher; Marc Adrian Rogmann; Johanna Vogelhuber; Sebastian Zimmer; Georg Nickenig; Can Öztürk,10.1007/s00392-025-02841-y,2026-01-08,Clinical Research in Cardiology,"Abstract Background The renal resistive index (RRI) is increasingly used as a non-invasive marker of cardiorenal interaction. We aimed to determine (i) whether baseline RRI predicts survival after mitral transcatheter edge-to-edge repair (M-TEER) and (ii) whether RRI changes in response to the procedure. Methods In this prospective, single-center cohort we enrolled consecutive patients with severe mitral regurgitation who underwent M-TEER between October 2020 and December 2021 (trial registration number 412/20, date of registration 02.09.2020). Baseline demographics, estimated laboratory parameters, comprehensive echocardiography, and Doppler-derived RRI were collected before and 3 months after intervention. The primary endpoint was all-cause mortality. Associations were analyzed with multivariable Cox regression. Renal endpoints were not systematically collected and were therefore not included as clinical outcome measures. Results Among 109 patients (53.2% women), the median baseline RRI was 0.71 (IQR 0.67–0.75) and showed no correlation with eGFR, left-ventricular ejection fraction, or echocardiographic measurements of mitral regurgitation at baseline. Higher RRI was associated with all-cause mortality, and in exploratory post hoc analyses an RRI cutoff &gt; 0.70 remained predictive independent of baseline renal function (HR 5.37, p 0.07). RRI improved significantly 3 months after M-TEER (0.67; IQR 0.63–0.70; p &lt; 0.001), particularly in patients with a post-procedural MR reduction of at least 1 grade. However, the change in RRI showed no correlation with mortality or changes in renal function. Conclusions A baseline RRI above 0.70 was independently associated with mortality following M–TEER, underscoring its potential prognostic relevance. The marked post-procedural decline in RRI, especially in patients with relevant MR improvement, suggests that RRI reflects hemodynamic rather than renal filtration changes. Given the limited sample size and number of events, these findings should be considered exploratory and hypothesis-generating, requiring validation in larger multicenter cohorts. Graphical Abstract"
OpenAlex,mitral regurgitation,Paroxysmal hypotension and hypoxemia caused by severe dynamic secondary mitral and tricuspid regurgitation after acute myocardial infarction,Weiya Li; Si Liang Wang; Yujia Liang; Xin Wei; Mao Chen,10.1093/eschf/xvaf014,2026-01-08,ESC Heart Failure,"Abstract A 57-year-old male patient developed paroxysmal hypotension and hypoxemia during endotracheal extubation post-acute myocardial infarction revascularization. The underlying cause was severe dynamic mitral regurgitation (MR) and secondary tricuspid regurgitation (TR). After successful extubation and weaning, the patient’s MR nearly resolved. Discharged in improved condition with guideline-directed medical therapy, the patient was soon readmitted for heart failure with pulmonary edema. The transthoracic echocardiogram confirmed recurrent, worsening MR.​ Transcatheter edge-to-edge repair was successfully performed, reducing the patient’s severe MR to trivial and resolving TR completely. At 1-year follow-up, the patient remained stable with improved cardiac function and no readmissions for cardiac causes."

We report a case of mitral valve replacement in a 76-year-old woman with a large caseous cavity, coronary artery disease, severe mitral valve stenosis and atrial fibrillation. Preoperative computed tomography showed a large caseous cavity (3 x 3.5 cm) in the posterior annulus extending into the atrioventricular groove. After unroofing and evacuation, the cavity was excluded with a pericardial patch. The lower edge of the patch was sutured to the ventricular side of the cavity; valve sutures passed through the residual posterior leaflet, the upper edge of the patch and the atrial edge of the cavity. The mitral prosthesis was then secured. The patient was weaned from cardiopulmonary bypass without complications. Intraoperative echocardiography demonstrated a well-seated mitral prosthesis with no valvular or paravalvular leaks. Postoperative imaging confirmed successful exclusion of the cavity in the atrioventricular groove. The postoperative echocardiogram revealed a mean gradient of 4 mmHg across the mitral prosthesis and no mitral regurgitation. Patch exclusion of the caseous cavity is a safe and feasible approach to support implanting a mitral prosthesis and obliterating a cavity."
