Consecutive, single-center retrospective cohort conducted at a tertiary hospital in Mexico (December 2023-May 2025). POD was defined as a positive Confusion Assessment Method (CAM) documented in the electronic health record, without formal blinding. Descriptive analyses, nonparametric tests, and univariable logistic regression were performed; given the low event frequency, an exploratory parsimonious multivariable model was fitted. Limitations: retrospective design, low number of events-particularly in TAVI-and lack of formal blinding for CAM assessment.
Seventy patients were included (58 SAVR and 12 TAVI). Overall POD incidence was 17.1% (95% CI: 10.1-27.6); SAVR 15.5% (9/58; 95% CI: 8.4-26.9) and TAVI 25.0% (3/12; 95% CI: 8.9-53.2) (p = 0.42). In the penalized (Firth) adjusted model, atrial fibrillation (OR: 11.17; 95% CI: 1.58-79.66; p = 0.038) and infections (OR: 5.03; 95% CI: 1.06-23.11; p = 0.042) were associated with POD. Hyponatremia occurred only among patients with POD.
POD was frequent after SAVR and TAVI. In exploratory penalized analyses, atrial fibrillation and infections were associated with POD, while hyponatremia was observed only among POD cases. These findings support focusing on feasible in-hospital preventive measures."

The management of this condition remains challenging and requires a multidisciplinary approach that integrates clinical, hemodynamic, and multimodality imaging data to define the most effective and durable treatment strategy. Although randomized evidence to guide treatment decisions in this setting is limited, percutaneous interventions to address additional valvular lesions are being increasingly adopted. This review provides an overview of the pathophysiology of valvular diseases commonly associated with severe aortic stenosis, highlighting their prognostic implications after surgical or transcatheter treatment and their impact on risk stratification and therapeutic management."

However, the prognostic impact of LA dysfunction in the surgical intervention for AS remains unclear.
Among the 812 patients who underwent isolated surgical aortic valve replacement (SAVR) for AS at eight institutions between 2016 and 2021, 366 with available preoperative left atrial volume index (LAVI) were included. Based on the optimal value of 40 mL/m2-derived from receiver operating characteristic curve analyses-patients were stratified into a LA enlargement group (n = 219) and a non-enlargement group (n = 147), and 5-year outcomes were investigated.
Age (76.0 vs 76.0 years, P = 0.489) and sex (male 44.3% vs 50.3%,P = 0.256) were comparable, while the LA enlargement group showed lower eGFR (52.3 vs 59.2 mL/min/1.73 m2, P = 0.002), serum albumin (3.9 vs 4.0 g/dL, P = 0.003), and ejection fraction (65.0% vs 70.0%,P < 0.001), as well as a higher tendency for atrial fibrillation (20.1% vs 12.2%,P = 0.066), and higher STS-PROM (3.10% vs 2.91%,P = 0.029). The 5-year incidence of cardiac mortality was higher in the LA enlargement group (13.4% vs 2.6%,P = 0.001). Multivariable analysis identified preoperative LA enlargement (LAVI ≥ 40 mL/m2) as an independent predictor of cardiac mortality (adjusted HR, 2.08; 95% CI, 1.01-4.82; P = 0.041). LA enlargement was also associated with higher all-cause mortality and heart failure readmission (17.4% vs 7.6%,P = 0.002; and 11.0% vs 2.8%,P = 0.013, respectively).
In patients with severe AS undergoing isolated SAVR, a preoperative LAVI ≥ 40 mL/m2 was associated with midterm mortality and heart failure, suggesting that SAVR before significant LA enlargement may improve prognosis."

This single-center, retrospective cohort study included fetuses diagnosed with DAA using fetal echocardiography and managed perinatally at Kanagawa Children's Medical Center from January 2013-December 2024. Clinical data, fetal echocardiography, postnatal contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) findings, surgical intervention, and outcomes were reviewed. Narrowest tracheal diameter (NTD) Z score in late gestation and narrowest-to-reference tracheal area (NTA/RTA) ratio on postnatal CT were measured. Primary and secondary outcomes included respiratory symptoms shortly after birth and elective surgery, respectively. Groups were compared using t-tests, and the optimal cutoff values were determined using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis. Reproducibility was assessed using intraclass correlation coefficient. Twenty-two patients were included: 5 symptomatic and 17 asymptomatic (12, prophylactic surgery; 5, observation). Symptomatic patients had significantly lower NTD Z scores (median - 1.8 vs. -1.2, P = 0.012) and NTA/RTA ratios (median 0.39 vs. 0.67, P < 0.001). NTD Z score ≤ - 1.7 (area under the ROC curve [AUC] 0.87; sensitivity 80%, specificity 88%) and NTA/RTA ratio ≤ 0.5 (AUC 0.94; sensitivity 100%, specificity 82%) were optimal thresholds for predicting early symptoms. In the asymptomatic group, NTA/RTA ratio ≥ 0.56 identified candidates for observation without surgery. The ICC values for both parameters exceeded 0.85, indicating excellent reproducibility. The prenatal NTD Z score and postnatal NTA/RTA ratio accurately predict postnatal respiratory symptoms in fetuses with DAA. These quantitative parameters may guide individualized perinatal management and surgical decision-making."
PubMed,aortic stenosis,Left Atrial Reservoir Strain in Cardiovascular and Systemic Disease: Advances and Clinical Applications From Physiology to Practice.,Andrea Sonaglioni; Gian Luigi Nicolosi,10.31083/RCM46198,2025-12,Reviews in cardiovascular medicine,"Traditional parameters, such as left atrial size or volume, typically reflect chronic pressure and volume overload; however, these abnormalities only become evident at advanced stages, often missing early signs of dysfunction. In contrast, left atrial reservoir strain (LASr), measured by speckle-tracking echocardiography, offers a sensitive and dynamic assessment of atrial mechanics, integrating atrial compliance with left ventricular diastolic interaction. Moreover, impaired LASr reflects atrial stiffness and fibrosis, and correlates with elevated filling pressures, making the LASr parameter a comprehensive biomarker of left-sided cardiac function. Indeed, LASr has demonstrated diagnostic and prognostic value across a wide spectrum of conditions. In heart failure with preserved ejection fraction, LASr refines the assessment of diastolic dysfunction and predicts hospitalization and mortality. In atrial fibrillation, reduced strain correlates with atrial fibrosis and left atrial appendage dysfunction, identifying patients at increased risk of arrhythmia recurrence and thromboembolism. In valvular disease, LASr uncovers subclinical remodeling and stratifies risk even in patients with apparently moderate aortic stenosis. Meanwhile, in addition to cardiovascular disease, LASr can detect early atrial impairment in systemic disorders such as hypertension, diabetes, obesity, and amyloidosis, often before structural enlargement becomes evident. Our group has shown that LASr predicts persistent hypertension after gestational hypertensive disorders, reveals subclinical diastolic dysfunction in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, non-invasively predicts left atrial appendage thrombus in atrial fibrillation, stratifies outcomes in moderate aortic stenosis, and provides prognostic information in acute ischemic stroke. This narrative review outlines the physiological basis, technical considerations, and clinical applications of LASr, discusses its limitations and future perspectives-including multimodality imaging and artificial intelligence-and underscores its transition from a research metric to a dynamic biomarker ready for clinical practice."

A total of 137 patients were enrolled who were treated with a self-expandable Venus A valve at our center, who underwent TAVR from January 1, 2019, to June 30, 2022. We retrospectively included patients with BAV and TAV who underwent echocardiographic follow-ups at baseline and at least 6 months after the procedure.
Patients with a BAV were younger than those with a TAV. The BAV patients had a larger aortic root diameter (ARD), although the size of valve implantation was comparable between the two groups. Patients with a BAV might experience less reverse LV remodeling post-TAVR than patients with a TAV during the one-month follow-up (140.09 ± 36.94 g/m2 vs. 126.36 ± 26.96 g/m2; p = 0.044). There were no significant differences in the LV mass index (LVMi) between the two groups throughout the 24 hours or the six-month follow-up post-TAVR. Patients with a higher mean pressure gradient (MPG) (95% confidence interval (CI): 0.112-0.581; p = 0.004) and a larger ARD (95% CI: 0.519-5.573; p = 0.019) before TAVR had favorable mid-term LV reverse remodeling (ΔLVMi within 6 months) post-TAVR. Patients with much more severe aortic stenosis (AS) had favorable mid-term LV reverse remodeling post-TAVR.
Patients with BAV might experience less reverse LV remodeling post-TAVR than patients with TAV during a short-term follow-up, but similar remodeling during mid-term follow-ups."

This study evaluated the prognostic value of the Kihon Checklist (KCL), which covers physical, cognitive, and social domains, for patients receiving TAVI.
We retrospectively analyzed data from 986 patients who underwent elective TAVI between May 2017 and September 2022. Frailty was classified according to the KCL as non-frail (for scores of 0-3), pre-frail (4-7), or frail (≥8). The primary outcome measure was all-cause mortality following discharge. Kaplan-Meier, Cox regression, and classification and regression tree (CART) analyses were used. Of the overall patient cohort, 47.4% were classified as frail. Over a mean follow-up period of 968±578 days, 18.1% died. Frailty was significantly associated with higher mortality (adjusted hazard ratio 1.771; 95% confidence interval 1.096-2.862; P<0.02). Impaired socialization and physical function were also found to represent independent predictors of mortality. CART identified socialization as the primary node in the risk stratification.
Preoperative frailty, as defined by the KCL, was found to be independently associated with mortality after TAVI. Social and physical domains were also found to have strong prognostic relevance in this context."

This is a case of a 12-year-old male with a history of bicuspid aortic valve and mild asymptomatic aortic stenosis who presented with flu-like symptoms, right-sided hemiplegia, and aphasia. Although he initially presented with symptoms of arterial ischemic stroke, he was found to have infective endocarditis (IE) secondary to Bartonella henselae, confirmed by echocardiogram and plasma microbial cell-free DNA (mcf-DNA) testing. Initial antimicrobial treatment per standard guidelines was unsuccessful. Hence, second-line antimicrobials were commenced, to which he responded appropriately. His clinical course markedly improved, with recovery of neurological function within three weeks. He continued treatment of endocarditis and bartonellosis in an outpatient setting with significant clinical response until eventual cardiac surgery for valve replacement. Although the diagnosis and management of blood culture-negative IE can be very challenging and associated with morbidity, mcf-DNA testing has been shown to be helpful in establishing an accurate diagnosis and promoting appropriate antimicrobial management."
PubMed,aortic stenosis,Improvement in coronary microvascular dysfunction after transcatheter aortic valve implantation leading to positive fractional flow reserve and percutaneous coronary intervention: a case report.,Kosuke Fujita; Kyohei Onishi; Ayano Yoshida; Hiroki Matsuzoe; Gaku Nakazawa,10.1093/ehjcr/ytaf649,2026-01,European heart journal. Case reports,"The management of coronary artery disease in patients with severe aortic stenosis is controversial, with no consensus on optimal revascularization strategies. The validity of using fractional flow reserve to assess ischaemia in this population is debated. Conflicting results have arisen regarding the impact of transcatheter aortic valve implantation on fractional flow reserve values. We present the case of a patient with severe aortic stenosis and intermediate left anterior descending artery stenosis, in whom the fractional flow reserve and the index of microcirculatory resistance suggested the presence of coronary microvascular dysfunction prior to transcatheter aortic valve implantation. However, after valve replacement, the fractional flow reserve and the index of microcirculatory resistance indicated physiologically significant ischaemia, prompting intervention.
An 82-year-old woman presented with paradoxical low-flow, low-gradient severe aortic stenosis and intermediate left anterior descending artery stenosis. The fractional flow reserve was borderline, and the index of microcirculatory resistance was elevated before transcatheter aortic valve implantation, indicating the presence of coronary microvascular dysfunction. Six months after valve replacement, the fractional flow reserve declined to 0.64 with an improved index of microcirculatory resistance, prompting a successful percutaneous coronary intervention. Subsequent cardiac magnetic resonance imaging revealed reverse remodelling with a reduced left ventricular mass.
This case illustrates that transcatheter aortic valve implantation may unmask coronary ischaemia by restoring microvascular vasodilatory capacity in patients with coronary microvascular dysfunction. It also highlights the importance of reassessing coronary physiology in selected patients following transcatheter aortic valve implantation."
PubMed,aortic stenosis,Age-related geometric analysis of the extracranial artery for endovascular access planning.,Jung Soo Park; Hyun Goo Kang,10.21037/qims-2025-1369,2026-01-01,Quantitative imaging in medicine and surgery,"Age-related geometric remodeling of the extracranial carotid arteries significantly influences hemodynamics and endovascular accessibility, yet comprehensive data covering the entire supra-aortic route remain limited. The objective of this study was to investigate these age-related geometric changes from the aortic arch to the proximal internal carotid artery (ICA) using computed tomography angiography (CTA), and to assess their association with vascular aging.
This retrospective cross-sectional study included 485 patients who underwent CTA between January 2020 and December 2022. The participants were divided into two age groups: young (<60 years) and old (>70 years). Patients with carotid plaques or stenosis were excluded. Using semi-automated segmentation techniques, we analyzed geometric parameters, including vascular tortuosity, maximal diameter, cross-sectional area, and bifurcation angles from the aortic arch to the proximal ICA.
Out of the 485 participants, 257 (53%) were included in the old age group (mean age: 78.77±0.36 years). Vascular tortuosity from the common carotid artery (CCA) to the carotid artery bifurcation (CAB) was significantly higher in the old age group on both sides (right: 0.15±0.01 vs. 0.07±0.00; left: 0.14±0.01 vs. 0.06±0.00; P<0.001). The maximal diameters and cross-sectional areas of the common and internal carotid arteries also increased significantly with age CCA diameter (right: 7.49±1.05 vs. 7.25±1.05 mm; ICA cross-sectional area, right: 25.55±5.15 vs. 20.06±4.51 mm2; P<0.001). Furthermore, the CAB angle was markedly elevated bilaterally in older individuals (right: 33.52°±16.04° vs. 26.3°±15.86°; left: 35.94°±16.14° vs. 29.36°±13.97°; P<0.001).
Geometric changes in extracranial carotid arteries, including increased tortuosity, diameter, cross-sectional area, and bifurcation angle, are strongly associated with aging. These findings highlight the potential of CTA-based vascular geometry as a non-invasive imaging biomarker for assessing vascular aging and early structural remodeling."

The European Society of Cardiology/European Association for Cardio-Thoracic Surgery released their updated guidelines in 2025. Although there is broad alignment in principles of intervention, prosthesis choice, and the role of Heart Teams, the European document incorporates substantial new trial evidence. Key areas of divergence include thresholds for earlier intervention in aortic stenosis and regurgitation, expanded recommendations for transcatheter edge-to-edge repair and mitral replacement, formal integration of tricuspid repair and transcatheter therapies, evolving strategies for coronary assessment in transcatheter aortic valve implantation, and sex-specific considerations.

A 58-year-old man with chronic hepatitis B and cirrhosis, previously treated for rectosigmoid adenocarcinoma, presented with progressive abdominal fullness and markedly elevated AFP (315 KIU/L). Imaging showed multiple arterially enhancing hepatic lesions with washout, highly suggestive of HCC in a cirrhotic liver. Given the patient's history and risk factors, the initial diagnostic impression favored HCC. However, core biopsy of a liver lesion revealed poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma consistent with colorectal origin (CK20 positive, CK7 patchy positive, CDX2 negative). Surgical resection was contraindicated due to severe aortic stenosis and prior chemotherapy toxicity. The patient received palliative systemic therapy but developed hepatic decompensation and died of progressive disease. A literature review identified only a few reports of AFP-producing colorectal cancers, most presenting with advanced disease and poor outcomes, with cirrhotic background being exceptionally rare.
AFP-producing colorectal adenocarcinoma with liver metastases can masquerade as HCC, particularly in patients with underlying liver disease. This case underscores the need for histological confirmation of atypical hepatic lesions to avoid misdiagnosis. Awareness of this rare entity and careful clinical reasoning are crucial to guide appropriate management and highlight pitfalls in diagnostic practice."

However, its impact on periprocedural and procedural outcomes remains unclear.
The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of BSH on periprocedural and postprocedural outcomes in patients undergoing TAVR.
This study included patients with severe aortic stenosis (AS) who underwent TAVR using either balloon-expandable (BEVs) or self-expanding valves (SEVs). The primary endpoint was to compare periprocedural interventions and procedural outcomes. Secondary endpoints included subgroup analyses by device generation (new vs. old), valve type (BEVs vs. SEVs), severity of septal hypertrophy, and across study periods.
A total of 3261 TAVR patients were included: 1050 had a BSH ≥ 15 mm (HS+ group) and 2211 had a septal thickness < 15 mm (HS- group). Patients in the HS+ group had higher rates of post-dilatation (25% vs. 21%, p = 0.008), moderate or greater paravalvular leak (PVL) on angiography (2.4% vs. 0.8%, p < 0.001) and echocardiography (5% vs. 3.4%, p = 0.033), and permanent pacemaker (PPM) implantation (18% vs. 14%, p = 0.008). Conversely, HS- patients more often required valve repositioning and a second valve. In subgroup analyses stratified by device generation, the influence of BSH appeared broadly consistent across platforms. Additional Subgroup analysis showed particularly higher rates of post-dilatation, moderate or greater PVL, and PPM implantation in the SEV HS+ group, whereas mild septal thickening (12-15 mm) had no significant impact compared with marked hypertrophy (≥ 15 mm).
In this large cohort of TAVR patients, BSH (≥ 15 mm) was associated with higher rates of post-dilatation, PVL, and PPM implantation, particularly among those receiving SEVs, while mild septal thickening had no significant impact."

If treated with transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR), patients with the combined phenotype (AS-CA) have a similar survival at 1 year compared to those with lone AS. This study aims to evaluate the long-term outcomes of AS-CA compared to lone AS.
Using a prospective, multicenter, observational, case-control design, we studied patients with severe AS referred for TAVR. All underwent bone scintigraphy to differentiate between AS-CA and lone AS. Outcomes were compared between the two cohorts. Mortality (all-cause and cardiovascular [CV]) and hospitalization for heart failure (HHF) were captured as clinical endpoints for long-term outcome.
406 patients [84(80-88) years, 50 % female, EuroSCORE-II 4.2 (3.7-5.0)] were recruited, of which 47 (11.6 %) had AS-CA (all transthyretin). Over a follow-up of 5.4 (4.9-5.8) years, 244 (60.1 %) patients died. AS-CA was associated with higher all-cause mortality (crude HR 1.75, 95 % CI 1.24-2.46; log-rank, p = 0.001), which remained significant after multivariate adjustment for clinical confounders (EuroSCORE-II, valve replacement; adjusted HR 1.72, 95 % CI 1.22-2.42; p = 0.002). AS-CA was not associated with CV mortality (log-rank, p = 0.18) or time to first HHF (log-rank, p = 0.43), but the rate of HHF was significantly higher in AS-CA compared to lone AS (129 versus 65 per 1000 patient years, p = 0.022).
AS-CA is associated with an increased long-term risk of all-cause mortality and rate of hospitalization for heart failure compared to patients with AS. Further studies evaluating the role of CA-specific therapies are warranted in this population."

The authors sought to report early real-world experience with the Navitor valve (Abbott Structural Heart) from the STS/ACC TVT Registry (Society of Thoracic Surgeons/American College of Cardiology Transcatheter Valve Therapy Registry).
Baseline, procedural, and follow-up data were prospectively collected and retrospectively analyzed. The primary outcome was a composite of all-cause mortality or stroke at 30 days. Additional safety and effectiveness outcomes were reported per registry definitions.
A total of 2,958 aortic stenosis patients were treated between January 2023 and December 2024. Mean age was 81.4 ± 7.6 years; 62.4% were female. Mean STS score was 6.6% ± 5.4%. Technical success rate was 97.9%, with in-hospital mortality rate at 1.3%. Thirty-day all-cause mortality or stroke rate was 5.2% (2.8% mortality, 2.7% stroke). Major vascular complications and new permanent pacemaker implantation (PPI) occurred in 1.8% and 17.8%, respectively. At 30 days, mean transvalvular gradient was 7.3 ± 3.8 mm Hg; aortic valve area was 1.98 ± 0.64 cm2; moderate or greater PVL occurred in 1.8%. Analysis of case volume showed reduced PPI rate with site experience beyond 20 cases for Navitor Classic (19.4% vs 13.5%; P = 0.0039) and Vision (19.1% vs 10.6%; P = 0.047).

The contribution of MRAS variants to NS pathogenesis remains poorly characterized, and infective endocarditis (IE) is extremely rare in patients with NS.
A 22-year-old woman presented with typical dysmorphic features of NS, including short stature, broad forehead, hypertelorism, low-set posteriorly rotated ears, and a broad neck. She developed fever and progressive exertional dyspnea.
Echocardiography demonstrated obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy with vegetation located in the left ventricular outflow tract. Blood cultures grew Streptococcus mutans. Whole-exome sequencing identified a heterozygous MRAS c.203C>T (p.Thr68Ile) mutation affecting a highly conserved residue among RASopathy-associated GTPases, supporting the diagnosis of MRAS-associated Noonan syndrome complicated by infective endocarditis.
Antibiotic therapy was escalated to intravenous gentamicin (60 mg daily) combined with ceftriaxone in accordance with the 2023 European Society of Cardiology guidelines for infective endocarditis.
After one month of intravenous gentamicin and ceftriaxone therapy, fever resolved, and follow-up echocardiography showed disappearance of the vegetation. Residual cardiac abnormalities persisted, including marked left ventricular hypertrophy with left ventricular outflow tract obstruction, left atrial enlargement, moderate mitral regurgitation, patent foramen ovale with minor shunting, and impaired diastolic function. Exertional dyspnea remained despite resolution of the infection.
This case expands the genotypic spectrum of Noonan syndrome by supporting MRAS mutations as pathogenic drivers. It also identifies infective endocarditis as a previously unreported complication in MRAS-associated NS with outflow tract obstruction, highlighting the importance of careful cardiac surveillance in patients with RASopathies."

An 88-year-old female with a 40-year history of paroxysmal palpitations and chest tightness, with significant worsening of symptoms over the past 20 days. Despite undergoing AF ablation 5 years ago, her symptoms and arrhythmia burden persisted.
Long-standing (24 years) AF, severe AS, and a history of failed radiofrequency catheter ablation for AF.
The patient underwent left bundle branch pacing followed by AVNA.
During the 9-month follow-up period, her palpitations completely resolved, with no recorded atrial arrhythmias. The AF's impact on quality of life score significantly improved, and her performance on the 6-minute walk test markedly increased, indicating significant functional enhancement.
This case demonstrates that left bundle branch pacing combined with AVNA is clinically effective and technically feasible for AF patients in the elderly population with severe AS, particularly when conventional rhythm control methods fail. This approach offers an effective option for symptom relief and functional improvement in this challenging patient population."

Minimally invasive aortic valve replacement (MIAVR) has emerged as a potential way to combine the durability of surgery with reduced procedural trauma. This study aims to assess the safety and feasibility of MIAVR in elderly patients. Methods: A total of 990 patients were included in this retrospective cohort study. Among them, 261 (26%) were aged 70 years or older (elderly cohort), and 729 (74%) were younger than 70 years (younger cohort). All patients were followed for at least 30 days postoperatively, with survival data collected through May 2025. Multivariable logistic regression, linear regression, and Kaplan-Meier survival analyses were performed. Results: Elderly patients were more likely to be female (51% vs. 40%, p = 0.001) and carried a heavier burden of vascular and renal comorbidity: renal impairment 33% vs. 17% and extracardiac arteriopathy 45% vs. 30% (both p < 0.001). Major bleeding occurred more frequently in the elderly cohort (7.7% vs. 4.1%; p = 0.02), as did new permanent pacemaker implantation (10% vs. 5.8%; p = 0.021) and sepsis (3.4% vs. 1.1%; p = 0.012). Rates of stroke, perioperative myocardial infarction, ECMO/right-heart failure, re-thoracotomy, and postoperative dialysis were low and comparable across age groups (all p > 0.20). Overall, 30-day mortality was 2.4% (24/990), with crude mortality approximately threefold higher among patients aged ≥70 years (4.6% vs. 1.6%). Conclusions: Our findings indicate that MIAVR is a feasible and safe surgical option across age groups; Elevated morbidity in elderly patients is primarily due to bleeding, pacemaker implantation, and sepsis, while rates of stroke, renal failure, and myocardial infarction are low."

While the 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) is a common low-cost diagnostic test, its interpretation is limited by human variability. Through machine learning with large diverse ECG data sets and artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms, ECG analysis can be automated for pattern recognition with higher accuracy. AI-augmented ECG algorithms have been demonstrated to be able to detect myocardial infarction with high accuracy and reduce door-to-balloon coronary intervention times. Similar models can be utilized to detect subtle ECG waveforms suggestive of current or future asymptomatic left ventricular dysfunction, aortic stenosis, and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. Despite these promising results, there is concern for generalizability and bias or errors in training data. As AI systems evolve to multimodal integration, AI-augmented ECG has the potential to redefine cardiovascular diagnostics and enable earlier detection, risk stratification, and precision-guided interventions."

With a focus on the prevalent psychological complications following the onset of this condition, this study aimed to explore the correlation between antenatal depression and Corona disease anxiety, personality traits, and postpartum depression during the COVID-19 pandemic.                                                           Materials and Methods:                     This cross-sectional descriptive-analytical study investigated women receiving care at health centers affiliated with Kerman University of Medical Sciences during the last month of their pregnancy and the postpartum period in 2022. Following the acquisition of informed consent, participants were assessed using various measures, including demographic and obstetric information, the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale, the Corona Disease Anxiety Scale (CDAS), and the NEO Personality Inventory-Revised during their third trimester of pregnancy. The same group of participants completed the Edinburgh Depression Scale and the Corona Disease Anxiety Scale (CDAS) 4-6 weeks after childbirth.                                                           Results and Discussion:                     There was a significant correlation between family income, unwanted pregnancy as perceived by both the mother and father, and antenatal depression. Additionally, marital satisfaction played a significant role in postpartum depression. Furthermore, antenatal depression was significantly associated with neuroticism, agreeableness, and physical symptoms related to Corona disease anxiety. Personality traits, with the exception of extroversion and conscientiousness, and various domains of Corona disease anxiety, excluding psychological symptoms, were also significantly associated with postpartum depression.                                                           Conclusion:                     During pandemics or epidemics, such as the COVID-19 outbreak, experiencing mental distress during pregnancy can contribute to mental health issues during the postpartum period. This risk is particularly true in individuals with unique personality traits, emphasizing the need for increased focus on mental health within prenatal care during these crises."

Method:                     This cross-sectional study was conducted in Kerman, Iran. Data were collected from patients who visited Afzalipour Hospital in Kerman more than twice during the COVID-19 epidemic from the end of February 2020 to March 21, 2021. We conducted two key analyses: 1. Mixed effect logistic regression was used to check the relationship between the variables and COVID-19 severity. 2. Mixed effect linear regression was used to check the relationship between the variables and the length of stay in the hospital.                                                           Results:                     The findings indicated that the most important risk factors for the severity of COVID-19 were heart diseases (OR=1.67,95%CI:1.20-2.30), increasing age (OR=2.23 for age&gt;54, 95%CI:1.70- 2.90), male gender (OR=1.47,95%CI:1.10-1.96), respiratory diseases other than asthma, and frequency of admission (OR=1.60,95%CI:1.20-2.15). All patients who underwent readmission experienced a shorter duration of hospitalization during their subsequent admission (OR=0.94,95%CI:0.91,0.96) and had a higher mortality rate (30% within 14 days, 26.6% between 14-90 days). Patients readmitted at intervals of 14-90 days and greater than 90 days exhibited lower disease severity compared to those readmitted within the 0-14 day period.                                                           Conclusion:                     Examining readmissions, the severity of COVID-19, and the length of hospital stay in affected patients are important factors for planning and allocating resources for COVID-19 management and treatment. These factors can help policymakers develop effective clinical guidelines for hospitalization or outpatient treatment of COVID-19 patients and contribute to reducing the burden of disease in the community."

Kinovea, as an accessible motion-analysis software, provides both visual and quantitative feedback. However, its application in supporting technique development among beginner athletes remains insufficiently explored. Aim: This study aims to describe the use of Kinovea in biomechanics training and examine its contribution to the awareness of kinematic characteristics and movement techniques among beginner athletes. Methods: A descriptive qualitative design involved 72 beginner athletes aged 18–25 years selected through purposive sampling. Data were collected over 16 weeks through interviews, field observations, and motion video recordings analyzed using Kinovea. Kinematic data focused on joint angles, stride behavior, and movement phases during walking, running, and the flight phase. Qualitative data were analyzed using content analysis with NVivo 12, while kinematic results were interpreted descriptively to identify performance patterns and areas for technical refinement. Result: Kinematic analysis showed coordinated joint-angle patterns across all phases. Walking analysis identified arm swing angles of 50.9°–58.8° and leg separation angles of 64.3°–67.2°, indicating a stable gait rhythm. The running analysis revealed knee angles of 68.8°–69.8° and elbow angles of 87.6°–89.1°, indicating efficient propulsive mechanics. The flight phase demonstrated knee angles of 81.2°–87.8° and elbow angles of 80.4°–88.3°, suggesting effective momentum use and postural stability. These measurements supported stride-efficiency assessment and technique evaluation. Qualitative findings revealed that Kinovea enabled athletes to interpret movement phases and identify technical inefficiencies through slow-motion and frame-by-frame visualization. Conclusion: Kinovea supports basic motion analysis by providing clear kinematic information and helping beginner athletes observe and refine their movement techniques. The findings also offer practical value for coaches by enabling more precise identification of inefficient patterns and guiding targeted corrections during early-stage training."

Liu; Zhixiong Tan; Lu Kong; Xiaoqing Quan; Xiehui Chen,10.1097/md.0000000000047080,2026-01-09,Medicine,"Rationale: Dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) is a major cause of chronic heart failure, and some patients continue to deteriorate despite guideline-directed medical therapy. Immunoadsorption (IA), which removes pathogenic autoantibodies, has been proposed as a potential adjunctive therapy, but its clinical use remains limited. This case illustrates the potential benefits of IA in advanced, treatment-refractory DCM. Patient concerns: A 53-year-old woman with a 9-year history of DCM presented with recurrent chest tightness and dyspnea. Despite long-term guideline-directed medical therapy, her symptoms progressively worsened. Diagnoses: The patient had chronic DCM initially diagnosed in the peripartum period, with a left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) of 11% at onset. Before IA, echocardiography demonstrated severe systolic dysfunction (LVEF 22%–24%) with significant mitral regurgitation, and laboratory evaluation showed markedly elevated pro-BNP (4454 pg/mL). Interventions: The patient underwent two sessions of immunoadsorption in September 2024, followed by high-dose intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) as per standard protocols. Outcomes: Following treatment, her symptoms improved, pro-BNP decreased to 2109 pg/mL, and repeat echocardiography showed an increase in LVEF to 29.2%. Lessons: This case suggests that immunoadsorption may offer clinical benefit in patients with advanced, refractory DCM. While promising, IA remains experimental and requires further investigation in larger, controlled studies."
OpenAlex,mitral regurgitation,Effects of Levosimendan in Patients with Severe Mitral Insufficiency and Left Ventricular Dysfunction Undergoing Transcatheter Edge-to-Edge Repair: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis,Stephanie Gladys Kühne; Deborah Penet; Simon Wölbert; Eva Harmel; Damyan Penev; Sebastien Elvinger; Mauro Chiarito; Philip W. J. Raake; Dario Bongiovanni,10.3390/jcdd13010040,2026-01-09,Journal of Cardiovascular Development and Disease,"Severe mitral regurgitation (MR) is one of the most common valvular heart diseases and is frequently associated with advanced left ventricular (LV) systolic dysfunction. Transcatheter edge-to-edge repair (TEER) offers effective symptom relief but may induce abrupt hemodynamic changes leading to afterload mismatch and acute LV failure. Levosimendan may help mitigate this complication by improving contractility, yet evidence supporting its use in this setting is scarce. Therefore, the aim of this study was to systematically evaluate the evidence on the effects of Levosimendan in patients with severe MR and LV dysfunction undergoing TEER. We performed a comprehensive search of PubMed, Embase, Scopus, and Google Scholar. Primary outcomes were postprocedural LV ejection fraction (LVEF) and systolic pulmonary artery pressure (sPAP). Secondary outcomes included procedural success, procedure duration, and in-hospital complications. Five studies comprising 315 patients (n = 141 Levosimendan, n = 174 controls) met the inclusion criteria. Pooled analysis showed no significant difference in postprocedural LVEF between Levosimendan-treated patients and controls (mean difference 0.45%, 95% CI [−1.46–2.35] p = 0.65) and no significant change from baseline. Similarly, postprocedural sPAP did not differ significantly. Procedural success was higher with Levosimendan, and procedure duration was shorter. These hypothesis-generating findings highlight the need for larger, prospective randomized trials to clarify the role of Levosimendan in this setting."

Traditional management strategies follow a step-by-step approach, prioritizing guideline-directed medical therapy (GDMT) and reserving interventional (surgical or percutaneous) options only in case of persistent symptoms or worsening HF after GDMT. However, greater experience with the use of percutaneous procedures, even in high-risk patients, could support a more integrated approach, which exploits the synergistic effects of medical and interventional therapies to increase the tolerability of one vs the other, thereby improving quality of life and outcomes through their synergic effects. This expert opinion paper summarizes current data and evolving practices in the management of VHD in patients with HF, including secondary mitral regurgitation, aortic stenosis, aortic regurgitation, and tricuspid regurgitation."

Less is known about the operator volumes–outcomes association in the contemporary era. Objective To determine whether an operator-level volume-outcomes association exists for TAVR and MTEER in the contemporary era. Design, Setting, and Participants This cohort study examined data from patients undergoing TAVR or MTEER between January 2020 and December 2023 included in the Society of Thoracic Surgeons (STS)/American College of Cardiology (ACC) Transcatheter Valve Therapies (TVT) Registry, a national all-comers real-world registry. Consecutive patients undergoing TAVR for aortic stenosis or MTEER for mitral regurgitation were included. Data analysis was performed from October 2024 to December 2025. Exposure TAVR or MTEER. Main Outcomes and Measures The primary outcome measures were (1) 30-day all-cause mortality, (2) a 30-day composite outcome, and (3) in-hospital procedural complications following TAVR or MTEER. Data from the STS/ACC TVT Registry were analyzed for patients undergoing TAVR or MTEER between 2020 and 2023. The primary analysis assessed the association between operator volume and 30-day outcomes using a 2-level random-effects logistic regression model. The interaction between operator and hospital volumes and the association between TAVR and MTEER outcomes were also evaluated. Results A total of 358 943 patients underwent TAVR at 827 hospitals (7524 operators; median [IQR] annual volume, 24 [11-47]), and 51 407 patients underwent MTEER at 493 hospitals (2483 operators; median [IQR] annual volume, 12 [7-19]). For TAVR, median (IQR) patient age was 79.0 (73.0-85.0) years, and 152 186 patients (42.4%) were female; for MTEER, median (IQR) patient age was 79.0 (71.0-84.0) years, and 23 402 patients (45.5%) were female. Low-volume operators demonstrated inferior process of care measures compared with high-volume operators. In adjusted analyses, a higher risk of 30-day mortality (odds ratio [OR], 1.13; 95% CI, 1.02-1.26; P = .02) and in-hospital complications (OR, 1.09; 95% CI, 1.03-1.16; P = .005) was observed for low-volume TAVR operators (&amp;amp;lt;15/y) compared with high-volume operators (&amp;amp;gt;37/y). For MTEER, in-hospital complications (OR, 1.31; 95% CI, 1.11-1.56; P = .002) were higher for low-volume operators (&amp;amp;lt;8/y) compared with high-volume operators (&amp;amp;gt;16/y), while 30-day mortality was not different (OR, 1.16; 95% CI, 0.96-1.41; P = .12). Associations were consistent across hospital volume strata. Operator-level outcomes for TAVR and MTEER were not correlated. Conclusions and Relevance In this cohort study, results from a large, contemporary US registry demonstrate a persistent inverse association between operator volume and patient outcomes for both TAVR and MTEER. These findings may help inform future policies aimed at ensuring optimal outcomes."

We aimed to determine (i) whether baseline RRI predicts survival after mitral transcatheter edge-to-edge repair (M-TEER) and (ii) whether RRI changes in response to the procedure. Methods In this prospective, single-center cohort we enrolled consecutive patients with severe mitral regurgitation who underwent M-TEER between October 2020 and December 2021 (trial registration number 412/20, date of registration 02.09.2020). Baseline demographics, estimated laboratory parameters, comprehensive echocardiography, and Doppler-derived RRI were collected before and 3 months after intervention. The primary endpoint was all-cause mortality. Associations were analyzed with multivariable Cox regression. Renal endpoints were not systematically collected and were therefore not included as clinical outcome measures. Results Among 109 patients (53.2% women), the median baseline RRI was 0.71 (IQR 0.67–0.75) and showed no correlation with eGFR, left-ventricular ejection fraction, or echocardiographic measurements of mitral regurgitation at baseline. Higher RRI was associated with all-cause mortality, and in exploratory post hoc analyses an RRI cutoff &gt; 0.70 remained predictive independent of baseline renal function (HR 5.37, p 0.07). RRI improved significantly 3 months after M-TEER (0.67; IQR 0.63–0.70; p &lt; 0.001), particularly in patients with a post-procedural MR reduction of at least 1 grade. However, the change in RRI showed no correlation with mortality or changes in renal function. Conclusions A baseline RRI above 0.70 was independently associated with mortality following M–TEER, underscoring its potential prognostic relevance. The marked post-procedural decline in RRI, especially in patients with relevant MR improvement, suggests that RRI reflects hemodynamic rather than renal filtration changes. Given the limited sample size and number of events, these findings should be considered exploratory and hypothesis-generating, requiring validation in larger multicenter cohorts. Graphical Abstract"

The underlying cause was severe dynamic mitral regurgitation (MR) and secondary tricuspid regurgitation (TR). After successful extubation and weaning, the patient’s MR nearly resolved. Discharged in improved condition with guideline-directed medical therapy, the patient was soon readmitted for heart failure with pulmonary edema. The transthoracic echocardiogram confirmed recurrent, worsening MR.​ Transcatheter edge-to-edge repair was successfully performed, reducing the patient’s severe MR to trivial and resolving TR completely. At 1-year follow-up, the patient remained stable with improved cardiac function and no readmissions for cardiac causes."

We report a case of mitral valve replacement in a 76-year-old woman with a large caseous cavity, coronary artery disease, severe mitral valve stenosis and atrial fibrillation. Preoperative computed tomography showed a large caseous cavity (3 x 3.5 cm) in the posterior annulus extending into the atrioventricular groove. After unroofing and evacuation, the cavity was excluded with a pericardial patch. The lower edge of the patch was sutured to the ventricular side of the cavity; valve sutures passed through the residual posterior leaflet, the upper edge of the patch and the atrial edge of the cavity. The mitral prosthesis was then secured. The patient was weaned from cardiopulmonary bypass without complications. Intraoperative echocardiography demonstrated a well-seated mitral prosthesis with no valvular or paravalvular leaks. Postoperative imaging confirmed successful exclusion of the cavity in the atrioventricular groove. The postoperative echocardiogram revealed a mean gradient of 4 mmHg across the mitral prosthesis and no mitral regurgitation. Patch exclusion of the caseous cavity is a safe and feasible approach to support implanting a mitral prosthesis and obliterating a cavity."

Objectives: We aimed to study with an automatic three-dimensional transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) dedicated software patients with moderate and severe mitral regurgitation when compared to patients with no structural cardiac chamber alterations (patients with patent foramen ovale (PFO) who underwent TEE) . Methods: We employed a TEE software dedicated to automatic analysis of 34 parameters of the mitral valve apparatus comparing MVP patients with moderate and severe mitral regurgitation and patients with PFO without cardiac chamber structural alterations. Mitral valve effective regurgitant orifice (ERO) and regurgitant volume were correlated to automatic MVP parameters. Results: 59 MVP patients and 43 PFO patients were analysed. All MVP patients presented P2 mitral valve prolapse, 15 (25.4 % ) with both posterior and anterior prolapse. Twenty-seven automatic parameters (79%) were different concerning MVP and PFO patients (p&amp;lt; 0.05): diameters, area, perimeter, height, angle, coaptation width, lenght, closure line lenght, annulus. ERO was 0.43 + 0.11 cm2 , and regurgitant volume: 62.2 + 14.9 ml/beat. Automatic analysis correlated to 75 percentile ERO MVP patients (ERO&amp;gt; 0.48 cm2): Posterior Leafltet Area (r:0.74, p:0.031); Posterior Leafltet Lenght (r:0.73, p:0.032); Tenting area (r:0,41, p:0.048). Conclusions: Automatic mitral valve parameters analysis were different concerning MVP and no structural cardiac chamber (PFO) patients. 75 percentile ERO MVP patients (ERO&amp;gt; 0.48 cm2) correlated to posterior leaflet parameters.This anatomic information could be useful to planning and surgical treatment of mitral valve prolapse patients."

Yaffee,10.1093/ejcts/ezag016,2026-01-06,European Journal of Cardio-Thoracic Surgery,"Abstract OBJECTIVES Severe mitral annular calcification (MAC) carries an increased risk of perioperative complications in patients undergoing mitral valve surgery and may be considered a prohibitive surgical risk. Cavitron ultrasonic surgical aspiration (CUSA) has been reported as a method for controlled debridement of severe MAC during mitral valve surgery, however experience in the literature is limited. METHODS We assessed 30-day and intermediate-term outcomes in 67 consecutive patients (mean age: 72 (SD 9) years; female sex: 65.7% (44/67)) with severe MAC who underwent mitral valve repair or replacement for mitral stenosis and/or regurgitation using CUSA between 3/2021 and 12/2024. Operations included isolated mitral valve replacement (41.8% (28/67)), isolated mitral valve repair (4.5% (3/67)), mitral and aortic valve replacement (37.3% (25/67), mitral valve replacement with coronary bypass (6.0% (4/67)), and mitral and aortic valve replacement with coronary bypass (10.4% (7/67)). Intermediate survival was estimated using the Kaplan–Meier method. RESULTS Mortality rate was 6.0% (4/67), stroke was 3.0% (2/67), and new postoperative atrial fibrillation was 29.0% (20/67). There were no atrioventricular groove ruptures. At a median echocardiographic follow-up time of 361 days (IQR 112, 671) moderate paravalvular leak occurred in 3.0% (1/67). Mid-term all-cause mortality was 9.0% at a mean follow-up time of 42.5 (95% CI 39.0, 46.0) months. CONCLUSIONS The use of CUSA to debride severe mitral annular calcification in patients undergoing mitral valve surgery is associated with acceptable short-term morbidity and mortality and durable intermediate-term results. This technique allows surgical intervention in patients who may otherwise be deemed prohibitive surgical risk."
OpenAlex,mitral regurgitation,Comparative study of transcatheter aortic valve implantation versus conventional surgical aortic valve replacement in the treatment of severe aortic stenosis with reverse ventricular remodeling,Haoyan Li; Sumin Yang; Wenlong Yan; Xiaodong Chen; Xun Chi,10.3389/fcvm.2025.1712400,2026-01-06,Frontiers in Cardiovascular Medicine,"Introduction This study aimed to compare echocardiographic outcomes and analyze the changes in ventricular remodeling at different time points after surgery in patients with severe aortic stenosis (AS) undergoing either surgical aortic valve replacement (SAVR) or transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR). Methods This retrospective study consecutively enrolled 175 patients with severe AS who underwent either SAVR or TAVR. Transthoracic echocardiograms obtained at baseline, 30 days, and 1 year after the procedure were analyzed by multiple echocardiographers at our institution. Results At baseline, the TAVR group was significantly older (74 ± 7 years vs. 62 ± 9 years, p &amp;lt; 0.001) and had a higher prevalence of hypertension (53.5% vs. 31.0%, p = 0.003), coronary artery disease (38.4% vs. 23.0%, p = 0.028), and atrial fibrillation (16.3% vs. 2.3%, p = 0.002). Additionally, the TAVR cohort demonstrated significantly worse cardiac functional status ( p &amp;lt; 0.001). Compared to TAVR patients, SAVR patients ( N = 87) exhibited a more pronounced reduction in left ventricular end-systolic dimension (−0.5 ± 0.65 cm vs. −0.2 ± 0.47 cm, p &amp;lt; 0.001) and left ventricular end-diastolic dimension (−0.6 ± 0.64 cm vs. −0.3 ± 0.55 cm, p &amp;lt; 0.001) at the 1-month follow-up. A decrease in left ventricular mass was observed in both groups from baseline to 1 month postoperatively, with the SAVR group showing a significantly greater reduction (LV mass: −67.3 ± 59.31 g vs. −38.2 ± 46.49 g, p = 0.003; LVMI: −39.1 ± 33.93 g/m 2 vs. −22.5 ± 27.08 g/m 2 , p = 0.005). However, these differences were not sustained at the 1-year follow-up. SAVR patients experienced a transient decline in right ventricular function at 1 month, which recovered by 1 year postoperatively. At the 1-year follow-up, the TAVR group experienced a higher incidence of Major Adverse Cardiac Events (MACE) ( p = 0.01), despite showing significant improvement in the severity of both mitral and tricuspid regurgitation compared to baseline ( p &amp;lt; 0.001). Although pulmonary artery pressure improved in both groups after AVR, the SAVR group demonstrated significantly lower pressure at 1 year ( p &amp;lt; 0.001). Conclusion In patients with severe aortic stenosis, SAVR was associated with more significant regression of left ventricular dimensions and mass at 1 month compared to TAVR, alongside a transient impairment of right ventricular function. By 1 year postoperatively, however, no significant differences in ventricular remodeling were observed between the two groups."

While her preoperative transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) did not reveal a discrete mass, it showed a mean mitral gradient of 7 mmHg; intraoperative transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) identified a 2 cm × 1.2 cm thrombus on the bioprosthetic MV. Given these findings, the surgical team decided to replace the mitral valve concurrently with LVAD implantation. Although this approach is not routine, the goal was to improve her quality of life and reduce postoperative complications. Post-procedure TEE showed an improved MV mean gradient of 3 mmHg with no evidence of paravalvular leak. The patient was subsequently discharged home in stable condition without any thromboembolic events. This case highlights the challenges of managing complex valvular pathology in patients undergoing LVAD placement."
OpenAlex,mitral regurgitation,Study of the energy efficiency of various drive systems of an innovative implantable left ventricular assist device,Ryszard Jasiński; K.

One of the advantages of the proposed LVAD is in cases where end-stage left ventricular failure is accompanied by mitral valve regurgitation and pulmonary hypertension. Another advantage is minimally invasive implantation with minimal thoracic trauma, without disrupting the breathing process, which shortens the length of hospital stay. The best drive system for converting the rotary motion of the servo motor into reciprocating motion of the piston of the suction-discharge device was chosen. Two types of drive were considered, namely a yoke mechanism and a crank mechanism that were evaluated in terms of energy efficiency of the entire device. One of the most important conclusions is that both mechanisms have comparable operating parameters for balloon inflation and similar electrical energy consumption which amounts to comparable operating times for these mechanisms. However, the energy consumption of the yoke mechanism is slightly higher. At the same time the pressure in the left ventricle and aorta is slightly lower in comparison with a yoke mechanism. Furthermore, the results of the study also showed that the balloon pressures were significantly higher with crank drive, which may cause the balloons to wear out more quickly. The mass flow rates generated by both drives are similar with a slight advantage for the yoke mechanism. Finally, typical aortic, atrial and left ventricular pressure plots during the cardiac cycle are also shown."

OpenAlex,mitral regurgitation,NF1 with Multiple Cardiac Structural Abnormalities Leading to Cerebral Infarction,J. Ye; Yiyi Jiang; Hanmin Wang; Dan Wang,10.3390/diagnostics16010163,2026-01-04,Diagnostics,"Background/Objectives: Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is an autosomal dominant disorder driven by mutations in the NF1 gene, whose pathogenesis centers on the loss of neurofibromin function and subsequent hyperactivation of the RAS/MAPK pathway. Notably, to the best of our knowledge and following a systematic literature search conducted by our research team, no cases of NF1 complicated by severe cardiac structural abnormalities that ultimately lead to cerebral infarction have been reported to date. Thus, it is of paramount importance to avoid missed diagnosis by performing comprehensive cardiac-related examinations in patients with NF1. Case Presentation: A 20-year-old male patient diagnosed with NF1 presented with right-sided limb weakness and was initially identified with cerebral infarction. To clarify the underlying etiology, a comprehensive clinical evaluation was performed, including cardiac imaging assessments (to characterize cardiac structural changes) and whole-exome sequencing (to identify the presence of procoagulant gene mutations). Comprehensive evaluation revealed a spectrum of cardiac structural abnormalities in the patient: aortic valve prolapse with severe regurgitation, non-infective vegetations on the aortic valve leaflets, mild-to-moderate mitral regurgitation, left ventricular hypertrophy and dilation, and left atrial dilation. Whole-exome sequencing detected exclusively a pathogenic variant in the NF1 gene, with no other pathogenic/likely pathogenic variants or thrombophilia-associated polymorphisms being found. Laboratory investigations ruled out infectious etiologies, supporting the notion that NF1-mediated cardiac structural and developmental anomalies are the primary driver of cardiac vegetation formation, given the absence of other identified contributing factors; embolization of one such vegetation ultimately led to both splenic and cerebral infarction. Conclusions: This case emphasizes the necessity of implementing early and proactive cardiac evaluations in patients with NF1. Additionally, for NF1 individuals—particularly those presenting with suggestive vascular or cardiac symptoms—a comprehensive multifactorial assessment of thrombotic risk is critical. Collectively, maintaining clinical vigilance for cardiac abnormalities in NF1 patients and avoiding diagnostic oversight is essential to reduce life-threatening risks."

We present a case where an apico-aortic conduit offered a safer alternative. Case presentation A 20-year-old woman with Type IIIc GD (homozygous D409H mutation) presented with New York Heart Association (NYHA) Class III dyspnoea, palpitations, and syncope. She had hypertension, hypothyroidism, and a sibling deceased from the same condition. On enzyme replacement therapy for 6 years, she was found to have severe calcification of the aortic valve, root, and ascending aorta, stenosis of arch vessels, grade II aortic regurgitation, mild mitral stenosis, and proximal left anterior descending artery stenosis. Intraoperatively, extensive calcification precluded root and arch reconstruction. A left ventricular apex–descending thoracic aorta conduit with a mechanical valve was constructed, combined with coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) to the left anterior descending artery and an innominate artery bypass. Recovery was uneventful, and follow-up at 13 months showed the patient in NYHA Class I with patent conduit and grafts. Conclusions An apico–aortic conduit can provide a safe and effective solution in GD with porcelain aorta, avoiding high-risk aortic manipulation. To our knowledge, this is the first reported use of a valved conduit in Gaucher-related calcification, broadening surgical options for this complex patient group."

OpenAlex,deep learning,A Novel Deep-Learning-Based Approach for Estimating High-Resolution InSAR Parameters,"Dell Amore, Luca; Carcereri, Daniel; Demir, Begüm; Rizzoli, Paola",,2026-06-01,elib (German Aerospace Center),"Nowadays, SAR Interferometry (InSAR) represents one of the most powerful tools to perform complex tasks, such as retrieving Earth’s surface topography and monitoring its deformations. However, denoising strategies are crucial for the generation of reliable and high-quality InSAR products. In this framework, we propose a complete and generalized theoretical and statistical model to physically describe and simulate a noise-free interferogram, together with its corresponding noisy version, starting from the knowledge of the InSAR acquisition geometry and of the underlying topography. A deep-learning-based model is then trained in a fully-supervised manner to estimate high-resolution InSAR parameters, i.e. coherence and interferometric phase, leveraging the proposed statistical model. In particular, an accurate assessment of the network’s estimation performance is conducted by comparing it to state-of-the-art denoising filters, such as Boxcar and Phi-Net and showing the added value of the proposed theoretical modifications to the state-of-the-art literature."
OpenAlex,deep learning,Assessing knowledge in policing,Tom Cockcroft; Jennifer Norman; Clare Rawdin,,2026-05-05,CLOK (University of Central Lancashire),"Assessment is one important component of effective learning design. The process of assessment can be explained as starting with an understanding of what a learner needs to know or be able to do by the end of the learning experience, what they have to do to achieve this and what method is best applied to ascertain if the learner has reached the required level (Cockcroft, 2023). Without assessment, educators and trainers would have limited awareness of the extent to which (if at all) they are cultivating learners’ knowledge, attitudes and skills, both as the learning proceeds (formative assessment) and at the end of learning (summative assessment). Traditionally, much police learning and associated assessment has been in-house / work-based. It has been delivered within local Learning and Development units, typically by former police officers (Stanko & Hohl, 2018) with portfolios predominantly used as the mode of assessment for practitioners. The embedding of a professionalisation agenda over the last decade, however, has led to a renewed focus on assessment for officers who have joined through the graduate entry routes (formally known as the Policing Education Qualifications Framework, PEQF; see Wood, 2018), and continue to join through the Police Constable Entry Pathways (PCEP). Framed by recent trends within police learning and specifically developments in the field of rape investigation, the aim of this chapter is twofold. Firstly, there is a focus on what the Soteria ‘deep dives’ revealed about the process of assessment. In this chapter the focus is focused on the the role of assessment within the portfolio-based Serious Sexual Assault Investigator’s Development Programme (SSAIDP). Secondly, an examination of what ‘best practice assessment’ might look like in the Rape and Serious Sexual Offending (RASSO) context"

OpenAlex,deep learning,A Deep Learning Based Code Loop Discriminator for GPS Spoofing Mitigation,S. Tohidi; M. R. Mosavi,,2026-03-01,DOAJ (DOAJ: Directory of Open Access Journals),"A vital part of people's daily life is the position, navigation, and time service provided by the Global Positioning System (GPS), which is always accessible globally. Consequently, the security of the GPS receivers is crucial. Occasionally, intentional and unintentional interferences cause GPS location issues. Spoofing attack is the most severe interference to the GPS receivers, which results in positional mistakes. This paper's goal is to defend against the carry-off spoofing attacks. In a carry-off spoofing attempt, the spoofer transmits signals whose code phase and carrier frequency parameters are strikingly close to the actual signal in order to change the correlation values generated in the tracking stage. Discriminator output values alter as correlation values change. As a result, the Pseudo Random Noise (PRN) code generator unit creates a local replica, which forces the tracking loop to follow the fake signal instead of the real one. It is proposed in this paper that when spoofing attacks occur, discriminator output values be generated independently of correlation values. Specifically, when a spoofing signal is detected, the conventional discriminator is replaced by a Non-linear Autoregressive Exogenous Neural Network (NARX NN)-based predictor. This strategy protects the tracking loop from the effects of the spoofing signal. The efficiency of the provided strategy was evaluated using three spoofing data sets. The results of the suggested mitigation method, based on NARAX NN, show that it mitigates spoofing attacks by an average of 95.82%."

This study explores the emotional anatomy of fake news by re-annotating the widely used LIAR dataset, creating the Emotion-Labelled Fake News Dataset (ELFND). By leveraging advanced NLP methods, with a focus on VADER sentiment analysis, the dataset categorizes news articles according to emotions tone conveyed. Ensemble machine learning models, Random Forest and Gradient Boosting are employed to detect fake news by analyzing its emotional content. Furthermore, AI explainability methods, including LIME and SHAP, are utilized to offer a deeper understanding of how the model generates predictions, shedding light on how specific emotions contribute to the classification of news as fake. The findings reveal that emotions are crucial in the structure of fake news, and the use of XAI enhances transparency in misinformation detection, offering a clearer understanding of the emotional drivers behind fake news."

However, stable multi-particle levitation remains challenging due to complex acoustic dynamics and limitations of existing models. We introduce AcoustoReinforce, a reinforcement learning-based path planner that autonomously controls the motion of multiple levitated particles. Leveraging a decentralized architecture, it learns local neural policies that generate particle trajectories independently, enabling scalable, communication-free control even in densely populated acoustic fields. To ensure physical feasibility, acoustic trapping strength is incorporated as a constraint during both training and inference, producing trajectories that are collision-free, acoustically stable, and physically realizable within real-world system constraints. Experiments on a realworld levitation platform show that AcoustoReinforce outperforms state-of-the-art planners, improving task success rates by up to 130% across diverse configurations. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of learning-based decentralized control for complex multi-object acoustophoresis in real environments."

This thesis advances qualify as-you-build manufacturing by developing high-fidelity, data-driven surrogate models that transform in-process monitoring data into real-time predictions of sub-surface pores and surface dimensional errors. A co-axial optical monitoring system comprising a photodiode and an NIR camera captured the laser-powder interaction, with X-ray computed tomography providing ground-truth labels. For binary pore detection, a hybrid CNN-LSTM model that incorporated inter-hatch and inter-layer remelting effects achieved an area under the Receiver Operating Characteristic curve (AUROC) of 0.91 for pores exceeding 8000 µm3. To predict keyhole pore, physics-informed melt pool features integrated into a Random Forest model (AUROC = 0.95) outperformed deep learning benchmarks, delivering superior accuracy at substantially lower computational cost. In lack-of-fusion porosity regression, the CNN-LSTM surrogate model achieved high accuracy in within-scenario predictions (RMSE = 2.1 %). Domain adversarial transfer learning enhanced cross-scenario performance by up to 35 %, highlighting the potential of the surrogate model to generalize across part positions and process parameters. The hyperparameter associated with inter-layer remelting was further validated against the ratio of melt pool depth to layer thickness, ensuring alignment with process physics. Surface geometric deviation prediction was advanced through a CNN-Transformer architecture that correlates melt pool signatures with CAD referenced 3D voxel volumes, achieving RMSE values of 6.1 µm (up-skin) and 27.4 µm (down-skin). Model interpretability was provided through Grad-CAM visualizations and Transformer attention maps, highlighting critical spatial regions and temporal dependencies governing defect formation. Collectively, these contributions support the vision of first-time-right manufacturing in PBF-LB/M. By strengthening defect localization, improving predictive fidelity, and enhancing generalization, this thesis lays the foundation for digital product passports, feedback-loop control, and broader industrial adoption of in-situ quality assurance."
