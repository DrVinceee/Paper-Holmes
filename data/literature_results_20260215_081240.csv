We performed a single-centre retrospective analysis of all patients who underwent surgery for SVAS between August 1974 and January 2025. The outcomes were analysed using survival and competing risk analysis, and risk factors were identified using Cox regression models.
A total of 75 patients were identified, 26 (35%) profited from the McGoon technique, 33 (44%) patients received a Doty repair, and 16 (21%) underwent Brom repair. Williams-Beuren syndrome was associated with 45 (60%) patients. Associated anomalies included pulmonary stenosis in 40 (53%) patients, aortic coarctation in 24 (32%), and abnormal coronary arteries in 14 (19%). Transplant-free survival at 15 years was 92%, and no difference was found between surgical techniques (P = .339). Abnormal coronary arteries were a risk factor for major adverse cardiac events (odds ratio 8.666, P = .011) and mortality (hazard ratio [HR] 4.285, P = .030). Cumulative incidence of reoperation at 15 years was 18%, with no difference between surgical techniques (P = .299). However, patients with pulmonary stenosis (HR 3.450, P = .020) had a higher risk of reoperation.
Survival after surgical repair of SVAS is over 90% at 15 years regardless of the surgical technique. Abnormal coronary arteries are responsible for higher operative mortality. Concomitant pulmonary artery stenosis is at a higher risk of reoperation, suggesting more severe arterial disease."

Methods: A total of 70 patients who underwent CMR examinations were enrolled from the UK Biobank database as the training set. A four-dimensional mesh model of the cardiac left and right ventricles was constructed using CMR images that passed quality control. Additionally, a validation set consisting of 30 patients who underwent CMR examinations at the First Medical Center of the Chinese People's Liberation Army General Hospital from March 2021 to October 2024 were included. These patients were classified into three groups based on clinical diagnosis: dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) group, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) group, and control group (no cardiomyopathy). The trained model was applied to analyze the CMR images of the validation set patients, calculating various cardiac structure and function parameters, including left ventricular volume index, left ventricular ejection fraction, left myocardial mass index, and strain. Differences in these parameters between the DCM or HCM groups and the control group were compared, and linear mixed models were used for statistical analysis of inter-group differences. Results: The age of patients in the training set was (62.2±10.3) years, with 58 (83%) males. The age of patients in the validation set was (56.5±13.9) years, with 21 (70%) males, including 8 patients in the HCM group, 9 in the DCM group, and 13 in the control group. The left ventricular ejection fraction in the DCM group was lower than that in the control group ((39.34±3.73) % vs. (53.56±2.98) %, P=0.006 3). The linear mixed model analysis showed that the left ventricular volume index and various strain parameters in the DCM group were significantly higher than those in the control group (all P<0.001). The left myocardial mass index in the HCM group was higher than that in the control group ((94.21±9.10) g/m² vs. (56.36±11.33) g/m², P<0.001). The analysis results of the linear mixed model were consistent with it (P<0.001). Conclusions: The preliminary results confirm that the four-dimensional cardiac mesh model based on CMR imaging constructed in this study could integrate and evaluate multiple parameters of cardiac structure and function in patients with cardiomyopathy. It has the potential to become an intelligent imaging diagnostic tool for cardiac diseases."
PubMed,aortic stenosis,Impact of syncope history on long-term physical activity in patients ≥2 years after transcatheter aortic valve replacement: a single-centre cross-sectional study in China.,Zhiyun Shen; Ziyan Zhu; Chenxu Huang; Daxin Zhou; Jiaying Lv; Ying Lin; Yuxia Zhang,10.1136/bmjopen-2024-094395,2026-02-12,BMJ open,"To explore long-term physical activity (PA) among patients 2 years post-transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) and assess the impact of syncope history on post-TAVR activity.
This was a cross-sectional study conducted using an on-site questionnaire.
In this cross-sectional study, we used convenience sampling to recruit participants from the outpatient department at a tertiary hospital in Shanghai, China, between July 2023 and December 2023.
Patients who had undergone TAVR for 2 years or more were included in the study.
The self-reported PA levels were assessed using the validated Chinese version of the International Physical Activity Questionnaire-Short Form. Additionally, medical records of the patients were thoroughly reviewed to accurately document the history of syncope for everyone.
Via convenience sampling, we recruited 179 consecutive participants aged 60 years and older who underwent TAVR. Only 36.31% (65/179) of patients remained physically active ≥2 years post-TAVR, with 27.37% having a syncope history. After adjusting for potential confounders, a history of syncope was independently associated with significantly lower levels of long-term PA (adjusted OR 0.287, 95% CI 0.122 to 0.675). This negative association was particularly pronounced among men and individuals with a normal body mass index (BMI).
A history of syncope is a strong independent predictor of reduced PA in the long term after TAVR. These findings highlight that patients with a history of syncope, especially men and those with normal BMI, represent a high-risk subgroup warranting particular attention in post-TAVR care. Targeted assessment and rehabilitation strategies should be considered for this population, and further research is needed to elucidate the underlying mechanisms."

We performed a retrospective observational cohort study at a single center from 2019 to 2022, including 180 patients (TAVR: n=65; SAVR: n=115). TAVR patients were older and had higher surgical risk. The total cost of TAVR was significantly higher than SAVR (INT$ 40,776.9 vs. INT$ 12,393.7, p <0.001), primarily driven by the prosthetic valve cost. However, TAVR was associated with a shorter post-procedural length of stay (5 days vs. 7 days, p <0.001) and lower absolute 1-year mortality rates (3.1% vs. 6.1%), although this difference did not reach statistical significance (p=0.60). Most TAVR cases were accessed through litigation due to the lack of formal incorporation in the public system during the study period, which contributed to higher baseline frailty. In conclusion, while TAVR remains more expensive due to device costs, it offers clinical advantages in high-risk populations within a developing healthcare system."

This study aims to explore the hemodynamic factors associated with eventual iliac branch occlusion after EVAR for abdominal aortic aneurysm.MethodsSix patients with different causes of iliac branch occlusion were selected between January 2013 and December 2023, and computed tomography angiography (CTA) images were acquired at the time of preoperative and postoperative occlusion of EVAR. Specific CTA images were applied for modeling and computational fluid dynamics (CFD) analysis was implemented.ResultsPressure, velocity, wall shear stress (WSS), time-averaged wall shear stress (TAWSS), oscillatory Shear Index (OSI), and relative residence time (RRT) were calculated. Velocity, WSS, and TAWSS were elevated at the stenosis, and pressure, OSI, and RRT were decreased at the stenosis. Streamlines were reduced at stenotic sites. Iliac branch locations that eventually occluded had more disturbed flow compared to non-occluded sites. Both pressure and flow velocity gradient variations are greater on the occluded side than on the non-occluded side.ConclusionsComputational fluid hemodynamic analysis identified consistent flow disturbances associated with eventual iliac limb occlusion following EVAR. These findings suggest that CFD-based hemodynamic assessment may help stratify patients at risk of iliac branch occlusion before clinical manifestation."

The clinical course of conduction disturbances after PMI, based on the type of TAVI valve, remains unclear. Therefore, the present study aimed to evaluate the effects of different types of TAVI valves on the clinical course of conduction disturbances.
In total, 480 patients, including 230 with self-expandable (SE) valves and 250 with balloon-expandable (BE) valves, who underwent TAVI between January 2016 and December 2024, were enrolled in this study. The characteristics of patients who required PMI and the changes in the ventricular pacing ratio were compared.
There was no significant difference in PMI factors depending on the type of valve. Computed tomography (CT) images showed that the length of the membranous septum (MS) in the PMI group did not differ from the length of the MS in the non-PMI group. There was a significant difference in improvement in autologous AV conduction between the SE and BE groups at PMI time (SE group vs. BE group; 11/15 [66.7%] vs. 3/11 [27.3%], p = 0.047). At 1 month follow-up, the SE group improved significantly compared to the BE group (SE vs. BE; 14/15 [93.3%] vs. 4/11 [33.3%], p = 0.002).
Restoration of autologous AV conduction and subsequent decrease in ventricular pacing ratio were more likely in the SE group and less variable in the BE group. This result indicates that PM dependency can be reduced by using an extended AVD setting or AVH."

Our study evaluated 5-year outcomes in patients after minimally invasive surgery for aortic valve replacement (AVR) compared with FS access.
We conducted a single-center registry data analysis of AV patients who underwent only elective, isolated AVR compared to MS, and FS hospitalized between 2014 and 2024 in the Cardiac Surgery Department at the Medical University of Silesia. Redo, emergency, salvage and concomitant procedures were excluded. The 5-year survival data were verified in the National Health Fund. Propensity score matching (PSM) was conducted to determine FS controls for the MS group in a 1 : 1 ratio with a 0.1 SD caliper.
The study group included 1289 elective patients (73 MS, and 1216 FS). All operative and postoperative data before and after PSM are presented in tables. PSM resulted in 65 MS cases and 65 FS controls. The 5-year survival did not differ between groups, either before PSM (HR = 0.92, 95% CI [0.34-2.5]; p = 0.6) or after PSM (HR = 0.79, 95% CI [0.25-2.5]; p = 0.480). After matching, differences were found only in cardiopulmonary bypass time in MS vs. FS (73 [IQR: 61-88] vs. 63 [IQR: 53-77]; p = 0.034) and higher requirement for norepinephrine support (90.8% vs. 61.5%; p < 0.001).
Our study demonstrates that minimally invasive aortic valve replacement offers comparable 5-year outcomes. The results suggest that the less invasive alternative should be the first choice option for patients with aortic valve diseases."

Current AI-enabled tools rely on murmur detection as a proxy for VHD but lack sensitivity for common subtypes like mitral regurgitation and are limited by small datasets. This study presents a novel neural network that directly predicts clinically significant VHD from stethoscope recordings, trained using echocardiographic targets rather than heart murmur labels. A diverse dataset of 1767 patients across UK primary care and hospital settings was developed, combining stethoscope recordings with echocardiographic labels. The trained recurrent neural network achieved an AUROC of 0.83, outperforming general practitioners and demonstrating exceptional sensitivity for severe aortic stenosis (98%) and severe mitral regurgitation (94%). This algorithm shows promise as a scalable, low-cost screening tool, enabling earlier diagnosis and timely referral for intervention.

Lipoprotein(a) possesses increased atherogenicity, contributing to residual cardiovascular risk. Elevated Lp(a) levels affect a substantial proportion of the population, rendering this a potentially high-impact therapeutic target, but currently available lipid-lowering agents and lifestyle interventions have minimal impact on lowering Lp(a), and lipoprotein apheresis is the sole effective-but impractical-method to significantly reduce Lp(a). Recent advances in Lp(a)-targeted therapies, notably nucleic acid-based approaches (e.g. antisense oligonucleotides and small interfering RNAs) and a small molecule inhibitor of Lp(a) synthesis, demonstrated substantial and often durable Lp(a)-lowering effects in Phase II trials. Phase III trials of these agents are now underway to examine the impact of lowering Lp(a) levels on atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease outcomes, and their results may transform the landscape of cardiovascular risk reduction and management for patients with elevated Lp(a). This review summarizes existing lipid-lowering therapies' limited effects on Lp(a), provides an update on the array of emerging therapeutics and their safety and efficacy, and discusses ongoing Phase III trials as well as other potential benefits of Lp(a)-lowering, such as slowing progression of calcific aortic valve stenosis."

Cardiovascular computed tomography (CT) has become essential for diagnosing BAV, planning procedures, and evaluating patients after treatment. This is largely due to CT's high spatial resolution and its ability to perform volume imaging effectively. This review provides an up-to-date overview of the increasing role of cardiovascular CT in the management of bicuspid aortic valve (BAV). It covers various aspects, including BAV morphology, optimal sizing for transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR), and post-procedural monitoring. We highlight significant innovations, such as supra-annular sizing techniques and artificial intelligence (AI)-guided analysis, that position CT at the nexus of anatomy, function, and targeted treatment. Additionally, we address controversies concerning inconsistencies in sizing algorithms, recent classification challenges, and radiation exposure. Future development areas include AI predictive tools, radiomic phenotyping, and CT-guided precision medicine. This synthesis aims to provide clinicians and researchers with a high-level guide to the clinical integration of cardiovascular CT and its future in the BAV population. This review provides the most current, comprehensive synthesis on the pivotal role of cardiovascular CT in BAV management, offering a roadmap for integrating advanced imaging into clinical practice and guiding future research priorities."

However, there are no clear evidence-based guidelines defining optimal heparin dosing or target activated clotting time (ACT) values. This study aimed to evaluate the association between intraprocedural UFH dosing, ACT values, and peri-procedural stroke risk in the overall population of patients undergoing TAVR, with a prespecified stratified analysis according to body mass index (BMI ≥ 30 vs. <30 kg/m2). Methods: This analysis enrolled consecutive individuals with severe aortic stenosis (AS) who were treated with TAVR using either balloon-expandable or self-expanding valves. The primary outcome was the occurrence of stroke during the periprocedural period in the overall population and according to BMI (<30 vs. ≥30 kg/m2). Secondary endpoints included periprocedural parameters, clinical outcomes (in-hospital and 1-year mortality), and safety outcomes. Subgroup analysis was performed to assess stroke risk according to ACT values. Patients with atrial fibrillation or receiving chronic oral anticoagulation were excluded. Results: A total of 1045 patients underwent TAVR between 2022 and 2024, including 827 with BMI < 30 and 218 with BMI ≥ 30. The study population had a mean age of 82 ± 6 years, and 56% of patients were male. In the overall study population, the mean heparin dose was 47 U/kg and the mean ACT value was 218 s. Patients with lower BMI received higher heparin doses (50 vs. 40 U/kg, p < 0.01) and had higher ACT values (221 vs. 208 s, p < 0.01). Protamine use was low and similar between groups. Periprocedural stroke rates were low overall (1.1%) and comparable between study groups (1.2% vs. 0.9%, p = 0.71). One-year mortality was also similar (3% vs. 4%, p = 0.53), with no significant differences in other safety outcomes. Subgroup analysis by ACT (≤250 vs. >250 s) showed no difference in stroke rates (1% vs. 1.5%, p = 0.60). Conclusions: In this single-center cohort, differences in heparin dosing and ACT values were not associated with differences in peri-procedural stroke or overall procedural outcomes. However, given the low number of stroke events, these findings should be interpreted cautiously. Prospective randomized studies are needed to define optimal anticoagulation strategies during TAVR."

This has informed the recommendation for urgent intervention upon diagnosis, especially when symptoms develop. Asymptomatic severe aortic stenosis has a four-year mortality between 30 and 50% if left untreated, which is similar to some metastatic cancers. Conservative management for patients with severe asymptomatic aortic stenosis was previously advocated, likely owing to the relative invasiveness of surgical aortic valve replacement. The advent of low-risk transcatheter aortic valve implantation with good medium-term durability has prioritized the need for a paradigm shift in the treatment of asymptomatic severe aortic stenosis towards a more proactive strategy of early intervention to reduce significant adverse events.

However, the precise underlying mechanisms are not fully understood.
This study aimed to establish a causal association between cardiometabolic diseases and CAVS by using genetic correlations and a bidirectional two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis.
Genome-wide association study (GWAS) data for seven cardiometabolic disorders and CAVS were obtained from the FinnGen consortium. The genetic correlations between two conditions were evaluated using the linkage disequilibrium score regression (LDSC) and high-definition likelihood (HDL) methods. MR analyses were conducted with inverse-variance weighted (IVW) regression as the principal method, complemented by weighted median, heterogeneity analysis, and sensitivity tests.
We identified 12 shared genes between cardiometabolic disorders and CAVS. Functional enrichment analysis revealed that these overlapping genes are involved in cholesterol homeostasis, vascular remodeling, smooth muscle proliferation, and lipid accumulation. MR analysis suggested a causal relationship between cardiometabolic disorders and CAVS.
Our study indicates significant genetic overlap between cardiometabolic disorders and CAVS. This finding provides valuable insights into the underlying mechanisms of their co-occurrence and has important implications for future therapeutic strategies.

The objective of the study was to investigate procedure-related changes in eGFR and clinical outcomes following mTEER.
We studied patients in the Transcatheter Valve Therapy registry undergoing mTEER between 2013 and 2022 with available baseline and discharge eGFR. Multivariable linear regression identified baseline characteristics associated with changes in eGFR following mTEER. Cox proportional hazards models examined the adjusted association between improved (≥10% increase in eGFR), unchanged, and worsened renal function (≥10% decrease in eGFR) and survival at 1 year.
Among 48,472 patients undergoing mTEER, 15.7% experienced improved renal function and 13.7% had worsened renal function. Cardiogenic shock within 24 hours, age >80, Black race, diabetes, heart failure within 2 weeks, and female sex were strongly associated with worsened renal function after mTEER. Compared to the group with no change in renal function, improved renal function was associated with a decreased risk of 1-year mortality (adjusted hazard ratio: 0.77; 95% CI 0.69-0.86, p < 0.001), whereas worsened renal function was associated with an increased risk of death at 1 year (adjusted hazard ratio: 2.85; 95% CI 2.64-3.08, p < 0.001).
Approximately 30% of patients experience marked changes in renal function following mTEER.A greater than 10% increase or decrease in eGFR is independently associated with differences in 1-year survival. Careful attention to patients at greatest risk for worsened renal function after mTEER is warranted."

While traditional approaches have addressed these components in isolation, this review summarizes the mechanisms and clinical evidence of a 'whole-heart electro-mechanical optimization' approach for the treatment of bradycardia.
Accelerated atrial pacing can lower left-sided filling pressures and improve symptoms in patients with heart failure with preserved ejection fraction and diastolic dysfunction. Bachmann bundle area pacing restores physiological atrial activation, which not only improves diastolic filling and reduces atrial arrhythmia burden but also redefines the effective AV-delay. AV-sequential pacing enables optimization of AV coupling to enhance left ventricular filling by restoring appropriate timing between early ventricular filling and atrial contraction, and by reducing diastolic mitral regurgitation. Importantly, conduction system pacing, typically left bundle branch area pacing, preserves near-normal ventricular activation enabling the full hemodynamic benefits of the preceding interventions without pacing-induced dyssynchrony.
Together, these complementary and interdependent pacing strategies form an integrated 'whole-heart electro-mechanical optimization' approach aimed at integrative optimization of whole-heart pump function in selected patients."

This study aimed to correlate MAVIR with echocardiographic and clinical variables of myxomatous mitral valve disease (MMVD) severity in dogs.
Data from two centres were reviewed for healthy dogs and dogs with MMVD. The RF was calculated using Teichholz (RFTeichh) and Simpson (RFSMOD) methods. The correlation between MAVIR and echocardiographic indices and its difference across American College of Veterinary Internal Medicine and Mitral INsufficiency Echocardiographic (MINE) classes were assessed. A receiver operating characteristic curve analysis assessed MAVIR's ability to predict MMVD severity and RF.
A total of 1,109 examinations from 950 dogs were included in the present study. The MAVIR differed between healthy and MMVD at all American College of Veterinary Internal Medicine stages and MINE classes (P<0.001). It correlated with RFSMOD (Rho: 0.78, P<0.001) and RFTeichh (Rho: 0.83, P<0.001). The areas under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUCs) for discriminating mild from moderate and moderate from severe-late stage according to the MINE score were AUCs = 0.709 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.673, 0.745) and 0.784 (95% CI: 0.731, 0.836), respectively; for predicting RFSMOD ≥ 50%, the AUC was 0.946 (95% CI: 0.926, 0.966), with a cutoff >1.27 (sensitivity 91.11%; specificity 84.15%).
Retrospective study design and negative RF values are the limitations of this study.
Although not clinically validated against a gold standard, the MAVIR is associated with MMVD severity. A MAVIR >1.27 predicts an RFSMOD ≥ 50%. Given its simplicity, MAVIR might represent a valuable tool for staging MMVD and warrants further investigation."

This retrospective propensity-score-matched analysis compared the outcomes of MI-MVr in obese patients (body mass index [BMI] ≥30 kg/m2), with those in individuals with normal body weight (BMI 19-25 kg/m2), focusing on overall survival.
In 501 analysed matched pairs, BMI ranged 30-60 kg/m2 in obese group and 19-24.9 kg/m2 in normal-BMI group. There were no baseline differences among matched cohorts, except for higher incidence of hypertension (78% vs 57%, P < .001) and hypercholesterolaemia (35% vs 28%, P = .02) in obese patients, and slightly worse renal function. All patients received MI-MVr through right lateral mini-thoracotomy. The median total operative time (by 11 minutes) and cardiopulmonary by-pass time (by 5 minutes) were longer in obese patients (P = .001), but the cross-clamp times did not differ. There were no intergroup differences in the early complication rates or hospitalization lengths. After a median follow-up of 9.3 years, the overall survival was similar. Actuarial survival at 15 years was 59% for obese patients and 57% for those with normal BMI (log-rank, P = .38). A multivariable model identified diabetes (HR [95% CI], 1.65 [1.26-2.16], P = .0003), chronic lung disease (1.81 [1.31-2.51], P = .0004), left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) <50% (2.28 [1.78-2.93], P ≤ .0001), and older age (1.08 [1.07-1.10], P ≤ .0001) as independent predictors of mortality.
Obesity alone does not influence the outcomes of MI-MVr, but diabetes, chronic lung disease, and impaired pump function do affect the overall survival."

The value of four-dimensional automated right ventricular quantification (4D-RVQ) in PMR remains underexplored.
In this prospective study, 141 participants (36 mild, 31 moderate, 35 severe PMR, and 39 controls) underwent comprehensive echocardiography, including 2D speckle-tracking and 4D-RVQ. The RV-pulmonary artery (PA) coupling index was derived as the ratio of RV free wall longitudinal strain (RVFWLS) to pulmonary artery systolic pressure (PASP). Both 2D and 4D RVFWLS and RV global longitudinal strain showed a significant progressive decline with increasing PMR severity (P < 0.001), outperforming conventional parameters like TAPSE. The RV-PA coupling index demonstrated the strongest correlation with RVEF (r = -0.631, P < 0.001). 4D-RVQ parameters showed good agreement with 2D-derived values. Notably, the 4D RV-PA coupling index exhibited superior discriminatory power for moderate-or-greater PMR (AUC: 0.893, 95% CI: 0.809-0.977), slightly outperforming the 2D index. Despite the preservation of LV ejection fraction even in severe PMR, RV dysfunction was apparent by the moderate stage.
4D-RVQ provides a comprehensive and sensitive assessment of RV function in PMR. RV strain parameters and the RV-PA coupling index are superior to conventional measures for detecting early RV dysfunction. Its integration into clinical practice can improve the detection of right heart function with significant PMR by directly quantifying the pathophysiological hallmark of RV-PA uncoupling."

Despite this, little is known about sex differences in LV remodeling in patients with mitral valve prolapse (MVP) undergoing mitral valve repair (MVr).
To assess pre- and post-MVr sex differences in LV size and function in patients with MVP.
Patients with MVP operated between 2007-2024 at two Heart Valve Centers were included. We excluded patients with previous cardiac surgery, coronary artery disease, other concomitant procedures than tricuspid valve repair, non-sinus rhythm at baseline and those with significant post-surgical mitral regurgitation (≥grade 2). LV size was evaluated before and after surgery using both end-systolic diameter (ESD) and volume (ESV), while LV function was assessed by EF and GLS. Thresholds for normal sex-specific LV size and function were based on current recommendations. The primary outcome was postoperative LV damage, defined as the presence of enlarged LV ESVi, impaired LV EF or impaired LV GLS. The ability of preoperative measures of LV size to discriminate the outcome was assessed using receiver operating characteristics curve analyses.
A total of 190 patients (37% women, mean age 58 ± 12 years) were assessed 4 [1-6] months before and 14 [11-22] months after surgery. While men had significantly larger preoperative LV ESD (37 ± 5 mm vs. 34 ± 5 mm), LV ESV (74 ± 20 ml vs. 52 ± 13 ml) and LV ESV/BSA (36 ± 9 ml/m2 vs. 30 ± 7 ml/m2) than women, LV ESD/BSA was higher in women (19 ± 3 mm/m2 vs. 18 ± 2 mm/m2) (all p <0.010). Postoperatively, only men exhibited significantly lower LV ESV compared to the preoperative values, regardless of BSA indexation: LV ESV 62 ± 16 ml and LV ESV/BSA 31 ± 7 ml/m2 in men (both p <0.001), but LV ESV 50 ± 14 ml (p =0.265) and LV ESV/BSA 29 ± 8 ml/m2 (p =0.216) in women. In multivariable logistic regression analysis, women were 6.3 (95% CI 2.6-14.9, p <0.001) times more likely than men to have dilated LV after MVr after adjusting for baseline characteristics (p <0.001). LV EF was similar between sexes both before and after surgery. LV GLS was higher in women than in men before surgery (22.8 ± 2.6% vs. 22.1 ± 2.2%, p =0.038) but comparable after surgery (17.1 ± 2.6% vs. 17.2 ± 2.2%, p =0.715). Adjusting for age as well as preoperative LV GLS, LV size and left atrial reservoir strain, women were 3.3 (95% CI 1.5-7.3, p =0.003) times more likely than men to have impaired LV GLS postoperatively (p <0.001). The optimal cutoff of LV ESD/BSA to predict postoperative LV damage was 19 mm/m2 in men and 16 mm/m2 in women with an AUC of 0.68.
In patients with MVP undergoing MVr, women have higher BSA-adjusted LV size by ESD, while ESV remains larger in men. Only men demonstrate a significant reduction in LV ESV after MVr, whereas women are more prone to postoperative LV dilatation and dysfunction. Our findings suggest that women are being operated at a later stage of disease, and support the need for sex-specific assessment of preoperative LV size when referring patients to mitral valve surgery."

Case reports,"Infective endocarditis arising on a stenotic mitral valve is uncommon, and it may present with atypical morphology.
We report a case of infective endocarditis in a patient with mild to moderate degenerative mitral stenosis who developed an extensive, broad-based vegetation nearly occluding the mitral valve, with an overlying contiguous aneurysm-like cystic structure. Transthoracic echocardiography demonstrated an elevated transmitral gradient, while transesophageal echocardiography revealed hemodynamic communication between the cystic structure and the left ventricle. Computed tomography showed contrast enhancement within the cavity. Three-dimensional transesophageal echocardiography was crucial in delineating the en face morphology and extent of the obstruction. The surgical and pathological findings confirmed a flat vegetation with pseudoaneurysmal features.
This high-risk morphology warrants urgent surgical consideration, as aneurysmal rupture could precipitate acute mitral regurgitation superimposed on obstruction.
With the increasing prevalence of degenerative mitral stenosis, recognition of such morphologies is essential to guide timely surgical intervention."

Heart failure,"Left atrial (LA) remodeling, characterized by progressive enlargement, is commonly observed in heart failure with reduced ejection fraction and reflects left ventricular (LV) dysfunction and functional mitral regurgitation (FMR). However, its independent prognostic significance remains uncertain.
This study aims to investigate the independent association between LA volume index (LAVI) and long-term mortality in patients with heart failure, considering its interaction with FMR severity.
A cohort of 13,954 patients who received a diagnosis of heart failure stage B or C and a first diagnosis of reduced LV ejection fraction (<50%) at Mayo Clinic was analyzed. Comprehensive echocardiographic quantification of LAVI, LV function, FMR, and hemodynamics was performed. Survival analysis included Kaplan-Meier curves, Cox proportional hazards models, and spline modeling, adjusted for demographic, clinical, and echocardiographic variables.
Mean LAVI increased with worsening FMR (35 ± 14 mL/m2 in no FMR to 61 ± 23 mL/m2 in severe FMR). Higher LAVI was associated with increased mortality (HR: 1.13 per 10 mL/m2; P < 0.0001), independent of LV function, FMR, and comorbidities. A mortality risk threshold emerged at LAVI >40 mL/m2, with excess mortality increasing steeply beyond this point. Stratification showed significant interactions between LAVI, LV ejection fraction, atrial fibrillation, and pulmonary hypertension. Although LAVI threshold of excess mortality shifted from about 40 mL/m2 in no-mild FMR to about 60 mL/m2 in severe FMR, the slope of the relationship persisted unaltered, confirming the graded relationship between LAVI and outcome at each FMR grade (P for interaction = 0.35).
LAVI is an independent predictor of mortality in heart failure stage B or C, with excess risk starting at 40 mL/m2. The prognostic impact of LAVI persisted with a graded relationship in all FMR severity grades, emphasizing its role in risk stratification. These findings support the integration of LA remodeling assessment into heart failure management to refine prognostic evaluation and therapeutic strategies."

Mechanical circulatory support (MCS), such as the HeartMate 3 left ventricular assist device (LVAD), is a therapeutic option for patients who are ineligible for heart transplantation. Right heart failure (RHF), depending on the clinical criteria applied for its diagnosis, occurs in 10-40% of patients following LVAD implantation and significantly worsens prognosis. This report presents a 69-year-old male with chronic ischemic HF, prior cardiac resynchronization therapy with defibrillator (CRT-D) implantation, and coronary intervention with drug-eluting stents. Due to progressive mitral regurgitation (MR) and elevated HF biomarkers, MitraClip implantation was performed with initial clinical improvement. Subsequently, left ventricular function deteriorated despite optimized pharmacotherapy, leading to HeartMate 3 LVAD implantation. The postoperative course was complicated by recurrent cardiac tamponade requiring surgical management. Progressive RHF necessitated temporary support with an Impella RP device. Further complications included recurrent infections, sepsis, respiratory failure, and acute kidney injury requiring renal replacement therapy. Despite comprehensive treatment, progressive multiorgan failure and severe cachexia developed. Given the patient's status as a destination therapy, care was transitioned to home-based palliative management. This case illustrates the complexity of managing end-stage HF with LVAD support, highlighting the frequent complications such as RHF and infections, and the importance of recognizing when to prioritize comfort in advanced disease."

Imaging methods and practice,"In the follow-up of patients with mitral regurgitation (MR), assessment of left ventricular (LV) dilatation using standard echocardiography often yields inconsistent results. We investigated whether measuring 3D LV end-systolic volume (3DLVESV) improves risk stratification in moderate or greater MR.
In the prospective 3D Echocardiography and Cardiovascular Prognosis in Mitral Regurgitation (3D-PRIME) study, 227 patients -142 with primary (PMR) and 85 secondary MR (SMR)- underwent 2D/3D echocardiography. 3DLVESV was increased if ≥41.5/35 mL/m², and LV end-systolic diameter (LVESD) enlarged if ≥39.8/34.8 mm in men/women. The primary outcome was a composite of MR progression towards intervention, death, or heart failure hospitalization (HFH). Death or HFH was a secondary outcome.At baseline, 28% of PMR and 54% of SMR patients had increased 3DLVESV. After 21 (15-25) months, increased 3DLVESV was associated with 1.9-fold (1.2-3.2) higher adjusted risk of the primary outcome in PMR, and 4.1-fold (1.6-10.7) higher risk of death or HFH in SMR (P < 0.05). 3DLVESV and LVESD concordantly identified LV dilatation in 20% of PMR patients and were discordant in 27%. Both patients with increased 3DLVESV only, and those with increased both 3DLVESV and LVESD, had high risk of the primary outcome after adjusting for recommendations for intervention in PMR: HR 7.1 (2.9-16.9) and 4.9 (2.1-11.1), respectively (P < 0.001).
Increased 3DLVESV is associated with a higher risk of adverse events in patients with significant MR. In PMR, evaluating LV dilatation using both 3DLVESV and LVESD may enhance risk stratification and aid in patient selection for close follow-up.

We aimed to investigate whether the level and the change of the TyG index were associated with HCM.
The study retrospectively collected socio-demographic, medical, anthropometric, and laboratory data from patients with HCM who were continuously admitted to Beijing Anzhen Hospital between January 1, 2018, and December 31, 2022. Logistic regressions were used to determine the relationship between the TyG index, other HCM factors, and the incidence of atrial fibrillation (AF). After stratifying patients by TyG index, we compared inter-group characteristics and evaluated the association between the TyG index and AF using logistic regression, followed by subgroup analyses to examine the consistency of this association.
For the total HCM population, the prevalence of AF was 285/1284(22.20%). Patients with AF had greater age (61.8 ± 10.6 vs. 54.0 ± 14.2 years, P < 0.001), lower body mass index (BMI) (25.59 ± 3.27 vs. 26.47 ± 4.03, P < 0.001), larger left atrial diameter (LAD) (46.86 ± 7.11 vs. 40.39 ± 5.98, P < 0.001), and more moderate or severe mitral regurgitation (MR) (82.5% vs. 67.0%, P < 0.001). Patients with AF had significantly greater free fatty acids (FFA) level (0.50 ± 0.26 vs. 0.44 ± 0.22, P = 0.004), although their triglycerides (TG) (1.45 ± 0.95 vs. 1.77 ± 1.05, P < 0.001), TyG index (8.64 ± 0.64 VS. 8.84 ± 0.64, P < 0.001), total cholesterol (TC) (4.21 ± 1.07 vs. 4.53 ± 1.07, P < 0.001), and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) (2.55 ± 0.91 vs. 2.75 ± 0.88, P = 0.001) levels were much lower. In the multivariate logistic regression model, we discovered that age, LAD, left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF), and TyG index were independently linked with the occurrence of AF. Subgroup analysis of the study population showed no interaction between all subgroups after adjusting for confounders.
In conclusion, our study demonstrates that a higher TyG index is inversely associated with key adverse features in HCM, including LAD, and the prevalence of AF and moderate-to-severe MR. Further investigations are warranted to elucidate the mechanisms underlying these associations and their impact on the long-term prognosis of HCM."

ICM with significantly reduced LVEF remains one of the severe forms of chronic heart failure (CHF), associated with a high risk of adverse outcomes. The choice of the optimal treatment strategy, coronary revascularization in addition to intensive medical therapy, is a subject of active discussion and requires further study, especially regarding its effect on LV reverse remodeling and long-term prognosis. This retrospective cohort study included 561 patients with ICM and LVEF &lt;40%. The follow-up lasted from 2014 through 2024. 74% of the patients were men aged 61.4±8.7 years. Patients were divided into a revascularization group (PCI+OMT, n=281) and an OMT group (n=280). The structural and functional state of the heart was assessed using transthoracic echocardiography (ECHO) with standard protocols.
The OMT group had a significantly higher EuroSCORE II surgical risk (4.0±1.9% vs. 3.0±1.5% in the PCI+OMT group; p&lt;0.05), a greater prevalence of stage III or higher chronic kidney disease (35.7% vs. 17.8%; p&lt;0.05), and more severe LV dilatation (LV end-diastolic volume 265±54 ml vs. 245±45 ml; p&lt;0.05). The PCI+OMT group presented with significantly higher anatomical lesion complexity compared to the OMT group (SYNTAX Score 33.5±8.8 vs. 28.9±9.7, p&lt;0.05). At the 24-month follow-up, the PCI+OMT group demonstrated a superior improvement in LVEF (+10.7±6.8% vs. +2.1±4.5%, p&lt;0.001). The proportion of patients with severe mitral regurgitation (III+) was lower in the PCI+OMT group (5.3% vs. 16.1%, p&lt;0.001), and overall mortality was 10.7% vs. 23.2% in the OMT group (p&lt;0.001). The CHF-related hospitalization rate was also significantly lower in the PCI+OMT group than in the OMT group (17.8% vs. 33.9%; p&lt;0.001).
The combination of PCI and OMT is associated with a pronounced recovery of myocardial contractility, reverse LV remodeling, and regression of functional mitral regurgitation. The structural changes in the myocardium achieved through the integrative approach translate into a significant reduction in overall mortality and hospitalizations rates due to decompensated CHF during mid-term follow-up."

We seek to evaluate how rewarming temperature affects postoperative bleeding in patients undergoing mitral valve repair.MethodsClinical, anesthesia and CPB data were analyzed for 379 adults undergoing isolated mitral regurgitation repair. Platelet levels (1000/μL) were divided into three groups: low, 53-164 (n = 128); medium, 165-208 (n = 126); and high, 209-906 (n = 125). The primary endpoint was chest drainage volume (mL) at 24 postoperative hours. To delineate the degree and impact of rewarming, a variable ""rewarming/cooling ratio"" was defined as: peak rewarming temperature (°C) divided by nadir cooling temperature (°C). General linear models were used to evaluate factors associated with the volume of 24-h chest drainage.ResultsMean flow rate was 2.7 ± 0.1 L/min/m2, nadir core temperature 30.7 ± 1.3°C and peak rewarming temperature 36.2 ± 0.5°C. The ""rewarming/cooling ratio"" averaged 1.133 ± 0.044.Postoperatively, nadir platelet count was 115 ± 46 k/μL, and chest drainage averaged 344 ± 181 mL at 24 h. Two patients underwent re-exploration for bleeding (0.5%). Transfusion was required in 85 patients (22.4%).Gender (F = 20.585, p < 0.001), platelet count (F = 3.875, p = 0.024), fibrinogen (F = 4.241, p = 0.040), and chest incision (F = 58.097, p < 0.001), rather than the rewarming temperature (F = 2.322, p = 0.128), were factors significantly associated with 24-h chest drainage.A significant interaction existed between platelet levels and ""rewarming/cooling ratio"" (F = 3.717, p = 0.025), i.e., with a higher ""rewarming/cooling ratio"", 24-h chest drainage tended to increase in the low platelet group, and to decrease in patients with high and medium platelet levels.ConclusionsIn this series of patients undergoing isolated mitral regurgitation repair, gender, platelet count, fibrin and chest incision, rather than rewarming temperature, were independent factors significantly associated with postoperative bleeding. The impact of rewarming temperature on postoperative bleeding was modified by preoperative platelet levels.

While transcatheter edge-to-edge repair (TEER) improves symptoms and prognosis in selected patients, its effects on cardiac remodeling remain debated. This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to evaluate the impact of TEER on echocardiographic indices of cardiac remodeling.
PubMed, Scopus, and Cochrane Library were used to identify relevant studies assessing echocardiographic changes before and after TEER. Outcomes of interest were left ventricular (LV) ejection fraction, global longitudinal strain, LV end-diastolic and end-systolic volumes and LV end-diastolic and end-systolic diameter, tricuspid annular plane systolic excursion, pulmonary artery systolic pressure, and left atrial end-systolic volume.
Forty-two studies (3987 patients) were included. TEER was associated with a significant increase in LV ejection fraction (mean difference [MD], 1.51% [95% CI, 0.47-2.55]), without significant improvement in global longitudinal strain. Significant LV remodeling was observed, with reductions in LV end-diastolic volume (standardized MD, -0.26 [95% CI, -0.37 to -0.14]), LV end-systolic volume (standardized MD, -0.21 [95% CI, -0.30 to -0.12]), LV end-diastolic diameter (MD, -2.35 mm [95% CI, -3.66 to -1.04]) and left ventricular end-systolic diameter (MD, -2.30 mm [95% CI, -3.86 to -0.74). TEER also improved right ventricular function (tricuspid annular plane systolic excursion [MD, 1.29 mm [95% CI, 0.60-1.97]) and reduced pulmonary artery systolic pressure (MD, -6.75 mm Hg [95% CI, -8.53 to -4.97). No significant improvement in left atrial end-systolic volume was detected.
Available evidence suggests that TEER promotes significant cardiac remodeling in patients with secondary mitral regurgitation."

Experimental groups included 105 confirmed cases of heart disease in failure and a control group of 40 confirmed cases of heart disease not in failure. The program had an 87.04% sensitivity and an 80% specificity for radiographically concluding HF in dogs. Compared to true findings, the program had a 98% sensitivity in detecting an interstitial pattern, 100% sensitivity in detecting cardiomegaly, and 95% sensitivity in detecting a vascular pattern among other findings. In cats, the program had a 96% sensitivity in detecting an interstitial pattern, 96% sensitivity in detecting cardiomegaly, and 94% sensitivity in detecting a vascular pattern, among other findings. Despite this high sensitivity performance, the program only combines these findings to conclude HF with a sensitivity of 9.8% and specificity of 95%. The AI software had a similar success rate compared to radiologists in identifying the individual findings of HF in both species. This software has reached a level of sophistication to identify the different abnormalities as accurately as a large radiology group and also combine these findings and arrive at the radiographic conclusion of HF in dogs. The performance of this program in cats highlights the importance for veterinarians to utilize their medical knowledge to interpret the AI report like any other ancillary diagnostic test."

Diabetic cardiomyopathy (DbCM), defined as myocardial dysfunction occurring independently of coronary artery disease, hypertension, or significant valvular disease, is an important complication of T2DM and may progress to overt heart failure if undiagnosed. While well characterised in high-income settings, DbCM prevalence and distribution in LMICs remain poorly defined. This systematic review aims to estimate the pooled prevalence of DbCM among adults with T2DM in LMICs.
This protocol follows the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses Protocols (PRISMA-P) guidelines and the Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) Manual for Evidence Synthesis. A comprehensive search will be conducted in PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, Embase, AJOL, and EBSCOhost, supplemented by regional databases and grey literature sources. Observational studies conducted in LMICs that report the prevalence of DbCM among adults with T2DM will be considered. DbCM must be diagnosed using objective cardiac imaging after exclusion of alternative causes of myocardial dysfunction. Two reviewers will independently screen, extract data, and assess risk of bias using a tool adapted for prevalence studies.
Where data are sufficiently comparable, pooled prevalence estimates will be calculated using random-effects meta-analysis. Prevalence proportions will be modelled using generalised linear mixed models with a logit link function to account for within- and between-study variability. Statistical heterogeneity will be assessed using the I2 statistic and explored through subgroup analyses by demographic, clinical, and regional characteristics. Where meta-analysis is not appropriate, findings will be synthesised using a structured narrative approach.
This review is expected to report pooled prevalence estimates of DbCM across LMICs and to describe regional variation. Differences in diagnostic approaches, glycaemic control, diabetes duration, age, sex, and geographical region are anticipated to contribute to heterogeneity and will be explored where data permit.
By synthesising available evidence on the prevalence of DbCM in LMICs, this review will clarify the burden of disease and provide evidence to inform health system planning and guide future research and prevention efforts aimed at reducing diabetes-related heart failure."

Unlike conventional indices such as left ventricular ejection fraction and global longitudinal strain, MW integrates myocardial deformation with left ventricular pressure, providing a load-adjusted and physiologically meaningful assessment of myocardial performance. Growing evidence demonstrates that impaired MW is consistently associated with adverse outcomes, including heart failure hospitalization, mortality, and functional deterioration, across a wide spectrum of cardiovascular conditions such as ischemic heart disease, valvular heart disease, and cardiomyopathies. The noninvasive estimation of MW using commercially available echocardiographic software has enhanced its feasibility in routine clinical practice, enabling improved risk stratification and early identification of high-risk patients. This review summarizes current evidence supporting the prognostic value of MW, highlights its incremental role beyond conventional echocardiographic parameters, and discusses future perspectives for its integration into everyday clinical decision-making."

Case reports,"Lambl's excrescences (LEs) are thin, filamentous valvular strands that are usually small and asymptomatic, however when they are large and mobile, they can cause embolic or obstructive events.
A 59-year-old man presented with recurrent angina-like chest pain. Coronary angiography showed an intermediate lesion in the left anterior descending artery without hemodynamic relevance. Echocardiography revealed a highly mobile, 20- to 30-mm filamentous structure attached to the left coronary cusp, intermittently prolapsing toward the left coronary ostium and causing moderate aortic regurgitation. Surgical excision and aortic valve replacement were performed through a ministernotomy. Symptoms resolved, and histopathology confirmed a giant LE.
Giant or hypermobile LEs can dynamically obstruct coronary ostia, mimicking atherosclerotic angina, even without significant coronary vascular disease. Surgical treatment is recommended when lesions are large, symptomatic, or associated with an increased risk of embolism.
Large LEs may cause coronary obstruction; multimodality imaging is essential, timely surgical removal provides relief and prevents ischemic or embolic complications."

Cardiovascular Imaging,"Multivalvular heart disease (MVD), defined as coexisting lesions in two or more valves, poses significant diagnostic and prognostic challenges. While isolated valvular heart disease (VHD) is well characterized, the impact of moderate aortic regurgitation (AR) with another concomitant moderate VHD remains unclear. Current guidelines focus mainly on isolated severe lesions, potentially underestimating moderate MVD. This study assessed the prevalence and prognostic impact of concomitant moderate VHD in patients with moderate AR.
We retrospectively analyzed 794 patients with ≥ moderate AR (2017-2023) from a dedicated echocardiographic database. Groups were: isolated moderate AR (n=178), isolated significant AR (n=214), and moderate AR plus ≥ one concomitant moderate VHD (n=402). Significant AR was defined by the presence of ≥1 echocardiographic severity criterion. Exclusion criteria included cardiomyopathy, prior cardiac surgery, LVEF <50%, or severe VHD other than AR. Follow-up was 24 months for a composite endpoint of all-cause mortality and heart failure hospitalization (HHF). VHD severity was graded per guidelines. Patients with moderate AR plus another VHD were older (79.9 vs. 66.4 years, p<0.001), with more comorbidities and larger left atria. During follow-up, 151 patients (18.8%) met the composite endpoint (63 HHF, 108 deaths). Moderate AR with another VHD independently predicted higher risk [HR 2.83 (95% CI: 1.32-6.03; p = 0.007)], comparable to isolated significant AR [HR 2.65 (95% CI: 1.23-5.70; p = 0.013)].
Moderate AR with another concomitant moderate VHD carries a prognosis similar to significant AR, indicating this combination is not benign and may be underestimated by current guidelines."

SISBH diagnosis is based on oral anticoagulation history associated with acute abdominal symptoms and suggestive radiological findings. Experience with this condition is still limited in the literature. This report highlights the clinical presentation and management of this rare condition, including the first known use of total-body positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) scan in the diagnostic workup of SISBH.
A 53-year-old male on long-term oral anticoagulation with VKA for mechanical mitral valve replacement due to rheumatic heart disease presented to the emergency department for abdominal pain and nausea. Physical examination was remarkable for abdominal distension, increased bowel sounds and rebound tenderness, a presentation compatible with intestinal subocclusion. At admission, the international normalized ratio was 8.3, indicating VKA intoxication. Abdominal CT revealed significant jejunal parietal thickening, suggestive of SISBH. PET/CT findings were also consistent with a possible hematoma, although an inflammatory or neoplastic process could not be excluded. We opted for conservative treatment with temporary warfarin suspension and vitamin K infusion. The patient's intestinal subocclusion gradually improved, and he was discharged after seven days with full recovery.
SISBH, although rare, should be considered in the differential diagnosis of acute abdominal symptoms in patients receiving long-term oral anticoagulation, particularly with VKAs. Conservative treatment is the preferred initial option. A high index of suspicion, followed by prompt abdominal CT, is key to early diagnosis. PET/CT provided minimal diagnostic value beyond CT. Conservative management with anticoagulation reversal and supportive care is generally the primary therapeutic strategy adopted in the literature, demonstrating favorable short-term outcomes, as was the case with our patient."

It is a progressive form of heart valves damage that leads to dysfunction of the heart. According to WHO 2020, It is urgently necessary to clarify the pathogenic mechanisms underlying RHD in order to develop therapeutic interventions. Molecular mimicry (MM), the fundamental mechanism underlying RHD, is triggered by antigens on group A streptococcus (GAS) to activate CD4 + T cells, which subsequently cross-react with related peptides in the tissue surrounding the heart valve. Although, the most well-established theory for the development of RHD is MM, however, over the past few years, competence of MM theory to elucidate autoimmune diseases in RHD is questioned several times. The GAS first adheres and colonize on the surface of epithelium of the heart and then with the help of various adhesion molecules invade the heart valves and cause inflammation. Furthermore, the observation that multiple members of the affected person's family have RHD supports the idea that genetics plays a role in the RHD pathogenesis. This suggests a genetic predisposition for RHD. Therefore, in the present review, besides MM, other factors such as cellular proteins, various cells producing cytokines and chemokines, and genetic factors that leads to disease manifestation have been discussed."

This initiative aims to strengthen the national development of cardiovascular devices.
Computational analyses, mechanical tests, and hydrodynamic tests (normocardic and accelerated fatigue) were performed. The BVC-F was evaluated in a range of 20 to 200 beats per minute for 30 min. The accelerated fatigue tests were carried out at a frequency of 1050-1080 beats/min for a period of 1 month, followed by implantation in five Yorkshire porcine models using extracorporeal circulation.
Finite element analysis indicated a low risk of fracture (stresses 73% below yield strength) and radial expansion (15.95%). Tests validated an effective orifice area of 2.25 cm², transvalvular gradients < 10 mmHg, and a regurgitant flow lower than 5%. Accelerated fatigue tests confirmed structural integrity equivalent to 2.2 years. In vivo porcine implantation (n = 5) was successful, maintaining a mean gradient of 10 ± 2 mmHg with no paravalvular leakage. Furthermore, the viability of a ViV procedure was validated, resulting in sufficient annulus expansion and stable hemodynamics.
The BVC-F INC achieved compliance with preliminary safety and efficacy standards. Nonetheless, extended and complex simulations are requisite to assess long-term mechanical behavior, wear resistance, and functional stability before human clinical trials."

This study aims to synthesise and update contemporary long-term TAVI versus SAVR data.
This study comprised a systematic review and meta-analysis and employed a Bayesian hierarchical design. Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing TAVI to SAVR in low-risk to intermediate-risk patients with at least 5-year follow-up were included. The primary outcome was 5-year all-cause mortality; secondary outcomes were the 5-year incidence of stroke and the 5-year incidence of the composite of mortality and stroke.
Time-to-event data were reconstructed. Relative risks (RRs) with 95% credible intervals (CrIs) were estimated from reported 5-year event rates using minimally informative priors. Sensitivity analyses were performed using various meta-analytical models, and using conventional frequentist random-effects and fixed-effects models for sensitivity purposes.
A total of six RCTs, enrolling 7249 low- to intermediate-risk patients reported 5-year outcomes (TAVI n=3704, SAVR n=3545). The 5-year all-cause mortality rate was 29.7% (28.2-31.2%, TAVI) and 27.6% (26.1-29.1%, SAVR). The median RR for all-cause mortality was 1.12 (95% CrI 1.02-1.22, heterogeneity τ2=0), with a 99.3% posterior probability that SAVR is superior to TAVI for this endpoint. For stroke, the median RR was 1.13 (95% CrI 0.93-1.39, heterogeneity τ2=0.04), resulting in an 88.0% posterior probability that SAVR outperformed TAVI for this outcome. These results were consistent across conventional frequentist random-effects and fixed-effects models employing p values (RR 1.13, 95% CI 1.05 to 1.22, p=0.001, and RR 1.12, 95% CI 1.03 to 1.23, p=0.011, respectively). There was no evidence for an interaction effect of surgical risk category (p=0.470).
In this meta-analysis of RCTs, TAVI resulted in a clinically relevant increase in all-cause mortality, and a high probability of an increased risk of stroke, at 5 years of follow-up in low-risk to intermediate-risk patients, when compared to SAVR."

Cardiovascular interventions,"Estimating the probability of major bleeding (MB) in patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) after transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) is important for decision-making regarding anticoagulation strategy.
The aim of this study was to identify independent predictors of MB to create a risk assessment score in patients with AF after successful TAVR.
In this ENVISAGE-TAVI AF (EdoxabaN Versus standard of care and their effectS on clinical outcomes in pAtients havinG undergonE Transcatheter Aortic Valve Implantation-in Atrial Fibrillation; NCT02943785) on-treatment analysis, a stepwise Cox regression model identified MB predictors from baseline patient characteristics. A simple point-based additive score was constructed using the variable β estimates from the selected model. Patients were stratified into low-, moderate-, and high-risk groups according to their risk assessment scores; the likelihood of MB was compared between groups.
Among 1,377 patients, 139 (10.1%) experienced MB (mean ± SD on-treatment follow-up: 1.3 ± 0.8 years). The independent predictors of MB formed the HARHP (low Hemoglobin, excessive Alcohol use, severe Renal impairment, history of Hypercholesterolemia, and Percutaneous coronary intervention performed within 30 days of TAVR) score, with each parameter given a weight of 1 or 2. The likelihood of MB for high-risk patients (score ≥ 4) was 6.5 times higher than for low-risk patients (score = 0 or 1) (HR: 6.54; 95% CI: 3.61-11.85; P < 0.0001) and 2.9 times higher than moderate-risk patients (score = 2 or 3) (HR: 2.86; 95% CI: 1.62-5.04; P = 0.0003). The C statistic for the HARHP score was 0.63 at 1-year follow-up and 0.62 at 2-year follow-up.
Five independent predictors of long-term MB were identified in patients with AF requiring oral anticoagulant agents after TAVR and formed the HARHP score to assess MB risk. Use of the HARHP score may improve patient outcomes."

A comparative study was conducted involving 80 individuals: 40 patients with confirmed HCM and 40 sex- and age-matched controls (22 men, 18 women, mean age 55.3±13.3 years). All participants underwent a comprehensive examination at the cardiology department, including electrocardiography (ECG), echocardiography with full assessment of intracardiac hemodynamic parameters, Holter ECG monitoring, and laboratory tests. For molecular biological analysis, plasma expression levels of circulating microRNAs (-21, -29a, -133a) were determined for all participants using real-time polymerase chain reaction.
Circulating microRNA levels differed significantly between patients with HCM and the comparison group. The analysis showed a significant increase in the microRNA-21 expression (4.07 vs. 2.03; p&lt;0.001) and significant decreases in microRNA-29a (0.24 vs. 1.83; p&lt;0.001) and microRNA-133a (0.02 vs. 6.34; p&lt;0.001). ROC analysis demonstrated a high discriminatory ability of the studied microRNAs: microRNA-21 (AUC=0.887, sensitivity 89.7%, specificity 84.4%); microRNA-29a (AUC=0.884, sensitivity 92.3%, specificity 87.5%).
Increased expression of microRNA-21 and decreased expression of microRNA-29a are associated with myocardial fibrosis, while marked suppression of microRNA-133a reflects hypertrophic remodeling. These findings suggest that this microRNA panel holds promise as potential auxiliary markers for HCM, though clinical significance requires validation in larger, prospective studies."

While recent advances underscore the importance of accurately identifying these modifications to elucidate their contribution to Alzheimer's disease pathology, existing computational methods remain limited by their generic approaches that overlook disease-specific epigenetic signatures.
To bridge this gap, we develop a novel large language model-based deep learning framework tailored for disease-contextual prediction of histone modifications and variant effects. Focusing on Alzheimer's disease as a case study, we integrate epigenomic data from multiple patient samples to construct a comprehensive, disease-specific histone modification dataset, enabling our model to learn Alzheimer's disease -associated molecular signatures. A key innovation of our approach is the incorporation of a Mixture of Experts architecture, which effectively distinguishes between disease and healthy epigenetic states, allowing for precise identification of Alzheimer's disease -relevant epigenetic modification patterns. Our model demonstrates robust performance in disease-specific histone modification prediction, significantly outperforming existing state-of-the-art methods that lack disease context. Beyond accurate modification site prediction, our framework provides important biological insights by successfully prioritizing Alzheimer's disease-associated genetic variants, which show significant enrichment in disease-relevant pathways.
Our framework establishes a powerful new paradigm for epigenetic research that can be extended to other complex diseases, offering both a valuable tool for variant effect interpretation and a promising strategy for uncovering novel disease mechanisms through epigenetic profiling."

This prospective study included 214 participants who underwent standard-dose CT (SDCT, 3.68 ± 1.53 mSv) reconstructed with 50% adaptive statistical iterative reconstruction (ASIR-V-50%) and LDCT. LDCT was randomly divided into a higher-dose group (LD-A, 0.57-1.15 mSv, n = 108) and a lower-dose group (LD-B, 0.33-0.63 mSv, n = 106). Each group was stratified into four BMI-based subgroups with individualized protocols reconstructed with deep learning image reconstruction (DLIR-H and DLIR-M), ASIR-V-50%, and filtered back projection (FBP). Image quality, nodule detection across BMI subgroups, and the performance of four algorithms in detection, size measurement accuracy, and Lung-RADS v2022 consistency were analyzed.
In LDCT, DLIR-H provided superior image quality (p < 0.001) and the highest overall nodule detection rate (99.04%), surpassing ASIR-V-50% (98.55%) and FBP (97.87%) (both p < 0.05). The advantage was most evident for nodules < 6 mm, while all nodules ≥ 6 mm were consistently detected across algorithms. Detection rates showed no significant variation among BMI subgroups (all p > 0.05). For measurement accuracy, FBP and ASIR-V-50% performed better in LD-A (all p < 0.05), whereas DLIR-M was superior in LD-B (p < 0.001). All algorithms demonstrated excellent Lung-RADS agreement (κ > 0.9, p < 0.001).

PubMed,deep learning,A hierarchical interaction message net for accurate molecular property prediction.,Huiyang Hong; Xinkai Wu; Hongyu Sun; Chaoyang Xie; Qi Wang; Yuquan Li,10.1038/s42004-026-01922-x,2026-02-14,Communications chemistry,"Discovering molecules with desirable molecular properties, including ADMET profiles, is of great importance in drug discovery. Existing approaches typically employ deep learning models, such as Graph Neural Networks and Transformers, to predict these molecular properties by learning from diverse chemical information. However, these models often lack mechanisms for effective interaction among multi-level features. To address these limitations, we propose a Hierarchical Interaction Message Passing Mechanism, which serves as the foundation of our model, the Hierarchical Interaction Message Net (HimNet). Our method enables interaction-aware representation learning across atomic, motif, and molecular levels via hierarchical attention-guided message passing. This design allows HimNet to effectively balance global and local information, ensuring rich and task-relevant feature extraction for downstream property prediction tasks. We systematically evaluate HimNet on eleven datasets, including eight widely-used MoleculeNet benchmarks and three challenging, high-value datasets for metabolic stability, malaria activity, and liver microsomal clearance, covering a broad range of pharmacologically relevant properties. Extensive experiments demonstrate that HimNet achieves the best or near-best performance in most molecular property prediction tasks. We believe that HimNet offers an accurate and efficient solution for molecular activity and ADMET property prediction, contributing significantly to advanced decision-making in the early stages of drug discovery."

Recent studies have identified isonicotinylation (Kinic), a novel lysine acylation, as a regulatory modification influencing carcinogenic protein activity and liver cancer progression. In this study, we established the Kinic Index (KinicI), an artificial intelligence (AI)-driven predictive model that integrates multi-omics data and consensus clustering to classify HCC patients into two distinct Kinic subgroups. Patients in the high-Kinic subgroup exhibited significantly worse overall survival, demonstrating the value of KinicI for risk stratification and outcome prediction. Machine learning approaches (LASSO, RSF) coupled with Shapley additive explanation (SHAP) analysis identified CYP2C9 and G6PD as the most influential prognostic variables associated with HCC progression. Single-cell and spatial transcriptomic analyses confirmed that CYP2C9 and G6PD are primarily localized in malignant hepatocytes with high metastatic potential, underscoring their clinical relevance. Importantly, using the GraphBAN deep learning framework and ADMET-AI screening, we prioritized candidate compounds targeting CYP2C9 and G6PD, followed by molecular docking that validated strong binding affinities, suggesting their potential as novel therapeutics. Together, our study demonstrates that KinicI is a powerful AI-enabled platform for prognostic modeling, molecular stratification, and multitarget drug discovery, providing a foundation for precision oncology and resistance-aware treatment strategies in HCC patients."

The use of machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) models in computer-aided drug design is constantly growing owing to their capacity to analyze large, heterogeneous datasets, their ability to capture nonlinear biological trends, and their integration of various molecular and clinical characteristics. AI applications accelerate target discovery by predicting protein structures, ranking disease-relevant genes, and assessing target drugability. AI can be used to conduct rapid searches of multiplexed chemical libraries, predict drug-target interactions, and optimize the pharmacological and physicochemical properties of drugs in virtual screening. Advanced neural network designs also aid in de novo drug design, which involves developing new molecular structures with therapeutic properties of interest. This review outlines how AI has been used for target identification, virtual screening, de novo molecular design, and, specifically, in cancer applications. It further discusses the major issues in AI-based drug development, such as data quality, model interpretation, computational constraints, and ethical and regulatory considerations, which remain essential obstacles to broader clinical translation."

The process of boiling is characterized by the formation of bubbles within the liquid. These bubbles are composed of vapour of the substance. The formation and growth of bubbles are influenced by various factors which directly regulate the nucleation sites in the liquid. The formation of nucleation sites is directly linked to the heat flux and heat transfer efficiency of the device. The accurate prediction of these parameter is quite important for the equipment design, safety, reliability. Here, we used machine learning approach that correlates high-quality high-speed imaging on dynamic bubbles at different heat flux. The framework leverages cutting-edge deep learning models including convolutional neural networks and object detection algorithms to automatically extract both hierarchical and physics-based features. By training on these features, our model learns physical boiling laws that statistically describe the manner in which bubbles nucleate, coalesce, and depart under boiling conditions, enabling in situ boiling heat flux prediction. The proposed method achieves an average heat flux prediction error of approximately 6%, while maintaining an overall classification accuracy of 88% across all heat flux levels. Our framework offers an automated, learning-based, alternative to conventional boiling heat transfer metrology."

Over the past fifteen years, the field has expanded beyond handcrafted radiomic features toward deep radiomics, multi-site radiomics, and multi-omics integration, while the need for interpretability has become increasingly central. The aim of this article was to define and clarify these major methodological and conceptual evolutions, to summarize current innovations in deep, explainable, multi-site, and multi-omics radiomics, and to identify the remaining challenges that must be addressed before clinical translation. We first outline how deep learning architectures, including convolutional neural networks, autoencoders, vision transformers, and mask image modeling, enable the extraction of high-level, data-driven imaging representations that theoretically surpass the descriptive power of classical handcrafted radiomic features. Because tumors often display heterogeneous behavior across metastatic sites, we then describe the transition from single-site radiomics to patient-level multi-site approaches integrating all lesions, using aggregation methods, radiomic distance metrics, or attention-based multi-instance learning. Next, we highlight the efforts to harmonize imaging acquisition, preprocessing, and feature extraction across centers, and the growing role of multi-omics frameworks that integrate radiomics with genomic, transcriptomic, immunologic, and clinical data to provide a more complete picture of tumor biology. As model complexity increases, explainable artificial intelligence methods (e.g., class activation maps, permutation importance, and Shapley values), structured reporting frameworks, and intrinsically interpretable model architectures should be viewed as complementary rather than competing approaches to ensure transparency, interpretability, and clinical trust. Despite major progress, key challenges persist, including confounding factors, limited public datasets, multicenter variability, inconsistent reporting, and the absence of prospective radiomics-driven clinical trials. Ultimately, radiomics will reach clinical maturity only through the joint advancement of methodological rigor, harmonization, interpretability, and multi-omics integration."

American journal of neuroradiology,"To evaluate the feasibility and technical performance of integrating a Delay Alternating with Nutation for Tailored Excitation (DANTE) preparation into a deep learning-accelerated, post-contrast T1-SPACE sequence for intracranial vessel wall imaging (IC-VWI).
In this retrospective, single-center study, 35 patients (22 women; mean age, 57.9 ± 17.1 years) underwent IC-VWI using post-contrast DL-T1-SPACE with (T1-SPACEDL+DANTE) and without (T1-SPACEDL) a DANTE preparation. Two neuroradiologists independently scored lumen and wall visualization across the arterial segments on a 4-point Likert scale (1: worst to 4: best) and graded venous flow artifacts along the middle cerebral artery (MCA), peri-mesencephalic veins (PMV), deep cerebral veins (DCV), and cortical veins (CV). Intersequence comparisons used cumulative-link mixed-effects models (CLMMs); segments were additionally pooled and analyzed as proximal versus distal. Venous flow artifact scores were compared with paired Wilcoxon tests between sequences and percentage agreement between readers. Exploratory Bland-Altman analysis was also performed for both readers.
A total of 556 vessel-segment pairs were analyzed. In CLMM analysis, T1-SPACEDL+DANTE improved lumen scores versus T1-SPACEDL (pooled OR 40.02; 95% CI 24.06-66.57; FDR p<0.001) but reduced wall scores (pooled OR 0.11; 95% CI 0.08-0.14; FDR p<0.001). By anatomic group, lumen ORs were 26.03 (proximal) and 91.93 (distal), and wall ORs were 0.12 (proximal) and 0.04 (distal) (all FDR p<0.001). Venous flow artifacts improved across all analyzed subsites (p<0.001). ±1-point inter-reader concordance was near perfect across analyses. Bland-Altman plots showed negative lumen bias (favoring T1-SPACEDL+DANTE) and positive wall bias (favoring T1-SPACEDL) without consistent proportional bias.
Adding DANTE preparation to deep-learning accelerated IC-VWI was associated with fewer flow-related artifacts and a clearer depiction of the vessel lumen, which may support a more accurate assessment of intracranial vasculopathies and aneurysms. Potential gains were accompanied by a modest wall-visualization penalty, which is not unexpected with a flow-suppression pulse."

American journal of neuroradiology,"To enable accurate 3D morphological assessment and support clinical decision making, DIVA-seg: a Deep learning-based method for Intracranial Vessel and Aneurysm segmentation from MRA-TOF using a pseudo labeling approach was developed and validated.
Three MRA-TOF datasets were used: 1) labeled data for training (n=57) and testing (n=14), 2) unlabeled data for pseudo labels (n=518), and 3) labeled data for external validation (n=82). An nnU-Net (Model 1) was iteratively trained for creating pseudo labels for Dataset 2. Cases with stable segmentation performance across iterations were selected for further training. Stable cases (n=484) were combined with Dataset 1 to train a second nnU-Net (Model 2). Performance testing on Dataset 1 and 3 comprised of Dice similarity coefficients (DSC), 95%-Hausdorff distances, 3D morphological measures, and a blinded qualitative evaluation.
DIVA-seg achieved a mean (standard deviation) internal vessel and aneurysm DSC of 0.925 (±0.025) and 0.880 (±0.045), respectively. On the external test set the DSC were 0.899 (±0.028) and 0.861 (±0.114), respectively. Mean Hausdorff distances were 0.67mm for both test sets. Bland-Altman plots showed a high agreement between 3D morphological measures from ground truth and model segmentations; however, a proportional bias was observed for voxel volume, surface area, sphericity and shape index. The qualitative evaluation showed no clear preference for either ground truth or model segmentation.
The model achieved accurate and reliable segmentation of vessels and aneurysms internally and externally while also showing high agreement between 3D morphological measures from automatic and manual segmentations, indicating its potential clinical utility.
Accurate intracranial aneurysm assessment is essential for treatment planning and risk stratification. Manual aneurysm segmentation is labor-intensive and subject to substantial inter- and intra-observer variability. Although automated segmentation approaches have been proposed, many suffer from limited accuracy, lack of robustness across datasets, or insufficient validation on heterogeneous, real-world data. As a result, reliable and generalizable tools for aneurysm segmentation and morphological analysis remain an unmet need. DIVA-seg, an nnU-Net-based model, achieved high aneurysm segmentation accuracy (DSC >0.86; HD <0.7mm) and close agreement with expert annotations in clinically relevant 3D morphological measures, demonstrating consistent performance across internal and external datasets. This work demonstrates a robust and generalizable approach for automated intracranial aneurysm segmentation, enabling reliable morphological analysis. The proposed method has the potential to streamline aneurysm monitoring, reduce observer variability, and support future automated tools for risk predictions and clinical decision making."

Photoperiod-sensitive species such as the Djungarian hamster undergo cyclical physiological adaptations in response to seasonal light cues, providing a unique framework to investigate bone adaptation during physiologically regulated phases of bone loss under endocrine and circadian control without surgical or pharmacological intervention. Female Djungarian hamsters were maintained under long-day (LD) or short-day (SD) photoperiods to induce physiological body weight loss without surgical or pharmacological intervention. Femoral and tibial bones were analyzed across mechanical, microstructural, and cellular scales using three-point bending, high-resolution microcomputed tomography, histomorphometry, and deep-learning-based quantification of bone marrow adipocytes. Under SD conditions, bone exhibited reduced mass (p=0.001), trabecular number (p=0.003), cortical thickness (p=0.009), and mechanical strength (p=0.013), along with increased marrow adiposity (p<0.001) and matrix erosion (p=0.020). These changes occurred without surgical manipulation, reflecting a physiologically driven, photoperiod induced bone loss mechanism. The Djungarian hamster provides a non-invasive framework model to study bone as a physiologically regulated biological material undergoing osteoporosis-like changes. By enabling photoperiod-controlled bone remodeling, this system offers translational opportunities to study bone material adaptation and the biological environment relevant for biomaterial performance under conditions of bone loss. Moreover, this model provides a physiologically relevant platform to study age- and endocrine-associated bone loss mechanisms and to inform the development of future osteoanabolic strategies. STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCE: Bone loss caused by disease or disuse is typically progressive and difficult to reverse, and most experimental models rely on invasive surgical or pharmacological interventions to induce osteoporosis. In contrast, photoperiod-sensitive species such as the Djungarian hamster exhibit naturally regulated, reversible skeletal adaptation. In this study, we characterize bone as a reversibly adaptive biological material under controlled photoperiod conditions. Using multiscale structural, mechanical, and histological analyses, we show that short-day photoperiods induce pronounced, physiologically regulated changes in bone microarchitecture, mechanical competence, and marrow composition without surgical manipulation. Understanding how bone adapts, deteriorates, and regains function under endogenous control may inform the development of regenerative materials and therapies capable of operating within dynamically changing and compromised skeletal environments."

Accurately predicting the interaction and binding affinity between drugs and targets is one of the key steps in modern drug development. Although traditional experimental methods are accurate, they are difficult to meet the efficiency requirements of current drug development due to high costs, low throughput, and high failure rates. In contrast, computational prediction methods are gradually becoming an indispensable auxiliary tool that can not only significantly shorten the research and development cycle and reduce experimental costs, but also improve the success rate of candidate drug screening. This review focuses on the research of drug-target interaction (DTI) and drug-target binding affinity (DTA), and systematically reviews the relevant research progress. Distinct from existing reviews, we treat large pre-trained model-based approaches as an independent paradigm, rather than subsuming them under conventional sequence- or structure-based models. The article first outlines commonly used resources and methods from the perspective of data and representation, and the computational definition of drug target prediction problem was clarified. On this basis, we have summarized the development path of computational models, from early similarity and feature driven models, to matrix decomposition, network analysis, sequence and structure modeling, and then to the emergence of large-scale pre-trained models in recent years, forming a relatively complete technological evolution path. The article also summarizes the experience at the experimental level, such as the selection of evaluation indicators, handling of cold start scenarios, design of case studies, and analysis of model interpretability. Finally, we synthesize key challenges and identify several directions for future research."

There are numerous mechanisms deployed for the identification of arrhythmias; yet, most of the techniques have been utilized sources such as Electrocardiogram (ECG). The ECG-based manual evaluation by the medical analysts is inaccurate. Some experiments have been concentrated on the accuracy and the speed of the learning method by utilizing Artificial Intelligence (AI), and pattern detection in the classification model. However, there are two primary limitations in the conventional mechanisms; the models demand large training time and demand feature selection on a manual basis. Hence, an intellectual arrhythmia classification model using deep learning is introduced to identify the irregular heartbeat. In the beginning, the required signals are accumulated from standard sources. Further, three different kinds of features are extracted for an efficient automatic classification process of arrhythmia. At first, the deep features are extracted by applying the Conditional Autoencoder, and these features are considered as feature set 1. Further, wave features and spectral features are retrieved from the input signal and these features are considered as feature set 2. Subsequently, the signals are converted into spectrogram images and the Graph Convolutional Neural Network (GCNN) technique is employed to retrieve the feature set 3 from those images. Further, the ensemble feature fusion process takes place to combine all three sets of features. Ensemble features are provided as input for the Optimal Dense Recurrent neural network with Attention Mechanism (ODR-AM) for classifying the arrhythmia. The classifier's performance is boosted by optimizing the parameters using the Augmented Random value of Giant Armadillo Optimization (ARGAO). This model is useful to know about the specific type of arrhythmia. Finally, the simulation findings of the presented model are analyzed with other conventional models."

A debate persists regarding the optimal aortic clamp occlusion strategy, with limited comparative data. The two principal strategies, which are transthoracic cross-clamping (TTCC) and endo-aortic balloon occlusion (EABO), offer distinct advantages, but comparative clinical data remain limited. This study compares the two techniques in terms of procedural safety and early outcome. Materials and Methods: This single-center retrospective study included consecutive adult patients undergoing elective MIS via video-assisted right mini-thoracotomy between 2012 and 2018 for mitral valve surgery. Tricuspid repair, atrial fibrillation and redo surgery were included in the final cohort. Aortic occlusion was performed with transthoracic cross-clamping (TTCC) or endo-aortic balloon occlusion (EABO). Primary endpoints were intra-operative complications and the rate of conversion to full sternotomy; secondary outcomes were overall mortality and Society of Thoracic Surgeons (STS)-defined comorbidities. Results: A total of 163 patients were analyzed (TTCC: n = 99, 60%; EABO: n = 64, 40%). While both techniques demonstrated equivalent safety profiles (overall mortality: 0%), EABO was associated with higher conversion to full sternotomy [(n = 7, 10.9%) vs. TTCC (n = 1, 1.3%), p = 0.016]. In a generalized estimation equations (GEE) model, no patient-level covariate predicted conversion, suggesting technical or procedural factors as the primary contributors. In addition, EABO was associated with longer cross-clamp time [median: 87 min (IQR: 73, 100) vs. TTCC median: 77 min (IQR: 65.5, 87.5), p = 0.03]. Stroke, acute kidney injury, respiratory failure, reoperation and wound infection did not differ significantly; also, hospital stay was similar between groups. Conclusions: In this single-center series, EABO showed longer operative times and a higher conversion rate to sternotomy, but without excess mortality or major complications. This may be correlated with the initial learning phase and redo cases; further comparison is needed to assess the benefits of EABO."

Em idosos, essa condição apresentou particularidades clínicas relevantes, uma vez que esteve frequentemente associada a processos degenerativos, calcificação do anel mitral e comorbidades cardiovasculares pré-existentes. As manifestações cardiovasculares foram influenciadas tanto pela progressão lenta da doença quanto pelas alterações fisiológicas do envelhecimento, favorecendo aumento da pressão atrial esquerda, congestão pulmonar e sobrecarga do ventrículo direito. Objetivo: Analisar as principais manifestações cardiovasculares associadas à estenose mitral em idosos, com ênfase nos mecanismos fisiopatológicos, repercussões hemodinâmicas e implicações clínicas descritas na literatura científica recente. Metodologia: A metodologia baseou-se no checklist PRISMA e incluiu a busca de artigos científicos publicados nos últimos 10 anos nas bases de dados PubMed, Scielo e Web of Science. Foram utilizados cinco descritores combinados: “mitral valve stenosis”, “elderly”, “cardiovascular manifestations”, “heart failure” e “atrial fibrillation”. Os critérios de inclusão compreenderam estudos originais, revisões de literatura e livros científicos que abordaram idosos com estenose mitral e descreveram manifestações cardiovasculares, publicações em inglês, português ou espanhol e textos completos disponíveis. Os critérios de exclusão incluíram estudos com populações exclusivamente pediátricas ou adultas jovens, artigos que abordaram outras valvopatias sem análise específica da estenose mitral e publicações duplicadas ou com dados insuficientes. Resultados: Os resultados demonstraram que as manifestações cardiovasculares mais frequentes foram dispneia aos esforços, fibrilação atrial decorrente da dilatação atrial esquerda, hipertensão pulmonar secundária e insuficiência cardíaca direita. A literatura destacou aumento do risco de eventos tromboembólicos, piora da capacidade funcional e maior complexidade diagnóstica em idosos devido à sobreposição de sintomas com outras doenças cardiovasculares. Conclusão: Concluiu-se que a estenose mitral em idosos apresentou manifestações cardiovasculares complexas e multifatoriais, associadas à progressão da doença valvar e ao envelhecimento cardiovascular. A identificação precoce dessas repercussões foi descrita como fundamental para o manejo clínico adequado, contribuindo para redução de complicações, melhora prognóstica e maior qualidade de vida nessa população."

With a focus on the prevalent psychological complications following the onset of this condition, this study aimed to explore the correlation between antenatal depression and Corona disease anxiety, personality traits, and postpartum depression during the COVID-19 pandemic.                                                           Materials and Methods:                     This cross-sectional descriptive-analytical study investigated women receiving care at health centers affiliated with Kerman University of Medical Sciences during the last month of their pregnancy and the postpartum period in 2022. Following the acquisition of informed consent, participants were assessed using various measures, including demographic and obstetric information, the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale, the Corona Disease Anxiety Scale (CDAS), and the NEO Personality Inventory-Revised during their third trimester of pregnancy. The same group of participants completed the Edinburgh Depression Scale and the Corona Disease Anxiety Scale (CDAS) 4-6 weeks after childbirth.                                                           Results and Discussion:                     There was a significant correlation between family income, unwanted pregnancy as perceived by both the mother and father, and antenatal depression. Additionally, marital satisfaction played a significant role in postpartum depression. Furthermore, antenatal depression was significantly associated with neuroticism, agreeableness, and physical symptoms related to Corona disease anxiety. Personality traits, with the exception of extroversion and conscientiousness, and various domains of Corona disease anxiety, excluding psychological symptoms, were also significantly associated with postpartum depression.                                                           Conclusion:                     During pandemics or epidemics, such as the COVID-19 outbreak, experiencing mental distress during pregnancy can contribute to mental health issues during the postpartum period. This risk is particularly true in individuals with unique personality traits, emphasizing the need for increased focus on mental health within prenatal care during these crises."

Method:                     This cross-sectional study was conducted in Kerman, Iran. Data were collected from patients who visited Afzalipour Hospital in Kerman more than twice during the COVID-19 epidemic from the end of February 2020 to March 21, 2021. We conducted two key analyses: 1. Mixed effect logistic regression was used to check the relationship between the variables and COVID-19 severity. 2. Mixed effect linear regression was used to check the relationship between the variables and the length of stay in the hospital.                                                           Results:                     The findings indicated that the most important risk factors for the severity of COVID-19 were heart diseases (OR=1.67,95%CI:1.20-2.30), increasing age (OR=2.23 for age&gt;54, 95%CI:1.70- 2.90), male gender (OR=1.47,95%CI:1.10-1.96), respiratory diseases other than asthma, and frequency of admission (OR=1.60,95%CI:1.20-2.15). All patients who underwent readmission experienced a shorter duration of hospitalization during their subsequent admission (OR=0.94,95%CI:0.91,0.96) and had a higher mortality rate (30% within 14 days, 26.6% between 14-90 days). Patients readmitted at intervals of 14-90 days and greater than 90 days exhibited lower disease severity compared to those readmitted within the 0-14 day period.                                                           Conclusion:                     Examining readmissions, the severity of COVID-19, and the length of hospital stay in affected patients are important factors for planning and allocating resources for COVID-19 management and treatment. These factors can help policymakers develop effective clinical guidelines for hospitalization or outpatient treatment of COVID-19 patients and contribute to reducing the burden of disease in the community."

Kinovea, as an accessible motion-analysis software, provides both visual and quantitative feedback. However, its application in supporting technique development among beginner athletes remains insufficiently explored. Aim: This study aims to describe the use of Kinovea in biomechanics training and examine its contribution to the awareness of kinematic characteristics and movement techniques among beginner athletes. Methods: A descriptive qualitative design involved 72 beginner athletes aged 18–25 years selected through purposive sampling. Data were collected over 16 weeks through interviews, field observations, and motion video recordings analyzed using Kinovea. Kinematic data focused on joint angles, stride behavior, and movement phases during walking, running, and the flight phase. Qualitative data were analyzed using content analysis with NVivo 12, while kinematic results were interpreted descriptively to identify performance patterns and areas for technical refinement. Result: Kinematic analysis showed coordinated joint-angle patterns across all phases. Walking analysis identified arm swing angles of 50.9°–58.8° and leg separation angles of 64.3°–67.2°, indicating a stable gait rhythm. The running analysis revealed knee angles of 68.8°–69.8° and elbow angles of 87.6°–89.1°, indicating efficient propulsive mechanics. The flight phase demonstrated knee angles of 81.2°–87.8° and elbow angles of 80.4°–88.3°, suggesting effective momentum use and postural stability. These measurements supported stride-efficiency assessment and technique evaluation. Qualitative findings revealed that Kinovea enabled athletes to interpret movement phases and identify technical inefficiencies through slow-motion and frame-by-frame visualization. Conclusion: Kinovea supports basic motion analysis by providing clear kinematic information and helping beginner athletes observe and refine their movement techniques. The findings also offer practical value for coaches by enabling more precise identification of inefficient patterns and guiding targeted corrections during early-stage training."

OpenAlex,deep learning,Combating Data and Target Shifts in Visual Tasks,Zhaorui Tan,10.17638/03194353,2031-01-01,University of Liverpool,"The rapid advancement of deep learning models for visual tasks has led to significant progress in many domains. However, a key challenge remains: ensuring that models can generalize effectively to unseen samples or novel classes, especially in real-world scenarios where training data-target pairs are often limited or unavailable, and test data may exhibit shifts in both data and targets. This thesis addresses the problem of shifts across data and targets, proposing novel methods to improve model generalization and transferability in complex settings. The thesis identifies the different shift scenarios for visual tasks and presents their problem forms. The research first relaxes the static target distribution assumption in Multi-Domain Generalization (mDG) tasks, introducing the General Multi-Domain Generalization (GMDG) objective to improve generalization under varying data shifts. Specifically, Extensive experiments validate that GMDG is feasible for classification, segmentation, and regression tasks. Further considering extreme target distribution shifts where even unknown novel classes emerge, the study also explores logical regularization techniques for tasks such as Generalized Category Discovery (GCD), mDG+GCD, and Class Incremental Learning (CIL), proposing a sample-based logical regularization term (L-Reg) to enhance data-, target-, and all-shift generalization. Additionally, a partial logic framework is introduced to address challenges in CIL, enabling models to retain room for unknown classes during training. This is further extended by the Partial-Logic Regularization (PL-Reg), which improves generalization across GCD, mDG+GCD, and transferability for CIL tasks. Furthermore, the thesis proposes a novel Semantic-aware Data Augmentation (SADA) framework for cross-modality generalization in text-to-image synthesis (T2Isyn), text-image retrieval (TIR), and image-text retrieval (ITR) tasks. This framework ensures semantic preservation across text and image modalities, improving both semantic consistency and image quality in cross-modality tasks. The methods proposed in this thesis offer significant advancements in visual generalization and transfer scenarios, providing theoretical insights and practical solutions for handling data shifts, target shifts, and multi-modalities in complex scenarios. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of the proposed methods, demonstrating their superior performance across a range of tasks."
OpenAlex,deep learning,Antecedents and consequences of Green-tech FDI in emerging markets,Zhuoran Liu,10.17638/03195308,2031-01-01,University of Liverpool,"As environmental pressures intensify, attracting sustainable foreign direct investment (FDI), particularly green-tech FDI, has become a critical pathway for emerging markets to achieve environmental sustainability. However, existing research remains fragmented, offering limited insights into why green-tech FDI enters emerging markets and how it affects regional green innovation. This thesis addresses these gaps by systematically examining both the antecedents and consequences of green-tech FDI through three empirical studies using regional data from China. Study 1 and Study 2 focus on the antecedents of green-tech FDI. Study 1 examines how host-country conditions can attract green-tech FDI, highlighting the role of environmental management information disclosure (EMID) by domestic firms in reducing information gaps and strengthening green market–seeking motives. Study 2 shifts attention to the active decision-making of green-tech FDI, showing that under uncertainty, green-tech foreign investors engage in identity-based bandwagon learning by imitating peers with similar green identities, thereby mitigating investment risks. Study 3 turns to the consequences of green-tech FDI. It demonstrates that, due to the technological complexity of green innovation and limited absorptive capacity in emerging markets, green-tech FDI may generate crowding-out effects rather than purely positive spillovers. Adopting a network perspective, the study further finds that universities play a key moderating role: through broad linkages and deep collaborations, they help mitigate negative spillovers and facilitate the diffusion of green technologies. Together, the three studies advance the literature on sustainable FDI by differentiating green-tech FDI from general FDI and identifying the specific mechanisms that shape its entry decisions and local innovation outcomes. Practically, the findings provide guidance for emerging-market governments and firms on how to attract and manage sustainable investment, balance growth with environmental objectives, and strengthen local innovation ecosystems."
OpenAlex,deep learning,A UAV-Based Framework for Community-Scale Residential Building Energy Modelling in China,Mengfan Jin,10.17638/03195460,2029-01-01,University of Liverpool,"With increasing emphasis on energy efficiency and carbon emission reduction in the building sector, rapid and scalable energy modelling of existing buildings is critical for retrofit projects and policy development. Conventional surveys, data collection and energy modelling processes remain labour-intensive and impractical for large-scale applications, and energy modelling often dominates project time and cost. Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) equipped with high-resolution and infrared cameras now offer fast and safe exterior surveys, showing great potential in building energy assessments. Yet, a systematic framework for UAV integration, from image capture through processing to inputs for building energy simulation, has not been established. This research addresses these challenges by developing a structured framework for community-scale building energy modelling, which integrates UAV photogrammetry to accelerate data acquisition, reduce labour, and shorten energy modelling time for retrofit projects. The framework is designed to minimise prior data requirements while maximising automation and retaining sufficient accuracy and reliability. It also addressed systemic issues, such as the lack of data necessary to fully exploit the potential of available technologies in the context of this study. To achieve this research objective, a mixed-methodology approach, combining desk studies and fieldwork, was adopted. First, a comprehensive review of UAV-based building energy studies mapped the current applications and available tools, proposing a preliminary framework. Fieldwork then encompassed a pilot study and a detailed case study. In the pilot test, a single building was surveyed to identify an optimal toolchain for flight planning, image capture, photogrammetric reconstruction, model generation, and selection of a simulation platform. The resulting refined framework was applied to a case study of a 39-building community, and it was demonstrated that further automation was necessary. The potential for automation was then further explored. Geomatic algorithms, machine learning, and deep learning techniques were compared, and the combination that best balanced accuracy and processing time was selected for 3D model generation and window-to-wall ratio (WWR) extraction. In parallel, an archetype library of residential buildings in the Hot Summer Cold Winter (HSCW) zone in China was compiled to facilitate the assignment of thermal parameters. Finally, a reusable community-scale building energy modelling (CBEM) workflow was assembled in Grasshopper using Ladybug Tools components to process the aforementioned inputs. In conclusion, this study integrates UAV photogrammetry, GIS-based geomatic algorithms, machine learning, and graphical programming to develop an UAV-CBEM framework. The outcomes establish a foundation for scalable UAV-based building energy assessments, enhancing applicability in data-limited and large-scale settings worldwide."

OpenAlex,deep learning,Unsupervised Deep-learning Methods for Low-dose Computed Tomography Reconstruction,Ran An,10.17638/03194237,2027-01-01,University of Liverpool,"Computed tomography (CT) has become an indispensable imaging technique in medical diagnostics and industrial applications, owing to its non-invasive nature and high resolution in visualizing object internal structures. While X-ray CT (X-ray computed tomography) significantly enhances lesion detection capabilities, excessive exposure to X-ray radiation raises substantial health concerns, including elevated cancer risks and potential genetic damage. Although low-dose CT (LDCT) protocols reduce radiation safety concerns, they inevitably introduce severe noise and artifacts, which might compromise diagnostic accuracy. Recent advances in supervised deep learning approaches have demonstrated remarkable success in LDCT reconstruction. However, the reliance on paired training data severely limits their deployment in practical CT applications. This fundamental constraint highlights the critical importance of developing unsupervised reconstruction methods. Although existing unsupervised LDCT methods have made notable progress, they still face challenges requiring systematic solutions. This thesis makes three contributions to advance the field of unsupervised LDCT reconstruction: 1. Current dual-domain self-supervised LDCT denoising methods typically neglect the heterogeneity of the non-stationary Gaussian noise levels in low-dose sinograms and usually treat them as common images without appropriately controlling the denoising strength. The denoisers employed by them, which are based on classic convolutional neural networks (CNN), will lead to blurring artifacts in the reconstructed images if directly used for sinogram denoising. In addition, the denoising strength in the sinogram and image domains must be well-balanced to avoid introducing over-blurring or secondary artifacts in the reconstructed images, but existing approaches do not focus on this crucial point. To address these limitations, this thesis proposes a novel end-to-end dual-domain self-supervised framework for LDCT denoising. It employs Dropblock layers to adaptively localize the effect of convolution for sinogram denoising and sets a weighted average between the denoised sinograms and their noisy counterparts to better control the denoising strength, thus effectively reducing the blurring artifacts and leading to a well-balanced dual-domain denoising. Numerical experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and superior performance of the proposed method. 2. Existing normalizing flows (NFs)-based unsupervised LDCT reconstruction methods face challenges in both image quality and computational efficiency. On one hand, they typically utilize a two-way transformation strategy between noisy images and latent variables, which could easily lead to detail loss and secondary artifacts in the reconstructed images. On the other hand, training NFs on high-resolution CT images is computationally intensive. Although conditional normalizing flows (CNFs) can mitigate computational costs by learning conditional probabilities, existing approaches rely on labeled data for conditionalization, leaving unsupervised CNFs-based LDCT reconstruction a challenge. To tackle these issues, this thesis proposes a novel unsupervised LDCT iterative reconstruction algorithm based on CNFs. The proposed method employs a strict one-way transformation strategy during the alternating optimization in the dual spaces to prevent detail loss and secondary artifacts, and proposes a novel unsupervised conditionalization strategy for CNFs, thus achieving efficient training and inference on high-resolution images. The proposed method illustrates high-quality and relatively fast unsupervised reconstruction. Experiments across two datasets demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed method by rivaling several state-of-the-art methods. 3. Current diffusion model-based LDCT reconstruction methods solely employ the prior distributions learned from normal-dose CT data but neglect the valuable priors in low-dose data, which contain information about the characteristics of low-dose noise and artifacts. In addition, their reconstruction speed suffers from multiple sampling steps, presenting low efficiency. Breaking new ground in prior utilization, this thesis proposes a novel unsupervised LDCT iterative reconstruction algorithm based on dual denoising diffusion probabilistic models (DDPM), which leverages both normal-dose and low-dose priors. Specifically, the proposed method employs two DDPMs to learn the prior distributions from normal-dose and low-dose images, respectively, and incorporates them into a joint iterative reconstruction framework. To accelerate the reconstruction, partial diffusion sampling and single-pass deterministic reconstruction strategy are utilized in the proposed method, as well as the spaced OS-SART approaches. Experiments at different dose levels demonstrate the outstanding performance and fast speed of the proposed reconstruction algorithm. Through these innovations and contributions, this thesis addresses some significant challenges in current deep-learning-based unsupervised LDCT reconstruction methods, and proposes three novel unsupervised reconstruction algorithms. The proposed methods effectively improve the performance and efficiency of LDCT reconstruction under different unsupervised learning conditions, and provide some new perspectives and inspirations for future research."
OpenAlex,deep learning,From Sparse to Dense: Label-Efficient Weakly Supervised Segmentation for Images and Videos,Jian Wang,10.17638/03195330,2027-01-01,University of Liverpool,"Obtaining high-quality annotated data has become a primary bottleneck for training deep learning models, particularly for dense prediction tasks like semantic segmentation and video salient object segmentation. The demand for meticulous, pixel-level labeling makes fully-supervised approaches prohibitively expensive and limits their scalability. This thesis directly confronts this issue by proposing and systematically investigating a label-efficient ""sparse-to-dense'' paradigm. The core objective is to develop innovative frameworks that can learn from sparse, inexpensive weak supervision—such as image-level tags or scribbles—and intelligently propagate this minimal information to generate complete, pixel-accurate dense predictions. The major part of this thesis focuses on the ""sparse-to-dense'' challenge within Weakly Supervised Semantic Segmentation (WSSS) for images, where models learn from only image-level tags. Dominant approaches rely on Class Activation Maps (CAMs) as initial object seeds. However, CAMs inherently activate only the most discriminative object regions, leading to incomplete pseudo-labels. This gives rise to the central problem of activation densification: the critical process of expanding these sparse activations to cover the full extent of an object. Our research addresses this challenge through a progressive, multi-faceted strategy. Our exploration begins with a foundational framework (C3) designed to rectify the intrinsic flaws of initial CAMs. We propose a synergistic mutual calibration method. This method leverages the discrepancies between the two maps to generate local prototypes, which are simultaneously utilized to complete missing object parts and suppress background noise, yielding a significantly more accurate and complete initial seed. This foundational work immediately reveals the limitation of single-prototype instability and its inability to capture diverse features. Building on this foundation, we then develop architecture-specific strategies to address deeper limitations of the prototype-based approach. For Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) (C4), the use of a single prototype proves insufficient to capture significant intra-class variation. In response, we introduce an Optimal Transport (OT)-assisted framework that effectively mines multiple, diverse prototypes, thereby yielding more comprehensive activation maps. However, while C4 solves the intra-class diversity problem, the inherent local context constraint of the CNN architecture becomes the new bottleneck, fundamentally limiting the quality of globally-aware feature extraction needed for optimal multi-prototype assignment. This limitation necessitates a shift in architectural focus from CNNs to Vision Transformers. In the ViT architecture (C5), a new challenge arises where the token gap between the discriminative class token and varied patch tokens leads to incomplete activation. To bridge this gap, we leverage a tailored application of Optimal Transport, where the algorithm is tasked with learning a comprehensive proxy to ensure complete object activation. Despite these architectural advances (C3-C5), the overall WSSS performance hit a ceiling. This is fundamentally limited by the sparse supervision of class labels, which cannot provide precise boundary information. To break this ceiling, our WSSS exploration culminates in a universal enhancement strategy (C6) that transcends architecture-specific designs by leveraging Visual Foundation Models (VFMs). We resolve the conflict between the discriminative nature of initial CAMs and the VFM's need for holistic prompts. By modeling the CAM foreground as a graph and employing spectral analysis, our method intelligently selects a diverse set of prompt points that represent the overall structure of the foreground object. This guides the VFM to generate superior, boundary-aware supervision that can universally enhance any WSSS pipeline. Subsequently, the thesis extends the ""sparse-to-dense'' paradigm to the dynamic domain of video, addressing Weakly Supervised Video Salient Object Segmentation (WSVSOS) (C7) from sparse scribble annotations. In this specific context, the challenge evolves into spatio-temporal densification, which requires both full-object coverage within each frame and temporal consistency across the video sequences. To this end, we introduce the core CFMR framework, which utilizes Spatio-Temporal co-regulation. This framework is subsequently enhanced (CFMR+) by integrating the VFM guidance strategy from C6, which provides high-quality spatial priors essential for ensuring both high spatial detail and inter-frame consistency. By enforcing both intra-frame and cross-frame consistency between these two streams, our method effectively propagates the sparse initial signal to generate dense and temporally coherent saliency masks. In conclusion, this thesis presents a comprehensive and cohesive investigation into label-efficient segmentation tasks, offering a suite of innovative and effective strategies for the ""sparse-to-dense'' challenge. Our work establishes a progressive roadmap that systematically overcomes architectural and semantic limitations, culminating in highly robust and generalized densification pipelines. Our extensive experimental results on standard benchmarks validate the state-of-the-art performance of these methods, providing robust solutions to a long-standing problem in the computer vision field."

El sistema aplica un proceso de limpieza, interpolación temporal y transformación de variables, incluyendo la codificación cíclica del tiempo y la conversión espacial a coordenadas UTM, lo que permite una fusión precisa entre datos geográficos y meteorológicos mediante técnicas como la ponderación por distancia inversa (IDW). El modelo predictivo se basa en una red neuronal LSTM, especialmente adaptada para secuencias temporales multivariables. Se entrena utilizando una estrategia de ventana deslizante a 32 muestras (7 horas y 45 minutos) para predecir la intensidad de tráfico en el siguiente intervalo. El sistema incorpora además mecanismo de IterableDataset para manejar grandes volúmenes de datos de entrenamiento sin comprometer la estabilidad del entorno. Los resultados obtenidos muestran una precisión robusta en escenarios de validación, con errores de predicción (MAE y RMSE) aceptable. Además, se ha desarrollado una interfaz web interactiva, que permite el despliegue local del sistema, con capacidad de ingestión de datos en tiempo real y visualización directa de las predicciones. Ente trabajo demuestra la viabilidad técnica y operativa de aplicar aprendizaje profundo al análisis de tráfico urbano, y sienta las bases para su evolución futura hacia sistemas más generalizables, robustos y útiles en contexto reales de ciudad inteligente. Abstract This Project develops an urban traffic intensity prediction system using deep learning techniques, with the aim of improving mobility decision-making. Unlike other platforms focused on visualizing the current state, the proposed solution seeks to anticipate future behaviors, and is positioned as an open, replicable alternative specifically oriented towards prediction. To achieve this, a modular architecture based on the Python language has been designed, capable of integrating multiple open data sources: historical traffic records, historical weather situation data, and spatial coordinates of measurement sensors. The system applies a process of cleaning, temporal interpolation, and variable transformation, including cyclic encoding of time and spatial conversion to UTM coordinates, allowing for precise fusion between geographical and meteorological data through techniques such as inverse distance weighting (IDW). The predictive model is based on an LSTM neural network, especially adapted for multivariate time sequences. It is trained using a sliding window strategy of 32 samples (7 hours and 45 minutes) to predict traffic intensity in the next interval. The system additionally incorporates an IterableDataset mechanism to handle large volumes of training data without compromising the stability of the environment. The obtained results show robust accuracy in validation scenarios, with acceptable prediction errors (MAE and RMSE). Furthermore, an interactive web interface has been developed, allowing for the local deployment of the system, with the capacity for real-time data ingestion and direct visualization of predictions. This work demonstrates the technical and operational feasibility of applying deep learning to urban traffic analysis and lays the groundwork for its future evolution towards more generalizable, robust, and useful systems in real smart city contexts."
OpenAlex,deep learning,Deep Learning-Based Data Hiding Technique for Medical Images,Hadjer SAIDI,,2026-06-26,University of Biskra Theses Repository (University of Biskra),"This thesis introduces novel deep learning-based frameworks for secure medical image steganography, addressing the critical challenge of protecting sensitive patient information while preserving diagnostic quality. Medical images present unique security requirements due to their dual nature: containing both critical visual data for diagnosis and sensitive patient metadata, which conventional steganographic techniques do not adequately address. Our work presents two complementary approaches to this challenge. First, we develop a Mask-RCNN based framework that intelligently identifies diagnostically insignificant regions within medical images for strategic data embedding. By combining this regionaware detection with Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) embedding in the frequency domain, our method achieves remarkable imperceptibility with Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR) values exceeding 115 dB while maintaining high payload capacity. Second, we propose a clinical quality-aware convolutional neural network architecture that leverages an encoder-decoder framework for end-to-end steganography. This approach employs parallel processing paths with scaled residual learning to embed secret medical images within cover images while preserving diagnostic features. Extensive experimentation across multiple medical imaging modalities (CT, MRI) from datasets including MIDRC-RICORD-1B, and IQ-OTH/NCCD, demonstrates that our method achieves a good trade-off between payload and imperceptibility. The frameworks developed in this thesis achieve an optimal balance between embedding capacity, imperceptibility, and robust secret recovery, providing healthcare institutions with effective tools for safeguarding patient privacy while maintaining the integrity of medical diagnostics. This work significantly advances the field of medical image security and establishes a foundation for future innovations in secure healthcare information systems."
OpenAlex,deep learning,A Novel Deep-Learning-Based Approach for Estimating High-Resolution InSAR Parameters,"Dell Amore, Luca; Carcereri, Daniel; Demir, Begüm; Rizzoli, Paola",,2026-06-01,elib (German Aerospace Center),"Nowadays, SAR Interferometry (InSAR) represents one of the most powerful tools to perform complex tasks, such as retrieving Earth’s surface topography and monitoring its deformations. However, denoising strategies are crucial for the generation of reliable and high-quality InSAR products. In this framework, we propose a complete and generalized theoretical and statistical model to physically describe and simulate a noise-free interferogram, together with its corresponding noisy version, starting from the knowledge of the InSAR acquisition geometry and of the underlying topography. A deep-learning-based model is then trained in a fully-supervised manner to estimate high-resolution InSAR parameters, i.e. coherence and interferometric phase, leveraging the proposed statistical model. In particular, an accurate assessment of the network’s estimation performance is conducted by comparing it to state-of-the-art denoising filters, such as Boxcar and Phi-Net and showing the added value of the proposed theoretical modifications to the state-of-the-art literature."
