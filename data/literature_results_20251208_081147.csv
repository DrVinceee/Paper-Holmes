PubMed,aortic stenosis,The prognostic value of N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide in patients with severe aortic stenosis and preserved ejection fraction.,Akiva Rosenzveig; Shivabalan Kathavarayan Ramu; Ankit Agrawal; Rohan Prasad; Akhilesh Khuttan; Tamari Lomaia; Besir Besir; Judah Rajendran; Osamah Badwan; James Yun; Zoran Popovic; Grant Reed; Rishi Puri; Amar Krishnaswamy; Serge Harb; Samir R Kapadia,10.1016/j.pcad.2025.11.008,2025-12-04,Progress in cardiovascular diseases,"Transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) is increasingly utilized for severe aortic stenosis (AS), yet optimal risk stratification remains challenging, particularly in patients with preserved ejection fraction (EF). Diastolic dysfunction (DD) has been reported in up to 54.4 % of TAVR patients (predominantly grade 1) and severe (grade 3) DD in ~13.4 % in prior cohorts and predicts poor outcomes. N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-pro-BNP), a marker of ventricular stress, shows promise in enhancing risk assessment. This study evaluates NT-pro-BNP's utility in detecting DD and predicting outcomes in severe AS patients with preserved EF undergoing TAVR.
This retrospective study included 1594 patients with severe AS (aortic valve area < 1 cm2) and EF ≥50 % undergoing TAVR at Cleveland Clinic (2016-2020). Of these, 784 had complete echocardiographic DD data. Pre- and post-TAVR NT-pro-BNP levels, clinical, and echocardiographic parameters were analyzed. DD was classified using Mitral valve (MV) E/e', tricuspid regurgitation (TR) velocity, and left atrial volume index (LAVi). The Youden Index determined the optimal NT-pro-BNP cut-off, with outcomes assessed via Kaplan-Meier and Cox regression analyses.
NT-pro-BNP correlated with DD severity, with a cut-off of 802 pg/mL (sensitivity 62.3 %, specificity 54.1 %) identified. Higher NT-pro-BNP tertiles were linked to worse baseline characteristics (e.g., NYHA III/IV 65.7 %-82.5 %, p = 0.02) and echocardiographic DD markers (e.g., LAVi 37.61-50.14 mL/m2, p < 0.001). Post-TAVR, NT-pro-BNP >802 pg/mL predicted increased mortality, heart failure hospitalizations, and prolonged length of stay (p < 0.001), with Cox regression confirming NT-pro-BNP as an independent predictor (OR 1.645, 95 % CI: 1.244-2.174).
NT-proBNP should be considered a complementary biomarker of DD and predicts adverse outcomes in severe AS patients with preserved EF undergoing TAVR, supporting its integration into pre-procedural risk stratification to optimize management."

Currently available lipid-lowering pharmacotherapies have limited effects on elevated levels of Lp(a) and several new therapies are in development to lower Lp(a).
This article reviews the novel therapies in development to reduce Lp(a) in patients with elevated levels. These were identified by a PubMed search and mainly focus on the drugs that are at an advanced stage of development.
The N-acetylgalactosamine (GalNAc)-conjugated antisense oligonucleotide (ASO) pelacarsen and the small-interfering RNA (siRNA) agents olpasiran, lepodisiran and zerlasiran have all been shown to be safe and effective in lowering Lp(a) levels between 80% and almost 100%. Pelacarsen, olpasiran, and lepodisiran are being tested in phase 3 cardiovascular outcome studies and the first results may be available in 2026. Muvalaplin is a small molecule given orally once daily and reduces Lp(a) by up to 65%. It is also being assessed in a cardiovascular outcome study. It will be essential to identify what baseline level of Lp(a) is needed and what degree of Lp(a) lowering is required to produce a cardiovascular benefit and whether aggressive lowering of Lp(a) has any adverse effects."

Publicly available trial information (ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT06861361) was reviewed, and the design was benchmarked against the minimum expected methodological standards for generating practice-changing evidence in patients with very long life expectancy (LE) following SAVR. The appraisal domains included objectives and study endpoints; selected non-inferiority (NI) margins; adequacy of follow-up for late events; statistical analysis plans and handling of crossovers/missing data; consistency of surgical comparators; and prespecified sub-groups.
Several major concerns were identified: (1) co-primary safety/efficacy composites mix hard adverse events (death, stroke) with softer outcomes, with rehospitalization likely to dominate; (2) limited duration primary follow-up (30 days/1 year), with only optional survaillance beyond 5 years, inadequate for durability and late hazards; (3) wide NI margins (7%-8%) that could accept clinically meaningful inferiority; (4) an unclear statistical analysis plan; (5) a device-specific TAVI arm versus heterogeneous SAVR comparator; and (6) up to 25% bicuspid anatomy without stratified randomization or powered analyses. Collectively, these choices markedly increase the risks of type I error, and misinterpretation in a population with likely crossing hazard curves and a long median LE comparable to that of the age-matched general population after SAVR.
In order to generate guideline-informing evidence for extending TAVI to younger patients with severe AS, the trial should prioritise hard adverse endpoints, tighten NI margins, mandate extended follow-up, standardise the surgical comparator, and adequately power the bicuspid subgroup. Without these revisions, continuing the study under the current protocol risks yielding biased, non-guideline informative results."
PubMed,aortic stenosis,Early comparison of one-year outcomes after aortic mechanical vs. biological valve replacement in Chinese patients with small aortic annulus.,Yu Sun; Yang Gao; Wen Xiao; Zimo Wang; Yonglei Liu; Xiao Wang; Laichun Song,10.1186/s13019-025-03614-4,2025-12-05,Journal of cardiothoracic surgery,"This study compares short-term clinical and hemodynamic outcomes of AVR using mechanical versus bovine pericardial valves in patients with a small aortic annulus (≤ 21 mm) and evaluates the feasibility and safety of AVR in this population.
Between November 2020 and November 2022, 142 patients with a small aortic valve annulus underwent AVR at Wuhan Asia Heart Hospital, with 73 patients in mechanical group and 69 in biological group. All patients met the surgical criteria for AVR. Baseline data, historical diseases, preoperative and follow-up echocardiographic results, and surgical-related data were shown in this study.
All patients successfully underwent surgery. In the mechanical valve group, four perioperative deaths occurred due to multiple organ failure, respiratory and cardiac arrest and circulatory failure. After one-year follow-up, hemodynamic parameters improved in both groups compared with preoperative values. Although the mechanical valve group demonstrated lower peak pressure gradients and maximum velocity compared with the bioprosthetic valve group in the follow-up period (P < 0.05), the bioprosthetic valve group exhibited shorter Intensive Care Unit (ICU) stay(3.6 ± 2.5d vs. 5.3 ± 7.9d, P < 0.001 ) and cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) times (178.1 ± 89.0 min vs. 192.4 ± 124.3 min, P = 0.032), and fewer postoperative complications at the one-year follow-up (4.3% vs. 14.9%, P = 0.026). No cerebrovascular events, valve dysfunction, or structural valve degeneration were observed in either group during the follow-up period.
Both mechanical and bioprosthetic valves showed excellent short-term outcomes in small aortic annulus patients. Bioprosthetic valves were comparable to mechanical valves, with potential benefits in reducing ICU stay, CPB time, and complications. For elderly patients, bioprosthetic valves are a safe and effective alternative in small aortic annulus AVR."

Epilepsy incurs a higher risk for developing CVD with an odds ratio of 2.25. CVDs can influence the function of the brain, and many brain diseases are linked with CV dysfunction, in a resiprocal relationship (neurocardiac axis). In patients with epilepsy, interactions along this neuro-cardiac axis appear to be involved in CVDs, such as hypertension and cardiac arrhythmias including atrial fibrillation, long QT syndrome, catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia, and sudden cardiac death (SCD) in epilepsy. Heart-brain interactions may comprise 2 wide categories: CV effects of neurological disease and neurological effects of CVD. The pathogenesis of neurogenic CV effects may involve a neurogenic cascade where sudden shifts in autonomic balance lead to an exaggerated catecholamine release. This can occur in acute neurological conditions such as ischemic stroke, intracranial hemorrhage, and epilepsy. Cardiovascular complications comprise the stroke-heart syndrome, neurogenic pulmonary edema and cardiomyopathy, Takotsubo syndrome, cardiac arrhythmias, and SCD. Specific areas of the brain, such as the insular cortex, play key roles in cardiac autonomic regulation, and disorders involving these areas have greater effects on the CV system. On the other hand, CV conditions can adversely influence the neurological system. Atrial fibrillation and intracardiac thrombus can cause cardioembolic strokes, whereas heart failure and severe aortic stenosis might account for cognitive impairment. This neuro-cardiac axis is herein detailed and the heart-lung-brain interactions in patients with epilepsy are pictorially illustrated. The epileptogenic and anti-epileptogenic medications and the results of reports of meta-analyses on the CV outcomes of patients with epilepsy are tabulated."

This meta-analysis aims to compare the clinical outcomes of TAVR in IC versus non-IC patients. A comprehensive search was conducted across PubMed, EMBASE, and Cochrane Central for randomized controlled trials and observational studies that compared outcomes between IC and non-IC patients undergoing TAVR. Primary outcomes included 1-year all-cause, cardiovascular (CV) and non-CV mortality. Secondary outcomes included new permanent pacemaker implantation (PPI) and major periprocedural complications. 4,478 patients in seven studies (mean age 80.5 years, 7.64% IC) were included in the analysis. As compared with non-IC patients, IC patients exhibited a similar 30-day death rate (Odds Ratio (OR) 1.62; 95% Confidence Interval (CI) 0.68 - 3.98; p=0.297), but significantly higher 1-year all-cause mortality (OR 2.39; 95% CI 1.55 - 3.70; p < 0.001). Notably, IC patients demonstrated a lower risk of CV death (OR 0.24; 95% CI 0.10 - 0.59; p = 0.002) but a higher risk of non-CV death (OR 4.16; 95% CI 1.70 - 10.18; p = 0.002). There was no difference in the rate of new PPI or major periprocedural complications. In conclusion, TAVR is a safe and effective treatment strategy in IC patients, with similar short-term mortality and increased medium-term mortality risk as compared with non-IC patients.

Cardiovascular imaging,"Chronic aortic regurgitation (AR) is associated with significant cardiac remodeling, but the prevalence and prognostic impact of extravalvular cardiac damage remain unexplored.
Adults with moderate or greater chronic AR identified on echocardiogram between January 2008 and July 2024 were included. Exclusion criteria were acute AR, hypertrophic and infiltrative cardiomyopathies, prior cardiac surgery, and valve stenosis. Cardiac damage was classified into hierarchical stages: no cardiac damage (stage 0), left ventricular damage (stage 1), moderate or greater mitral regurgitation or left atrial damage (stage 2), pulmonary hypertension or moderate or greater tricuspid regurgitation (stage 3), and significant right ventricular dysfunction (stage 4). The primary outcome was the association between cardiac damage stages and all-cause mortality under medical surveillance.
Of 4026 patients (median age, 72 [61-80] years), 78% had moderate AR, 11% had moderate-severe, and 11% had severe AR. Cardiac damage was present in 87% of patients: 14% in stage 1, 53% in stage 2, 18% in stage 3, and 2% in stage 4. In a multivariable model, including age, sex, AR severity, and Charlson Comorbidity Index, cardiac damage stages were associated with mortality. Adjusted hazard ratios were 1.42 (95% CI, 1.04-1.96) for stage 1, 1.58 (95% CI, 1.21-2.06) for stage 2, 2.78 (95% CI, 2.10-3.67) for stage 3, and 5.34 (95% CI, 3.67-7.76) for stage 4. Adding cardiac damage staging to multivariable models improved predictive accuracy for mortality, increasing the concordance statistics from 0.73 (95% CI, 0.71-0.75) to 0.76 (95% CI, 0.74-0.77).
Cardiac damage is present in nearly 90% of patients with moderate or greater AR and is associated with increased mortality, highlighting the need for a more comprehensive evaluation of cardiac structure and function beyond the aortic valve and left ventricle."
PubMed,aortic stenosis,"A ""Watchful Surgery"" Approach: Timing and Valve Choice for Mildly Symptomatic Mitral and Aortic Valve Disease.",Shaanali Mukadam; Chang Kon Kim; Devendra K Agrawal,10.26502/jsr.10020472,2025,Journal of surgery and research,"The timing of surgical intervention and prosthesis selection in mildly symptomatic aortic and mitral valve disease remain an area of clinical uncertainty. Symptom-based referral often occurs after the onset of adverse ventricular remodeling, whereas earlier surgery may improve long-term outcomes but introduces procedural risk. This article synthesized contemporary evidence to delineate optimal strategies in this intermediate-risk population. In aortic stenosis, randomized trials including RECOVERY and AVATAR demonstrate that early surgical aortic valve replacement reduces heart failure events and may improve survival. In aortic and mitral regurgitation, observational data associate early intervention, triggered by mild symptoms or subclinical ventricular dysfunction, with improved survival and preservation of cardiac function. Emerging modalities such as global longitudinal strain and natriuretic peptide biomarkers enhance risk stratification in asymptomatic individuals. Prosthesis selection is primarily informed by patient age, comorbidity burden, and anticoagulation tolerance. Mechanical valves confer superior durability and lower reoperation risk in younger patients. Bioprosthetic valves are increasingly favored in older adults due to compatibility with transcatheter valve-in-valve reintervention and avoidance of lifelong anticoagulation. Comparative cohort studies and meta-analyses suggest a survival benefit for mechanical valves up to approximately 65-to-70 years of age, beyond which the benefit diminishes due to competing mortality risks. Evidence supports timely surgical referral in mildly symptomatic patients, particularly in the presence of early imaging or biomarker evidence of ventricular dysfunction. Individualized decision-making through multidisciplinary heart team evaluation remains essential. Further investigations are warranted to define long-term prosthetic durability and the role of early surgery in valvular regurgitation."

To delineate a comprehensive bibliometric panorama of artificial intelligence applications in cardiovascular medicine over the past decade, and to furnish evidence-based, actionable, decision-making references for researchers, policymakers and clinicians in this domain.
We conducted a bibliometric analysis of publications on artificial intelligence applications in cardiovascular medicine from 2015 to 2024, sourced from the Web of Science Core Collection database. Visualization and analysis were performed using VOSviewer, CiteSpace and the R package ""bibliometrix"".
A total of 914 articles from 76 countries were analysed, revealing significant growth in research output. The USA and China led in publication volume, Harvard University was the most prolific institution and Frontiers in Cardiovascular Medicine emerged as the leading journal. Johnson et al. (2018), published in the Journal of the American College of Cardiology, was the most cited article, and ""prediction"" and ""classification"" were identified as primary research hotspots. Emerging research directions included cardiomyopathy and aortic stenosis, with an emphasis on predictive analytics, disease classification, healthcare modelling and coronary artery disease.
This bibliometric analysis highlights robust growth and global collaboration in artificial intelligence applications within cardiovascular medicine. Current research emphasizes predictive analytics and disease classification, focusing increasingly on cardiomyopathy and aortic stenosis. This study provides insights into current trends, identifies research gaps and suggests potential avenues for future studies, facilitating further innovation and clinical translation in cardiovascular medicine."

Case reports,"Patients with cardiogenic shock secondary to severe aortic stenosis represent a population at exceedingly high surgical risk. In this setting, the use of a left atrial-to-femoral arterial bypass percutaneous ventricular assist device (LA-FA pVAD) as temporary mechanical circulatory support (tMCS), followed by transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR), may offer a viable, potentially lifesaving alternative.
A 73-year-old man with known aortic stenosis was admitted with cardiogenic shock. Given the hemodynamic compromise associated with low-flow, low-gradient severe aortic stenosis, tMCS was initiated to stabilize end-organ perfusion. Subsequent TAVR was successfully performed, resulting in rapid clinical recovery.
This case highlights the feasibility of performing TAVR in severe aortic stenosis-related cardiogenic shock under tMCS. LA-FA pVAD provides effective unloading and systemic perfusion, bridging unstable patients to definitive valve intervention.
An LA-FA pVAD can safely support TAVR in severe aortic stenosis-related cardiogenic shock."

Case reports,"Coarctation of the aorta is associated with long-term cardiovascular complications, including hypertension and early onset atherosclerosis.
A 36-year-old woman with persistent hypertension after preeclampsia presented with chest pain. Electrocardiogram showed left ventricular hypertrophy with signs of ischemia. Echocardiography revealed a bicuspid aortic valve; however, the aortic arch was poorly seen. Coronary computed tomography identified severe left anterior descending artery stenosis with thoracic collaterals. During angioplasty, guidewire misdirection uncovered nearly atretic aortic coarctation, successfully stented a few days later.
This case illustrates how aortic coarctation can remain undetected until adulthood. It causes long-term cardiovascular complications through chronic hypertension and vascular dysfunction, promoting early coronary artery disease. Besides classical risk factors, Turner syndrome, the shape of the aortic arch, as well as the timing and method of repair, also appear to be additional risk factors.
Aortic coarctation is an aortopathy that leads to early atherosclerosis and coronary artery disease. Comprehensive evaluation is essential for timely diagnosis and optimal management."

Case reports,"Stent dislodgement with systemic embolization is a rare but serious complication of percutaneous coronary intervention.
During intravascular ultrasound-guided percutaneous coronary intervention for aorto-ostial left main artery stenosis, a fully expanded 4.0-mm drug-eluting stent dislodged upon balloon withdrawal. Angiography showed the stent partially floating in the aortic root, with its distal struts still anchored at the ostium, before its complete embolization. After securing the left main artery with a second stent, the dislodged stent was identified following systemic embolization to the left renal artery. Given the high risk of retrieval, it was managed in situ with balloon expansion to achieve full apposition against the vessel wall.
This report describes the rare event of systemic embolization of a fully expanded stent. Our experience indicates that in situ expansion may represent a practical alternative when retrieval poses significant hazards, offering a potential pathway to stabilize the complication.
Fully expanded coronary stents can in rare cases dislodge and embolize systemically. When retrieval is high risk, intentional in situ deployment at the embolization site provides a safe and definitive management option."

We carried out a retrospective analysis of patient characteristics, periprocedural complications, and 30-day mortality after 33 079 TAVI procedures that were carried out in seven German cardiac care centers.
TAVI case numbers rose from 1605 in 2013 to 4459 in 2023. The mean age of the patients remained constant at 81 years, while the operative risk (STS score) fell from 5.9% to 4.1%. The percentage of low-risk patients (STS < 4%) rose from 47% to 66%. From 2013 to 2023, there was a steady decline in periprocedural complications including severe bleeding of VARC types 3 and 4 (8.5% to 2.9%), vascular complications (17.2% to 4.9%), stroke (4.2% to 2.1%), and pacemaker implantations (15.5% to 11.4%). Over the same period, the risk-adjusted 30-day mortality fell from 3.8% to 3.2%.
The improved short-term results of TAVI from 2013 to 2023 are attributable to a change in patients' risk profiles as well as the increasing experience of the interventionists and refinements of the procedure. The mortality rate, which has remained unchanged in recent years, indicates that TAVI for older patients has been largely optimized."

From 2015 to 2023, a total of 303 patients with aortic stenosis (AS) who underwent TAVI at Kumamoto University Hospital were screened, and excluding 4 patients with in-hospital deaths, 299 were analyzed. The median follow-up period after TAVI was 693 days (interquartile range, 435-1189 days), during which 63 deaths occurred. Pre-TAVI echocardiographic findings showed that apical LS was significantly higher in the survival group compared to the all-cause death group (15.1 ± 4.7％ vs. 13.7 ± 4.4 %, p = 0.02). Multivariable Cox proportional hazards analysis, adjusted for body mass index, aortic valve peak velocity, atrial fibrillation, high-sensitivity troponin T, tricuspid regurgitation, demonstrated that apical LS was independently associated with all-cause mortality (hazard ratio: 0.91, 95 % confidence interval: 0.88-0.99, p = 0.02). Time-dependent receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis identified apical LS to discriminate all-cause mortality (area under the curve, 0.69), with the predictive ability peaking within the first two years after TAVI. Kaplan-Meier analysis revealed significantly higher mortality rates in patients with low apical LS group (<15.4 %) (p = 0.01).
measurement of apical LS in patients with AS provides valuable associational prognostic information, even after adjusting for multiple clinical and echocardiographic factors, highlighting its value in enhancing risk stratification for patients undergoing TAVI."

The urinary Legionella antigen test serves as a rapid, first-line diagnostic tool; however, early results may be negative, and antigen shedding can be intermittent. In these situations, timely retesting is essential, especially in postoperative or high-risk patients. We report the case of a 74-year-old man, a former smoker with diabetes and moderate aortic stenosis, who underwent thoracoscopic left lower lobectomy and was discharged on postoperative day (POD) six. He developed a fever on POD 27, accompanied by right upper lobe pneumonia. Outpatient urinary antigen tests for pneumococcus and Legionella were negative, and oral garenoxacin was initiated. However, hypoxemia and inflammation worsened, resulting in urgent admission on POD 30. Broad-spectrum β-lactams (sulbactam/ampicillin, followed by piperacillin/tazobactam) were ineffective. Chest CT revealed enlarging infiltrates and a parapneumonic effusion requiring drainage, despite negative pleural fluid cultures. Given the persistent deterioration of the patient's condition, levofloxacin was added, and the urinary Legionella antigen test (R70829, MIZUHO MEDY Co., Ltd., Tosu, Japan) was repeated on hospital day five (POD 35), which returned positive, confirming Legionella pneumonia. Subsequent targeted therapy with azithromycin (days 6-8 and 13-15), alongside levofloxacin, resulted in clinical improvement. Despite complications during the clinical course, including acute kidney injury necessitating two hemodialysis sessions and a creatine kinase peak of 1,563 U/L, the chest drain was removed on day 21, oxygen was discontinued by day 31, and the patient was transferred to long-term care on day 54. The sequence of renal failure preceding creatine kinase elevation suggests direct renal involvement by L. pneumophila rather than primary rhabdomyolysis. Vigilant retesting enabled timely pathogen-directed therapy and a favorable outcome. This case report highlights that a single negative urinary antigen test does not rule out Legionella infection. We accordingly recommend early repeat antigen testing, ideally within one week, for postoperative pneumonia unresponsive to β-lactams, together with prompt macrolide or fluoroquinolone therapy."

Morbidity is related to severe congenital heart defects, aortic hypoplasia, airway stenosis, constrictive pericarditis, and restrictive cardiomyopathy. We report two detailed autopsies: the first of an 8-year-old female who succumbed to congenital mitral valve disease and restrictive cardiopulmonary complications. Autopsy documented chronic pericarditis and fibrosing pleuritis, diffuse interstitial pulmonary fibrosis, extensive submucosal interstitial fibrosis of the bladder, and nodular medial hypertrophy of the aorta. The second patient was a 20-year-old female with progressive laryngo-tracheal stenosis, interstitial lung disease, pericardial and peritoneal adhesions, and dermal fibrosis. Both patients had ovarian fibrosis with reduced oocytes. Neuropathologic examination revealed brains below expected weight with hypoxic-ischemic injury. The first patient also had scattered intraparenchymal microcalcifications and a known Chiari I malformation, and the second had a thickened calvarium and dura mater and rounded cerebrum (shortened frontal and occipital lobes). These two patients demonstrate the value of postmortem examination to confirm suspected pathology and elucidate new features. The pleiotropy of Myhre syndrome was demonstrated by complex comorbidities and the devastating impact of indiscriminate fibrosis. Counseling regarding the role of postmortem examination should be considered in the palliative care of Myhre syndrome patients and their families."

Case reports,"Carcinoid heart disease is a complex consequence of functional neuroendocrine tumors, characterized by progressive thickening and degeneration of the right-sided valvular apparatus, leading to valvular and heart failure. Management is challenging, requiring multidisciplinary considerations regarding tumor disease management, heart failure pharmacotherapy, and heart valve replacement in individuals with acceptable performance status.
We present a case of a middle-aged man with a history of metastatic neuroendocrine tumor receiving biweekly octreotide therapy. He presented with constitutional syndrome and right-sided heart failure signs. Cardiac imaging revealed significant tricuspid and pulmonary regurgitation. The patient was a poor surgical candidate; consequently, after multimodal cardiac imaging assessment, alternative 1-stop transcatheter pulmonary and tricuspid replacement was planned and performed.
Patients with symptomatic carcinoid heart disease require comprehensive multidisciplinary evaluation. For high-risk patients with multivalvular disease, transcatheter valve replacements provide a feasible and less invasive alternative to standard surgical replacement.
One-stop transcatheter valvular interventions are a feasible therapeutic alternative to surgical replacement in patients with symptomatic carcinoid heart disease and suitable anatomy. Multimodal cardiac imaging is crucial for preprocedural assessment and the performance of transcatheter right-sided heart valve interventions."

A retrospective observational analysis. Place and Duration of the Study: Department of Nephrology, Hangzhou First People's Hospital, Hangzhou, China, from May 2022 to August 2023.
Patients undergoing MHD were classified into two groups based on the echocardiographic results: CVC group and Non-CVC group. The former had CVC, and the latter was without calcified valves. The differences in baseline data between the two groups were compared, and logistic regression analysis was employed to investigate the impact of plasma Hcy on the CVC.
Of the total 98 patients undergoing MHD, 64 (65.3%) had CVC, and 79 (80.6%) had hyperhomocysteinaemia. The proportion of hyperhomocysteinaemia was greater in the CVC group than in the Non-CVC group (90.6% vs. 61.8%, p = 0.001). Multivariate logistic regression indicated that, after adjusting for age, duration of dialysis, serum calcium levels, diabetes, and other variables, elevated plasma Hcy levels were independently linked to an increased risk of CVC, irrespective of whether Hcy was considered as a continuous variable (OR = 1.121, 95% CI 1.051-1.195; p <0.001) or a binary variable (OR = 5.191, 95% CI 1.379-19.54; p = 0.015).
Elevated plasma Hcy levels are independently linked to a greater risk of CVC in patients undergoing MHD.

However, MVP may also present with ventricular arrhythmias (VA) or sudden cardiac death (SCD). The arrhythmic form of MVP and the complicated course of this condition are closely associated with mitral annular disjunction (MAD). MAD alters the anatomical integrity of the mitral annulus and is thought to contribute to leaflet degeneration and myocardial fibrosis, creating a substrate for malignant arrhythmias. The most common complications associated with MVP and MAD include progressive mitral valve regurgitation, left ventricular hypertrophy and an increased risk of SCD. Cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) imaging is the most sensitive modality for detecting MAD and myocardial fibrosis and is thus essential for early diagnosis and risk stratification. This review aims to enhance recognition of MAD, summarize current diagnostic and risk assessment strategies, and provide clinical context through two cases of patients with arrhythmic MVP and MAD."

Emerging evidence of transcatheter edge-to-edge repair (TEER) use for treating acute mitral regurgitation has promoted TEER as a promising alternative to mitral valve surgery, owing to reduced mortality and complications. CASE REPORT A 66-year-old female patient with a history of thyroid nodules presented with dyspnea and hemoptysis. Imaging confirmed bilateral pleural effusions, with opacities suggestive of diffuse alveolar hemorrhage, and echocardiography revealed acute severe mitral valve regurgitation. The patient chose TEER over surgical valve replacement. After discharge on apixaban for new-onset atrial fibrillation, she returned a week later with melena and worsening dyspnea. Echocardiography demonstrated recurrent mitral valve regurgitation, and bronchoscopy confirmed diffuse alveolar hemorrhage. Despite aggressive management, the patient died. CONCLUSIONS This case highlights the complexity of managing acute severe mitral regurgitation complicated by diffuse alveolar hemorrhage in a patient requiring anticoagulation. Although a TEER procedure using the Pascal device was performed, the patient's condition continued to deteriorate, underscoring the importance of individualized treatment strategies, as surgical mitral valve replacement may offer more definitive hemodynamic correction in selected cases."

We report our experience in this patient cohort and compared different PM strategies prioritising interventional valve sparing options.
Consecutive patients treated with the EVOQUE system (Edwards Lifesciences) at our centre between January 2024 and May 2025 were included in this retrospective single centre analysis. Successful implantation of a valve sparing PM and feasibility of PM implantation were assessed.
This analysis included 39 patients (mean age 77.3 years, 74.4% women, 8 patients with pre-existing PM). High-degree AV-Block requiring PM implantation occurred in 28.2% in our cohort (11/39 patients), the de-novo PM implantation rate was 35.5% (11/31 patients). Complete or incomplete right bundle branch block (RBBB) was the most frequent conduction system disorder after TTVR (11/31 patients). Median time from TTVR to PM implantation was six days [IQR: 2.5-13]. PM implantation was feasible in 11/11 patients (100%), no surgical lead placement was necessary. Implantation of a valve sparing PM was successful in 10/11 patients (90.9%). Leadless PM were implanted in 3/11, coronary sinus lead PM in 7/11 patients. In one patient both interventional valve sparing PM approaches failed and a standard RV lead across the EVOQUE system was implanted.

However, physical deterioration and declining autopsy rates limit ongoing acquisition and use. While micro-CT scanning has been used to digitally archive wax-infiltrated specimens, most cardiac specimens in our collection are wet formalin-preserved hearts, for which micro-CT is suboptimal.
This study evaluates photogrammetry as a practical, high-fidelity digital archiving technique for wet cardiac specimens.
Ninety wet cardiac specimens representing a broad spectrum of CHD and other cardiac diseases were digitized using a handheld Artec Space Spider 3D scanner. Specimens were suspended via a custom apparatus to optimize surface coverage. Scan data were processed with Artec Studio and refined in Blender to generate anatomically accurate, textured 3D models. Two experienced cardiac morphologists validated the digital reconstructions against the physical specimens.
Photogrammetry produced high-resolution, color-accurate 3D models closely replicating anatomical details, including complex internal structures. The custom suspension device enhanced visualization, particularly of internal chambers. Challenges included scanning smaller, darker hearts and delicate valve structures, which required manual post-processing. The digital models are accessible via a cloud-based platform for research and education.
Photogrammetry is a practical and effective method for digitally archiving wet cardiac specimens, preserving valuable anatomical data, and mitigating loss due to specimen degradation. This technique facilitates broader accessibility and enhances educational and clinical applications in the study of CHDs and other cardiac diseases."

Annual International Conference,"Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) represents one of the leading causes of sudden cardiac death (SCD), particularly in the young population, with a risk of approximately 1% per year. So far, no reliable electrocardiogram (ECG) biomarkers have been presented for risk assessment, but ECG in HCM patients are often abnormal due to structural and electrical abnormalities. This study aimed to extract morphological ECG biomarkers to differentiate HCM patients based on their arrhythmic risk levels (15 HCM patients with arrhythmic events vs. 40 HCM control). We extracted ECG features including width, amplitudes, slopes between fiducial points, Hermite transform coefficients, and variational mode decomposition features. Following feature selection using combined metrics, the study population was divided into two groups for each ECG biomarker, with the median value serving as the cutoff point to distinguish between the groups. QRS and T waverelated features effectively separated patients into high and low arrhythmic risk categories. Notably, univariate Cox regression analysis showed that patients having more local QRS optima or highest percentage of negative QRS present the highest risk (p< 0.01 and p< 0.05 respectively). In conclusion, we proposed automatic ECG extracted features that can be used to stratify the risk for arrhythmic events in HCM patients.Clinical Relevance-This study provides novel insights into ECG-based risk stratification for HCM patients, offering potential tools for early identification of individuals at higher risk of cardiac events."

IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society. Annual International Conference,"Coronary artery disease (CAD) and valvular heart disorder (VHD) are major categories of cardiovascular disease (CVD), the leading cause of mortality and morbidity worldwide. CAD occurs due to plaque accumulation on the inner walls of the coronary arteries, restricting blood flow to the myocardium and potentially leading to heart attack or stroke. VHD refers to dysfunction in one or more heart valves, impairing blood flow between the heart's chambers or to other systemic organs. Due to the prevalence of CVD, there is a global need for an effective screening tool capable of detecting various CVDs on a mass scale. Both CAD and VHD alter the acoustic signature of phonocardiogram (PCG) signals, offering a non-invasive detection method. This study implements a multiclass classification model to differentiate between CAD, VHD, and normal heartbeats, collected from subjects using an innovative wearable multichannel PCG vest. Linear frequency cepstral coefficients (LFCCs), coupled with a support vector machine (SVM) using a radial basis function (RBF) kernel, achieved the highest multiclass subject-level accuracy of 81.53%, with a sensitivity of 85.20% for VHD and 81.47% for CAD. Additionally, a binary classification task between normal and abnormal (CAD and VHD together) heartbeats reported an accuracy of 82.01%. This is the first study to apply multiclass classification across different CVD categories using PCG signals collected with the same hardware."

Annual International Conference,"Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is a complex disease that can be associated with ischemia with no sign of coronary disease. Ischemia seems to result from microcirculatory abnormalities that appear to be modulated by left ventricular outflow tract (LVOT) obstruction. This paper proposes a model-based approach for the analysis of physiological mechanisms that affects coronary circulation in HCM. A novel integrated cardiovascular model, including LVOT obstruction and coronary circulation, was proposed. A sensitivity analysis was applied to identify the most influential parameters on coronary flow both at the macro- and micro- circulatory level. Finally, the proposed model was adapted to two HCM patients (obstructive / non-obstructive) from previous works of the team. Results show that the level of obstruction had a strong influence on coronary flow and the adaptation of the model to HCM patients confirmed the important influence of LVOT obstruction at the microcirculatory level. Despite the difficulty of having direct measures of coronary microcirculation, this works shows that computational models can help in studying the effect of a pathophysiological feature on coronary circulation in the context of HCM."

Annual International Conference,"Regular cardiac monitoring can detect early signs of cardiovascular diseases and it's important for chronic disease management. Video-based seismocardiography (SCG) based on the defocused speckle imaging emerged recently, but signals extracted from speckle motions on the camera 2D imaging plane often contain coupled SCG and gyrocardiography (GCG) components. This study aims to investigate the feasibility of using two cameras with different defocus levels to measure speckle motion signals and reconstruct a pure cardiac Z-axis vibration signal (i.e. true SCG). Using chest-mounted accelerometer as the reference, we assessed the reconstructed SCG signals and raw speckle motion signals from two cameras with different focal lengths, from the aspects of the waveform similarity w.r.t. the reference and the accuracy of biomarker detection (including aortic valve opening/closure (AO/AC), mitral valve opening/closure (MO/MC), and isovolumic movement (IM)). The results obtained from an experiment involving 10 subjects with ice pack stimulation protocol showed that the reconstructed SCG signals have higher Pearson correlation with the reference signal (r=0.822) and better accuracies of biomarker detection (with a 6 ms allowable error range, accuracies are 99.43%, 71.83%, 69.49%, 69.30% and 81.50%).

This study examines expert assessment ambiguity in canine auscultation data, highlights the negative impact of label noise on classification performance, and introduces methods for label noise reduction. To evaluate whether label noise can be minimized by incorporating multiple expert opinions, a dataset of 140 heart sound recordings (HSR) was annotated regarding the intensity of holosystolic heart murmurs caused by Myxomatous Mitral Valve Disease (MMVD). The expert opinions facilitated the selection of 70 high-quality HSR, resulting in a noise-reduced dataset. By leveraging individual heart cycles, the training data was expanded and classification robustness was enhanced. The investigation encompassed training and evaluating three classification algorithms: AdaBoost, XGBoost, and Random Forest. All of them showed significant improvements in classifi-cation accuracy due to the applied label noise reduction, most notably XGBoost. Specifically, for the detection of mild heart murmurs, sensitivity increased from 37.71% to 90.98% and specificity from 76.70% to 93.69%. For the moderate category, sensitivity rose from 30.23% to 55.81% and specificity from 64.56% to 97.19%. In the loud/thrilling category, sensitivity and specificity increased from 58.28% to 95.09% and from 84.84% to 89.69%, respectively.

Among pathogenetic mechanisms associated with DM, increased oxidative stress plays a key role in the valvular degeneration progression. This study aimed to evaluate whether DM coexistence with severe AS is associated with parallel enhancement of oxidative stress in both circulating blood and stenotic valves. We enrolled 70 severe AS patients scheduled for aortic valve replacement, including 40 (57%) with concomitant type 2 DM (AS-DM) and 30 AS patients without type 2 DM (AS-nonDM). We assessed circulating oxidized phospholipids (oxPL), myeloperoxidase (MPO), advanced glycation end products (AGEs), and their soluble receptors (sRAGE). Valvular expression of oxPL and AGEs was determined using immunostaining of aortic valve samples. In the whole group of AS patients (n=70) oxPL, MPO and AGEs levels correlated with HbA1c concentration (r=0.79, p<0.001; r=0.60, p<0.001 and r=0.85, p<0.001, respectively). Similarly, oxPL and MPO were associated with plasma AGEs (r=0.66, p<0.001 and r=0.53, p<0.001). Moreover, serum MPO and oxPL correlated with aortic valve area (AVA; r= -0.49, p<0.001 and r= -0.45, p<0.001). Among 40 AS-DM patients we observed 2.55-fold higher serum oxPL, 1.38-fold higher serum MPO, 2.07-fold higher plasma AGEs and 2.22-fold higher plasma sRAGE compared to AS-nonDM (all p<0.001). In AS-DM group, valvular oxPL and AGEs expression was 1.8-fold and 1.6-fold higher when compared to AS-nonDM patients (all p<0.001). Of major importance, valvular expression of oxPL correlated both with serum oxPL and MPO levels (r=0.72 and r=0.63, respectively; both p<0.001). This study is the first to show that in severe AS patients with concomitant DM, valvular expression of oxPL is markedly higher compared to non-DM patients and associates with their circulating levels. Moreover, enhanced valvular oxidative stress was linked with glycemic status and more severe AS."

Kinovea, as an accessible motion-analysis software, provides both visual and quantitative feedback. However, its application in supporting technique development among beginner athletes remains insufficiently explored. Aim: This study aims to describe the use of Kinovea in biomechanics training and examine its contribution to the awareness of kinematic characteristics and movement techniques among beginner athletes. Methods: A descriptive qualitative design involved 72 beginner athletes aged 18–25 years selected through purposive sampling. Data were collected over 16 weeks through interviews, field observations, and motion video recordings analyzed using Kinovea. Kinematic data focused on joint angles, stride behavior, and movement phases during walking, running, and the flight phase. Qualitative data were analyzed using content analysis with NVivo 12, while kinematic results were interpreted descriptively to identify performance patterns and areas for technical refinement. Result: Kinematic analysis showed coordinated joint-angle patterns across all phases. Walking analysis identified arm swing angles of 50.9°–58.8° and leg separation angles of 64.3°–67.2°, indicating a stable gait rhythm. The running analysis revealed knee angles of 68.8°–69.8° and elbow angles of 87.6°–89.1°, indicating efficient propulsive mechanics. The flight phase demonstrated knee angles of 81.2°–87.8° and elbow angles of 80.4°–88.3°, suggesting effective momentum use and postural stability. These measurements supported stride-efficiency assessment and technique evaluation. Qualitative findings revealed that Kinovea enabled athletes to interpret movement phases and identify technical inefficiencies through slow-motion and frame-by-frame visualization. Conclusion: Kinovea supports basic motion analysis by providing clear kinematic information and helping beginner athletes observe and refine their movement techniques. The findings also offer practical value for coaches by enabling more precise identification of inefficient patterns and guiding targeted corrections during early-stage training."

OpenAlex,valvular heart disease,Early outcomes of surgical treatment in patients with combined aortic and mitral valve pathology and concomitant coronary artery disease,O.V. Zelenchuk; N.V. Ponych; Б.М. Тодуров,10.31928/3083-7111-2025.3.714,2025-12-03,Cardiac Surgery and Interventional Cardiology,"The aim – to evaluate the clinical outcomes of surgical treatment in patients with combined aortic and mitral valve disease in the setting of concomitant coronary artery disease (CAD), who underwent simultaneous valve replacement and coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG), with analysis of preoperative, intraoperative, and postoperative parameters. Materials and methods. A retrospective analysis of 35 cases of combined surgical interventions (AVR + MVR + CABG), performed at the Heart Institute of the Ministry of Health of Ukraine between 2019 and 2023, was conducted. The study assessed clinical characteristics, echocardiographic findings, intraoperative data, postoperative course, complications, and mortality rates. Risk stratification was performed using EuroSCORE II and the STS Risk Calculator.Results. In patients with severe multivalvular disease (n = 35), mitral regurgitation (100 %) and concomitant heart failure (94.3 %) were predominant. Postoperative improvement of NYHA class was observed in 74.3 % of cases. Mortality rate was 14.3 %, with infectious (51 %) and neurological (39 %) complications being common. Atrial fibrillation was associated with higher mortality. Postoperative echocardiography showed improved hemodynamics. These findings confirm the effectiveness of combined surgical intervention when careful patient selection is ensured.Conclusions. Simultaneous aortic and mitral valve replacement combined with coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) represents a clinically justified surgical strategy for patients with combined valvular pathology and coronary artery disease, including those at intermediate and high risk according to the EuroSCORE II and STS scales. Despite acceptable survival rates, the incidence of postoperative complications remains significant, due to acute kidney injury, stroke, infections, ventricular fibrillation, and the need for reinterventions)."

A 34-year-old woman, in her second pregnancy following a previous abortion, presented at 34 weeks and 5 days of gestation with progressive dyspnea and orthopnea. Echocardiography confirmed severe MS accompanied by pulmonary hypertension and preserved left ventricular systolic function. After multidisciplinary optimization, an elective cesarean delivery was performed under graded epidural anesthesia with incremental dosing of lidocaine and ropivacaine. Beat-to-beat cardiac output monitoring using the MostCare™ PRAM (Pressure Recording Analytical Method) system guided vasopressor titration with phenylephrine, maintaining hemodynamic stability. The patient remained hemodynamically stable throughout the intraoperative and postoperative periods, with no pulmonary edema or arrhythmias, and was discharged on postoperative day four. This case demonstrates that graded epidural anesthesia, when combined with advanced hemodynamic monitoring and collaborative care, represents a safe and effective alternative to general anesthesia in parturients with severe valvular heart disease."

It is a significant cause of sudden cardiac death, particularly in young individuals, often remaining undiagnosed until autopsy. Methods: A systematic review of the literature was conducted following PRISMA guidelines to revisit the main postmortem findings (gross, microscopic, and genetic) useful to perform the postmortem diagnosis of DCM. Scientific databases (PubMed and Scopus) were searched for articles published up to February 2025 describing postmortem findings in individuals diagnosed with DCM. Inclusion criteria were focused on studies reporting macroscopic cardiac findings, and microscopic and genetic variants identified postmortem or in related familial studies. Data were extracted and categorized to identify consistent diagnostic markers and to assess the frequency and relevance of genetic findings in autopsy-confirmed DCM cases. From 2081 initial records, 30 studies met inclusion criteria. Two reviewers independently performed study selection and data extraction, and methodological limitations of the included studies were considered qualitatively to inform the synthesis. Results: Common macroscopic features included increased heart weight (often &gt; 350 g), dilated left or biventricular chambers, and thinning of the ventricular walls. Histologically, the most consistent findings were diffuse interstitial fibrosis, myocyte hypertrophy, and nuclear atypia. Particular attention was given to morphological features essential to distinguish between genetic and nongenetic forms of DCM and, thus, useful to perform a differential diagnosis with disease having a DCM-like pattern. Notably, truncating variants in genes such as TTN, FLNC, DSP, PKP2, and MYH7 were frequently reported, particularly in young decedents with no significant history of cardiac disease. However, only about half of reviewed studies included any form of genetic analysis, reflecting a significant gap in current practice for forensic pathologists. Conclusions: DCM may cause sudden death without prior symptoms, making genetic testing essential to uncover the diagnosis, especially in cases with a negative phenotype. Therefore, molecular autopsy combined with careful macroscopic and microscopic analysis can strengthen the forensic assessment."

Over the past decades, open-heart mitral valve surgery has been the gold-standard intervention for this complex disorder, but in recent years, transcatheter edge-to-edge repair has emerged as a valuable option in selected clinical scenarios. However, a considerable proportion of patients develop recurrent mitral regurgitation during follow-up, leading to a significant increase in morbidity and mortality. In this context, data is limited regarding the optimal approach. This review provides an overview of the current evidence on transcatheter mitral valve intervention therapies for the management of recurrent mitral regurgitation following transcatheter edge-to-edge repair."

Aortic regurgitation (AR) is the predominant valvular lesion. When AR precedes characteristic mucocutaneous symptoms, misdiagnosis and treatment delays often occur. Case Presentation: We, herein, report the case of a 37-year-old male presenting with isolated aortic regurgitation (AR) as the initial manifestation of Behçet's disease (BD). Initial echocardiography revealed severe eccentric AR with left coronary cusp prolapse and a vegetation-like lesion, raising suspicion of infective endocarditis; however, relapsed oral ulcers developed postoperatively, ultimately confirming BD diagnosis. Despite successful aortic valve replacement, delayed diagnosis due to absent early mucocutaneous symptoms contributed to catastrophic prosthetic valve dehiscence with severe paravalvular leak. The patient underwent an emergency Bentall procedure with venoarterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (VAECMO) support but succumbed to cardiogenic shock and multiorgan failure. Pathological analysis demonstrated tissue necrosis with minimal inflammation. Conclusion: Isolated AR may be BD's initial manifestation, preceding classic symptoms by months. Echocardiographic features, including valve prolapse and perivalvular lesions, despite their non-specificity, should prompt screening for BD. Inherent tissue fragility in BD significantly elevates postoperative risks of paravalvular leak and prosthetic valve dehiscence. Early identification, optimal surgical procedure, and timely immunosuppressive therapy are essential to improve the prognosis of cardiac BD."

A systematic review of the guidelines was conducted to inform clinical judgment. The preferred approach for diagnosing and grading MS involves a multimodal strategy that encompasses transthoracic and transesophageal echocardiography, assessment of evolving symptoms, hemodynamic evaluation via cardiac catheterization, and exercise testing. Both guidelines converge on the use of anticoagulation therapy, which has demonstrated efficacy in reducing thromboembolic events associated with rheumatic MS. However, a nuanced difference exists between the guidelines in terms of the criteria for assessing MS severity."

Buriman; Daniel Lighezan,10.3390/jcdd12120468,2025-11-29,Journal of Cardiovascular Development and Disease,"Aortic stenosis (AS), a progressive valvular disease that results in increasing left ventricular (LV) afterload, leads to ventricular dysfunction and heart failure if left untreated. Transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) has emerged as a minimally invasive and effective alternative to surgical replacement, especially in elderly or high-risk patients. Objectives: The present study aims to assess the influence of the tricuspid annular plane systolic excursion (TAPSE)/pulmonary systolic arterial pressure (PASP) ratio on clinical outcomes in patients with aortic stenosis undergoing TAVR and offer valuable insights into patient selection and tailored management strategies for individuals undergoing TAVR. Methods: A retrospective analysis was conducted on 100 patients with AS who underwent TAVR, included in two distinct groups based on their median TAPSE/PASP ratio. Results: Patients were divided according to their median TAPSE/PASP ratio into two groups. Those with lower TAPSE/PASP ratios had a higher incidence of post-procedural atrial fibrillation (AF) (48% vs. 28%, p = 0.0404), lower left-ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) (41.06% vs. 49.50%, p &lt; 0.0001), a more pronounced inflammatory and hematologic response, and longer hospitalization. Receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) analysis demonstrated modest but significant discrimination rather than high sensitivity or specificity for postprocedural arrhythmias, particularly atrial fibrillation. Conclusions: TAPSE/PASP should be regarded as a clinically useful risk-stratification marker in patients with AS undergoing TAVR, enabling the identification of high-risk patients and optimizing peri-procedural management."
