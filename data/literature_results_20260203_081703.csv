PubMed,aortic stenosis,Combined assessment of pulmonary artery pulsatility index and pulmonary arterial capacitance for risk stratification following transcatheter aortic valve implantation.,Yuta Ozaki; Yusuke Uemura; Toru Kondo; Shingo Kazama; Shogo Yamaguchi; Takashi Okajima; Takayuki Mitsuda; Shinji Ishikawa; Kenji Takemoto; Takahiro Okumura; Toyoaki Murohara; Masato Watarai,10.1080/00015385.2026.2621562,2026-02-02,Acta cardiologica,"Right heart haemodynamics, including right ventricular function and pulmonary arterial capacitance (PAC), are important prognostic determinants in cardiovascular disease. However, their combined role in patients undergoing transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) remains unclear. This study aimed to determine whether the combined assessment using pulmonary artery pulsatility index (PAPi) and PAC can stratify clinical outcomes in patients with aortic stenosis (AS) undergoing TAVI.
This retrospective single-centre study included 77 patients with severe AS who underwent right heart catheterisation within 3 months before TAVI. Patients were stratified into four groups based on the median values of PAPi and PAC. The primary endpoint was a composite of all-cause death or heart failure-related hospitalisation.
During a median follow-up of 3.60 years (interquartile range: 1.89-4.62), 15 patients experienced the primary endpoint. Kaplan-Meier's analysis showed significant stratification by PAPi-PAC groups (log-rank p = 0.040). In Cox regression models, the low PAPi/low PAC group was independently associated with adverse outcomes compared with the other groups (hazard ratio (HR): 3.65, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.28-10.40, p = 0.015 adjusted for age and sex; HR: 3.61, 95% CI: 1.27-10.26, p = 0.016 adjusted for natriuretic peptide levels; HR: 3.07, 95% CI: 1.07-8.81, p = 0.038 adjusted for the Meta-analysis Global Group in Chronic Heart Failure score).
Combined PAPi-PAC assessment identified distinct haemodynamic phenotypes with prognostic significance following TAVI. This approach offers a simple, physiologically grounded framework for postprocedural risk stratification and individualised management."

Several mechanisms, such as multiple comorbidities, haemolysis and acquired coagulopathy, have been postulated. We aimed to address the knowledge gap regarding survival outcomes of Southeast Asians patients with AS and anaemia.
Six hundred and fifty-one consecutive patients in a tertiary academic centre with index echocardiographic diagnosis of AS were stratified into three groups based on haemoglobin (Hb) levels. Baseline demographics, comorbidities, echocardiographic findings and clinical outcomes were compared.
Of the 651 patients with AS, 256 had mild anaemia (mean Hb 11.2 g/dL, standard deviation [SD] ± 0.8), 122 patients had moderate-severe anaemia (Hb 8.7 ± 1.2 g/dL) and 273 patients had no anaemia (Hb 13.8 ± 1.3 g/dL). Patients with more severe anaemia presented with higher-grade New York Heart Association IV symptoms (P = 0.002). More profound degrees of anaemia were independent predictors of increased all-cause mortality (mild anaemia: adjusted hazard ratio (aHR) 1.84, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.42-2.39, P < 0.001; moderate/severe anaemia: aHR 2.77, 95% CI 2.00-3.82, P < 0.001) and increased composite endpoints (mild anaemia: aHR 1.25, 95% CI 1.01-1.55, P = 0.047; moderate/severe anaemia: aHR 1.33, 95% CI 1.33-1.76, P < 0.001) compared to no anaemia. Anaemia was a significant effect modifier of aortic valve replacement on all-cause mortality in AS on the additive scale (relative excess risk due to interaction 2.16, 95% CI 0.21-4.54, P = 0.04).
Anaemia in AS was associated with worse symptomology, all-cause mortality and composite endpoints of cardiovascular outcomes in Southeast Asian patients."

Its occurrence with transposition of the great arteries (TGA) is exceptionally rare, and the presence of coexisting aortic valve stenosis adds significant hemodynamic complexity. We describe a term neonate who presented immediately after birth with severe cyanosis and desaturation, requiring intubation and prostaglandin E₁ infusion. Chest radiography demonstrated marked cardiomegaly, while echocardiography confirmed TGA with a large ventricular septal defect (VSD), a dysplastic pulmonary valve resulting in free pulmonary regurgitation with massive main pulmonary artery dilatation, hypoplastic branch pulmonary arteries, and moderate aortic valve stenosis. Given the complexity of the cardiac anatomy, the guarded prognosis, and significant limitations in social support, including the poor socioeconomic status of very young parents who lived far from the nearest tertiary hospital, the multidisciplinary team elected to pursue conservative management. This rare constellation of cardiac lesions underscores the challenges of early recognition, risk stratification, and decision-making in neonates with severe conotruncal malformations."
PubMed,aortic stenosis,SAVR and TAVI comparison across the globe based on current regional registry evidence - A meta-analysis of reconstructed time-to-event data.,Tulio Caldonazo; Hristo Kirov; Anna Vogel; Angelique Runkel; Murat Mukharyamov; Johannes Fischer; Aryan Dadashzadeh; Torsten Doenst,10.1016/j.ijcha.2025.101703,2025-08,International journal of cardiology. Heart & vasculature,"There is debate whether surgical aortic valve replacement (SAVR) or transcatheter implantation (TAVI) provide better results for treatment of aortic valve stenosis. While randomized clinical trials (RCTs) are considered to compare the average treatment effect of two methods in a selected patient population, registry data, although biased, reflect every day clinical practice and provide external validation of RCTs. We evaluated the impact of SAVR or TAVI on long-term survival based on local reports from all available regions in the world.
We systematically searched three databases selecting risk-adjusted registry studies comparing outcomes for SAVR and TAVI with at least five years of follow-up. Reports without all-cause mortality were excluded. One time-to-event curve was reconstructed from survival curves. Cox regression model and sensitivity analysis were performed.
From 10,399 screened studies, 13 met the inclusion criteria with 28,344 patients in the final analysis (follow-up: 5-9 years). In ten studies, survival rates favored SAVR, three showed no difference and none favored TAVI. Hazard ratio (HR) for overall survival was 0.58 (95 %CI: 0.54-0.61, p < 0.01 - favors SAVR). A landmark analysis with a 6-months split showed no significant survival difference in the first 6 months (HR: 0.94, 95 %CI: 0.86-1.02, p = 0.14) and better survival for SAVR compared to TAVI thereafter (HR: 0.43, 95 %CI: 0.40-0.46, p < 0.01). All sensitivity analyses supported this outcome.
This systematic regional registry-type comparison revealed that SAVR is associated with increased long-term survival compared to TAVI, which appears to be independent of the world region in which the study was performed."

This study aims to compare mortality and other outcomes by prosthesis type for patients aged 50-70 years who received SAVR in a well-characterized Australian cohort.
Data were prospectively collected at the time of heart valve surgery and linked administrative outcome data. This analysis includes all patients aged 50-70 years who had SAVR in Western Australian public hospitals between 2010 and 2020. The primary endpoint was all-cause mortality. Secondary endpoints were cardiovascular mortality, separately and combined with admission for either non-fatal myocardial infarction or for non-fatal stroke (MACE), major bleeding, and days alive and out of hospital (DAOH). Outcomes, categorized by prosthesis type (mechanical or bioprosthetic), were compared using propensity matching. Within the initial cohort of 706 patients undergoing SAVR (mean age 62.5 years, SD 6), propensity score matching identified 149 patients each with mechanical or bioprosthetic valves. After adjustment, patients who received mechanical valves had lower all-cause mortality [adjusted hazard ratio (aHR) 0.51; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.27-0.98; P = 0.04] and MACE (aHR 0.53; 95% CI 0.30-0.95; P = 0.03) during median follow-up of 3.6 years. Mechanical valves were associated with increased risk of major bleeding (aHR3.40; 95% CI 1.32-8.77; P = 0.01). There was no difference in risk of cardiovascular mortality, admissions for non-fatal MI, non-fatal stroke, or DAOH by prosthesis type.
Patients aged 50-70 years who underwent mechanical valve SAVR had lower risk of all-cause mortality and MACE compared with those who received a bioprosthesis, despite higher bleeding risk. Randomized comparisons are necessary to confirm these findings."

Heart & vasculature,"Radiographic markers such as psoas muscle area (PMA) and pleural effusion have been linked to mortality after transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI). We examined their relationship with cause-specific mortality and their incremental prognostic value beyond EuroSCORE II.
This retrospective study included 1090 consecutive TAVI patients treated at Heart Hospital, Tampere University Hospital between 2008 and 2020. Preoperative CT scans were reviewed for L3-level PMA and pleural effusion (>10 mm thickness). Subdistribution hazard models adjusted for age, sex, BMI, and BSA were used to analyze cause-specific mortality. Incremental prognostic value beyond EuroSCORE II was assessed using time-dependent discrimination indexes (AUC and IDI) and net-reclassification index (NRI) at 3 years.
During a median follow-up of 4.3 years (IQR 3.1-6.0), 54% (n = 590) of patients died: 64% (n = 376) from cardiovascular, 30% (n = 177) from non-cardiovascular, and 6% (n = 37) from unnatural causes. PMA and pleural effusion were associated with cardiovascular mortality (PMA: SDH/1SD 0.88, 95% CI 0.78-0.99, p = 0.037; pleural effusion: SDH 1.73, 95% CI 1.37-2.19, p < 0.001). Combined inclusion of PMA and pleural effusion improved NRI = 0.13 (p = 0.004) and IDI = 0.015 (p = 0.004) of overall mortality prediction compared to EuroSCORE II alone.
Psoas muscle area (PMA) and pleural effusion were independently associated with cardiovascular mortality after TAVI, whereas no significant associations were observed with non-cardiovascular deaths. Combined inclusion of these parameters led to a modest but not clinically meaningful improvement in the EuroSCORE II-based prediction of mortality."

Heart & vasculature,"Shear wave elastography (SWE) is a noninvasive ultrasound technique that quantifies liver stiffness. Previous studies have suggested that liver SWE can serve as an indirect marker of hepatic congestion. However, it remains unclear whether liver SWE measured after transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) is associated with clinical outcomes.
A total of 127 consecutive patients with severe aortic stenosis who underwent TAVI and had liver SWE measured using abdominal ultrasonography at discharge were enrolled. Liver SWE was obtained from the right hepatic lobe via an intercostal approach. Patients were stratified by the median liver SWE value (1.36 m/s): low-SWE group (< 1.36 m/s; n = 59) and high-SWE group (≥ 1.36 m/s; n = 68). The primary endpoint was a composite of all-cause death and heart failure (HF) rehospitalization.
All 127 patients were followed for 24 months, during which 21 (16.5 %) experienced the primary endpoint. Kaplan-Meier analysis showed a higher cumulative incidence of the primary endpoint in the high-SWE group than in the low-SWE group (log-rank P = 0.019). In Cox proportional hazards models adjusted using inverse probability of treatment weighting, high liver SWE was independently associated with an increased risk of the primary endpoint (hazard ratio 3.66; 95 % confidence interval 1.30-10.32; P = 0.014).
High liver SWE after TAVI was independently associated with an increased 24-month risk of all-cause death and HF rehospitalization."

Integrated care pathways (ICPs) supported by structured data systems may improve safety and outcomes, but real-world evidence in AS remains limited. We aimed to characterize a contemporary cohort of patients with severe AS managed within an ICP at a tertiary hospital, comparing profiles and outcomes by treatment strategy, and to describe diagnostic procedures and the implementation of cardiac rehabilitation (CR) interventions embedded in the pathway.
Prospective observational study of all consecutive patients with AS evaluated by a multidisciplinary heart team between 2018 and 2022. Baseline characteristics and frailty, diagnostic tests, CR interventions, procedural details, and outcomes were collected via an interoperable data management platform and compared across treatment groups: surgical (SAVR) or transcatheter (TAVR) valve replacement, or conservative management. Early survival was assessed using Kaplan-Meier analysis with log-rank testing.
Among 984 patients (median age 78 years, 42% women), 43.9% underwent SAVR, 49.8% TAVR, and 6.3% were managed conservatively. TAVR and conservative groups were older, frailer, and had higher comorbidity. Device success at 30 days was high (≈91%), with periprocedural death at 2.5% for interventions, vs. 9.7% early mortality for conservative management (p < 0.001). Early survival differed significantly (log-rank p = 0.004). TAVR had higher permanent pacemaker implantation (21.7% vs. 7.4% for SAVR, p < 0.001) and major vascular complications (4.1% vs. 0.2%, p < 0.001), while SAVR had more reoperations (8.3% vs. 0.2%, p < 0.001) and atrial fibrillation (18.9% vs. 10.1%, p = 0.001). Prehabilitation was implemented in 64.6% of candidates, while postprocedural CR remained underutilized (11.3%).
Integrated care for a cohort of patients with AS, supported by structured data management, enabled comprehensive profiling, systematic outcome monitoring, and identification of improvement areas. Both SAVR and TAVR achieved high success with low early mortality, while conservative management had poor survival."

Management requires a multidisciplinary approach, including medical therapy, endoscopic intervention, and valve replacement. Despite advances, many aspects remain unclear. This review explores the epidemiology, pathophysiology, and management of Heyde syndrome while highlighting areas for future research.
A comprehensive search of PubMed and Google Scholar focused on English-language human studies, including case reports, clinical trials, reviews, and expert guidelines. Additional literature on Von Willebrand syndrome and GI angiodysplasia was reviewed. The final search was completed on April 5, 2025.
Aortic valve replacement improves outcomes and hematologic abnormalities. Transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) showed lower rates of life-threatening bleeding, fewer perioperative complications, and reduced transfusions compared to surgical replacement. Guidelines recommend dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) for 3-6 months post-TAVR, with 79%-86% of patients experiencing no recurrence of GI bleeds. Management of intestinal angiodysplasia often shows high recurrence rates due to persistent lesions and vWS-2A. Surgical valve replacement also improves bleeding control, even with anticoagulation. Aortic valve replacement should be first-line therapy in severe aortic stenosis with chronic GI bleeding.
Heyde syndrome remains a complex and often underrecognized condition in elderly populations. Continued research is critical to deepen understanding and improve patient outcomes, allowing for more personalized and effective care strategies."

We prospectively enrolled 4,903 consecutive AS patients who underwent TAVI in 7 Japanese hospitals between April 2010 and June 2024 and evaluated the effect of preprocedural diuretics treatment on clinical outcomes. Patients were divided into 2 groups as follows: the Diuretics group, who received diuretic treatment before TAVI (n = 2,073), and the Non-Diuretics group without diuretic treatment (n = 2,830). The median observation period was 2.1 years. The Diuretics group was older and had higher surgical risk scores and more comorbidities, including prior myocardial infarction, atrial fibrillation/flutter, and peripheral artery disease. The Diuretics group included more patients with New York Heart Association (NYHA) classification III/IV, lower left ventricular ejection fraction, and reduced renal function. They had significantly worse all-cause and cardiovascular mortality than those in the Non-Diuretics group (38% versus 26% and 18% versus 10%, respectively; P < 0.001 by log-rank test). After propensity score matching to minimize the influence of confounding factors, preoperative diuretic treatment was associated with worse all-cause mortality (hazard ratio [HR]: 1.29, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.06-1.58, P = 0.012) and cardiovascular mortality (HR: 1.61, 95%CI: 1.15-2.26, P = 0.006).

LVH was defined by echocardiographic left ventricular mass index (LVMi) >115 g/m2 in male subjects and >95 g/m2 in female subjects. Ten ECG criteria were calculated, including Peguero-Lo Presti, Sokolow-Lyon, Cornell, Perugia, Romhilt-Estes, and others. Diagnostic performance was assessed using ROC curves (AUC), sensitivity (Sn), specificity (Sp).
In the HTN cohort, Peguero-Lo Presti achieved the highest AUC for LVH detection (0.752 [95% CI: 0.616-0.888]), with Sn = 31% and Sp = 94%. Other scores showed similar or lower AUCs, with Perugia score showing higher sensitivity (54%). The highest specificity were reached by Sokolow-Lyon and Gubner-Ungerleider (100%). In the HCM cohort, all ECG scores showed modest diagnostic performance (AUC 0.529-0.628). The Perugia and Romhilt-Estes scores achieved the highest sensitivities (94% and 71%, respectively), whereas Sokolow-Lyon showed the highest specificity (90%). In the sAS cohort, AUCs ranged from 0.519 to 0.671. Sensitivity was higher for Perugia (66%) and Romhilt-Estes ≥4 (57%). Highest specificity was shown by Gubner-Ungerleider (95%).

This study aimed to assess the outcomes of TAVR compared with those of surgical aortic valve replacement (SAVR) and examine the impact of BAV type, aortopathy, excess leaflet calcification, and raphe calcification on BAV TAVR outcomes.
We searched PubMed/MEDLINE, Embase, and Cochrane Library for studies that assessed the outcomes of TAVR in the BAV population. We also included studies of patients with BAV undergoing TAVR and SAVR, and those assessing anatomical predictors of TAVR outcomes. Random-effects models were used to calculate the pooled risk ratios, mean differences, and hazard ratios.
Patients with BAV who underwent TAVR showed significantly lower risks of major bleeding and acute kidney injury, and shorter hospital stays than those who underwent SAVR. However, BAV TAVR had a higher pacemaker implantation rate. Among the BAV types, Type 0 showed a higher risk of coronary obstruction, whereas Type 1 had a lower risk of pacemaker implantation following BAV TAVR. Additionally, BAV TAVR had a higher risk of long-term mortality in patients with aortopathy (ascending aortic diameter >4.5 cm) and excessive leaflet calcification.
Compared with SAVR, TAVR in BAV is associated with favourable in-hospital outcomes. Anatomical features, such as BAV type, aortopathy, excess leaflet calcification, and calcified raphe, significantly influence the outcomes of TAVR in the BAV population."

BAA was measured with the use of clinical biomarkers based on the KDM-BA and PhenoAge algorithms. Cox regression, restricted cubic spline (RCS) regression, and incremental predictive value analyses were used to evaluate the association between BAA and mortality.
Among 559 patients (mean age 64.80 years, 315 [56.4%] male), there were 153 cases (27.4%) of all-cause mortality during median 35.50 months of follow-up (range: 18.47-57.03 months). Kaplan-Meier curves revealed significantly elevated mortality in the highest quartile of BAA for both measures (KDM-BA: 38.8% [HR: 2.72; 95% CI: 1.73-4.29]; PhenoAge: 41.1% [HR: 3.26; 95% CI: 2.01-5.27]; both log-rank P < 0.0001). After fully adjusting for confounders, each SD increase in BAA was significantly associated with higher mortality (KDM-BA acceleration: HR: 1.36 [95% CI: 1.15-1.61]; PhenoAge acceleration: HR: 1.35 [95% CI: 1.17-1.56]). RCS regression revealed a significant linear BAA-mortality relationship. The addition of BAA into the basic model for all-cause mortality improved C-statistics (both P < 0.001), continuous-free net reclassification improvement value (both P = 0.013), and integrated discrimination improvement value (both P < 0.05).
Biomarker-derived BAA is independently associated with increased all-cause mortality in moderate to severe AVS patients, highlighting its potential as a prognostic indicator."

Asia,"Little information exists about national-based data on patients undergoing transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) in Asia and the associated costs.
This study aims to assess the baseline characteristics, procedural patterns, clinical outcomes, and cost expenses of patients with severe aortic stenosis who underwent TAVR in Korea.
We used the patient-level data from the National Health Insurance Review and Assessment Service registry, spanning from May 2015 to June 2021. The primary clinical outcome was all-cause mortality. Rehospitalization rates and procedural costs were also analyzed.
During the study period, 3,463 patients (mean age: 80.5 ± 5.9 years; 54.0% female) underwent TAVR at 39 hospitals in Korea. The annual number of TAVR procedures and the number of performing centers increased steadily. The proportion of low-risk patients (Society of Thoracic Surgeons Predicted Risk of Mortality ≤4%) was 41.7%. The transfemoral approach was conducted in 99.0% of cases, and the procedural success rate was 99.7%. All-cause mortality rates at 30 days, 2 years, and 5 years were 2.7% (95% CI: 2.1-3.2), 12.9% (95% CI: 11.8-14.0), and 19.5% (95% CI: 18.0-21.1), respectively. Rehospitalization related to cardiovascular causes occurred in 31.7% (95% CI: 29.3-34.1) at 2 years and 40.5% (95% CI: 34.1-46.9) at 5 years. The estimated mean index cost per patient was $32,173 ± $7,552, with 83.2% attributed to material expenses.
The number of TAVR recipients and performing centers in Korea has substantially increased over time. The procedural and survival outcomes were favorable. The overall medical costs for TAVR procedures are still substantial, mainly driven by device costs."

Asia,"Transcatheter aortic valve replacement is a promising alternative treatment for patients with severe aortic stenosis (AS), but uncertainties remain regarding its long-term durability.
This study aimed to evaluate the safety and feasibility of Sikelia transcatheter heart valve with polymeric leaflets in AS.
In this first-in-human, prospective, nonrandomized, single-arm, multicenter study, patients with severe symptomatic AS eligible for the novel valve were recruited. Clinical outcomes and hemodynamic performance were reported at discharge and 30-day, 6-month, and 1-year follow-up.
Twelve patients (73.75 ± 7.28 years, 25% female, mean Society of Thoracic Surgeons score 4.51% [4.07%-4.87%], 66.67% bicuspid valve) were enrolled. Procedural success was achieved in 83.33% (1 fully device retrieval and 1 death due to coronary obstruction). All patients successfully underwent transcatheter aortic valve replacement were in NYHA functional class I/II at the 30-day follow-up, and significant improvement was shown in 6-minute walk distance and Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire score (all P < 0.001). At 1 year, the effective orifice area (2.31 ± 0.33 cm2 vs 0.82 ± 0.14 cm2) and mean pressure gradient (6.33 ± 2.54 mm Hg vs 47.50 ± 13.82 mm Hg) improved substantially, so did those in bicuspid patients (all P < 0.001). No moderate/severe paravalvular leakage was recorded, and computed tomography scans revealed no evidence of subclinical leaflet thrombosis during follow-up. After discharge, no patients reported death, stroke, new pacemakers, or valve-related reintervention.
The preliminary outcomes of the novel transcatheter heart valve demonstrated a favorable hemodynamic performance with an acceptable safety profile at 1 year. Long-term follow-up is warranted to assess its durability in treating patients with AS."

The onset of diabetes mellitus has been reported to precede cardiovascular complications including cardiomyopathy, aortic stenosis, cardiac hypertrophy and hypertension. In addition to metabolic derangements, chronic medications such as HIV-antiretrovirals have also been associated with the risk factors of CVDs such as insulin resistance, dyslipidaemia, inflammation and oxidative stress and impaired glucose tolerance. Previous ART regimens have been associated with systemic insulin resistance and ectopic fat accumulation, leading to impaired glucose tolerance. The underlying molecular mechanisms behind the development of diabetic cardiomyopathies in persons chronically taking HIV-antiretrovirals remains unclear. Prediabetes is a condition of impaired glucose tolerance that is associated with low-grade inflammation and oxidative stress, which are precursors of CVDs. The link between chronic HIV-antiretroviral medication and prediabetes remains elusive. However, the increase in dispensation of HIV-antiretroviral medications has been associated with an increase in cases of prediabetes and diabetes, which could contribute to the development of CVDs. Hence, this review aims to provide insight into how the use of ARVs interacts with glucose metabolism and cardiovascular disease risk factors in patients on chronic HIV antiretrovirals."

Although uncommon, associations between cardiac infection and advanced malignancy, particularly with malignancy serving as the source of infection, have been documented in the literature, making this case clinically significant and complex.                                                           Case presentation                     A 54-year-old postmenopausal woman with insulin-dependent diabetes and poorly managed hypertension, who had previously undergone mitral valve replacement with a mechanical prosthesis and tricuspid valve repair for rheumatic mitral stenosis, was admitted for atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response. On admission, she presented with normochromic normocytic anaemia (7.7 g/dL), elevated inflammatory markers (CRP 250 mg/L), and leukocytosis (14,000/µL, neutrophils 10,000/µL). Transthoracic and transesophageal echocardiography identified vegetation on the mitral prosthesis with elevated gradients. Blood cultures were positive for Escherichia coli. A thoraco-abdominopelvic CT scan revealed a rectal tumor, confirmed by FDG-PET, with features consistent with metastatic colorectal cancer, considered the entry point for the infectious endocarditis. Tumor markers including ACE, CA 19 − 9, and CA 72 − 4 were elevated. The patient was treated with dual antibiotic therapy and showed initial clinical improvement but later died due to ventricular tachycardia.                                                           Conclusions                     This case highlights the importance of considering atypical sources, such as metastatic cancer, in unresolved cases of endocarditis. It underscores the need for comprehensive diagnostic assessment, including oncologic evaluation, in patients with prosthetic valve endocarditis caused by atypical pathogens like E. coli. It also stresses the importance of multidisciplinary collaboration between cardiology and oncology teams. This case report is significant due to its illustration of how infectious endocarditis on a prosthetic mitral valve revealed an underlying metastatic colorectal cancer (CRC)."

Materials and Methods: A total of 143 patients with heart failure and left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) under 50% were included in this retrospective cross-sectional study. Patients were classified into two groups according to the presence of VT. Clinical, biochemical, and echocardiographic variables were compared between groups. Independent predictors of VT were identified using multivariable logistic regression analysis. Results: MAC was significantly more prevalent in the VT group compared with controls (43.6% vs. 17.4%, p &lt; 0.001) and was the strongest independent predictor of VT (OR: 2.74; 95% CI: 1.13–6.65; p = 0.026). Higher inflammatory activity, lower serum albumin levels, increased left atrial volume, renal dysfunction, and elevated diastolic filling pressures were also associated with VT. Conclusion: MAC is a strong and independent predictor of ventricular tachycardia in patients with reduced and mildly reduced ejection fraction. Incorporating MAC into the overall arrhythmic risk profile alongside inflammatory, metabolic, and structural parameters may improve risk stratification in this population."

Left atrial reservoir strain (LASR) is a sensitive marker of atrial dysfunction and may offer incremental prognostic value. This study evaluated whether LASR predicts all-cause mortality and heart failure (HF) hospitalizations in FMR, its performance in VFMR versus AFMR, and its utility over standard echocardiographic parameters.                                                           Methods                     We retrospectively analyzed 102 patients (mean age 68 ± 14 years, 41.2% female) with at least moderate FMR who underwent transesophageal echocardiography between 2018 and 2023. Patients were categorized into VFMR (LV dysfunction or remodelling) and AFMR (LA enlargement with preserved LV function). LASR was assessed using speckle-tracking echocardiography. Primary and secondary endpoints were all-cause mortality and HF hospitalization, respectively. Cox models evaluated associations with outcomes, including subgroup analysis by LASR quartiles and additional risk stratification combining LASR with peak tricuspid regurgitation (TR) velocity.                                                           Results                                            LASR was independently associated with all-cause mortality in multivariate Cox regression (adjusted HR = 0.887,                       p                        = 0.039).

When combined with peak TR velocity in a composite risk model, patients with LASR ≤ 9.0% or TR velocity &gt; 3.0 m/s had significantly higher risks of mortality (HR = 2.853,                       p                        = 0.012) and HF hospitalization (HR = 3.922,                       p                        = 0.029).                                                                                Conclusions                     LASR, particularly when combined with TR velocity, provides strong prognostic value in FMR, supporting its potential role in refining risk assessment."

With a focus on the prevalent psychological complications following the onset of this condition, this study aimed to explore the correlation between antenatal depression and Corona disease anxiety, personality traits, and postpartum depression during the COVID-19 pandemic.                                                           Materials and Methods:                     This cross-sectional descriptive-analytical study investigated women receiving care at health centers affiliated with Kerman University of Medical Sciences during the last month of their pregnancy and the postpartum period in 2022. Following the acquisition of informed consent, participants were assessed using various measures, including demographic and obstetric information, the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale, the Corona Disease Anxiety Scale (CDAS), and the NEO Personality Inventory-Revised during their third trimester of pregnancy. The same group of participants completed the Edinburgh Depression Scale and the Corona Disease Anxiety Scale (CDAS) 4-6 weeks after childbirth.                                                           Results and Discussion:                     There was a significant correlation between family income, unwanted pregnancy as perceived by both the mother and father, and antenatal depression. Additionally, marital satisfaction played a significant role in postpartum depression. Furthermore, antenatal depression was significantly associated with neuroticism, agreeableness, and physical symptoms related to Corona disease anxiety. Personality traits, with the exception of extroversion and conscientiousness, and various domains of Corona disease anxiety, excluding psychological symptoms, were also significantly associated with postpartum depression.                                                           Conclusion:                     During pandemics or epidemics, such as the COVID-19 outbreak, experiencing mental distress during pregnancy can contribute to mental health issues during the postpartum period. This risk is particularly true in individuals with unique personality traits, emphasizing the need for increased focus on mental health within prenatal care during these crises."

Method:                     This cross-sectional study was conducted in Kerman, Iran. Data were collected from patients who visited Afzalipour Hospital in Kerman more than twice during the COVID-19 epidemic from the end of February 2020 to March 21, 2021. We conducted two key analyses: 1. Mixed effect logistic regression was used to check the relationship between the variables and COVID-19 severity. 2. Mixed effect linear regression was used to check the relationship between the variables and the length of stay in the hospital.                                                           Results:                     The findings indicated that the most important risk factors for the severity of COVID-19 were heart diseases (OR=1.67,95%CI:1.20-2.30), increasing age (OR=2.23 for age&gt;54, 95%CI:1.70- 2.90), male gender (OR=1.47,95%CI:1.10-1.96), respiratory diseases other than asthma, and frequency of admission (OR=1.60,95%CI:1.20-2.15). All patients who underwent readmission experienced a shorter duration of hospitalization during their subsequent admission (OR=0.94,95%CI:0.91,0.96) and had a higher mortality rate (30% within 14 days, 26.6% between 14-90 days). Patients readmitted at intervals of 14-90 days and greater than 90 days exhibited lower disease severity compared to those readmitted within the 0-14 day period.                                                           Conclusion:                     Examining readmissions, the severity of COVID-19, and the length of hospital stay in affected patients are important factors for planning and allocating resources for COVID-19 management and treatment. These factors can help policymakers develop effective clinical guidelines for hospitalization or outpatient treatment of COVID-19 patients and contribute to reducing the burden of disease in the community."

Kinovea, as an accessible motion-analysis software, provides both visual and quantitative feedback. However, its application in supporting technique development among beginner athletes remains insufficiently explored. Aim: This study aims to describe the use of Kinovea in biomechanics training and examine its contribution to the awareness of kinematic characteristics and movement techniques among beginner athletes. Methods: A descriptive qualitative design involved 72 beginner athletes aged 18–25 years selected through purposive sampling. Data were collected over 16 weeks through interviews, field observations, and motion video recordings analyzed using Kinovea. Kinematic data focused on joint angles, stride behavior, and movement phases during walking, running, and the flight phase. Qualitative data were analyzed using content analysis with NVivo 12, while kinematic results were interpreted descriptively to identify performance patterns and areas for technical refinement. Result: Kinematic analysis showed coordinated joint-angle patterns across all phases. Walking analysis identified arm swing angles of 50.9°–58.8° and leg separation angles of 64.3°–67.2°, indicating a stable gait rhythm. The running analysis revealed knee angles of 68.8°–69.8° and elbow angles of 87.6°–89.1°, indicating efficient propulsive mechanics. The flight phase demonstrated knee angles of 81.2°–87.8° and elbow angles of 80.4°–88.3°, suggesting effective momentum use and postural stability. These measurements supported stride-efficiency assessment and technique evaluation. Qualitative findings revealed that Kinovea enabled athletes to interpret movement phases and identify technical inefficiencies through slow-motion and frame-by-frame visualization. Conclusion: Kinovea supports basic motion analysis by providing clear kinematic information and helping beginner athletes observe and refine their movement techniques. The findings also offer practical value for coaches by enabling more precise identification of inefficient patterns and guiding targeted corrections during early-stage training."

OpenAlex,aortic stenosis,[Analysis of optimizing indications for fetal pulmonary valvuloplasty based on a multi-parameter scoring system].,Y Wang; Y Sun; G Luo; S L Pan,,2026-02-02,PubMed,"<b>Objective:</b> To establish a multi-parametric scoring system for predicting postnatal circulatory outcomes in fetuses with critical pulmonary stenosis (CPS) and pulmonary atresia (PA) with intact ventricular septum (IVS), in order to optimize the indications for fetal pulmonary valvuloplasty (FPV). <b>Methods:</b> This was a retrospective cohort study. A total of 96 fetuses diagnosed with CPS-IVS or PA-IVS at Women and Children's Hospital, Qingdao University between July 2018 and June 2021 were included. Fetuses who did not undergo FPV constituted the modeling cohort, while those who underwent FPV constituted the validation cohort. Fetuses were classified into biventricular and non-biventricular circulation groups based on postnatal circulatory outcomes. Prenatal fetal echocardiographic parameters were compared between groups using independent-samples <i>t</i> test, Mann-Whitney <i>U</i> test, <i>χ</i><sup>2</sup> test or Fisher exact test. Based on inter-group differences, parameters associated with postnatal circulatory outcomes were screened in the modeling cohort. For continuous variables, optimal cut-off values were determined using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve and the Youden index and then dichotomized. Right ventricular endocardial fibroelastosis (EFE) was graded as 0, 1 or 2 according to severity. <i>OR</i> of each parameter were calculated, and a multiparametric scoring system was constructed. ROC curve was used to evaluate its predictive performance. Post-FPV outcome improvement was assessed in the validation cohort. <b>Results:</b> Among the 96 fetuses, 78 were assigned to the modeling cohort and 18 to the validation cohort. Postnatally, biventricular circulation was achieved in 56 cases (72%) in the modeling cohort and 13 cases in the validation cohort. In the modeling cohort, the right ventricular long-axis/left ventricular long-axis (RV/LV), tricuspid annulus diameter/mitral annulus diameter (TV/MV) and pulmonary valve annulus/aortic valve annulus (PV/AV) in the non-biventricular group were lower than that in the biventricular group (all <i>P</i><0.05). The optimal cut-off values for predicting postnatal circulatory outcomes were 0.65, 0.82 and 0.78, respectively. There was statistically significant difference in the distribution of circulatory outcomes between fetuses with grade 2 EFE and those with no or grade 1 EFE (<i>χ</i><sup>2</sup>=21.28, <i>P</i><0.001). Therefore, right ventricular EFE was dichotomized in the model as ""none or grade 1"" versus ""grade 2"". Each parameter was assigned a corresponding weight based on its <i>OR</i> value, and an integer score was obtained to construct the scoring system: grade 2 right ventricular EFE was assigned 5 points, RV/LV≤0.65 was assigned 2 points, TV/MV≤0.82 was assigned 2 points, and PV/AV≤0.78 was assigned 1 point, with a maximum total score of 10 points. At cut-off scores of 3, 4, and 5 points, the areas under the curve were 0.88, 0.91, and 0.88, respectively, with the highest specificity (0.95, 95% <i>CI</i> 0.84-0.99) observed at a score threshold of 5 points. In the validation cohort, 15 fetuses had scores ≥5 points, among whom 10 fetuses achieved biventricular circulation after birth, whereas in the modeling cohort, only 1 of 18 fetuses achieved biventricular circulation after birth. <b>Conclusions:</b> A multiparametric scoring system based on prenatal fetal echocardiographic parameters can effectively predict non-biventricular postnatal outcomes in fetuses with CPS-IVS and PA-IVS. By identifying high-risk patients, the indications for FPV can be optimized."
OpenAlex,aortic stenosis,Can Acute Kidney Injury After Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement Alone Predict Poor Prognosis in Diabetic Patients?,Nur Ozer Sensoy; Fatih Levent; Ece Çelebi Coşkun; Günseli Demir; Mustafa Yılmaz,10.37990/medr.1654048,2026-01-31,Medical Records,"Aim: Transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) has become a well-recognized treatment option for patients with symptomatic severe aortic stenosis (AS) who are deemed to have a higher risk for surgical intervention. Due to underlying comorbidities, acute kidney injury (AKI) continues to be a common complication, especially in patients with diabetes mellitus after TAVR. The aim of this study is to evaluate the effect of postoperative AKI development in diabetic patients undergoing TAVR on the development of mortality and major adverse cardiac events (MACE) in these patients. Material and Method: A total of 141 patients who underwent TAVR between January 2015 and January 2020 were grouped according to whether they developed AKI and whether they had MACE. MACE and 5-year mortality status were compared according to whether the patients developed AKI. Results: A total of 35 patients were observed to develop AKI (24.8%). Additionally, MACE was observed in 36 patients (25.5%). Five-year mortality rates (42.9% vs. 15.1%; p = 0.002) and MACE rates (54.3% vs. 16%; p &lt; 0.001) were significantly higher in the AKI group. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses identified AKI as a significant independent predictor of MACE development, regardless of other associated parameters (OR = 3.92, 95% CI: 1.28–12.02; p = 0.017). Conclusion: The most important result obtained in this study is that AKI development in diabetic patients who underwent TAVR with the diagnosis of advanced aortic stenosis has an effect on the development of MACE and long-term mortality independently of other parameters."
OpenAlex,aortic stenosis,"Accuracy of fetal echocardiography in detecting lesions associated with, and predicting surgical plan for, dextro‐transposition of the great arteries and double outlet right ventricle with subpulmonary ventricular septal defect and predicted transposition physiology",Hamsika Chandrasekar; Michelle Kaplinski; S. A. Maskatia; M. J. Beattie; D. Y. Ho; C. D. Reddy; Rajesh Punn,10.1002/uog.70169,2026-01-30,Ultrasound in Obstetrics and Gynecology,"ABSTRACT Objectives In dextro‐transposition of the great arteries (D‐TGA) and double outlet right ventricle with subpulmonary ventricular septal defect (DORV‐SPV) and predicted transposition physiology, the presence of associated lesions, such as ventricular septal defect (VSD), coarctation of the aorta (CoA) or pulmonary stenosis (PS), impacts prenatal counseling and complicates neonatal surgery. This study aimed to evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of fetal echocardiography (FE) and its ability to predict the postnatal surgical plan in fetuses with D‐TGA or DORV‐SPV. Methods This was a single‐center retrospective cohort study of fetuses with D‐TGA or DORV‐SPV who were liveborn, had a recorded plan for postnatal intervention and were managed at Lucile Packard Children's Hospital, Palo Alto, CA, USA, between January 2013 and January 2024. In cases with serial FE examinations, all available FE reports were included in the analysis, in addition to the first postnatal echocardiogram report. For echocardiograms with incomplete measurement data, a single reader retrospectively obtained FE and postnatal echocardiogram measurements while blinded to clinical outcomes. Prenatal predictions for postnatal surgical repair were extracted from the fetal cardiology consultation notes and postnatal clinical data were obtained by chart review. Final FE and postnatal echocardiogram diagnoses, as well as prenatal surgical‐plan predictions and subsequent postnatal surgical repairs performed, were compared and the percentage concordance was calculated to obtain FE diagnostic accuracy. Receiver‐operating‐characteristics (ROC) curves were generated to evaluate the association of FE aortic and pulmonary measurements with postnatal CoA repair. Results The study included 99 fetuses, of which 45 were diagnosed postnatally with simple D‐TGA with no associated lesions (i.e. D‐TGA with intact ventricular septum), 38 with complex D‐TGA with associated lesions and 15 with DORV, and one neonate was diagnosed prenatally with DORV‐SPV but postnatally diagnosed with truncus arteriosus. In the majority (65%) of patients, serial FE was performed. The percentage concordance between fetal and postnatal echocardiogram diagnoses was high for simple D‐TGA (95% (42/44)) and D‐TGA with VSD and PS (100% (3/3)). The concordance was progressively lower for diagnoses of D‐TGA with VSD (93% (25/27)), DORV‐SPV (60% (3/5)), DORV‐SPV with CoA (40% (4/10)), D‐TGA with VSD and CoA (29% (2/7)), D‐TGA with isolated CoA (0% (0/2)) and DORV‐SPV with PS (0% (0/1)). Similarly, surgical‐plan accuracy between prenatal prediction and postnatal repair performed was highest for cases of simple D‐TGA and D‐TGA with VSD and PS, while it was lower for other diagnoses. Qualitative descriptions of VSD size changed frequently over serial FE examinations, with VSDs generally described as larger on later FE. However, between the final FE and postnatal echocardiogram, in those with discordance, the description of VSD size usually became smaller. Only 50% of small VSDs identified on postnatal echocardiography required repair. All patients who underwent postnatal repair of CoA had a VSD present. All area under the ROC curve values for aortic measurements and for ratios of aortic‐to‐pulmonary dimensions in predicting the need for postnatal CoA repair were greater than 0.9. Conclusions Challenges remain in the accurate diagnosis and prediction of the postnatal surgical plan in fetuses with complex D‐TGA and DORV‐SPV. The assessment of qualitative VSD size description changed frequently over serial FE evaluations, and between final FE and postnatal echocardiogram, with small defects often not requiring repair. Aortic and aortic‐to‐pulmonary ratio measurements in fetuses with D‐TGA or DORV‐SPV appear to have improved the discriminatory ability in identifying cases that undergo postnatal CoA repair relative to fetuses with isolated CoA. © 2026 International Society of Ultrasound in Obstetrics and Gynecology."
OpenAlex,aortic stenosis,Delayed complete atrioventricular block 11 months after transcatheter aortic valve replacement in a patient with a short membranous septum: a case report,Jian Xiong; Djandan Tadum Arthur Vithran; Zhixiao Wang; Zheng Cao; Xiaoyong Hu,10.3389/fcvm.2026.1703981,2026-01-30,Frontiers in Cardiovascular Medicine,"Conduction disturbances are among the most frequent complications of transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR), typically occurring within the first 72 h after implantation. However, delayed complete atrioventricular (AV) block is rare and may present late with serious clinical consequences. We describe the case of a 72-year-old man with hypertension who developed complete AV block nearly 1 year after TAVR, underscoring the importance of long-term surveillance in patients with high-risk anatomy. The patient initially presented with progressive exertional dyspnea and was diagnosed with severe low-flow, low-gradient aortic stenosis, with a left ventricular ejection fraction of 33%. Preprocedural computed tomography demonstrated a short membranous septum (4.0 mm) and an annulus–membranous septum distance of 1.2 mm, both of which are recognized predictors of conduction disturbances. He underwent transfemoral TAVR with a self-expanding Qiming L26 valve implanted at a depth of approximately 5 mm. Early recovery was uneventful, aside from a small paravalvular leak, which resolved by the 8-month follow-up, at which time echocardiography showed recovery of systolic function to 60%, and sinus rhythm was observed on electrocardiography. At 11 months following TAVR, a community screening ECG revealed 2:1 AV block, and 3 weeks later, he presented with symptomatic complete AV block and a ventricular escape rhythm at 30 bpm. Repeat CT showed increased frame depth (7.6 and 9.8 mm), suggesting possible valve–septum interaction; however, causal attribution is limited by the absence of immediate/serial CT and electrophysiological mapping, and age-related conduction system disease may have contributed to this finding. A dual-chamber permanent pacemaker was implanted, resulting in complete symptomatic recovery and a stable prosthetic valve function. This case report highlights a rare but clinically important phenomenon of very late conduction block after TAVR and supports a risk-stratified approach to anatomical assessment and long-term rhythm monitoring. However, this inference remains hypothesis-generating, given its single-patient nature."

Oh,10.1161/jaha.125.046558,2026-01-30,Journal of the American Heart Association,"Background Artificial intelligence (AI)–enabled electrocardiography has emerged as a tool for detecting cardiac dysfunction. The prognostic relevance of AI‐enabled electrocardiography–derived diastolic dysfunction (DD) in patients undergoing transcatheter aortic valve replacement had not been assessed. Methods We analyzed 3197 patients undergoing transcatheter aortic valve replacement for severe aortic stenosis between 2010 and 2023 with baseline 12‐lead ECGs processed by a validated AI model to classify diastolic function (grades 0–3). Multivariable Cox models and nested model comparisons assessed associations with all‐cause mortality, including a prespecified analysis in patients with indeterminate echocardiographic grading. Trajectories were defined by change in AI‐enabled electrocardiography DD grade (&lt;2 versus ≥2) from baseline to 30‐day or 1‐year follow‐up. Results At baseline, 21% had grade 3, 57% had grade 2, 8% had grade 1, and 14% had grade 0 AI‐enabled electrocardiography DD. Higher grades were associated with adverse cardiac remodeling and comorbidities. Over a median follow‐up of 3.4 years, grade 3 AI‐enabled electrocardiography DD independently predicted mortality (hazard ratio [HR], 1.80 [95% CI, 1.47–2.20]; P &lt;0.001). AI‐enabled electrocardiography DD improved prognostic discrimination beyond clinical and echocardiographic measures (ΔHarrell concordance statistic, 0.016; Δ χ 2 =57; P &lt;0.001). Among 1259 patients with indeterminate echocardiographic grading, AI‐enabled electrocardiography added prognostic value (ΔHarrell concordance statistic, 0.02; Δ χ 2 =13; P =0.006). Worsening or persistently high‐risk trajectories were associated with increased mortality (HRs, 1.45–1.80; all P &lt;0.05). Conclusions AI‐enabled electrocardiography–derived DD independently predicts mortality after transcatheter aortic valve replacement, adds value beyond echocardiographic grading, and enables dynamic risk stratification through longitudinal tracking."
OpenAlex,aortic stenosis,Patient‐Specific Computational Flow Simulation Reveals Adverse Hemodynamic Factors Associated With Occlusion of Directional Branches After Fenestrated‐Branched Endovascular Aneurysm Repair,Kenneth Tran; Jesse Chait; Emmanuel Tenorio; Weiguang Yang; Alison L. Marsden; Bernardo Mendes; Lee Jc; Gustavo S. Oderich,10.1161/jaha.125.044790,2026-01-30,Journal of the American Heart Association,"Background Fenestrated and branched endovascular aneurysm repair can be complicated by branch vessel occlusion in the absence of structural stenosis. We hypothesized that computational flow simulation could identify adverse hemodynamic features associated with postfenestrated and branched endovascular aneurysm repair branch occlusion. Methods Patients undergoing 4‐vessel fenestrated and branched endovascular aneurysm repair for Extent II to IV thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysms were retrospectively reviewed. Branches that occluded without identifiable kinking or stenosis on computed tomography were included, along with an equal cohort of anatomy‐matched patent controls. Patient‐specific pulsatile rigid‐wall simulations were performed using SimVascular with individualized geometries and boundary conditions. Abnormal time‐averaged wall shear stress (TAWSS) was defined as &lt;10 or &gt;70 dynes/cm 2 . Results Nine patients (36 target vessels) experienced 10 branch occlusions. Postoperative pressure and flow did not differ significantly between occluded and patent renal or mesenteric branches. However, occluded renal and mesenteric branches demonstrated significantly larger postoperative areas of abnormal TAWSS compared with controls (renal: 14.5% versus 5.9%, P =0.003; mesenteric: 17.7% versus 9.9%, P =0.035). Logistic generalized estimating equation modeling showed abnormal TAWSS to be a significant predictor of renal branch occlusion ( P =0.0085). Model estimates suggested occlusion probabilities of 1.1%, 31%, and 94% at 0%, 10%, and 20% abnormal TAWSS surface area, respectively. A cluster‐bootstrapped receiver operating characteristic curve (area under the curve, 0.876) identified a &gt;10.2% threshold that correctly classified 92% of renal occlusions. Abnormal TAWSS frequently localized to distal stent–artery interfaces. Conclusions Elevated abnormal TAWSS within stented renal branches is associated with subsequent branch occlusion after fenestrated and branched endovascular aneurysm repair. Computational flow simulation‐derived TAWSS thresholds may help identify high‐risk branches before failure, warranting prospective validation."
OpenAlex,aortic stenosis,Acute Cardiac Dysfunction and Rapid Descending Aortic Expansion Following Surgery for Acute Stanford Type A Aortic Dissection: a case report,Koki Yokawa; Taku Nakagawa; Yosuke Tanaka; Kazunori Yoshida; Hidetaka Wakiyama,10.1093/ehjcr/ytag082,2026-01-30,European Heart Journal - Case Reports,"Abstract Background Severe true lumen stenosis of the aorta can increase left ventricular afterload and impair cardiac function. We report a rare case of significant true lumen stenosis and cardiac dysfunction after undergoing total arch replacement for acute type A aortic dissection. Case Summary A 39-year-old man with acute Stanford type A aortic dissection and intimal tear in the ascending aorta underwent the Bentall procedure and total arch replacement with a frozen elephant trunk. He was readmitted one month after discharge with progressive cardiac dysfunction. Myocardial scintigraphy excluded ischemia, and computed tomography revealed severe true lumen stenosis at the distal frozen elephant trunk, resulting in an elevated left ventricular afterload. Thoracic endovascular aortic repair to expand the true lumen resulted in gradual improvement in cardiac function. However, there was progressive dilation of the descending and thoracoabdominal aorta: 26 mm at onset, and 32 mm and 46 mm at two and six months postoperatively, respectively. To close distal re-entries, endovascular aortic repair was performed after two months. His brain natriuretic peptide level decreased from 2901 pg/mL to 142 pg/mL over eight months; open abdominal aortic replacement was performed nine months after the onset, after sufficient cardiac function recovery (ejection fraction = 40%). Discussion True lumen stenosis is a substantial reversible cause of cardiac dysfunction after type A dissection surgery. Thoracic endovascular aortic repair effectively reduces the afterload and restores cardiac function; long-term imaging and staged intervention are essential to address distal aortic remodeling."

To assess the contribution of aortic valve (AV) calcification severity to permanent pacemaker (PP) insertion after transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) during the hospitalization. Material and methods . The study included 94 patients with severe aortic stenosis who underwent TAVI. All patients underwent multislice computed tomography (CT) before the procedure to assess AV calcification. Results . During the hospital period, eight patients (8,5%) required PP implantation. CT made it possible to reveal that patients who underwent pacemaker implantation after TAVI compared with patients without pacemaker had higher calcium volume in the left coronary cusp (LCC) (424,6 mm 3 [223,1-524,7] vs 151,6 mm 3 [91,9-276,2], respectively, p=0,005) and non-coronary cusp (608,2 mm 3 [254,5-805,2] vs 283,7 mm 3 [173,6-398,9], respectively, p=0,035). As a result of multivariate regression analysis, the independent predictors of pacemaker implantation after TAVI were the initial right bundle branch block (RBBB) (odds ratio (OR): 15,77; 95% confidence interval (CI): 2,06-120,5; p=0,008) and LCC calcium volume &gt;300 mm 3 (OR: 7,98; 95% CI: 1,38-46,11; p=0,020). Conclusion . According to the study results, initial RBBB and LCC calcification are independent predictors of permanent pacemaker implantation after TAVI during the hospital period. Further studies are needed to predict and prevent post-operative complications."
OpenAlex,aortic stenosis,Comparing TAVR + PCI vs. SAVR + CABG across short- and mid- to long-term horizons in patients with severe aortic stenosis and concomitant CAD: a systematic review and meta-analysis,Xiang Fang; Xuge Zhang; Fei Wei; Shenghong Feng; Xiaomei Chen,10.3389/fcvm.2026.1640906,2026-01-30,Frontiers in Cardiovascular Medicine,"Background The optimal revascularization approach for intermediate- and high-risk individuals with severe aortic stenosis (AS) and concomitant coronary artery disease (CAD) remains uncertain, particularly regarding the comparative short- and mid- to long-term outcomes of transcatheter aortic valve replacement with percutaneous coronary intervention (TAVR + PCI) vs. surgical aortic valve replacement with coronary artery bypass grafting (SAVR + CABG). Methods A systematic search of major databases was conducted up to March 2025 to identify studies comparing TAVR + PCI vs. SAVR + CABG in this population. Meta-analyses were performed using a random-effects model to estimate pooled odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Evidence quality was assessed using the GRADE framework. Results Thirteen studies comprising 53,869 patients were analyzed. Compared with SAVR + CABG, TAVR + PCI was associated with lower 30-day risks of stroke, myocardial infarction, and acute kidney injury, but higher permanent pacemaker implantation. No differences were found in all-cause mortality, major vascular complications, or major bleeding. In mid- to long-term follow-up (≥2 years), the TAVR + PCI group exhibited increased risks of all-cause mortality, myocardial infarction, and repeat revascularization, with similar stroke rates between strategies. Certainty of evidence ranged from very low to moderate. Conclusions In intermediate- and high-risk patients with severe AS and concomitant CAD, TAVR + PCI appears to confer short-term safety advantages but may be associated with less favorable mid- to long-term outcomes compared with SAVR + CABG. These findings support individualized revascularization strategies that balance early procedural safety against longer-term risks and highlight the need for further randomized trials with extended follow-up.

Methods: This descriptive case series included three patients who underwent TAVI at the Cardiovascular Center, E Hospital. The cohort comprised one valve-in-valve procedure for a degenerated surgical bioprosthesis and two cases of native severe calcific aortic stenosis. All patients underwent comprehensive pre-procedural assessment, including clinical evaluation, electrocardiography, transthoracic echocardiography, and multidetector computed tomography according to a standard TAVI protocol. Hydra THV sizing was based on annular perimeter and the perimeter-derived diameter. Early outcomes were assessed using contemporary standardized TAVI endpoint definitions. Results: All three TAVI procedures were successfully performed via the transfemoral approach. There were no cases of in-hospital mortality, major vascular complications, stroke, or acute coronary obstruction. Following the intervention, transaortic valve gradients were markedly reduced, valve hemodynamics were favorable, and paravalvular regurgitation was no more than mild. The valve-in-valve case involving a small annulus was managed successfully without coronary-related complications. All patients experienced early clinical improvement. Conclusions: In this small case series, TAVI using the Hydra THV self-expanding valve demonstrated favorable early feasibility and safety, even in complex anatomical settings such as valve-in-valve procedures and patients with peripheral arterial disease. Larger studies with extended follow-up are needed to further evaluate long-term valve performance and durability."

Methods: A prospective, cross-sectional study conducted in patients with severe aortic valve stenosis undergoing surgery, with longitudinal follow-up at 1 month and 3 months postoperatively. The study was carried out at the Cardiovascular Center, E Hospital, from October 2024 to November 2025. Results: A total of 30 patients were included, with a mean age of 64.5 ± 6.0 years, and 56.7% were male. Preoperatively, the mean left ventricular ejection fraction (EF) was 55%, the mean GLS was −15.7 ± 4.8, and the mean transaortic pressure gradient was 54.7 ± 16.5 mmHg. Postoperatively, global longitudinal strain showed a trend toward improvement over the follow-up period at 1 week and 3 months, respectively. Postoperative GLS demonstrated a strong correlation with preoperative EF and left ventricular end-diastolic diameter. Conclusions: Left ventricular global longitudinal strain assessed by 2D speckle-tracking echocardiography is a useful parameter for evaluating left ventricular function in patients with severe aortic valve stenosis before and after surgical valve replacement and shows a strong correlation with conventional echocardiographic parameters."

While male sex has been implicated as a risk factor for AVC, sex-specific differences, particularly among younger individuals in the general population, are not well characterised. Methods The Swedish CArdioPulmonary BioImage Study was used, comprising 30 154 individuals between 50 and 64 years, randomly selected from the general population. Study participants were part of a prospective cohort and underwent laboratory tests, clinical examinations, comprehensive questionnaires and cardiac CT. Cardiac CT was used for determining presence of AVC. Logistic regression analysis was performed to assess associations between traditional cardiovascular risk factors and AVC. Results In total, 29 160 participants were included and AVC was found in 1291 men (9%) and 730 women (5%). Male sex was an independent predictor of AVC (OR 1.91; 95% CI 1.71 to 2.13). Characteristics associated with AVC were similar between the sexes. In the adjusted analyses, lipoprotein(a), hyperlipidaemia, hypertension and smoking were strongly associated with AVC, whereas low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, diabetes, glycated haemoglobin and estimated glomerular filtration rate showed no significant associations with AVC. Higher body mass index (BMI) was associated with AVC in men but not women. Conclusions Male sex was independently associated with AVC, and the prevalence of AVC was nearly twice as high in men as in women. Traditional cardiovascular risk factors, including lipoprotein(a), hyperlipidaemia, hypertension and smoking, were associated with AVC, with similar associations between sexes, except for BMI, which was associated with AVC in men but not in women."
OpenAlex,aortic stenosis,High Risk Repeated Cardiac Surgery for Recurrent Subaortic Stenosis With a Favorable Outcome: A Case Report,Feras Zoreka; Abeer H Alkudsi; Abdulsater Allababidi; Lubana Shadoud,10.1097/cd9.0000000000000185,2026-01-29,Cardiology Discovery,"Abstract Subaortic stenosis is a form of left ventricular outflow tract obstruction, accounting for approximately 14% of cases. It occurs as an acquired lesion after repair of congenital heart disease and rarely following mitral valve repair or replacement. A 40-year-old female presented with dyspnea on minimal exertion, palpitations, and chronic hemolytic anemia. Her medical history included cardiac surgery at the age of 10 for closure of an atrial septal defect and mitral valve repair. Then, at the age of 28, she underwent another cardiac surgery to resect a subaortic stenosis, which recurred within one year. This recurrence led to a redo surgery involving mitral valve replacement with a 25-mm St. Jude prosthesis. Subsequent investigations demonstrated membranous subaortic stenosis with severe aortic valve insufficiency and partial de-insertion of the mitral valve with a small atrial septal defect. Management aimed to eliminate all systemic and structural factors contributing to increased flow in the left ventricular outflow tract, which are known to play an important role in the recurrence of subaortic stenosis. For this purpose, the patient underwent the fourth cardiac surgery involving aortic valve replacement, membrane resection, repair of the leak around the mitral valve, and atrial septal defect closure. She recovered within 2 months after surgery and resumed her job. During a 6-year follow-up period, she remained in good health with no evidence of cardiac dysfunction. Despite the considerable risks associated with repeated surgical interventions for recurrent subaortic stenosis, favorable long-term outcomes may outweigh these risks."
OpenAlex,aortic stenosis,Abstract WP125: Lipoprotein(a) and Echocardiographic Findings in Ischemic Stroke: Aortic Plaque as a Potential Signal,Solomon Oak; Gauri Patil; Connor Davy; Laura Stein; Steven Rudolph,10.1161/str.57.suppl_1.wp125,2026-01-29,Stroke,"Background: Lipoprotein(a) [Lp(a)] is a genetically determined, pro-atherogenic lipoprotein associated with ischemic stroke risk. While both Lp(a) and aortic arch plaque are established stroke risk factors, no studies have directly examined the relationship between Lp(a) levels and aortic arch plaque presence or characteristics in ischemic stroke patients. Aortic arch plaque is an established embolic source, but its relationship with Lp(a) levels in stroke patients has not been examined. Methods: We analyzed 188 consecutive ischemic stroke patients (2024–2025) from the Mount Sinai Health System Get With The Guidelines–Stroke registry with documented Lp(a) levels and echocardiographic evaluations. We abstracted patient demographics, including sex, age, race, and past medical history. Echocardiogram findings included ejection fraction (EF), aortic plaque, aortic stenosis, and left atrial enlargement. We additionally abstracted stroke subtype, as defined by TOAST classification. Based on previously established methods in Lp(a) research, patients were stratified by cohort-based Lp(a) tertiles (≤65, &gt;65–165, &gt;165 nmol/L). We compared echocardiographic findings and TOAST stroke subtypes across Lp(a) groups. Kruskal-Wallis and chi-square/Fisher’s tests were used for group comparisons. Results: Median age was 68.5 years (IQR 61–78), 45.7% were female, and median Lp(a) was 100 nmol/L (IQR 56–188). Race distribution significantly differed across Lp(a) tertiles ( p =0.008). Black patients comprised 39.7% of the lowest tertile, 70.5% of the middle tertile, and 66.1% of the highest tertile, despite representing 58.0% of the overall cohort. Eighteen (9.6%) patients had aortic arch plaque, which was more common in the highest Lp(a) tertile (17.5%) than in the middle (8.1%) or lowest (3.2%) ( p =0.02). Other echocardiographic findings and stroke subtype did not differ by Lp(a) tertile. Conclusions: In this cohort of ischemic stroke patients, higher Lp(a) was associated with the presence of aortic arch plaque on echocardiography. Although there was no difference in stroke subtype, aortic arch plaque may be an underrecognized source of stroke in patients with elevated Lp(a) and may provide further support for efforts to aggressively modify the atherosclerotic risk factor profile in these patients."

How QFR reclassifies coronary artery disease (CAD) at vessel‐level compared to angiography and how this influences the risk of death, remains undetermined. Methods We calculated QFR from consecutive 280 TAVR patients with bystander coronary stenoses. All lesions were managed conservatively. Angiographic CAD was defined by a diameter stenosis ≥ 50%, functional CAD by a QFR ≤ 0.80. The outcome was mortality at 3 years. Results Overall, 635 lesions were included. Angiographic CAD was evident in 165 (26.0%), functional CAD in 17 (11.2%) (reclassification: p &lt; 0.001). Angiography/QFR mismatch occurred in 22.5%, mostly in large vessels and lesions located in the proximal left anterior descending (LAD). QFR ≤ 0.80 was an independent predictor of death (HR 2.91, 95% CI 1.94−4.36; p &lt; 0.001). The risk was progressively increased for lower QFR values and positive QFR at LAD site (vs. QFR &gt; 0.80 HR: 3.92, 95% CI 2.78−5.53; p &lt; 0.001; vs. QFR ≤ 0.80 at non‐LAD site: HR 2.65, 95% CI 1.07−6.59; p = 0.034). Conclusions QFR leads to a significant reclassification of CAD rates at vessel‐level and shows a significant prognostic value in patients undergoing TAVR."

Schreyer,10.1093/ehjcr/ytag075,2026-01-29,European Heart Journal - Case Reports,"Abstract Background Caseous calcification of the mitral annulus (CCMA), also referred to as “toothpaste tumour”, is a rare variant of calcification of the mitral annulus (MAC). The prognosis and pathogenesis of CCMA remain obscure. Overall CCMA is benign and usually asymptomatic, but can manifest with abscess formation, embolic events such as stroke or significant mitral valve dysfunction. Case Summary We report two cases of CCMA in elderly female patients. Patient 1 presented with dyspnoea and was diagnosed with CCMA and aortic valve stenosis. When her symptoms worsened over time, severe coronary artery disease was diagnosed in addition. Multimodality imaging, using transoesophageal echocardiography (TEE), cardiac computed tomography (CT) and cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (CMRI) confirmed CCMA that remained stable over the lifetime of the patient. Due to high surgical risks, a conservative management was chosen. Six years later, the patient died from decompensated aortic stenosis with cardiogenic shock. Patient 2 initially presented with chest pain. Three-vessel coronary artery disease was diagnosed and treated with stent implantation by staged percutaneous coronary intervention. Subsequent imaging (TEE, cardio-CT) revealed CCMA. Annual echocardiographic examination showed stable dimensions of the CCMA lesion over six years of follow-up. Discussion Early recognition of CCMA is crucial because it may lead to serious complications. Although spontaneous resolution has been reported, CCMA remained stable over several years in both of our cases. Both patients were elderly women with arterial hypertension and chronic renal failure, supporting the hypothesis of an atheroma-like pathogenesis."
OpenAlex,aortic stenosis,Case Report: Newly discovered ELN gene mutation in congenital heart disease: case analysis and review,peiwen Cheng; Guozhen Wang; Jialin Qiu; Xia Xie; Y F An,10.3389/fped.2026.1671066,2026-01-29,Frontiers in Pediatrics,"Introduction Supravalvular aortic stenosis (SVAS) is a rare left ventricular outflow tract obstruction, most commonly caused by pathogenic variants in ELN. Truncating variants in exons 1–29 typically produce non-syndromic SVAS through elastin haploinsufficiency, whereas C-terminal variants are linked to autosomal dominant cutis laxa. However, clinically and mechanistically well-characterized variants in the distal part of this “stenotic zone,” such as exon 28, remain uncommon. Methods We conducted a retrospective family-based case report with standardized clinical evaluation, serial echocardiography, and trio whole-exome sequencing with Sanger confirmation and conservation analysis. Results A female infant presented at 1 month with severe sinotubular junction narrowing (Z-score −4.8, peak gradient 24 mmHg), severe peripheral pulmonary artery stenosis, a small atrial septal defect, and moderate mitral regurgitation. Her father had severe SVAS with mild PPAS and prior aortic root enlargement, without syndromic features. Trio sequencing identified a novel heterozygous ELN exon 28 frameshift variant, c.1879_1883dup (p.Ala629LeufsTer15), inherited from the father. Ala629 is fully conserved, and the duplication introduces a premature stop codon, consistent with nonsense-mediated decay and elastin haploinsufficiency. At 9 months, SVAS progressed (peak gradient 35 mmHg), while PPAS gradients regressed by &amp;gt;40%. Conclusion This novel exon 28 ELN frameshift expands the non-syndromic SVAS spectrum and illustrates a characteristic pattern of progressive aortic stenosis with improving PPAS, supporting ELN testing and targeted longitudinal surveillance in similar patients and families."
OpenAlex,aortic stenosis,Evidence-based guidelines for aortic stenosis: Focus on surgical aortic valve replacement versus transcatheter aortic valve implantation for young patients,Jorge Alcocer; Eduard Quintana; María Dolores Cepero Ascaso; Ricard Pruna,10.1177/02184923251415153,2026-01-29,Asian Cardiovascular and Thoracic Annals,"Transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) has revolutionized the management of aortic stenosis and is now an established alternative to surgical aortic valve replacement (SAVR) for all surgical risk categories. However, the extension of TAVI to younger, low-risk patients has raised important questions regarding the long-term outcomes, valve durability, and lifetime management strategies for these patients. This narrative review summarizes the current evidence from pivotal randomized trials and contemporary registries comparing TAVI and SAVR in young, low-risk patients, integrating the latest 2025 ESC/EACTS guidelines. While short-term outcomes and early recovery favor TAVI, SAVR remains associated with proven durability, lower rates of conduction disturbances, and a potential advantage in long-term outcomes as follow-up data extend beyond five years. Anatomical challenges such as bicuspid valves, coronary access, and patient–prosthesis mismatch further complicate the use of TAVI in this population. A “SAVR-first” lifetime management approach appears to provide greater procedural flexibility and a lower reintervention risk. Ultimately, the choice between TAVI and SAVR in young patients should be individualized through a multidisciplinary Heart Team process, balancing early procedural benefits with long-term durability and reintervention considerations. This review highlights the need for dedicated long-term data and patient-tailored strategies in the evolving management of aortic stenosis in young low-risk individuals."

Given the prohibitive risk of redo surgery [3], the Heart Team performed ViV-TAVI using a Hydra THV 22mm self-expanding transcatheter heart valve. The procedure was uneventful. At 15 days follow-up, transthoracic echocardiography demonstrated excellent hemodynamics performance with a peak transvalvular gradient of 9 mmHg and a mean gradient of 4 mmHg and the patient had returned to New York Heart Association (NYHA) functional class I. This case highlights the feasibility and favorable early outcomes of Hydra THV in ViV-TAVI for small surgical bioprostheses, a subgroup frequently associated with high residual gradients and patient–prosthesis mismatch [5–7]. This report aims to describe a Valve-in-Valve TAVI procedure in a small bioprosthetic valve, emphasize the role of multimodality imaging, evaluate post-procedural hemodynamic outcomes, and discuss potential complications and preventive strategies, with particular focus on coronary obstruction and patient–prosthesis mismatch."
OpenAlex,aortic stenosis,Abstract DP311: One-Stop Head-Neck-Aortic Vessel Wall MRI: A New Imaging Approach for Assessing Supracardiac Atherosclerosis in Stroke,Qianmei Jiang; Jing Jing; Zhe Zhang; Yongjun Wang,10.1161/str.57.suppl_1.dp311,2026-01-29,Stroke,"Background: Supracardiac atherosclerosis—including carotid, vertebrobasilar, intracranial, and aortic arch arteries—is a major cause of stroke. While vessel wall MRI (vwMRI) can assess plaques, current techniques lack full head-neck-aortic coverage and efficiency. Purpose: To develop and validate a rapid, comprehensive head-neck-aortic vwMRI approach for assessing supracardiac atherosclerosis, comparing it with supra-aortic CTA and evaluating its value in identifying causes of embolic stroke of undetermined source (ESUS). Materials and Methods: A new non-contrast 3D head-neck-aortic vwMRI approach was developed for assessing supracardiac vasculature in ischemic stroke patients. It integrates a multi-coil hardware system with 3D black- and gray-blood vwMRI, accelerated by a novel neural network-based technique, achieving about 15-minute total scan time(Figure 1). Plaque vulnerabilities, stenosis, and stroke etiologies were compared between vwMRI and supra-aortic CTA. Results: From October 2024 to March 2025, 108 patients (mean age, 56 ± 14 years; 89 male) with ischemic stroke or transient ischemic attack underwent both vwMRI and supra-aortic CTA. vwMRI detected 301 plaques in 88 patients, versus 246 plaques in 75 patients by CTA (κ=0.583, p&lt;0.001). For plaque vulnerabilities, black- and gray-blood vwMRI achieved 91% accuracy for calcification using CTA as reference (Figure 2). vwMRI identified intraplaque hemorrhage and ulceration in 27.8% and 25.9% of cases, respectively, while CTA identified ulceration in 23.1% and had limited sensitivity for hemorrhage. For ≥50% vascular stenosis, CTA found 49 patients (25 occlusions), and vwMRI found 47 (24 occlusions), with identified causes including atherosclerosis (n=41), thrombus (n=3), and dissection (n=3). For stroke etiologies, of the 38 initially classified as ESUS by conventional evaluation including CTA, vwMRI reclassified 16 (14 with culprit plaques, 2 dissections), reducing the ESUS proportion from 35.2% (38/108) to 20.4% (22/108) (Figure 3). Conclusion: This one-stop, 15-minute head-neck-aortic vwMRI approach offers comprehensive and detailed evaluation of supracardiac atherosclerosis, improving stroke etiological classification—especially in ESUS patients—compared to CTA."
