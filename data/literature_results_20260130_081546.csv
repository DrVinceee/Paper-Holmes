PubMed,aortic stenosis,Evidence-based guidelines for aortic stenosis: Focus on surgical aortic valve replacement versus transcatheter aortic valve implantation for young patients.,Jorge Alcocer; Eduard Quintana; María Ascaso; Robert Pruna,10.1177/02184923251415153,2026-01-29,Asian cardiovascular & thoracic annals,"Transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) has revolutionized the management of aortic stenosis and is now an established alternative to surgical aortic valve replacement (SAVR) for all surgical risk categories. However, the extension of TAVI to younger, low-risk patients has raised important questions regarding the long-term outcomes, valve durability, and lifetime management strategies for these patients. This narrative review summarizes the current evidence from pivotal randomized trials and contemporary registries comparing TAVI and SAVR in young, low-risk patients, integrating the latest 2025 ESC/EACTS guidelines. While short-term outcomes and early recovery favor TAVI, SAVR remains associated with proven durability, lower rates of conduction disturbances, and a potential advantage in long-term outcomes as follow-up data extend beyond five years. Anatomical challenges such as bicuspid valves, coronary access, and patient-prosthesis mismatch further complicate the use of TAVI in this population. A ""SAVR-first"" lifetime management approach appears to provide greater procedural flexibility and a lower reintervention risk. Ultimately, the choice between TAVI and SAVR in young patients should be individualized through a multidisciplinary Heart Team process, balancing early procedural benefits with long-term durability and reintervention considerations. This review highlights the need for dedicated long-term data and patient-tailored strategies in the evolving management of aortic stenosis in young low-risk individuals."

Case reports,"Patients with a small aortic root and subvalvular stenosis are at risk of prosthesis-patient mismatch, making annular and left ventricular outflow tract (LVOT) enlargement essential.
We herein report the case of a 41-year-old woman with prosthetic valve dysfunction and severe LVOT obstruction due to pannus formation in whom a 12-mm sizer could not be passed. Redo aortic valve replacement with the combined Konno-Nicks procedure successfully enlarged the annulus and LVOT, enabling the implantation of a 4-size larger prosthesis based on intraoperative sizer measurements. Postoperative echocardiography and computed tomography confirmed effective valve enlargement and preserved valve function.
Combined anterior-posterior enlargement can be valuable for redo aortic valve replacement in patients with a small annulus and subvalvular stenosis to prevent prosthesis-patient mismatch.
The combined Konno-Nicks procedure can effectively relieve prosthetic valve dysfunction with severe subvalvular stenosis by enabling larger prosthesis implantation."

It is the main basis of decision making for the patient. Transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) has been established as the standard treatment option for symptomatic aortic stenosis-patients. Current guidelines recommend transfemoral TAVI for patients aged 70 years or older, independently of the surgical risk and for patients below 70 years of age if they are at high surgical risk.
To evaluate beneficial aspects of an explanatory video in addition to conventional medical counseling.
The study was conducted as a prospective, single-arm, monocentric cohort study. Eligible patients received conventional medical counseling, followed by an educational video. Evaluation of the conventional counseling and the educational video was obtained through a 32-item questionnaire. Two hypotheses were tested: Hypothesis 1: Showing an explanatory video in addition to the standard patient consent discussion improves the mediation of medical facts; and hypothesis 2: Showing an explanatory video in addition to the standard patient consent discussion improves patient satisfaction and confidence.
In total, 66 patients, scheduled for transfemoral TAVI were included, 59% of them were male and 41% female, averaging 81 ± 6.1 years old. Conventional medical counseling by the attending physician was the major criterium for overall patient satisfaction and had more influence on the absence of preprocedural tension than the transfer of additional factual knowledge through the video. Nearly two-thirds (61%) reported that the video enhanced their understanding of the procedure's benefits, while 42% indicated a better understanding of the potential risks and 56% felt that watching the video contributed to decreased preprocedural tension.
Conventional medical counseling was most important for overall patient satisfaction. Educational videos aid in information transfer, in the reduction of preprocedural tension and were strongly sought after by the patients."

Since an elevated pressure gradient in the left ventricular outflow tract (LVOT) is a distinguishing feature of DSS, it is hypothesized that the membrane formation is caused by elevated wall shear stress applied to the endocardial endothelial cells (EECs) that line the LVOT, triggering fibrosis. To correlate shear stress to an EEC fibrotic phenotype, we applied fluid shear stress to EECs at physiological and pathological shear rates using a cone-and-plate device, designed to recapitulate physiological wall shear stress in a controlled in vitro environment. Controlled shear stress regimes were applied to EECs to replicate the conditions observed in DSS patients. We found that elevated shear stress triggered EEC alignment as well as endothelial-to-mesenchymal transformation (EndMT) signaling pathways driven by upregulation of SNAI1 gene expression. The EECs were then treated with a small molecule inhibitor of Snail1 protein, CYD19, to attempt to attenuate EndMT signaling, and subsequently subjected to pathological shear stress. The Snail1 inhibitor did downregulate selected markers of EndMT signaling, although only transiently. Interestingly, the application of shear stress had a greater effect on the EEC gene and protein expression than did the Snail1 inhibition. This investigation of EEC response to shear stress reveals the pronounced and complex effect of this mechanical stimulation on the EEC phenotype. Further study should reveal the mechanisms that drive fibrosis and the formation of the DSS membrane."

However, phenotyping using echocardiography remains limited in accuracy. This study aimed to evaluate the utility of cardiac CT for BAV phenotyping and its association with clinical relevance.
Four hundred eighteen BAV patients who underwent both echocardiography and cardiac CT within 3 months were analyzed. BAV was classified as fused, 2-sinus, or partial-fusion type. We investigated the association between the CT-derived BAV phenotype and types of BAV dysfunction and aortopathy.
CT-derived BAV phenotypes showed 58.6% concordance with echocardiography-based phenotypes. Fifty patients (12.0%) had a partial-fusion type based on echocardiography, but 124 patients (29.7%) had this type based on CT. CT-derived fused and 2-sinus type had a higher incidence of significant aortic stenosis than the other CT-based phenotypes [adjusted odds ratio (aOR):1.21, 95% CI: 1.12-1.31, p < 0.001; aOR: 1.14, 95% CI: 1.05-1.23, p = 0.002, respectively]. Partial-fusion type was associated with a higher incidence of significant aortic regurgitation (aOR: 1.50, 95% CI: 1.38-1.63, p < 0.001) and lower incidence of ascending-type aortopathy (aOR:0.88, 95% CI: 0.80-0.97, p = 0.008). In the 2-sinus BAV subgroup, a latero-lateral opening was more significantly associated with all types of aortopathy than the antero-posterior opening type (aOR:1.23, 95% CI: 1.05-1.43, p = 0.011).
Cardiac CT provides accurate information for BAV phenotype using the new nomenclature system. CT-derived BAV phenotyping is associated with types of BAV dysfunction and aortopathy and may therefore be useful for risk prediction in patients with a BAV.
Question Echocardiographic phenotyping of BAV is limited in accuracy. This study evaluated the utility and clinical relevance of CT-based BAV phenotyping. Findings CT and echocardiography showed 58.6% agreement in BAV phenotyping. CT identified more partial-fusion types and was significantly associated with valve dysfunction and aortic disease. Clinical relevance Cardiac CT provides accurate BAV phenotyping using the new nomenclature. CT-derived phenotype correlates with BAV dysfunction and aortic disease, suggesting its potential role in risk stratification and personalized management of patients with BAV."

We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to estimate its prevalence in this population and to summarize outcomes after valve intervention. Following PRISMA 2020, we searched PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science and registered the protocol in PROSPERO (CRD42024550839). Eligible observational studies reporting angiodysplasia, von Willebrand factor abnormalities, or both in aortic stenosis were appraised for quality and pooled using a random effects model; heterogeneity and publication bias were assessed with I² and Egger's test. Eleven studies were included. The pooled prevalence of gastrointestinal angiodysplasia among patients with aortic stenosis was 6.3% (95% confidence interval: 4.51-8.38, I² = 98.68, P < 0.0001), with no evidence of publication bias. Across studies that reported longitudinal outcomes, aortic valve replacement or transcatheter aortic valve implantation was associated with a reduction in lesion burden and lower rates of gastrointestinal bleeding, anemia, transfusion, and readmission, although early postprocedural bleeding could occur and typically declined over follow-up. These findings indicate that angiodysplasia is a clinically relevant comorbidity in aortic stenosis and support proactive gastrointestinal evaluation in patients with anemia or unexplained bleeding. Standardized diagnostic criteria and prospective studies are needed to clarify long-term outcomes after valve therapy and to define screening and management pathways."

However, they are not able to perform a complete analysis independently. We report the performance of a fully automated, deep learning-based algorithm for pre-procedural CT analysis as compared to the current clinical standard.
Patients with symptomatic severe aortic stenosis undergoing TAVI were retrospectively enrolled. The pre-procedural dataset was analysed by both a standard TAVI CT-analysis software and by a fully automated CT analysis platform with a deep learning-based algorithm.
Ninety-eight patients were included in the analysis. The mean annulus diameter was 24.4 ± 2.4 mm (conventional = 3mensio, Pie Medical Imaging, 3 M) vs. 24.0 ± 2.4 mm (artificial intelligence = AI), mean absolute error (MAE): 0.64 mm, mean absolute percentage error (MAPE): 2.6%. The mean annulus perimeter was measured at 77.7 ± 7.4 mm (3 M) vs. 76.1 ± 7.5 mm (AI), MAE: 2.26 mm, MAPE: 2.9%. The mean annulus area was calculated at 468.9 ± 92.1 mm2 (3 M) vs. 455.6 ± 91.0 mm2 (AI), MAE: 22.4 mm2, MAPE: 4.8%. The intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs) of all abovementioned parameter were > 0.95 showing an excellent correlation between the two methods. The distance from the annulus to the left coronary artery depicted to 14.0 ± 3.2 mm (3 M) vs. 12.6 ± 2.8 mm (AI), MAE: 2.1 mm, MAPE: 14.3%. The distance to the right coronary artery was 17.1 ± 2.7 mm (3 M) vs. 16.5 ± 3.2 mm (AI), MAE: 1.7 mm, MAPE: 10.1%. The ICCs of the distances to the coronary ostia showed good correlation between both methods.
In this retrospective analysis, a deep learning-based analysis of pre-procedural CT datasets showed good to excellent correlation with conventional assessment for the preprocedural TAVI CT measurements. AI-based fully automated CT analysis could emerge to a valuable alternative to conventional CT assessment in the pre-procedural-planning for TAVI."

Arginine vasopressin (AVP) promotes myofibroblast proliferation and collagen synthesis through V1a receptors. While hepatic studies suggest that AVP deficiency attenuates fibrosis, its cardiac impact remains unclear. This study evaluated the effects of AVP deficiency induced by neurointermediate pituitary lobectomy (NIL) and pharmacological V1a/V2 blockade with conivaptan (CV) in rats with fibrosis from abdominal aortic stenosis (AAC). Wistar rats were divided into seven groups with 10 animals each. Clinical variables and histopathology (H&E, Masson's trichrome, picrosirius red) were assessed. ANOVA, Fisher and Mantel-Cox tests were applied. The Fibrosis (F) group developed hypertrophy, hypertension, higher arrhythmia risk and increased fibrosis. In contrast, F+NIL and F+CV showed blood pressure and cardiac morphology comparable to controls, reduced arrhythmia risk and significantly less fibrosis. Histologically, F+NIL achieved partial regression, whereas F+CV nearly normalized tissue architecture. In conclusion, AVP deficiency or receptor blockade decreases and reverses AAC-induced fibrosis, improving hemodynamic, electrical, and structural outcomes. V1a/V2 blockade emerges as a potential therapeutic strategy."

Cardiovascular imaging,"Racial and ethnic differences have been reported for aortic valve calcium (AVC) and long-term aortic stenosis (AS). Whether these differences are due to differing risk factor profiles or the burden of AVC is unknown.
Baseline AVC was quantified using the Agatston method among 6812 MESA (Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis) participants. AVC scores were not reported to participants. The primary outcome of long-term moderate or severe AS was adjudicated using standard clinical criteria. We calculated multivariable Cox proportional hazards with log-transformed AVC as a continuous variable for each race and ethnicity.
The mean age was 62 years, and 47% of participants were women. Over a median follow-up of 16.7 years, 140 participants were diagnosed with moderate (n=56) and severe AS (n=84). The prevalence of baseline AVC >0 by self-reported race and ethnicity was White (15.8%), Hispanic (13.3%), Black (12.3%), and Chinese (8.3%). The rate of long-term incident moderate-severe AS was highest for White participants (2.1/1000 person-years) and lowest for Chinese participants (0.5/1000 person-years). The association of AVC with moderate-severe AS was significant for all race and ethnicity groups: White hazard ratio, 1.82 (95% CI, 1.62-2.03); Hispanic hazard ratio, 2.18 (95% CI, 1.82-2.62); Black hazard ratio, 2.28 (95% CI, 1.78-2.93); and Chinese hazard ratio, 3.65 (95% CI, 1.05-12.71) per 1 unit higher log transformed AVC. There was no interaction by race and ethnicity (P=0.26) when modeling Black versus non-Black participants.
The racial and ethnic groups with a higher baseline prevalence of AVC had a higher long-term incidence of moderate-severe AS, but a similar relative association between AVC and moderate-severe AS regardless of baseline atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease risk. Our findings suggest that differences in AS by race and ethnicity may likely be explained by the burden of AVC."

However, the response of LVEF to transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) is variable, with some patients even demonstrating a decline. The mechanisms underlying this phenomenon are incompletely characterized. Accordingly, we investigated changes in systolic function in the near-term postoperative period following TAVR.
We studied consecutive patients with severe AS referred for TAVR without identifiable perioperative sources of negative inotropy or ventricular dyssynchrony. Preoperative and postoperative day one echocardiograms were compared with respect to hemodynamics, LV geometry, LVEF, and midwall fractional shortening (FSmw). Contractility was assessed by comparing observed FSmw values to those predicted based on the stress-shortening relation of healthy controls.
Thirty-six patients were included (61% women; mean age 77 years; mean Society of Thoracic Surgeons mortality risk score 3.6%). Following TAVR, there was a precipitous decline in circumferential end-systolic wall stress from 122 ± 47 to 74 ± 32 kdyn/cm2 (p < 0.001) and a slight increase in LVEF. Surprisingly, however, there was also an increase in the percentage of patients with depressed contractility from 22% (8) to 78% (28) (p < 0.001). Heart rate and ventricular volumes remained unchanged.
Contractility declined in the near-term postoperative period following TAVR. We interpret this finding to suggest that contractility is augmented by high afterload in severe AS and declines in parallel with afterload reduction. We speculate that autoregulatory mechanisms triggered by high valvular resistance support LVEF in severe AS and rapidly abate following TAVR."

This investigation aimed to evaluate the link between various inflammation hematological ratios and patients with AVS.
Patients with AVS (n = 229) and control (n = 1716) were identified. Propensity score matching (PSM) was performed with the proportion of 1:1 using logistic regression based on the variables of age, sex, hypertension, diabetes, creatinine (Cr) and glutamate transpeptidase (γ-GT). The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis was used to estimate the performance of inflammation hematological ratios for distinguishing AVS. Univariate and multivariate analysis were performed to identify the independent risk factors of AVS. In addition, restricted cubic splines (RCS) regression analysis revealed the non-linear correlation between inflammation hematological ratios and AVS.
After PSM, 392 patients (196:196) were included. Univariate analysis showed monocyte/high density lipoprotein ratio (MHR) and neutrophil/lymphocyte ratio (NLR) were significantly higher in AVS group (MHR, 0.49 ± 0.23 vs 0.32 ± 0.20, p < 0.001, NLR, 3.52 ± 2.52 vs 2.87 ± 1.89, p < 0.001) while lymphocyte/monocyte ratio (LMR) was significantly lower (3.27 ± 1.72 vs 4.08 ± 1.76, p < 0.001). But the level of platelet/lymphocyte ratio (PLR) and systemic inflammation index (SII) (PLR, 146.27 ± 82.68 vs 143.27 ± 66.95, p = 0.927, SII, 690.22 ± 602.69 vs 610.58 ± 403.33, p = 0.100) did not differ significantly between the two groups. However, in multivariate logistic regression models, only MHR remained to be an independent risk factor of AVS (OR 2.010 with 95%CI 1.040-3.887, p = 0.038). Besides MHR, atrial fibrillation (AF), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), triglycerides (TG) and hemoglobin (Hgb) were also performed to be independent risk factors of AVS. ROC analysis showed that the cut-off value of MHR (0.2750) indicated AVS with 85.2% sensitivity and 51.5% specificity [95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.691-0.788, the area under the curve [AUC] = 0.740, P < 0.001]. Further, RCS revealed the non-linear correlation between MHR and AVS (p for non-linearity <0.001).
Elevated MHR was independently associated with the presence of AVS. MHR demonstrated stronger associational strength with AVS compared to other inflammatory hematological ratios such as SII, NLR, PLR and LMR."

Contemporary insights from an individual patient data meta-analysis.,Jae-Sung Choi; Jong-Ho Park; Se Jin Oh; You Jung Ok; Sohee Oh; Yong Won Seong; Hyeon Jong Moon; Jae Hwa Jeong,10.1097/JS9.0000000000004918,2026-01-28,"International journal of surgery (London, England)","Transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) and sutureless/rapid-deployment aortic valve replacement (SUAVR) have each undergone rapid technological advances and expanding indications. However, direct comparative evidence between the two, particularly for long-term outcomes, remains limited.
We conducted an updated meta-analysis of propensity score-matched studies using reconstructed individual patient data (IPD) to compare TAVR with SUAVR. The protocol was registered in PROSPERO (CRD420251046330). Published Kaplan-Meier survival curves were digitized, IPD reconstructed, and pooled analyses performed. Meta-regression was conducted on the pooled population.
A total of 6604 matched patients from 14 studies were included (TAVR: 3298; SUAVR: 3306). TAVR was associated with lower long-term survival (52.5% vs. 64.6% at 9 years; hazard ratio = 1.48, 95% CI: 1.27-1.72; P < 0.001), higher 30-day mortality [odds ratio (OR) = 2.26, 95% CI: 1.36-3.76], and increased rates of permanent pacemaker implantation (PPI; OR = 1.85, 95% CI: 1.10-3.10) and moderate-or-greater paravalvular leak (PVL; OR = 4.46, 95% CI: 2.58-7.71). In contrast, mean pressure gradient (mean PG) was lower with TAVR (standardized mean difference = -0.52, 95% CI: -0.75 to -0.29). Meta-regression suggested that higher rates of PPI, prosthesis-patient mismatch, and moderate-or-greater PVL may attenuate the survival advantage of SUAVR, although the magnitude of this effect appeared modest.
SUAVR was associated with superior long-term survival and favorable early outcomes compared with TAVR, whereas mean PG favored TAVR. These findings suggest that SUAVR may mitigate the surgical trauma inherent to conventional AVR, narrowing the gap with TAVR, and the choice of TAVR or SUAVR should be carefully individualized, especially in patients with longer life expectancy."

Emerging evidence suggests that these agents may also affect valvular pathobiology, particularly in degenerative aortic stenosis (AS), through anti-inflammatory and antifibrotic mechanisms. Objectives: This study evaluated whether SGLT2 inhibitor use is associated with improved clinical outcomes in degenerative AS, including all-cause mortality and the need for SAVR or TAVR, recognizing that these endpoints represent surrogate rather than direct measures of valve hemodynamic progression. Methods: A retrospective cohort analysis was conducted using TriNetX, a federated electronic medical record-based research network. Diagnoses are captured using ICD-9/ICD-10-CM codes and medications using ATC codes. Adults with non-rheumatic AS were stratified by SGLT2 inhibitors use. Propensity score matching (1:1) was performed to balance baseline characteristics between treated and untreated groups (n = 10,912 per group). Primary outcomes included all-cause mortality, TAVR, and SAVR during follow-up. Echocardiographic parameters (AVA, Vmax, mean gradient) were not systematically available. Results: After adjustment for comorbidities, SGLT2 inhibitor use was independently associated with lower all-cause mortality (6.15% vs. 9.34% HR 0.595; 95% CI 0.552-0.641; p < 0.001), TAVR (2.81% vs. 2.89% HR 0.835; 95% CI 0.746-0.934; p = 0.002), SAVR (1.28% vs. 1.90% HR 0.514; 95% CI 0.442-0.599; p < 0.001), cardiac arrest (0.82% vs. 1.21% HR 0.71; 95% CI 0.582-0.867; p < 0.001), and end-stage kidney disease (0.40% vs. 1.0% HR 0.292; 95% CI 0.222-0.384; p < 0.001). Although these associations may suggest slower disease progression, interpretation is limited by the lack of systematic echocardiographic follow-up. Conclusions: In addition to their established benefits in heart failure and renal protection, SGLT2 inhibitors may have valve-preserving effects in degenerative AS. Because true hemodynamic progression could not be evaluated, these results should be viewed as associations with surrogate clinical endpoints. Prospective studies with standardized imaging are required to determine whether SGLT2 inhibition can directly alter the course of this currently untreatable disease."

This study aimed to evaluate the prognostic value of both baseline and temporal (48-72 h) BUN/EF ratios for predicting mortality after TAVR. Methods: A total of 429 patients (mean age 76 ± 8 years; 51% female) who underwent TAVR for severe aortic stenosis between 2017 and 2025 were retrospectively analyzed. The primary endpoint was long-term all-cause mortality; in-hospital mortality was secondary. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves, Cox regression, and reclassification metrics (NRI, IDI) assessed prognostic performance. Restricted cubic spline (RCS) analysis explored non-linear associations. Results: During a median follow-up of 733 days, overall and in-hospital mortality rates were 37.8% and 7.9%, respectively. Both baseline and 48-72 h BUN/EF ratios were independently associated with mortality (HR = 3.46 and 3.79 per 1 SD increase; both p < 0.001). The temporal ratio showed superior discrimination for in-hospital mortality (AUC = 0.826 vs. 0.743, p = 0.007). Adding baseline BUN/EF to EuroSCORE II significantly improved model performance (AUC 0.712 vs. 0.668, p = 0.031; NRI = 0.33; IDI = 0.067). RCS analysis revealed a linear relationship for baseline and a steep, non-linear association for temporal ratios with mortality risk. Conclusions: The 48-72 h BUN/EF ratio is a robust dynamic biomarker that predicts early mortality after TAVR, while baseline BUN/EF identifies patients at long-term risk. Integrating this simple bedside index into risk algorithms may refine postoperative monitoring and improve outcome prediction in TAVR populations."

With its progressive course, AS leads to ventricular hypertrophy, impaired diastolic and systolic function, and symptomatic deterioration. The natural history of AS is closely linked to the extent of myocardial and extracardiac damage in association with the patients comorbidities. Diagnosis relies primarily on transthoracic echocardiography, which assesses valve morphology, quantifies stenosis severity, and evaluates cardiac remodeling. However, discordant grading is frequent, necessitating advanced imaging to clarify the severity and the mechanism of the stenosis and stratify risk. Treatment is predominantly interventional, as no medical therapy is able to stop disease progression. Surgical aortic valve replacement (SAVR) and transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) are the two treatment options. Special clinical scenarios-such as cardiogenic shock or concomitant cardiac amyloidosis-pose additional diagnostic and therapeutic challenges and require individualized, multidisciplinary management. Overall, contemporary AS care increasingly integrates multimodality imaging, refined risk stratification, and tailored interventional strategies to optimize outcomes."

While the extent of PC impacts surgical management and patient outcomes, curvature evaluation is inconsistent between surgeons due to a lack of reliable assessment techniques. Our goal was to create a dependable, automated deep-learning solution to precisely assess PC from real-time intraoperative 2D images.
A dataset of 421 images was assembled and annotated by four human experts. Annotations were used to calculate PC angles and determine ground truth curvature degrees in each case. All images and ground truth angle information were used to train 3 different deep-learning models. A YOLOv8 model was trained to localize and crop the penile region, then a deep-learning model was employed to segment the shafts and generate binary mask images. In the final stage, a modified HRNet model was used to integrate angle error, predict four key points denoting mid-axes of the proximal and distal shaft, and then use these landmarks to calculate curvature automatically.
The proposed system demonstrated a high level of reliability in localizing penile areas, as evidenced by a mean average precision score of 99.4 %. Furthermore, our pipeline exhibited strong performance in the segmentation task, achieving an impressive Intersection over the Union metric of 83.56 % and a Dice Similarity Coefficient of 91.02 %. In terms of angle prediction, the system achieved a mean absolute error of 7.9°. By comparison, variability among human raters ranged between 6.5 and 12.0° (median ≈ 8.9°), consistent with previously reported manual errors of 3.5-13.6°. Thus, the AI system matched or outperformed human raters, providing more consistent and reliable curvature estimation. The model achieved a median error of 7.8° across 421 images, with 82 % of predictions within ±10° of ground truth. Only 6 % of cases crossed the 30° surgical threshold, confirming the tool's reliability for clinical decision-making.
This study demonstrates the successful implementation of deep learning and keypoint-based measurement of PC that could significantly improve patient assessment by surgeons and hypospadiology researchers."

In this work, we present privacy-preserving model transcription, a data-free model-to-model conversion solution to facilitate model deployment with a privacy guarantee. To this end, we propose a cooperative-competitive learning approach termed differentially private synthetic distillation that learns to convert a pretrained model (teacher) into its privacy-preserving counterpart (student) via a trainable generator without access to private data. The learning collaborates with three players in a unified framework and performs alternate optimization: i) the generator is learned to generate synthetic data, ii) the teacher and student accept the synthetic data and compute differential private labels by flexible data or label noisy perturbation, and iii) the student is updated with noisy labels and the generator is updated by taking the student as a discriminator for adversarial training. We theoretically prove that our approach can guarantee differential privacy and convergence. The transcribed student has good performance and privacy protection, while the resulting generator can generate private synthetic data for downstream tasks. Extensive experiments clearly demonstrate that our approach outperforms 26 state-of-the-arts."

LRMC enjoys low computational complexity with linear convergence. Motivated by the proposed theorem, the free parameters of LRMC can be effectively learned via deep unfolding to achieve optimum performance. Furthermore, this paper proposes a flexible feedforward-recurrent-mixed neural network framework that extends deep unfolding from fixed-number iterations to infinite iterations.

We present DT-ECO, a privacy-preserving digital twins framework that enables decision-centric co-management of multi-modal patient monitoring and clinical environmental systems. DT-ECO constructs a hybrid digital twin that integrates a physics-informed building model with graph-temporal physiological inference and battery electrochemistry, enabling real-time synchronization between patient state, IoT device operation, and environmental dynamics within a differentiable programming environment. On this foundation, a hierarchical control strategy is developed, in which a constrained deep reinforcement learning agent adaptively schedules wearable IoT sensor sampling to extend device lifetime, while a model predictive controller orchestrates HVAC operation and on-site energy resources to maintain a therapeutic environment. Extensive evaluations on DOE reference hospitals and public ECG datasets demonstrate that DT-ECO achieves a 31.8% reduction in annual energy consumption and extends median wearable battery life by 28%, while rigorously maintaining clinical standards-evidenced by less than 0.6% thermal comfort violation and no degradation in arrhythmia detection capability (F1-score 0.956). By bridging the gap between patient physiology and the clinical environment, DT-ECO establishes a pathway toward precision healthcare facilities that are simultaneously patient-centric, diagnostically robust, and operationally sustainable."

To generate large-scale and denser colored point clouds, we propose a deep learning-based Joint Geometry and Attribute Up-sampling (JGAU) method, which learns to model both geometry and attribute patterns and leverages the spatial attribute correlation. Firstly, we establish and release a large-scale dataset for colored point cloud up-sampling, named SYSU-PCUD, which has 121 large-scale colored point clouds with diverse geometry and attribute complexities in six categories and four sampling rates. Secondly, to improve the quality of up-sampled point clouds, we propose a deep learning-based JGAU framework to up-sample the geometry and attribute jointly. It consists of a geometry upsampling network and an attribute up-sampling network, where the latter leverages the up-sampled auxiliary geometry to model neighborhood correlations of the attributes. Thirdly, we propose two coarse attribute up-sampling methods, Geometric Distance Weighted Attribute Interpolation (GDWAI) and Deep Learning-based Attribute Interpolation (DLAI), to generate coarsely upsampled attributes for each point. Then, we propose an attribute enhancement module to refine the up-sampled attributes and generate high quality point clouds by further exploiting intrinsic attribute and geometry patterns. Extensive experiments show that Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR) achieved by the proposed JGAU are 33.90 dB, 32.10 dB, 31.10 dB, and 30.39 dB when upsampling rates are 4×, 8×, 12×, and 16×, respectively.

However, their high dimensions present substantial challenges for conventional 2D image watermarking techniques in effectively ensuring copyright protection. In this work, we propose a deep learning-based Spatial-Angular Consistency waterMarking (SACMark) network, designed to address the unique challenges of watermark embedding and extraction in LF images. SACMark employs a spatial-angular feature extraction module to capture the multidimensional information of LF images and introduces consistency matching and fusion strategies to enhance feature utilization. The network adopts an encoder-noise-decoder architecture, optimized through adversarial training to improve the imperceptibility and robustness of the watermark. Experimental results demonstrate that SACMark maintains high visual quality across various embedding capacities and has minimal impact on depth estimation. Compared to traditional LF watermarking approaches and existing deep learning-based methods for 2D images, SACMark demonstrates improved resilience to noise while preserving essential LF characteristics. These findings suggest that SACMark holds promise for practical applications and may contribute to future developments in secure and adaptive LF image protection."

Patients with MASH cirrhosis are complex and often have extensive comorbidities. The current model for end-stage liver disease (MELD)-based liver allocation system has suboptimal concordance in predicting waitlist mortality for patients with MASH cirrhosis. Furthermore, it does not capture the competing outcomes of death and LT on the liver transplant waitlist.
A competing risk analysis using deep learning was conducted to forecast waitlist trajectories of patients with MASH cirrhosis using data available at the time of waitlisting.
A deep learning competing risk model was constructed using data from 17,551 waitlisted patients with MASH cirrhosis in the Scientific Registry of Transplant Recipients (SRTR) based on the DeepHit model framework with five-fold cross-validation. Model performance was evaluated and compared to single-risk Cox proportional hazards and random survival forests (RSF) models in predicting death or transplant using the concordance index and Brier score. Additionally, a novel performance metric, the competing event coherence (CEC) score, was developed to evaluate model performance in the setting of competing risks. Features associated with death and transplant in the DeepHit model were identified using permutation importance. Models were externally validated on data from the University Health Network.
A total of 17,551 patients were included. The mean MELD at listing was 19.4 (SD 8.1). At 120 months of follow-up on the waitlist, 54.6% (9599/17551) of patients underwent LT, 25.6% (4510/17551) of patients died or were removed due to deterioration, and 19.8% (3442/17551) of patients were removed for improvement or were censored. In a competing risk scenario, DeepHit achieved the best CEC scores at 1 (0.813), 3 (0.811), 6 (0.794), and 12 months (0.772) on the waitlist. The cause-specific RSF model had the highest concordance indices for death or transplant at all time points (death: 0.874 at 1 month, 0.840 at 6 months, and 0.814 at 12 months) except for death at 3 months, where DeepHit (0.883) outperformed RSF. RSF also had lower Brier scores overall, except for transplant at 12 months, where DeepHit outperformed RSF (0.206 vs 0.228). These results were similar on external validation. On feature importance assessment, MELD at listing and its components, as well as functional status, age, and blood type, were associated with death and transplant on the waitlist.
A deep learning competing risk analysis can forecast the risks of both death and transplant in patients with MASH on the waitlist, helping to inform clinical decisions by identifying the most impactful covariates for each outcome."

In this study, we investigated a novel composite machine-learning framework that integrates heuristic knowledge and model-specific classification to differentiate liver lesions using only the first 2 min of CEUS imaging.
CEUS images from 232 patients with 232 focal liver lesions (benign: 61, hepatocellular carcinoma [HCC]: 104, non-HCC malignancies [ML]: 67) were analyzed. For each case, six frames from injection to peak enhancement and static images at 1 and 2 min post-injection were used. Two deep learning models were developed: Model 1 classified heterogeneous enhancement patterns into ""benign,"" ""HCC,"" ""ML,"" or ""Uniform"" (homogeneous). Model 2 further classified ""Uniform"" cases into three diagnostic categories. Lesion brightness values were incorporated as input features. The artificial intelligence (AI) mode was also evaluated by observer study of three hepatologists using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC).
The composite model was evaluated on 58 independent test cases, achieving classification accuracy of 81.8% for benign, 93.5% for HCC, and 68.8% for ML, with an overall accuracy of 84.5%. Binary classification (benign vs. malignant) yielded 97.9% sensitivity, 94.8% specificity, and 94.8% overall accuracy. For discrimination between benign and malignant, the mean AUC for the three observers was significantly improved with AI output, where the difference in AUC (95% confidence interval) was 0.095 (0.0197, 0.1703) (P = 0.013).
The proposed AI-based framework enables accurate liver lesion classification using early phase CEUS, eliminating the need for Kupffer-phase imaging in many cases."

In addition, the deep learning method is employed for parameter identification, one is the modified ResNet50 with a regression head and integrated regularization to enhance generalization; the other is the improved VGG19 that adopts the Gaussian Error Linear Unit (GELU) function and mixed-precision training for greater efficiency. The identification results show that the deep learning methods achieve superior accuracy and robustness compared to the statistical approach, and ResNet50 achieves the best overall performance.

This heterogeneity, coupled with the complexities of the tumor microenvironment (TME), notably influences LUAD progression and patient prognosis. Integrating mass-spectrometry-based proteomic data from human tumors with corresponding multi-omics data opens significant opportunities for comprehensive and systematic cancer proteogenomic analyses. In our study, we analyzed LUAD proteogenomic data from the Cancer Proteome Atlas Program (CPTAC) to conduct a systematic molecular classification by integrating multi-omics data (genomic, transcriptomic, and proteomic) using ten clustering algorithms. This approach successfully identified three distinct molecular subtypes with notable biological heterogeneity: metabolic pathway activation, cell cycle pathway activation, and immune modulation. The metabolic pathway activation subtype was characterized by significant upregulation of metabolic pathways, this subtype showed enhanced mRNA expression and protein abundance of genes related to fatty acid and bile acid metabolism (e.g., MLYCD, ACSM3, ACSL5, ACSS1, and MAOA). It also exhibited a notably higher frequency of EGFR mutations compared to other subtypes. The cell cycle pathway activation subtype was defined by the activation of cell cycle signaling pathways, this subtype demonstrated amplification of the PCNA gene and significantly increased mRNA and protein expression levels of key cell cycle-related genes, such as CCNB1 and CDK1. Importantly, a high mutation frequency, copy number deletions, and downregulation of the tumor suppressor gene STK11 were observed, leading to the inactivation of its tumor suppressor function. This subtype also showed potential sensitivity to various cell cycle inhibitors. The immune modulation subtype was characterized by high immune cell infiltration and low tumor purity. This subtype exhibited multi-omics activation of the Ras signaling pathway, including MET amplification, increased GRB2 expression, decreased PEBP1 expression, and RET activating mutations. These findings suggest that this subtype may benefit from a combination of immunotherapy and targeted therapy against the Ras signaling pathway. Based on the expression profiles of 300 subtype-specific marker genes, we validated the molecular characteristics and clinical relevance of these three subtypes in the TCGA-LUAD and GSE50081 cohorts. Moreover, to enhance clinical applicability, we developed a rapid and cost-effective multi-instance model based on pathological images combined with deep learning techniques. This deep learning model demonstrated excellent performance in multi-omics subtype predictions. In, conclusion, this study systematically elucidates the molecular heterogeneity of LUAD through a multi-omics integration strategy, establishes a clinically relevant molecular classification system, and provides a theoretical foundation for developing personalized treatment plans for LUAD."

The DLS model was developed, validated, and tested in R-development (R-dev), R-validation (R-val), and P1, respectively. After exploring clinical predictors of HE using multivariable logistic regression on P1-development (P1-dev), a five-point score ""ARCHES"" (Ai-Reinforced intraCerebral Hemorrhage hematoma Expansion Score) combining clinical predictors with the DLS model was created. We compared the discrimination of the ARCHES, DLS, with other models using the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) and DeLong test.
The areas under the curve (AUC) of the DLS model were 0.781 (95% CI: 0.761-0.800) in R-dev, and showed similar results in P1. The ARCHES score, which includes DLS, baseline National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS), onset-to-NCCT time and regular antihypertension history, showed significantly better discrimination (AUC, 0.820; 95% CI: 0.775-0.859) than the blend sign and any hypodensity and time from onset-to-NCCT (BAT) score and the meta-analysis prediction model in P1-dev, P1-validation (P1-val) and P2.

This study aimed to develop and validate a fully automated deep learning model for adrenal mass detection and measurement in contrast-enhanced abdominal CT.
This retrospective study included 415 CT scans with (n = 155) and without (n = 260) adrenal masses for model development (median age, 40 years; 206 men). Adrenal gland masks were automatically generated using a pretrained segmentation model, and adrenal mass masks were manually refined to train a U-Net-based segmentation network. Two secondary test sets were used for validating mass detection (external test set, n = 995) and size measurement (internal test set 2, n = 50). The external test set reflects a real-world incidence of adrenal masses (4.8%) as determined by radiologic evaluation without pathologic confirmation. The model performance was evaluated using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) for adrenal mass detection and the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) for adrenal mass measurement.
In the internal test set 1 (n = 42), the AUC for classifying adrenal mass was 0.99 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.92-1.0), with an average Dice score of 0.812. The model achieved an AUC of 0.94 (95% CI: 0.93-0.96) with sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, and positive predictive value of 89.6%, 96.9%, 96.6%, and 59.7% (95% CI: 77.3-96.5%, 95.6-97.9%, 95.3-97.5%, and 50.6-68.2%, respectively), respectively, in the external test set. The model identified 44 of 50 adrenal masses in internal test 2. The ICCs of the predicted diameter were 0.848 (95% CI: 0.723-0.917) and 0.855 (95% CI: 0.735-0.921) for the CT-measured and pathologically measured diameters, respectively.
The proposed deep learning model accurately detected and measured adrenal masses in abdominal CT. The model has the potential to improve detection rates of adrenal lesions and facilitate their early management.
The proposed deep learning model can detect adrenal masses often missed by radiologists and accurately estimate their size, potentially improving patient management in screening, follow-up, and preoperative settings.
Adrenal masses, which may be functional or malignant, are frequently missed on abdominal CT, leading to delays in appropriate management. A deep learning model can accurately detect the adrenal masses (accuracy 96.6%) and predict the size similar to the sizes measured in CT and surgical specimens (ICC 0.848-0.855). The proposed DL algorithm may help clinicians in various clinical settings, including screening, follow-up, and preoperative evaluation of adrenal masses."

PubMed,deep learning,Motion as a Language: Transformer-Based Classification of Antimicrobial Peptide Conformational Dynamics.,Benjamin Bouvier,10.1021/acs.jctc.5c01690,2026-01-29,Journal of chemical theory and computation,"Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) represent a promising alternative to traditional antibiotics against which many bacteria are rapidly gaining resistance. Today, databases containing tens of thousands of AMPs, along with their properties and biological activities, can be screened to select lead candidates for a given application. The conformational plasticity of AMPs has been proven crucial for the recognition of their targets. However, the volume, complexity, and recalcitrance to classification of conformational data, obtained from e.g. molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, prevent it from being included in databases, let alone used as a criterion for the screening of AMPs. This work applies the transformer neural network architecture (which powers large language models such as ChatGPT) to the detection of temporal and spatial context in time series of AMP conformations from MD simulations. It shows how the representation of AMP conformational space learned by the network can be leveraged for the unsupervised classification of AMP plasticity, which can subsequently be used alongside conventional properties for the screening of databases. Thus, it reveals how deep learning can pave the way toward restoring conformational dynamics to its legitimate importance within drug design pipelines."
PubMed,deep learning,A Deep Learning Model to Guide Personalized Mechanical Circulatory Support Use in Cardiogenic Shock Patients Undergoing PCI.,Amit P Amin; Richard G Bach; Darren C Tsang; Weili S Zheng; Raed A Qarajeh; Emmanouil S Brilakis; Hemant Kulkarni,10.1016/j.jacadv.2025.102379,2026-01,JACC. Advances,"Cardiogenic shock (CS) in patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) involves rapidly changing clinical, hemodynamic, and metabolic factors that current models cannot effectively integrate.
The purpose of this study was to develop and validate a deep learning (DL) model to guide personalized use of mechanical circulatory support (MCS) devices in CS patients undergoing PCI.
The authors analyzed data from 1,408 CS patients treated with intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP) or microaxial flow-pump (mAFP) at multiple hospitals (2004-2019). Clinical, hemodynamic, and metabolic variables from admission to MCS placement were compiled into longitudinal vectors. Using Python 3.7 and TabNet in PyTorch, the OPtiMCS DL model was developed and validated in Google Colab to predict 30-day mortality, bleeding, acute kidney injury (AKI), 1-year mortality, and 1-year stroke. The model also simulated alternate outcomes by switching between IABP and mAFP to support a patient-centered approach.
The rates for 30-day mortality, bleeding, AKI, 1-year mortality, and 1-year stroke were 31%, 43%, 35%, 35%, and 5%, respectively. OPtiMCS achieved AUCs from 83% (AKI) to 98% (mortality) and identified key predictive features (eg, cardiac arrest predicted mortality). OPtiMCS predicted benefit of one MCS device over the other (eg, IABP switched to mAFP was predicted to reduce mortality by 1.8% and AKI by 5.2%).
Among CS patients undergoing PCI, we developed and validated a DL model to predict outcomes and facilitate a patient-centric approach. If it can be externally validated and implemented in clinical practice, it has the potential to distinguish the risk-benefit balance of MCS devices, reduce adverse outcomes, improve survival, and ultimately advance CS care."

In these contexts, reliable early stage prediction can significantly reduce experimental costs. In this study, we developed NeuroTDPi, a multilayer fully connected deep neural network model designed to identify neurotoxic compounds. The model employs a multimodal fusion strategy, integrating molecular characterization with feature representations tailored to three specific neurotoxicity end points: blood-brain barrier permeability, neuronal toxicity, and mammalian neurotoxicity. In order to enhance the interpretability of the model, the SHapley Additive Explanations (SHAP) method was employed to elucidate the contributions of various physical and chemical properties. NeuroTDPi exhibited a commendable performance, attaining area under the receiver operating characteristic curve values of 0.97, 0.84, and 0.82 for the three end points, respectively. Furthermore, a comprehensive mining and visualization workflow identified structural alerts associated with neurotoxicity, offering mechanistic insights into the observed toxic effects. These resources, which provide a robust platform for neurotoxicity evaluation and actionable structural insights for risk assessment, are freely available at https://www.sapredictor.cn/."
PubMed,deep learning,Survival Prediction and Treatment Decisions in Hepatocellular Carcinoma: A Deep Learning-Based Radiomics Approach.,Xiaoqin Wei; Jun Xiao; Ying Liu; Chaofeng Yang; Ziren Luo; Mingyue Tang; Xiaowen Chen,10.31083/BJHM50380,2026-01-26,"British journal of hospital medicine (London, England : 2005)","Deep learning radiomics (DLRadiomics) can capture a wide range of tumor and lesion characteristics, providing valuable insights into biological behavior, pathophysiological status, and patient prognosis. This study integrated clinical data with deep learning-derived features into a machine learning survival model to assess the effectiveness of hepatectomy and transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) treatments in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients.
This study included pathologically confirmed HCC patients who received either hepatectomy or TACE between January 2013 and December 2022. We utilized three deep learning-based algorithms (ResNet50, ResNet18, and DenseNet121) with contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) images to predict the overall survival time. Deep learning features were extracted from these predictive models. Furthermore, a combined survival model was developed by incorporating clinical factors with the deep learning features for two treatment regimens separately. The areas under the curves (AUC) of the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were used to assess the discrimination of the model at different time points. Additionally, nomograms were constructed to predict patient prognosis undergoing different treatment regimens, and their survival risk was evaluated using the Kaplan-Meier analysis.
This study recruited 409 HCC patients who received either hepatectomy (n = 278, 57 [49-66]; 239 men) or TACE (n = 131, 62 [51-69.5]; 111 men). ResNet50 achieved the highest AUC of 0.866 (95% confidence interval (CI): 0.815-0.917) in the training set and 0.793 (95% CI: 0.675-0.912) in the testing cohort. Overall, six models were constructed to assess overall survival for hepatectomy and TACE treatments, with the combined models exhibiting superior discriminative performance. The C-index for the combined hepatectomy model was 0.836 (95% CI: 0.776-0.897) in the training cohort and 0.861 (95% CI: 0.755-0.967) in the testing cohort. The C-index for the combined TACE model was 0.840 (95% CI: 0.792-0.888) in the training cohort and 0.834 (95% CI: 0.759-0.910) in the testing cohort. Two nomograms were created to help clinicians in selecting a treatment method by examining the difference scores between treatments.
The machine learning models can potentially predict differences in outcomes between hepatectomy and TACE. Furthermore, prognostic models using deep learning-based features can effectively predict survival risk in HCC patients."
PubMed,deep learning,DT-m6A: A DenseNet-Transformer Hybrid Framework for Accurate Prediction of m6A Modification Sites across Diverse Cell Lines and Tissues.,Qiyu Tao; Jianhua Jia,10.31083/FBL48029,2026-01-22,Frontiers in bioscience (Landmark edition),"N6-methyladenosine (m6A) RNA methylation is a crucial epigenetic modification that plays an essential role in regulating diverse biological processes. Accurate identification of m6A sites is therefore fundamental to understanding its regulatory mechanisms. In this study, we proposed DT-m6A, a novel deep learning framework that integrates DenseNet and Transformer architectures for accurate m6A site identification across diverse cell lines and tissues.
RNA sequences are first encoded using nucleotide chemical properties (NCP) for initial features extraction, after which DenseNet captures and reuses local sequence features through dense connections. The Transformer module then models long-range dependencies and extracts nonlinear representations, in which Batch Normalization replaces the conventional Layer Normalization in both sublayers to enhance training stability. Finally, a fully connected layer predicts m6A modification sites.
Evaluated on 11 independent test sets spanning eight cell lines and three tissue types, DT-m6A demonstrated robust performance, achieving average accuracy (ACC) of 76.97%, Matthews correlation coefficient (MCC) of 54.27%, precision (PRE) of 75.18%, recall (REC) of 79.76%, and F1 score of 77.26%.
DT-m6A surpassed the state-of-the-art method MST-m6A by 0.63% in average accuracy (p = 0.0023) and 1.4% in mean MCC (p = 0.0012) across 11 independent test sets. Although its performance on the CD8T and MOLM13 cell lines was comparable to MST-m6A, DT-m6A consistently achieved superior results across all other cell lines and tissues. Overall, DT-m6A effectively captures both local patterns and global dependencies in RNA sequences, improving prediction performance across diverse biological contexts."

With a focus on the prevalent psychological complications following the onset of this condition, this study aimed to explore the correlation between antenatal depression and Corona disease anxiety, personality traits, and postpartum depression during the COVID-19 pandemic.                                                           Materials and Methods:                     This cross-sectional descriptive-analytical study investigated women receiving care at health centers affiliated with Kerman University of Medical Sciences during the last month of their pregnancy and the postpartum period in 2022. Following the acquisition of informed consent, participants were assessed using various measures, including demographic and obstetric information, the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale, the Corona Disease Anxiety Scale (CDAS), and the NEO Personality Inventory-Revised during their third trimester of pregnancy. The same group of participants completed the Edinburgh Depression Scale and the Corona Disease Anxiety Scale (CDAS) 4-6 weeks after childbirth.                                                           Results and Discussion:                     There was a significant correlation between family income, unwanted pregnancy as perceived by both the mother and father, and antenatal depression. Additionally, marital satisfaction played a significant role in postpartum depression. Furthermore, antenatal depression was significantly associated with neuroticism, agreeableness, and physical symptoms related to Corona disease anxiety. Personality traits, with the exception of extroversion and conscientiousness, and various domains of Corona disease anxiety, excluding psychological symptoms, were also significantly associated with postpartum depression.                                                           Conclusion:                     During pandemics or epidemics, such as the COVID-19 outbreak, experiencing mental distress during pregnancy can contribute to mental health issues during the postpartum period. This risk is particularly true in individuals with unique personality traits, emphasizing the need for increased focus on mental health within prenatal care during these crises."

Method:                     This cross-sectional study was conducted in Kerman, Iran. Data were collected from patients who visited Afzalipour Hospital in Kerman more than twice during the COVID-19 epidemic from the end of February 2020 to March 21, 2021. We conducted two key analyses: 1. Mixed effect logistic regression was used to check the relationship between the variables and COVID-19 severity. 2. Mixed effect linear regression was used to check the relationship between the variables and the length of stay in the hospital.                                                           Results:                     The findings indicated that the most important risk factors for the severity of COVID-19 were heart diseases (OR=1.67,95%CI:1.20-2.30), increasing age (OR=2.23 for age&gt;54, 95%CI:1.70- 2.90), male gender (OR=1.47,95%CI:1.10-1.96), respiratory diseases other than asthma, and frequency of admission (OR=1.60,95%CI:1.20-2.15). All patients who underwent readmission experienced a shorter duration of hospitalization during their subsequent admission (OR=0.94,95%CI:0.91,0.96) and had a higher mortality rate (30% within 14 days, 26.6% between 14-90 days). Patients readmitted at intervals of 14-90 days and greater than 90 days exhibited lower disease severity compared to those readmitted within the 0-14 day period.                                                           Conclusion:                     Examining readmissions, the severity of COVID-19, and the length of hospital stay in affected patients are important factors for planning and allocating resources for COVID-19 management and treatment. These factors can help policymakers develop effective clinical guidelines for hospitalization or outpatient treatment of COVID-19 patients and contribute to reducing the burden of disease in the community."

Kinovea, as an accessible motion-analysis software, provides both visual and quantitative feedback. However, its application in supporting technique development among beginner athletes remains insufficiently explored. Aim: This study aims to describe the use of Kinovea in biomechanics training and examine its contribution to the awareness of kinematic characteristics and movement techniques among beginner athletes. Methods: A descriptive qualitative design involved 72 beginner athletes aged 18–25 years selected through purposive sampling. Data were collected over 16 weeks through interviews, field observations, and motion video recordings analyzed using Kinovea. Kinematic data focused on joint angles, stride behavior, and movement phases during walking, running, and the flight phase. Qualitative data were analyzed using content analysis with NVivo 12, while kinematic results were interpreted descriptively to identify performance patterns and areas for technical refinement. Result: Kinematic analysis showed coordinated joint-angle patterns across all phases. Walking analysis identified arm swing angles of 50.9°–58.8° and leg separation angles of 64.3°–67.2°, indicating a stable gait rhythm. The running analysis revealed knee angles of 68.8°–69.8° and elbow angles of 87.6°–89.1°, indicating efficient propulsive mechanics. The flight phase demonstrated knee angles of 81.2°–87.8° and elbow angles of 80.4°–88.3°, suggesting effective momentum use and postural stability. These measurements supported stride-efficiency assessment and technique evaluation. Qualitative findings revealed that Kinovea enabled athletes to interpret movement phases and identify technical inefficiencies through slow-motion and frame-by-frame visualization. Conclusion: Kinovea supports basic motion analysis by providing clear kinematic information and helping beginner athletes observe and refine their movement techniques. The findings also offer practical value for coaches by enabling more precise identification of inefficient patterns and guiding targeted corrections during early-stage training."

This has informed the recommendation for urgent intervention upon diagnosis, especially when symptoms develop. Asymptomatic severe aortic stenosis has a four-year mortality between 30 and 50% if left untreated, which is similar to some metastatic cancers. Conservative management for patients with severe asymptomatic aortic stenosis was previously advocated, likely owing to the relative invasiveness of surgical aortic valve replacement. The advent of low-risk transcatheter aortic valve implantation with good medium-term durability has prioritized the need for a paradigm shift in the treatment of asymptomatic severe aortic stenosis towards a more proactive strategy of early intervention to reduce significant adverse events. This article provides a state-of-the-art overview of the contemporary management of patients with asymptomatic severe aortic stenosis."
OpenAlex,aortic stenosis,Vascular Sociology: Integrating Vascular Surgery and Medical Sociology for a Comprehensive Understanding of Vascular Health,Davide Costa; Raffaele Serra,10.3390/jvd5010005,2026-01-26,Journal of Vascular Diseases,"Vascular diseases remain a major global health burden despite remarkable technological advances in vascular surgery and endovascular therapies. Conditions such as peripheral arterial disease, abdominal aortic aneurysm, carotid stenosis, chronic venous disease, diabetic vasculopathies, and vascular chronic ulcers are not only biological entities but are deeply shaped by social structures, cultural norms, and economic inequalities. This article introduces Vascular Sociology as an interdisciplinary field that integrates vascular surgery with medical sociology to provide a more comprehensive understanding of vascular health and disease. Drawing on classical and contemporary sociological theory, including concepts such as social determinants of health, embodiment, illness narratives, and the disease–illness–sickness triad, the article argues that vascular pathology reflects cumulative social exposures across the life course. Socially patterned behaviors, work conditions, food environments, healthcare access, gender norms, and geographic inequalities profoundly influence disease onset, progression, treatment decisions, and outcomes. The paper highlights how surgical success is contingent not only on technical excellence but also on patients’ social contexts, including health literacy, trust in institutions, caregiving resources, and the capacity to adhere to long-term follow-up and rehabilitation. By outlining conceptual foundations, epidemiological evidence, and mixed-methods research strategies, the article positions Vascular Sociology as a framework capable of bridging biomedical knowledge with lived experience. This approach expands the definition of vascular outcomes to include social reintegration, identity transformation, and equity of care, ultimately aiming to improve patient-centered practice, reduce disparities, and inform more socially responsive vascular health policies."

To identify the main differences in patients undergoing surgical treatment of acquired mitral valve (MV) disease depending on the preoperative type of pulmonary hypertension (PH), as well as to identify factors associated with PH persistence and its type one year after surgical treatment of MV disease. Material and methods . This open-label, single-­center prospective study included 40 patients with valvular heart disease (VHD) undergoing MV surgery. These patients had verified PH according to the right heart catheterization (RHC) as follows: 15 patients with isolated post-capillary PH and 25 patients with a combined post-/precapillary PH. Intraoperatively, 26 patients with PH underwent a right lung tissue biopsy with subsequent histological examination. One year after surgery, RHC was performed to assess PH dynamics. The significance ranks of the predictors were used to assess the contribution of factors to PH dynamics after surgery. Results . Patients with VHD and combined post/precapillary PH were characte­rized by more impaired right ventricle-­pulmonary artery coupling, increased le­vels of myocardial strain markers, severe changes in pulmonary circulation hemodynamics, arteriolization of venules, and a higher frequency of pandemic arterial thrombosis (53,3%) compared to patients with isolated postcapillary PH (9%). According to RHC data one year after surgery (n=21), PH regression was observed in 28,5%, while isolated postcapillary PH persisted in 42,85%, and combined post/precapillary PH — in 28,5%. The factors, that made the most significant contribution to PH regression one year after surgery included mitral valve stenosis (100 units), atrial fibrillation (73 units), type 2 diabetes (72 units), combined intervention on the mitral valve and aortic valve (61 units), obesity class (56 units), male sex (48 units). The character of morphological lung changes did not significantly contribute to perioperative dynamics of PH. Conclusion . Patients with VHD and combined post/precapillary PH are characterized by more impaired right ventricle-­pulmonary artery coupling, elevated levels of myocardial strain markers, severe changes in pulmonary circulation hemodynamics with arteriolization of venules and a higher prevalence of pandemic arterial thrombosis. For the first time, potentially modifiable factors have been identified as making the greatest impact on the PH dynamics one year after surgery."

Despite its clinical importance, Lp(a) remains largely unaffected by traditional lipid-lowering therapies, contributing to significant residual cardiovascular risk. Aim: This review aims to synthesize current knowledge regarding the clinical significance of elevated lipoprotein(a) levels and to explore the landscape of emerging therapeutic strategies designed to specifically address this challenging cardiovascular risk factor. Materials and Methods: An extensive synthesis of the current literature, prioritizing comprehensive review articles and meta-analyses published within the last five years, was conducted using multiple electronic databases (PubMed, Scopus, Google Scholar). Results: Epidemiological data indicate that 20–30% of the global population has elevated Lp(a) levels (&gt;30–50 mg/dL). While lifestyle and statins show negligible effects on Lp(a) concentration, novel nucleic acid-based therapies - specifically antisense oligonucleotides (pelacarsen) and small interfering RNAs (olpasiran, lepodisiran, zerlasiran) have demonstrated the ability to reduce Lp(a) levels by 70% to over 95%. Furthermore, oral small-molecule inhibitors like muvalaplin offer promising alternatives by disrupting the assembly of the Lp(a) particle. Conclusion: The emergence of targeted RNA-based and small-molecule therapies represents a paradigm shift in cardiovascular prevention. As phase 3 clinical trials progress, these interventions may provide the first definitive means of mitigating the residual risk associated with elevated Lp(a)."

Optimal management requires integrated risk stratification, multimodality imaging, tailored revascularization timing, and post-procedural care. This review synthesizes evidence on preoperative assessment (invasive angiography vs CT-angiography), decision-making for percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), staged vs concomitant approaches, and long-term antithrombotic and surveillance strategies to optimize outcomes. Introduction Severe aortic stenosis (AS) and CAD frequently coexist due to shared risk factors and pathophysiology. While TAVI has transformed AS treatment, untreated significant CAD may impair periprocedural hemodynamics and long-term prognosis. Preoperative Evaluation Coronary computed tomography angiography (CCTA) is increasingly preferred for its high negative predictive value and ability to assess anatomy for TAVI planning. Invasive coronary angiography remains the gold standard when revascularization is anticipated. Functional assessment (fractional flow reserve [FFR] or instantaneous wave-free ratio [iFR]) is recommended for intermediate lesions (50–70%) to guide intervention. Revascularization Strategies Staged PCI (prior to TAVI) is favored in most guidelines for complex or high-risk anatomy, minimizing contrast load and procedural time during valve deployment. Concomitant PCI during the same session may be considered in straightforward single-vessel disease or unstable presentations, though it carries higher acute kidney injury risk. Post-TAVI PCI is emerging as a viable option in select cases with favorable valve positioning. Multidisciplinary Heart Team Integration The Heart Team should weigh SYNTAX score, frailty, bleeding risk, and life expectancy. Hybrid approaches (e.g., PCI of proximal lesions pre-TAVI, distal optimization post-TAVI) are gaining traction. Antithrombotic Management and Follow-up Post-PCI/TAVI regimens typically involve dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) for 1–6 months, transitioning to single antiplatelet therapy (SAPT) or anticoagulation if indicated. Long-term surveillance includes echocardiography, stress testing, and symptom monitoring. Conclusion A structured, multidisciplinary strategy incorporating advanced imaging, physiology-guided PCI, and individualized timing improves safety and durability in TAVI recipients with coexistent CAD."

Optimal management requires integrated risk stratification, multimodality imaging, tailored revascularization timing, and post-procedural care. This review synthesizes evidence on preoperative assessment (invasive angiography vs CT-angiography), decision-making for percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), staged vs concomitant approaches, and long-term antithrombotic and surveillance strategies to optimize outcomes. Introduction Severe aortic stenosis (AS) and CAD frequently coexist due to shared risk factors and pathophysiology. While TAVI has transformed AS treatment, untreated significant CAD may impair periprocedural hemodynamics and long-term prognosis. Preoperative Evaluation Coronary computed tomography angiography (CCTA) is increasingly preferred for its high negative predictive value and ability to assess anatomy for TAVI planning. Invasive coronary angiography remains the gold standard when revascularization is anticipated. Functional assessment (fractional flow reserve [FFR] or instantaneous wave-free ratio [iFR]) is recommended for intermediate lesions (50–70%) to guide intervention. Revascularization Strategies Staged PCI (prior to TAVI) is favored in most guidelines for complex or high-risk anatomy, minimizing contrast load and procedural time during valve deployment. Concomitant PCI during the same session may be considered in straightforward single-vessel disease or unstable presentations, though it carries higher acute kidney injury risk. Post-TAVI PCI is emerging as a viable option in select cases with favorable valve positioning. Multidisciplinary Heart Team Integration The Heart Team should weigh SYNTAX score, frailty, bleeding risk, and life expectancy. Hybrid approaches (e.g., PCI of proximal lesions pre-TAVI, distal optimization post-TAVI) are gaining traction. Antithrombotic Management and Follow-up Post-PCI/TAVI regimens typically involve dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) for 1–6 months, transitioning to single antiplatelet therapy (SAPT) or anticoagulation if indicated. Long-term surveillance includes echocardiography, stress testing, and symptom monitoring. Conclusion A structured, multidisciplinary strategy incorporating advanced imaging, physiology-guided PCI, and individualized timing improves safety and durability in TAVI recipients with coexistent CAD."

Sharma,10.1080/14796678.2026.2615395,2026-01-23,Future Cardiology,"Transcatheter aortic valve replacement has rapidly expanded from high-risk populations to younger patients with aortic stenosis. This shift raises important questions about valve durability, reintervention strategies, and long-term outcomes compared with surgical aortic valve replacement. Younger patients often present with unique anatomical challenges, including bicuspid aortic valves, and are expected to outlive their first valve prosthesis, making lifetime management a central concern. While new valve technologies show promise, long-term data remain limited. Careful patient selection, shared decision-making, and ongoing prospective studies are essential to guide the role of TAVR in this population."

METHODS: We analyzed 2 multicenter registries that consecutively enrolled patients with severe aortic stenosis before and after the introduction of transcatheter AVR in Japan (CURRENT AS [CURRENT AS, Contemporary Outcomes After Surgery and Medical Treatment in Patients With Severe Aortic Stenosis] Registry-1: 2003–2011; Registry-2: 2018–2020). Data were derived from hospital electronic health records. The primary outcome was 1-year all-cause mortality. Secondary outcomes included hospitalization for heart failure, cardiovascular death, and noncardiovascular death. we Multivariable Cox proportional hazards models were adjusted for age, sex, body mass index, hypertension, current smoking, diabetes on insulin therapy, prior myocardial infarction, prior symptomatic stroke, atrial fibrillation or flutter, aortic or peripheral vascular disease, creatinine level, hemodialysis, anemia, liver cirrhosis (child B or C), malignancy currently under treatment, chronic lung disease (moderate or severe), coronary artery disease, peak aortic jet velocity, any combined moderate or severe valvular disease, and tricuspid regurgitation pressure gradient. RESULTS: A total of 6645 patients (Registry-1: 3448 patients, and Registry-2: 3197 patients) were included. Patients in Registry-2 were older than those in Registry-1 (81.7 versus 77.8 years), and an initial AVR strategy was more frequently selected (49.9% versus 31.3%). The cumulative 1-year incidence and adjusted risk of 1-year all-cause mortality were lower in Registry-2 than in Registry-1 (10.2% versus 16.0%, P &lt;0.001, hazard ratio, 0.55 [95% CI, 0.47–0.63]). In contrast, the incidence and adjusted risk of hospitalization for heart failure did not differ between Registry-2 and Registry-1 (8.5% versus 9.0%, P =0.66, hazard ratio, 0.88 [95% CI, 0.75–1.04]). CONCLUSIONS: The overall 1-year mortality outcome of patients with severe aortic stenosis improved in the posttranscatheter AVR era compared with the pretranscatheter AVR era, with no noticeable improvement in hospitalization for heart failure."

OpenAlex,aortic stenosis,Preoperative transcutaneous vagus nerve stimulation as a novel strategy to prevent postoperative atrial fibrillation in calcific aortic valve disease: mechanistic insights and translational perspectives,Justine Bergeon; Fanette Chassagne; Marie Fanget; Angèle N. Merlet; Stéphane Avril; Léonard Féasson; F. Hoffmann-La Roche; M. Bäck; David Hupin,10.3389/fcvm.2025.1625436,2026-01-23,Frontiers in Cardiovascular Medicine,"Postoperative atrial fibrillation (POAF) affects 38%–63% of patients undergoing surgical replacement for calcific aortic valve stenosis (CAVS), increasing morbidity, stroke risk, and hospital stay. POAF results from an interplay between pre-existing arrhythmogenic substrates, acute surgical triggers, unresolved inflammation, and autonomic nervous system (ANS) imbalance. Specialized pro-resolving mediators (SPMs) orchestrate inflammation resolution and tissue homeostasis; their deficiency may sustain valvular inflammation and promote arrhythmogenesis. Transcutaneous vagus nerve stimulation (tVNS) is a non-invasive approach that enhances parasympathetic tone, restores sympathovagal balance, and modulates inflammatory pathways. While tVNS has been applied postoperatively, its preoperative, preventive use in POAF has not been explored, representing a novel therapeutic strategy. In patients with CAVS, preoperative tVNS could reduce POAF by regulating ANS activity and limiting perioperative inflammation. Mechanistic insights may be gained through perioperative sampling, analysis of excised valvular and atrial tissue, and biomechanical assessments comparing stimulated and control groups. Preoperative tVNS thus offers a promising strategy to prevent POAF while addressing valvular inflammation, bridging translational physiology with clinical cardiology and potentially opening new avenues for the management of CAVS."

While acute presentations of valvular pathology exhibit dramatic clinical signs, most cases are chronic and commonly discovered incidentally during routine evaluations. Compensatory adaptations, including cardiac remodeling and atrial augmentation of preload, temporarily sustain cardiac function and mask disease severity, increasing the risk of heart failure and sudden cardiac death. This case-based article details the diagnostic journey of a 59-year-old male who presented with elevated blood pressure and lightheadedness. Abnormal electrocardiogram (ECG) findings prompted further evaluation, underscoring the importance of early recognition of ECG abnormalities. The article highlights the crucial role of advanced practice emergency providers in conducting timely cardiac assessments. By proposing a systematic approach from initial ECG findings to definitive imaging, it aims to enhance early intervention and ultimately improve patient outcomes in cases of AS."
OpenAlex,aortic stenosis,Successful treatment of <i>low-flow-low-gradient</i> aortic stenosis and complex coronary artery-disease in a patient with severly depressed left-ventricular function by protected PCI and transfemoral TAVR via Y-graft vascular prothesis: A case report,Yusuf Nejahsie; Samer Hakmi; S Willems; Wolfgang Tigges; E Tigges,10.1093/ehjcr/ytag035,2026-01-22,European Heart Journal - Case Reports,"Abstract Introduction Low-flow, low-gradient aortic stenosis (LFLG AS) is a subset of aortic stenosis associated with a poor prognosis and high operative risk, particularly in the presence of concomitant coronary artery disease requiring intervention. In patients considered inoperable, minimally invasive approaches often remain the only alternative. However, there are limited data on treatment strategies and outcomes in patients with LFLG AS and severe ischemic cardiomyopathy undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) and transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR), especially in cases with challenging transfemoral access. Case summary An 87-year-old male presented with progressive dyspnea and angina. Diagnostics revealed a non-ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI), acute heart failure, acute-on-chronic renal failure, LFLG AS (aortic valve area of 0.7 cm²), and a left ventricular ejection fraction of 10%. Coronary angiography showed severe coronary artery disease requiring revascularization. Due to excessive surgical risk, we planned a staged interventional treatment by Heart Team consensus. First, high-risk PCI with mechanical circulatory support was performed, followed by transfemoral TAVR using a self-expandable 29-mm bioprosthesis via a femoral Y-graft conduit. The patient reported immediate relief of symptoms. Follow-up echocardiography at discharge and at three months showed improvement of the aortic valve function and an increase of the ejection fraction to 35%. The patient remained asymptomatic and resumed his daily activities. Discussion This case demonstrates that Impella®-supported PCI prior to transfemoral TAVR is feasible and safe, even in the presence of a femoral Y-graft, in a patient with LFLG AS and severely reduced ejection fraction."

Makkar,10.1161/jaha.125.043880,2026-01-22,Journal of the American Heart Association,"Background Limited data are available comparing clinical outcomes between patients with small and large annuli following transcatheter aortic valve replacement using balloon‐expandable valves. This study sought to investigate 5‐year clinical outcomes in patients with severe aortic stenosis with a small annulus compared with those with a large annulus following transcatheter aortic valve replacement with newer‐generation balloon‐expandable valves. Methods A total of 3182 patients with aortic stenosis treated with balloon‐expandable valves were divided into small‐annulus (≤430 mm 2 ) and large‐annulus (&gt;430 mm 2 ) groups. A 1:1 propensity‐matched analysis was performed to adjust baseline differences. The primary end point was all‐cause death at 5‐year follow‐up. Secondary end points included heart failure hospitalization, bioprosthetic valve failure, and aortic valve reintervention. Results Among 533 matched pairs, compared with the large‐annulus group, the small‐annulus group had higher rates of aortic valve mean gradients ≥20 mm Hg (14.1% versus 2.9%; P &lt;0.001) and severe prosthesis–patient mismatch (9.8% versus 5.2%; P =0.019). At 5 years, there were no significant differences in all‐cause death (hazard ratio, 0.75 [95% CI, 0.52–1.09]; P =0.13). The incidence of heart failure rehospitalization, bioprosthetic valve failure, and aortic valve reintervention were similar between groups. Both groups achieved similar sustained improvements in New York Heart Association functional class and Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire–Overall Summary scores. Conclusions Despite higher transvalvular gradients and a greater rate of severe prosthesis–patient mismatch, 5‐year clinical outcomes in patients with a small annulus were comparable to those with a large annulus following transcatheter aortic valve replacement using newer‐generation balloon‐expandable valves."
