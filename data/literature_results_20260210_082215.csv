PubMed,aortic stenosis,Sex-related differences after transcatheter aortic valve implantation: A retrospective propensity-matched cohort.,Maroua Eid; Frédéric Pinaud; Simon Dang Van; Antoine Ducroix; Audrey Camarzana; Emmanuel Rineau; Emmanuelle Longeau; Wissam Abi-Khalil; Patrice Binuani; Christophe Baufreton; Frédéric Rouleau; Olivier Fouquet,10.1093/icvts/ivag034,2026-02-09,Interdisciplinary cardiovascular and thoracic surgery,"Sex differences in outcomes after transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) remain incompletely understood. Earlier studies described a ""sex paradox,"" with women experiencing more procedural complications but similar or superior survival compared with men. However, most data derive from earlier device generations, and contemporary evidence is limited.
We retrospectively analyzed all patients with severe aortic stenosis who underwent TAVI at the University Hospital of Angers between January 2012 and December 2023. Clinical and procedural characteristics were collected from a dedicated database. Propensity-score matching (1:1) was performed to account for baseline differences. The primary end-point was 30-day mortality.
A total of 2,718 patients underwent TAVI, of whom 49.1% were women. Women were older but had fewer comorbidities than men. After matching (1,320 pairs), procedural duration was similar, but women more often required alternative access and received self-expandable valves. Thirty-day mortality did not differ between sexes, but all-cause mortality was significantly higher in men (p < 0.01). Women had a greater incidence of postoperative stroke, particularly in low-risk patients, whereas men had higher rates of acute renal failure and pacemaker implantation. The survival probability was higher for women in overall population and in low- and intermediate-risk patients.
In this large, contemporary cohort, women experienced more strokes, whereas men had higher all-cause mortality and conduction-related complications. These findings underscore persistent sex-specific differences in TAVI outcomes and highlight the need for tailored procedural strategies."
PubMed,aortic stenosis,Association of epicardial adipose tissue with markers of cardiac remodelling and clinical outcomes in asymptomatic aortic stenosis.,Sarah L Ayton; Saadia Aslam; Abhishek Dattani; Jian L Yeo; Gaurav S Gulsin; Piotr J Slomka; Damini Dey; Gerry P McCann; Anvesha Singh,10.1136/openhrt-2025-003804,2026-02-09,Open heart,"Previous studies have suggested an adverse role of epicardial adipose tissue (EAT) in aortic stenosis (AS), potentially mediated by direct effects on the myocardium. This study aimed to assess whether EAT volume and density are associated with cardiac remodelling and clinical outcomes in a well-phenotyped cohort of patients with initially asymptomatic AS.
In this post hoc exploratory analysis of a multicentre, prospective longitudinal study, asymptomatic patients with moderate-to-severe AS (n=136; age 68.6 (60.1, 75.3) years, 27% female) and control participants (n=39; age 59.0 (54.0, 67.0) years, 38% female) underwent echocardiography, cardiac CT and MRI. EAT volume and mean CT attenuation were measured from non-contrast cardiac CT using an automated deep learning software. The primary outcome was symptoms necessitating valve replacement, cardiovascular death or major adverse cardiac event.
Participants with AS had significantly higher indexed EAT volumes (56.5 vs 38.8 cm3/m2, p<0.001) and lower EAT attenuation (-76.3 vs -69.9 Hounsfield units, p<0.001). Both measures were correlated with markers of AS severity. Indexed EAT volume was not associated with cardiac remodelling in AS after correcting for confounding variables; however, a higher mean EAT CT attenuation was associated with higher indexed left ventricular mass. There were 42 (31%) primary outcome events over a median of 370 days. Lower indexed EAT volume and higher mean CT attenuation were associated with the outcome, independent of age and sex. Indexed EAT volume remained negatively associated after further adjustment for AS severity.
Indexed EAT volume was higher in patients with AS, but not associated with MRI markers of cardiac remodelling. A higher indexed EAT volume was independently associated with a lower occurrence of symptoms and cardiovascular events. Further studies are needed to corroborate these findings and whether EAT has a potentially protective role in symptom progression in AS.

Despite its minimally invasive nature, transfemoral TAVI requires both a primary and a secondary arterial access site. While the femoral artery is most commonly used for secondary access, vascular and bleeding complications remain frequent and are associated with adverse outcomes. Observational evidence from TAVI cohorts suggests that radial secondary access may reduce such complications compared to femoral access.
The RADIAL-TAVI trial is a prospective, randomized, controlled, multicenter, open-label study designed to compare radial versus femoral secondary access in patients undergoing transfemoral TAVI. A total of 434 patients will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio. The primary endpoint is the incidence of vascular and bleeding complications at the secondary access site within 30 days, adjudicated according to VARC-3 criteria. Secondary endpoints include early safety, cardiovascular mortality, major adverse cardiovascular and cerebrovascular events (MACCE), quality of life, and health economic aspects up to 30 days, as well as long-term mortality up to 12 months. The study is powered to detect a reduction in the primary endpoint from 8% with femoral to 2% with radial access.
The RADIAL-TAVI trial will provide the first randomized evidence on the optimal secondary access strategy in transfemoral TAVI. If radial access proves superior, it has the potential to redefine standard practice, reduce complication rates, and improve patient safety and outcomes."

Cardiovascular Imaging,"Mixed aortic valve disease poses unique haemodynamic challenges. This study compared the clinical outcomes of concomitant moderate aortic stenosis (AS) and moderate aortic regurgitation to isolated AS.
We analysed a multicentre cohort of valvular heart disease between 2008 and 2022 at three tertiary centres. The entire cohort was divided into three groups: moderate AS accompanied by moderate aortic regurgitation (moderate ASR), isolated severe AS, and isolated moderate AS. The primary outcome was a composite of cardiac death and hospitalization for heart failure. The final analysis included 4395 patients (median age: 76 years, 50.8% male), comprising 224 patients with moderate ASR, 1996 with severe AS, and 2175 with moderate AS. Over a median follow-up of 3.4 years, aortic valve replacement (AVR) rates were 11.1, 57.2, and 7.8 per 100 person-years in the moderate ASR, severe AS, and moderate AS groups, respectively (P < 0.001). Patients with moderate ASR had a significantly higher risk of the primary outcome compared with moderate AS [adjusted hazard ratio (aHR) 1.49; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.15-1.92; P = 0.002] and a risk comparable to severe AS (aHR 1.28; 95% CI 1.00-1.64; P = 0.052). These results remained consistent even when AVR was included as a time-varying covariate. Older age, male sex, renal dysfunction, and lower left ventricular ejection fraction were independent predictors of the primary outcome in patients with moderate ASR.
Moderate ASR should not be considered a benign condition, as it is associated with poor clinical outcomes comparable to those of severe AS."

Heart and circulatory physiology,"Background In patients with aortic valve stenosis (AS), the pathophysiological abnormalities involved in the transition to heart failure are unclear. As chronic heart failure progresses, the ratio between myocardial stroke work and oxygen consumption, i.e. myocardial external efficiency (MEE), steadily deteriorates. However, in patients with AS, it is unknown whether changes in MEE are involved in disease progression. Purpose We investigated changes in MEE and if MEE was associated with long-term prognosis in patients with AS. Methods Ten healthy controls and 38 patients with moderate-severe AS and preserved left ventricular ejection fraction ≥50% were included in the study. To evaluate MEE, we used serial 11C-acetate positron emission tomography, cardiovascular magnetic resonance imaging and echocardiography, with a median follow-up period of 2.8 years. Furthermore, we conducted a long-term follow-up for a median of 5.2 years to detect cardiac events and related them to MEE. Results In patients with AS, MEE increased during follow-up from 25.2% (95% CI: 24.0 to 26.5%) to 29.5% (95% CI: 27.3 to 31.8%; p=0.001) and was higher than in healthy volunteers, 19.9% (18.1 to 21.8; p<0.001). Patients who experienced a cardiac event during long-term follow-up (n=24, 63%) had higher baseline MEE, 26.5% (95% CI: 24.6 to 28.4%), than event-free patients, 23.3% (95% CI: 22.2 to 24.3%; p=0.004). Conclusion In asymptomatic patients with AS, MEE increased over time and high baseline MEE predicted a poor prognosis. Thus, the myocardium displayed an inherent capacity to improve the coupling between oxidative metabolism and contractile function in response to pressure overload."

Although international guidelines increasingly recognize Lp(a) as a risk-enhancing factor, in many Asian populations thresholds for high Lp(a) and treatment strategies remain undefined. This Korean position paper, developed by the Lp(a) Task Force of the Korean Society of Lipid and Atherosclerosis, presents an evidence-based summary of the pathophysiology, clinical relevance, and therapeutic landscape surrounding Lp(a), with a focus on Korean-specific data. It reviews the genetic architecture of Lp(a), ethnic variability in concentrations, and its mechanistic roles in inflammation, thrombosis, and calcification. Based on large Korean cohorts, a 3-tiered classification is proposed of normal (<30 mg/dL), borderline high (30-49 mg/dL), and high (≥50 mg/dL), harmonizing global thresholds with local data. The document also highlights the limitations of current Lp(a) assays in Korea, and calls for standardized, isoform-insensitive testing. Novel therapeutics, including antisense oligonucleotides, small interfering RNAs, and small molecular inhibitors, have shown promising Lp(a)-lowering effects, with multiple phase 3 trials currently ongoing, or in planning. Given the unmet clinical need, the paper recommends incorporating Lp(a) into cardiovascular risk assessment, and calls for Korean-specific longitudinal studies, national screening strategies, and participation in clinical trials. These efforts will help clarify Lp(a)-associated risk in Korean patients and guide the adoption of future targeted therapies."

As indications for TAVR expand, particularly into younger patient populations, the incidence of TAVR-associated infective endocarditis (TAVR-IE) has concurrently increased. Although the reported incidence of TAVR-IE remains relatively low (0.3%-2.0% per 100 patient-years), its clinical outcomes are notably poor, with mortality rates considerably higher than those observed in general infective endocarditis (IE). Moreover, the microbiological profile of TAVR-IE differs distinctly from surgical aortic valve replacement-associated IE (SAVR-IE), predominantly involving Enterococcus spp., Staphylococcus aureus, and coagulase-negative staphylococci. This review systematically summarizes the epidemiology, diagnosis, microbial etiology, prevention strategies, clinical prognosis, and management approaches for TAVR-IE, providing clinical insights and identifying key areas for future research."
PubMed,aortic stenosis,From Last Resort to Standard of Care: The Evolution and Future of Transcatheter Aortic Valve Implantation.,Oliver Lee; Ahmed Osman; Dominique Shum-Tim,10.31083/RCM46697,2026-01,Reviews in cardiovascular medicine,"Transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) has evolved from an experimental, last-resort procedure in 2002 to a first-line therapy for aortic stenosis; moreover, the 2025 ESC/EACTS (European Society of Cardiology/European Association for Cardiothoracic Surgeons) guidelines marked a paradigm shift beyond traditional risk stratification toward earlier intervention and broader patient selection. Current evidence demonstrates the non-inferiority or superiority of TAVI to surgical aortic valve replacement across all risk categories, with the guidelines now recommending TAVI for patients aged ≥70 years and formally endorsing early intervention in asymptomatic severe stenosis when procedural risk is low. Meanwhile, critical challenges persist despite large-scale systematic reviews demonstrating significant mortality reduction following TAVI, including paravalvular leak rates of 10-25% compared to near-zero rates with surgery, and subclinical leaflet thrombosis affecting up to 30% of patients with unclear optimal management strategies. Moreover, the expansion toward younger populations exposes critical knowledge gaps, including unknown long-term durability beyond 10 years, structural valve degeneration rates of 4.8-13.3% at 5-7 years, and complex reintervention scenarios with reported mortality rates of 17.1% for surgical TAVI explantation. Thus, this review synthesizes contemporary evidence within the framework of the 2025 guidelines while examining unique aspects, including the pathophysiology of subclinical leaflet thrombosis, polymeric heart valve technologies as next-generation solutions, and the critical durability questions that will determine the role of TAVI in younger patients. Next-generation polymeric valves utilizing materials such as polyhedral oligomeric silsesquioxanes-polycarbonate urethane (POSS-PCU), poly(styrene-b-isobutylene-b-styrene) (SIBS), and siloxane polyurethane-urea have shown promising preclinical results in terms of enhanced durability and reduced thrombogenicity, although comprehensive clinical validation remains necessary. As TAVI practice evolves under new guideline recommendations emphasizing early intervention and simplified antithrombotic management, this thorough analysis can provide essential context for understanding both current capabilities and future directions in transcatheter valve therapy."

POAF results from an interplay between pre-existing arrhythmogenic substrates, acute surgical triggers, unresolved inflammation, and autonomic nervous system (ANS) imbalance. Specialized pro-resolving mediators (SPMs) orchestrate inflammation resolution and tissue homeostasis; their deficiency may sustain valvular inflammation and promote arrhythmogenesis. Transcutaneous vagus nerve stimulation (tVNS) is a non-invasive approach that enhances parasympathetic tone, restores sympathovagal balance, and modulates inflammatory pathways. While tVNS has been applied postoperatively, its preoperative, preventive use in POAF has not been explored, representing a novel therapeutic strategy. In patients with CAVS, preoperative tVNS could reduce POAF by regulating ANS activity and limiting perioperative inflammation. Mechanistic insights may be gained through perioperative sampling, analysis of excised valvular and atrial tissue, and biomechanical assessments comparing stimulated and control groups. Preoperative tVNS thus offers a promising strategy to prevent POAF while addressing valvular inflammation, bridging translational physiology with clinical cardiology and potentially opening new avenues for the management of CAVS."

A more comprehensive characterization of cardiac function and energetics can be achieved through pressure-volume analysis, but its clinical application is limited by the requirement for invasive measurements. We aimed to develop a clinically accessible, non-invasive method for pressure-volume loop analysis.
We obtained simultaneous 3-dimensional echocardiograms and invasive LV pressures with micromanometer-tipped catheters during transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) for severe aortic stenosis. Volume-time traces from the echocardiograms were combined with invasive LV pressures and non-invasive pressure estimates to construct pressure-volume loops. We used echocardiograms before and after TAVR to evaluate changes in myocardial function via non-invasive pressure-volume studies.
In same-beat comparisons, stroke work calculated using non-invasive LV pressure estimations correlated well with stroke work calculated using invasive LV pressures (r = 0.95, ICC = 0.95, p < 0.0001, y = 0.90X + 1,836, mean bias -549 mmHg*mL, standard deviation 774 mmHg*mL; 95% limits of agreement: -2,006 to +967 mmHg*mL). After TAVR, stroke work fell substantially, ventricular efficiency increased, ventriculo-arterial coupling improved, and both total and resting energy consumption decreased. On the other hand, LV biplane EF and GLS remained unchanged.
This study confirms the validity and clinical accessibility of non-invasive pressure-volume loop analysis in patients with aortic stenosis. The method identified and characterized changes in myocardial energetics, function, and ventriculo-arterial interaction, that are not typically detected by conventional echocardiography. These findings highlight the potential of non-invasive pressure-volume analysis in clinical and research practice."

Renin-angiotensin system (RAS) inhibitors may mitigate these adverse effects and improve clinical outcomes. Despite advancements in transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR), substantial mortality, heart failure readmissions, and other complications persist.
This study aimed to evaluate the impact of RAS inhibitor therapy following TAVR on clinical outcomes.
We conducted a systematic review and Bayesian meta-analysis following the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions. A comprehensive search of PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane was performed to identify studies comparing RAS inhibitor (RASi) use versus non-use in patients undergoing TAVR for aortic stenosis. Odds ratios (OR) and 95% credible intervals (CrI) were estimated using a Bayesian random-effects model. Between-study heterogeneity was quantified using the posterior distribution of the heterogeneity parameter (τ). Posterior probabilities (PP) of treatment benefit were calculated, with clinically meaningful effects defined as P (OR < 0.8). All analyses were performed using R version 4.5.0.
A total of 12 studies comprising 35,988 patients were included, of whom 17,026 (47.3%) received RASi therapy. The mean age ranged from 78.9 to 84.4 years. Post-TAVR RASi use was associated with a 79.4% probability of a clinically relevant reduction in all-cause mortality and a 99.5% probability of a clinically relevant reduction in cardiovascular mortality. There was a 54% probability of a clinically relevant reduction in heart failure hospitalization and a negligible (2.26%) probability of a reduction in the odds of myocardial infarction in the RASi group.
RASi therapy following TAVR is associated with reduced odds of mortality and heart failure readmission."

To investigate the influence of different spine structures on valve implantation.
Retrospectively, we investigated 95 severe aortic stenosis patients who underwent transfemoral TAVR using SEVs (PRO + : 41, FX: 21, and Navitor: 33 patients) from January 2021 to July 2023. The implantation depth difference (IDD) between Left Coronary Cusp (LCC) and Non-Coronary Cusp (NCC) was measured angiographically at the point of no recapture, defined as subtracting NCC implantation depth from LCC. Positive IDD indicates deeper LCC than NCC, also shown as ""vertical axis."" Whereas negative IDD indicates shallower LCC than NCC, demonstrated as ""horizontal axis.""
IDD at the point of no recapture showed significant difference among three groups (PRO + : 2.42 [0.81-3.42], FX: 1.01 [0.29-1.77], Navitor: -2.16[-2.74- (-1.14)] mm, p < 0.001, PRO + > FX/Navitor, FX > Navitor). PRO+ had a positive IDD, indicating deeper LCC implantation. Navitor had a negative IDD, demonstrating shallower implantation on LCC, and FX showed co-axial implantation.
PRO+ with double spines showed vertical axis, Navitor with non-spine showed horizontal axis, whereas FX demonstrated co-axiality at the point of no recapture. This knowledge may help refine the manipulation of procedural implantation based on the shaft rigidity in each device to gain co-axiality."

Predicting postoperative neurological outcomes is important to decide treatment strategies; however, current prediction methods have limitations. Therefore, this study examined whether the lateral ventricular volume ratio (LVR) on preoperative head computed tomography (CT) can predict postoperative neurological outcomes.
Among patients who underwent surgery for ATAAD at our institution between January 2007 and August 2024, those with cerebral malperfusion who underwent preoperative head CT were included. Cerebral malperfusion was defined as common carotid artery true lumen stenosis ≥50% and new neurological symptoms. The LVR was calculated as the larger lateral ventricular volume divided by the smaller lateral ventricular volume.
Of 386 patients with ATAAD, 33 had cerebral malperfusion and underwent preoperative CT. Receiver operating characteristic analysis determined LVR < 1.067 as the cut-off, classifying patients into the symmetric group (ratio < 1.067, n = 10) or the asymmetric group (ratio ≥ 1.067, n = 23). The symmetric group showed 80% postoperative neurological recovery compared with 26% in the asymmetric group (P = .007). The postoperative modified Rankin Scale score was ≥4 in 20% and 78% of patients in the symmetric and asymmetric groups, respectively (P = .005). Univariable analysis identified lateral ventricular symmetry as a predictor of postoperative neurological recovery (odds ratio = 11.3, 95% confidence interval: 1.86-69.1, P = .008). Long-term overall survival was significantly better in the symmetric group than in the asymmetric group (P = .043).
In patients with ATAAD and cerebral malperfusion, lateral ventricular symmetry on preoperative head CT may predict postoperative neurological outcomes.

Sex-specific differences in left ventricular (LV) remodeling may contribute to this disparity. We investigated whether a fully automated, machine-learning-based three-dimensional echocardiography (3DE) approach, the Dynamic Heart Model (DHM), improves the detection of these differences compared to conventional two-dimensional echocardiography (2DE). This study investigates sex-related differences in cardiac remodeling and hemodynamics in AS patients with a preserved ejection fraction (EF ≥ 50%), comparing results from 2D echocardiography (2DE) and 3D echocardiography (3DE) via the DHM. The study included 101 consecutive patients with AS (42% women) who were assessed with 2DE and DHM. Parameters such as LV volumes, mass (LVM), stroke volume (SV), and aortic valve area (AVA) were measured and indexed to body surface area (BSA). Sex-specific differences were analyzed, with a focus on identifying significant remodeling patterns. Women exhibited smaller LV end-diastolic volume (EDV) and end-systolic volume (ESV) by DHM compared to men (115 mL vs. 155 mL, p < 0.001; 51 mL vs. 66 mL, p < 0.001). Indexed EDV (EDVi) and ESV (ESVi) were also significantly lower in women (69 mL/m² vs. 84 mL/m², p < 0.001; 30 mL/m² vs. 34 mL/m², p = 0.002). LVM and indexed LV mass (LVMi) were significantly lower in women when measured by DHM (131 g vs. 163 g, p < 0.001; 75 g/m² vs. 89 g/m², p = 0.005), whereas 2DE did not reveal statistically significant differences. Women exhibited a more concentric LV geometry, as reflected by higher relative wall thickness than men (0.42 vs. 0.36; p = 0.04). Despite similar hemodynamic parameters, women had significantly smaller DHM-derived AVA (0.90 cm² vs. 1.20 cm², p < 0.001), correlating with reduced SV (64 mL vs. 90 mL, p < 0.001). This study highlights that significant sex-related differences in LV remodeling and AS severity are better captured by DHM than 2DE, emphasizing the importance of sex-specific considerations and accurate measurements in evaluating and managing AS."

Both early mitral valve repair surgery and active surveillance with facilitated surgery are possible strategies. The DutchAMR registry compares clinical outcomes between these two strategies.                                                           Methods                     Patients were included between 2013–2019. Primary endpoints were cerebrovascular accidents (CVA), reoperations, and mortality. Facilitated surgery was defined as mitral valve repair surgery performed after developing a surgical indication during active surveillance.                                                           Results                     Ninety-nine patients were enrolled; 71 in active surveillance and 28 in early surgery. Over a median follow-up time of 5.1 years, 51% of active surveillance patients underwent facilitated surgery due to ESC guideline triggers. Both the early and facilitated surgery groups had one perioperative CVA. During follow-up, in the active surveillance group, 5 (7%) patients died (3 without surgery and 2 after facilitated surgery), and 3 (4%) underwent reoperations. In the early surgery group, 4 (14%) patients reached a primary endpoint, including 2 (7%) CVAs (without residual symptoms) and 2 (7%) deaths. No reoperations occurred in the early surgery group. Baseline additional testing parameters based on CPET, Holter monitoring, and CMR showed no differences between the groups.                                                           Conclusions                     After 5.1 years, half of the active surveillance patients required facilitated surgery, with comparable postoperative outcomes to early surgery. Clinical endpoints were comparable between the early and facilitated surgery strategies. There were no differences in baseline additional testing parameters, suggesting no clear targets for upfront stratificatio. Thus, shared decision making weighing the different risks can be used to determine the strategy per patient."

Methods                     We conducted a retrospective cohort study using TriNetX to identify adults with mitral regurgitation who underwent surgical repair or TEER (2013–2025). Propensity score matching (PSM) balanced demographics, comorbidities, and medications. The primary outcome was all-cause mortality; the secondary outcomes included cardiovascular events.                                                           Results                     After exclusions, 35,753 patients with mitral regurgitation were identified, including 2,165 TEER and 33,588 surgical cases; 2,029 matched pairs were analyzed. At 1 year, surgery showed lower mortality (hazard ratio [HR]: 0.78; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.64–0.96), primarily between 2 months and 1 year. Surgery was associated with higher rates of early dyspnea, atrial fibrillation, and heart failure, though heart failure could be reversed later. No significant differences were found in major adverse cardiovascular events (MACEs), stroke, acute myocardial infarction (AMI), cardiac arrest, or emergency department (ED) visits. A subgroup analysis of patients with mitral valve prolapse showed consistent results, with atrial fibrillation and heart failure occurring more frequently after surgery.                                                           Conclusion                     In this large cohort, surgery and TEER produced different outcomes. Early mortality was similar, but surgery improved survival after 2 months. TEER had fewer early dyspnea, atrial fibrillation, and heart failure events. No differences were observed in MACE, stroke, AMI, or ED visits, supporting individualized MR treatment."

Percutaneous transvenous mitral commissurotomy (PTMC) is an effective treatment for symptomatic MS, yet its long‐term impact on atrial electromechanical properties remains underexplored.                                                           Methods                     We conducted a prospective observational study involving 53 patients (mean age 33.3 ± 6.44 years) who underwent successful PTMC for severe MS. Patients were followed up for a mean duration of 5.34 ± 0.55 years post‐procedure. Atrial electromechanical parameters, including P‐wave dispersion (PWD) and atrial electromechanical delay (AEMD), were assessed using electrocardiography and tissue Doppler echocardiography at baseline, 1 year, 3 years, and 5 years post‐PTMC.                                                           Results                     PTMC resulted in significant improvements in mitral valve area and gradients immediately post‐procedure, which were sustained over the long term. AEMD showed statistically significant improvement at mean 3 years and 5.3 years post‐PTMC, indicating enhanced electromechanical function. Conversely, PWD demonstrated gradual and significant improvement at intermediate follow‐up, with stabilization after 3 years. Patients who developed atrial fibrillation (AF) or restenosis during follow‐up exhibited higher baseline values, suggesting a potential predictive role for these parameters.                                                           Conclusion                     Our study demonstrates that PTMC leads to sustained improvements in atrial electromechanical function indices over long‐term follow‐up. AEMD and PWD serve as valuable markers for assessing atrial remodeling post‐PTMC, with implications for predicting AF and restenosis risk in patients with rheumatic MS."

Case Summary                     A middle-aged man with a history of intravenous drug use (IVDU) presented with fever, new apical systolic murmur, and widespread embolic phenomena affecting brain, spleen, kidneys, and lower limb. Transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) revealed a large posterior mitral leaflet vegetation with moderate-severe mitral regurgitation (MR). Blood and tissue cultures were negative. Next-generation sequencing (NGS) of an aspirated calf muscle abscess identified Rothia dentocariosa. Despite prolonged antimicrobial therapy and multidisciplinary care, persistent vegetations and high embolic risk prompted mitral valve replacement after interval stabilization of intracranial hemorrhages. He recovered without recurrent emboli and with stable prosthetic valve function.                                                           Conclusion                     Advanced molecular diagnostics like NGS can be crucial for identifying pathogens in culture-negative endocarditis. Multidisciplinary collaboration and individualized surgical timing are important for achieving optimal outcomes in complex cases with neurological complications."

With a focus on the prevalent psychological complications following the onset of this condition, this study aimed to explore the correlation between antenatal depression and Corona disease anxiety, personality traits, and postpartum depression during the COVID-19 pandemic.                                                           Materials and Methods:                     This cross-sectional descriptive-analytical study investigated women receiving care at health centers affiliated with Kerman University of Medical Sciences during the last month of their pregnancy and the postpartum period in 2022. Following the acquisition of informed consent, participants were assessed using various measures, including demographic and obstetric information, the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale, the Corona Disease Anxiety Scale (CDAS), and the NEO Personality Inventory-Revised during their third trimester of pregnancy. The same group of participants completed the Edinburgh Depression Scale and the Corona Disease Anxiety Scale (CDAS) 4-6 weeks after childbirth.                                                           Results and Discussion:                     There was a significant correlation between family income, unwanted pregnancy as perceived by both the mother and father, and antenatal depression. Additionally, marital satisfaction played a significant role in postpartum depression. Furthermore, antenatal depression was significantly associated with neuroticism, agreeableness, and physical symptoms related to Corona disease anxiety. Personality traits, with the exception of extroversion and conscientiousness, and various domains of Corona disease anxiety, excluding psychological symptoms, were also significantly associated with postpartum depression.                                                           Conclusion:                     During pandemics or epidemics, such as the COVID-19 outbreak, experiencing mental distress during pregnancy can contribute to mental health issues during the postpartum period. This risk is particularly true in individuals with unique personality traits, emphasizing the need for increased focus on mental health within prenatal care during these crises."

Method:                     This cross-sectional study was conducted in Kerman, Iran. Data were collected from patients who visited Afzalipour Hospital in Kerman more than twice during the COVID-19 epidemic from the end of February 2020 to March 21, 2021. We conducted two key analyses: 1. Mixed effect logistic regression was used to check the relationship between the variables and COVID-19 severity. 2. Mixed effect linear regression was used to check the relationship between the variables and the length of stay in the hospital.                                                           Results:                     The findings indicated that the most important risk factors for the severity of COVID-19 were heart diseases (OR=1.67,95%CI:1.20-2.30), increasing age (OR=2.23 for age&gt;54, 95%CI:1.70- 2.90), male gender (OR=1.47,95%CI:1.10-1.96), respiratory diseases other than asthma, and frequency of admission (OR=1.60,95%CI:1.20-2.15). All patients who underwent readmission experienced a shorter duration of hospitalization during their subsequent admission (OR=0.94,95%CI:0.91,0.96) and had a higher mortality rate (30% within 14 days, 26.6% between 14-90 days). Patients readmitted at intervals of 14-90 days and greater than 90 days exhibited lower disease severity compared to those readmitted within the 0-14 day period.                                                           Conclusion:                     Examining readmissions, the severity of COVID-19, and the length of hospital stay in affected patients are important factors for planning and allocating resources for COVID-19 management and treatment. These factors can help policymakers develop effective clinical guidelines for hospitalization or outpatient treatment of COVID-19 patients and contribute to reducing the burden of disease in the community."

Kinovea, as an accessible motion-analysis software, provides both visual and quantitative feedback. However, its application in supporting technique development among beginner athletes remains insufficiently explored. Aim: This study aims to describe the use of Kinovea in biomechanics training and examine its contribution to the awareness of kinematic characteristics and movement techniques among beginner athletes. Methods: A descriptive qualitative design involved 72 beginner athletes aged 18–25 years selected through purposive sampling. Data were collected over 16 weeks through interviews, field observations, and motion video recordings analyzed using Kinovea. Kinematic data focused on joint angles, stride behavior, and movement phases during walking, running, and the flight phase. Qualitative data were analyzed using content analysis with NVivo 12, while kinematic results were interpreted descriptively to identify performance patterns and areas for technical refinement. Result: Kinematic analysis showed coordinated joint-angle patterns across all phases. Walking analysis identified arm swing angles of 50.9°–58.8° and leg separation angles of 64.3°–67.2°, indicating a stable gait rhythm. The running analysis revealed knee angles of 68.8°–69.8° and elbow angles of 87.6°–89.1°, indicating efficient propulsive mechanics. The flight phase demonstrated knee angles of 81.2°–87.8° and elbow angles of 80.4°–88.3°, suggesting effective momentum use and postural stability. These measurements supported stride-efficiency assessment and technique evaluation. Qualitative findings revealed that Kinovea enabled athletes to interpret movement phases and identify technical inefficiencies through slow-motion and frame-by-frame visualization. Conclusion: Kinovea supports basic motion analysis by providing clear kinematic information and helping beginner athletes observe and refine their movement techniques. The findings also offer practical value for coaches by enabling more precise identification of inefficient patterns and guiding targeted corrections during early-stage training."

Sievert; Jacob Zeitani,10.36922/bh025510076,2026-02-05,Brain & Heart,"Cardioembolic stroke remains one of the most severe manifestations of cardiovascular disease, with atrial fibrillation (AF) responsible for a large proportion of ischemic cerebrovascular events. Stroke prevention strategies are currently dominated by oral anticoagulation guided by CHA2DS2-VASc scores, which emphasize age and comorbidities and therefore have limited applicability in younger patients with low conventional risk profiles. Although bleeding risk is routinely assessed using tools such as HAS-BLED, lifelong anticoagulation may still confer a substantial cumulative hemorrhagic burden over decades of treatment. The left atrial appendage (LAA) represents the primary anatomical source of thromboembolism in AF, yet current guidelines largely restrict surgical or percutaneous LAA exclusion to patients with AF who have contraindications to anticoagulation, reflecting a predominantly reactive approach. This Perspective advocates reconsideration of prophylactic surgical LAA exclusion at the time of open mitral valve repair in younger patients. Although early mitral repair limits atrial remodeling, it does not abolish lifetime AF risk, and post-operative or late-onset AF remains frequent. Moreover, residual or recurrent mitral regurgitation promotes progressive atrial dilation and fibrosis, increasing long-term thromboembolic risk even in patients initially in sinus rhythm. By integrating atrial remodeling, LAA morphology and function, residual mitral pathology, and the limitations of lifelong anticoagulation, a selective preventive framework emerges. An anatomical brain-heart prevention strategy may reduce lifetime cerebrovascular risk and improve long-term outcomes. While prospective data are needed, existing evidence supports individualized discussion of prophylactic LAA exclusion during mitral valve repair in selected young patients with structural atrial disease."

However, data on the long-term prognostic impact of MR and its progression or regression over time remain limited, particularly across individual HCM subtypes. METHODS: Patients with HCM were retrospectively included from a Japanese multicenter registry and compared by MR severity (moderate or greater versus mild or less) within each subtype: hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy (HOCM), end-stage HCM (ES-HCM), and other HCM (including nonobstructive, midventricular obstruction, and apical HCM). RESULTS: Among 3602 patients (HOCM: n=837; ES-HCM: n=275; other HCM: n=2490), the prevalence of moderate or greater MR was highest in HOCM (36.3%), followed by ES-HCM (21.5%) and other HCM (8.5%). During a median follow-up of 5.3 (interquartile range, 2.1–9.3) years, the cumulative 5-year incidence of all-cause death or heart failure hospitalization was not significantly different between the moderate or greater MR and mild or less MR groups in HOCM (14.6% versus 12.4%; P =0.35) or ES-HCM (60.7% versus 54.7%; P =0.84). After adjustment for clinical covariates, no significant association was observed in either subtype (HOCM: hazard ratio, 1.13 [95% CI, 0.79–1.60], P =0.51; ES-HCM: hazard ratio, 0.84 [95% CI, 0.55–1.28], P =0.42). In contrast, in other HCM, moderate or greater MR was significantly associated with the higher 5-year cumulative incidence of all-cause death or heart failure hospitalization (34.2% versus 13.9%, P &lt;0.001), which remained significant after adjustment, with a significant interaction (hazard ratio, 1.45 [95% CI, 1.09–1.91], P =0.01; P interaction =0.02). MR severity improved over time in HOCM, showed no clear change in ES-HCM, and worsened in other HCM ( P &lt;0.001, 0.46, and &lt;0.001, respectively; P interaction &lt;0.001). CONCLUSIONS: In patients with HCM, moderate or greater MR was not associated with worse outcomes in HOCM or ES-HCM, but had significant prognostic implications in other HCM subtypes, suggesting the need for HCM subtype-specific MR management."

However, primary (degenerative) and secondary (functional) MR represent distinct disease entities, characterized by different pathophysiological mechanisms, clinical trajectories, and determinants of benefit. This review aims to provide an interventional cardiology-oriented synthesis of TEER, emphasizing the fundamental differences between primary and secondary MR and their i for patient selection, procedural strategy, and outcome interpretation. Methods: A targeted literature search was performed in PubMed and Embase to identify pivotal randomized trials, registries, guideline documents, and high-quality reviews addressing TEER in MR. The available evidence was synthesized narratively, with a focus on mechanistic insights, TEER-specific imaging and procedural endpoints, and clinically relevant outcomes.Results: In primary MR, TEER functions as a valve-centered therapy, with procedural success primarily determined by anatomical suitability and the balance between durable MR reduction and avoidance of elevated transmitral gradients. In secondary MR, TEER should be considered an adjunctive intervention within a comprehensive heart failure strategy, with benefit dependent on patient phenotype, myocardial substrate, optimization of background therapy, and appropriate timing. Emerging phenotypes, such as atrial functional MR, further challenge traditional classification and highlight the need for mechanism-based selection. Across MR subtypes, residual MR and transmitral gradients emerge as key post-procedural endpoints with differential prognostic implications. Conclusions: TEER represents a phenotype-specific intervention rather than a uniform solution for MR. Recognizing the distinct interventional paradigms of primary and secondary MR is essential to optimize patient selection, procedural decision-making, and clinical outcomes."
OpenAlex,mitral regurgitation,Mechanisms of mitral valve development and disease,E. Wang; Bin Zhou,10.3389/fcvm.2026.1773671,2026-02-04,Frontiers in Cardiovascular Medicine,"The mitral valve apparatus comprises the annulus, valve leaflets, chordae tendineae, and papillary muscles, forming an integrated biomechanical unit essential for unidirectional blood flow. The leaflets and chordae are primarily derived from endocardial cells, and damage to these structures results in either mitral stenosis or mitral regurgitation, depending on the underlying pathology. This review compares three major mitral valve diseases, rheumatic mitral stenosis, congenital mitral stenosis, and myxomatous mitral valve prolapse, to highlight their distinct etiologies, molecular mechanisms, and structural endpoints. Rheumatic mitral stenosis is an acquired immune-mediated disease triggered by Group A streptococcal infection, in which molecular mimicry leads to autoantibody formation and chronic inflammation. Immune-cell infiltration and cytokine release drive the progression of leaflet fibrosis, commissural fusion, calcification, and pronounced chordal shortening, ultimately culminating in fixed obstruction. Large-scale genetic studies have not identified strong causal genes, instead revealing associations with immune-related risk loci, while valve-specific epigenetic mechanisms are poorly explored. Congenital mitral stenosis arises from developmental abnormalities of the mitral valve complex during embryogenesis and is classified into four anatomical subtypes. Due to its low incidence, the condition remains the least studied at the molecular and genetic levels. In contrast, myxomatous mitral valve prolapse is a degenerative, polygenic disorder driven by aberrant TGF β -dependent endothelial-to-mesenchymal transformation, valve interstitial cell activation, and extracellular matrix remodeling. Genetic studies have identified multiple causal genes, including FLNA , DCHS1 , DZIP1 , and TNS1 , underscoring its mechano-genetic origin. Despite their distinct causes, immune-mediated, developmental, and degenerative/genetic, all three diseases converge on progressive structural failure of the MV apparatus. Notably, pathological remodeling of the chordae plays a decisive role in disease progression and the need for surgical intervention. A deeper understanding of both shared and disease-specific mechanisms, particularly valve- and chordae-specific molecular regulation, is essential to advance translational research in mitral valve disease."
OpenAlex,mitral regurgitation,Effect of a Decellularised Tendon-Based Mitral Annuloplasty Ring on Regurgitation Suppression in Degenerative Mitral Regurgitation Model: An in Vitro Pulsatile Circulation Study,Ikuo Katayama; Shinya Imai; Yusei Okamoto; Kiyotaka Iwasaki,10.1093/icvts/ivag040,2026-02-03,Interdisciplinary CardioVascular and Thoracic Surgery,"Abstract OBJECTIVES Conventional annuloplasty rings used in mitral valve repair (MVr) are made of metal or synthetic polymers, which may increase infection risk. This study aimed to develop a mitral annuloplasty ring using decellularised tissue and evaluate its ability to suppress regurgitation in a degenerative mitral regurgitation (DMR) model. METHODS A 4 mm diameter annuloplasty ring was created using decellularized bovine tendon. Porcine mitral valve complexes (including the annulus, leaflets, chordae tendineae, and papillary muscles) were obtained from a slaughterhouse. The annulus was enlarged by 4 mm, and the two chordae tendineae of the posterior leaflet (P2) were severed. The DMR model, integrated into a pulsatile flow simulator, was repaired using a commercial—Physio II, Colvin-Galloway (CG) Future, Tailor band, and a decellularised tendon-based ring. Regurgitation control and effective mitral valve area (MVA) were compared (n = 6 for each group). RESULTS The regurgitation rate of the DMR model was 52.3 ± 3.4%, consistent with severe MR. Post-MVr with each ring, the regurgitation rates were 14.9 ± 3.1% (Physio II), 14.5 ± 1.1% (CG Future), 16.4 ± 1.7% (Tailor band), and 15.5 ± 3.0% (decellularised tendon-based biological ring). All of these rates were significantly reduced, with no significant differences among them. Effective MVA was comparable across groups: 2.46 ± 0.28 cm2 (Physio II), 2.33 ± 0.54 cm2 (CG Future), 2.28 ± 0.12 cm2 (Tailor band), and 2.27 ± 0.53 cm2 (decellularised tendon-based biological ring). CONCLUSIONS The decellularised tendon-based annuloplasty ring demonstrated functional performance comparable to that of current mitral annuloplasty devices."

OpenAlex,mitral regurgitation,Clinical outcomes and management strategies for moderate aortic regurgitation in patients undergoing rheumatic mitral valve surgery,Chuang Liu; Zhou Liu; Jia-Jun Liang; Songhao Jia; Mingxuan Zhang; Peiyi Liu; Mao-zhou Wang; Xiao-long Wang; Hong-jia Zhang; Wen-jian Jiang,10.1038/s41598-026-37045-5,2026-02-03,Scientific Reports,"Additional exploration is required to determine how to treat patients with moderate aortic regurgitation (AR) in rheumatic mitral valve (MV) surgery. This study compared clinical outcomes in patients undergoing non-surgical treatment (NT) of aortic valve (AV), aortic valvuloplasty (AVP), and aortic valve replacement (AVR). This multicenter, retrospective observational cohort study included 338 moderate AR patients undergoing rheumatic MV surgery from January 2015 to January 2024. We followed up with patients for a median of 43.4 months. Furthermore, more-than-mild aortic valve dysfunction (AVD) in the follow-up period was our primary outcome. Our secondary outcomes were all-cause mortality and cardiac valve reoperation before discharge and during follow-up. We classified patients into three groups, namely, NT (n = 128), AVP (n = 91), and AVR (n = 119) groups, respectively. Moreover, 33.0%, 30.1%, and 3.9% of patients achieved our primary outcome, while 4.2%, 5.6%, and 9.6% of them attained our secondary outcomes in the three groups, respectively. We observed that fewer patients from the AVR group had achieved the primary outcome than those in the NT [adjusted relative risk (RR), 0.41; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.21-0.68; p = 0.002] and AVP groups (adjusted RR, 0.14; 95% CI, 0.04-0.43; p = 0.002), respectively. The secondary outcomes did not significantly differ among the three groups. Without increasing surgical risks, the concurrent AVR significantly improves AV status in moderate AR patients undergoing rheumatic MV surgery throughout follow-up. None or mild AVD was observed in many patients from the NT group during the follow-up, thereby warranting the delay of surgery for AV."
OpenAlex,mitral regurgitation,Outcome of del Nido versus St. Thomas cardioplegia solution in adult mitral valve replacement surgery for rheumatic mitral valve disease,Akash Shah; Anil Jain; Himani Pandya; Ronak Raval,10.1177/02676591261423026,2026-02-03,Perfusion,"Background Effective myocardial protection is essential for successful outcomes in open-heart surgery. Although both del Nido and St. Thomas cardioplegia solutions are widely used, comparative evidence in adult rheumatic mitral valve replacement remains limited. This study aimed to compare their myocardial protective efficacy and clinical outcomes. Methods A prospective comparative study was conducted between May 2022 and October 2024. Total 50 adult patients undergoing mitral valve replacement—20 with severe mitral regurgitation (MR) and 30 with severe mitral stenosis (MS) were included. Patients were divided into two groups based on cardioplegia type (del Nido or St. Thomas). Intraoperative parameters, postoperative left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF), troponin I levels, inotropic and ventilatory support, and ICU/hospital stay were analysed. Results Baseline characteristics were comparable across groups. The mean number of cardioplegia doses was significantly lower in the del Nido group (1.6 ± 0.5 vs 3.2 ± 0.8; p &lt; 0.001). Postoperative LVEF was better preserved with del Nido cardioplegia (MS: 53.3 ± 7.2% vs 45.3 ± 10.6%; p = 0.023). Troponin I levels at 6, 24, and 48 h were lower in the del Nido group, though not statistically significant. Patients receiving del Nido required less inotropic and ventilatory support, with shorter ICU and hospital stays. One in-hospital death occurred in the del Nido group due to sepsis. Conclusion Del Nido cardioplegia offers comparable or superior myocardial protection to St. Thomas solution in adult mitral valve replacement, with fewer interruptions, reduced dosing, and faster postoperative recovery."

The 2019 classification distinguishes TRALI type I [no acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) risk factors] from type II (pre-existing or concurrent ARDS risk factors). We describe a case of TRALI type II after red blood cell (RBC) transfusion in a patient with cancer, sepsis, and suspected endocarditis. A 64-year-old woman with metastatic breast cancer on doxorubicin was hospitalized for fever and acute kidney injury. Echocardiography revealed a mobile mass on the posterior mitral leaflet with severe mitral regurgitation, and she was treated with ceftaroline and daptomycin. On hospital day 20, she received an RBC transfusion for anemia (hemoglobin 6.2 g/dL). Five hours later, she developed sudden hypoxemic respiratory failure with new bilateral infiltrates consistent with pulmonary edema, without fluid overload or cardiac decompensation. Despite non-invasive ventilation, she deteriorated and died. TRALI type II was considered the most likely diagnosis, underscoring the need for vigilance."

Catheter looping and knot formation are rare but potentially hazardous complications. Case summary An 82-year-old woman with permanent atrial fibrillation and severe mitral and tricuspid valve regurgitation presented with complete atrioventricular block and a ventricular escape rhythm at 28 bpm. A temporary transvenous pacing catheter inserted via the right internal jugular vein failed to achieve consistent ventricular capture and became entrapped at 45 cm, forming a knot near the venous introducer. Given the patient's frailty and high surgical risk, a multidisciplinary team opted for a fully percutaneous strategy for removal. After definitive pacemaker implantation, the knotted catheter was successfully retrieved using a stepwise approach: engagement of the loop with a deflectable ablation catheter, externalization through a femoral sheath, and extraction using a 13-F dilator sheath to minimize venous trauma. Discussion This case highlights procedural pitfalls during emergency temporary pacing without fluoroscopy and illustrates a safe, creative percutaneous solution for knot retrieval using tools familiar to electrophysiology and lead extraction operators."
OpenAlex,mitral regurgitation,Left atrial reservoir strain by speckle-tracking echocardiography predicts prognosis in secondary mitral valve insufficiency,Ricardo Micael Mendes Morais Carvalheiro; Miguel Marques Antunes; Vera Vaz Ferreira; Ana Leal; F Gameiro; Isabel Cardoso; J Viegas; T Mano; Pedro Rio; S Aguiar Rosa; Ana Teresa Timóteo; Ana Galrinho; Rui Cruz Ferreira,10.1007/s12471-026-02022-0,2026-02-02,Netherlands Heart Journal,"Abstract Background Functional mitral regurgitation (FMR) contributes significantly to morbidity and mortality and may result from left ventricular (VFMR) or atrial (AFMR) remodelling. Left atrial reservoir strain (LASR) is a sensitive marker of atrial dysfunction and may offer incremental prognostic value. This study evaluated whether LASR predicts all-cause mortality and heart failure (HF) hospitalizations in FMR, its performance in VFMR versus AFMR, and its utility over standard echocardiographic parameters. Methods We retrospectively analyzed 102 patients (mean age 68 ± 14 years, 41.2% female) with at least moderate FMR who underwent transesophageal echocardiography between 2018 and 2023. Patients were categorized into VFMR (LV dysfunction or remodelling) and AFMR (LA enlargement with preserved LV function). LASR was assessed using speckle-tracking echocardiography. Primary and secondary endpoints were all-cause mortality and HF hospitalization, respectively. Cox models evaluated associations with outcomes, including subgroup analysis by LASR quartiles and additional risk stratification combining LASR with peak tricuspid regurgitation (TR) velocity. Results LASR was independently associated with all-cause mortality in multivariate Cox regression (adjusted HR = 0.887, p = 0.039). Higher LASR quartiles were associated with improved survival ( p = 0.013). When combined with peak TR velocity in a composite risk model, patients with LASR ≤ 9.0% or TR velocity &gt; 3.0 m/s had significantly higher risks of mortality (HR = 2.853, p = 0.012) and HF hospitalization (HR = 3.922, p = 0.029). Conclusions LASR, particularly when combined with TR velocity, provides strong prognostic value in FMR, supporting its potential role in refining risk assessment."

OpenAlex,mitral regurgitation,Is left ventricular relative wall thickness a predictor of 5-year mortality in patients with acute decompensated heart failure?,Sefa Tatar; Hasan Kan; Yunus Emre Yavuz; Selçuk Çakmak; Yakup Alsancak; Abdullah İçli; Hakan Akilli,10.1177/20480040261421393,2026-02-01,JRSM Cardiovascular Disease,"Objectives Heart failure (HF) is a significant global health problem that continues to increase in prevalence, morbidity, and mortality, particularly in aging populations. Relative wall thickness (RWT), an echocardiographic parameter reflecting geometric remodeling of the heart, is easily measurable and may possess prognostic value. This study aimed to evaluate the predictive power of RWT for 5-year mortality in patients with HF. Methods In this retrospective observational analysis, a total of 232 individuals diagnosed with acute decompensated heart failure were enrolled. RWT values were calculated using echocardiographic measurements. In this single retrospective cohort, participants were stratified into two subgroups based on their 5-year survival status. Demographic, clinical, laboratory, and echocardiographic parameters were compared between these subgroups Results After 5 years of follow-up, 133 patients had died. Patients in the mortality group were significantly older (p = 0.001). The mortality cohort demonstrated a higher prevalence of chronic renal failure, atrial fibrillation, and mitral regurgitation compared with survivors. Echocardiographically, elevated systolic pulmonary artery pressure (sPAP) was associated with mortality (p = 0.009). However, regression analysis did not find sPAP to be statistically significant [95% confidence interval (CI), hazard ratio: 1.047 (0.818-1.340), p:0.7)]. RWT values ​​did not show a significant difference between the groups (0.39 ± 0.13 compared to 0.37 ± 0.06; p = 0.225). Area under the curve for RWT was 0.50 (95% CI: 0.43–0.57), indicating poor predictive power. Kaplan–Meier analysis showed no significant difference in survival between RWT groups (log-Rank:0.984, p: 0.32). Conclusion RWT has limited ability to predict 5-year mortality among patients with advanced stages of HF. Age emerged as the strongest independent predictor. RWT should be evaluated in conjunction with multiple clinical and laboratory parameters rather than in isolation when managing HF."
