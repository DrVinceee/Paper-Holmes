PubMed,aortic stenosis,Immediate changes in Left Ventricular Cardiac Mechanics following Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement for Severe Aortic Stenosis - an In-Vivo Pressure-Volume Analysis study.,Antoon J M van den Enden; Mark M P van den Dorpel; Giulio M Mondellini; Antonio M Mattace-Raso; Rik Adrichem; Marcello B Bastos; Jan J Schreuder; Mattie J Lenzen; Isabella Kardys; Marcel L Geleijnse; Rutger J Nuis; Joost Daemen; Daniel Burkhoff; Nicolas M Van Mieghem,10.1016/j.ahj.2025.107302,2025-11-13,American heart journal,"Severe aortic stenosis (AS) induces a disproportional pressure gradient across the aortic valve causing increased left ventricular (LV) afterload. Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement (TAVR) aims to immediately alleviate the aortic pressure gradient and thereby changing LV cardiac mechanics. The aim was to describe by in-vivo assessment of LV pressure-volume (PV) relationships how TAVR acutely affects LV cardiac mechanics.
In this prospective observational study in patients with severe AS, LV cardiac mechanics were evaluated with an LV conductance catheter before and after TAVR. The effects of transcatheter valve design, pre- and post-dilatation, use of rapid pacing (≥180 bpm) and LV ejection fraction (EF) were specifically addressed.
In-vivo LV PV reconstructions were obtained in 61 patients. Stroke work (SW) and pressure volume area (PVA) were significantly lower following TAVR (decrease from median (25th-75th percentile) of 10,935.6 (6,877.5-13,490.8) to 6,878.0 (4,870.8-8,613.8) mmHg/mL, p<0.001 and from 17,831.5 (12,414.9-22,416.8) to 11,024.9 (8,364.7-14,705.0) mmHg/mL, p<0.001, respectively) with stable SW/PVA ratios. Overall, end-systolic and end-diastolic pressures and volumes were significantly lower after TAVR. Arterial Elastance, as an index for LV afterload also decreased (2.66 (2.01-3.87) to 1.96 (1.25-2.72) mmHg/mL, p<0.001). LV contractility declined as illustrated by a reduction in End-systolic Elastance (2.22 (1.50-3.10) to 1.58 (1.08-2.43) mmHg/mL, p<0.001). The trends in changing LV cardiac mechanics were similar for balloon- and self-expanding valves and were not affected by pre/post dilatation, rapid pacing or LV EF.
TAVR for severe AS resulted in immediate LV unloading, lower myocardial metabolic demand and impaired contractility.

Advances,"Cardiac damage stage predicts clinical outcomes in severe aortic stenosis (AS), yet its validation in moderate AS and natural history preaortic valve replacement (AVR) and post-AVR is poorly understood.
This paper sought to: 1) determine whether index cardiac damage stage predicts cardiovascular outcomes in patients with moderate AS; and 2) describe the impact of AVR on cardiac damage stage over time.
This retrospective single-center cohort study stratified patients with moderate AS according to index cardiac damage stage. We assessed whether cardiac damage stage predicted a primary composite outcome of all-cause death and heart failure (HF) hospitalization and a secondary outcome of AVR. Changes in stage over time were also assessed.
Among 688 patients (median follow-up of 3.6 years), baseline cardiac damage stages 0, 1, 2, and 3 to 4 were evident in 25.1%, 24.1%, 41.6%, and 9.2%, respectively. Escalating baseline stage conferred an increased risk of the composite primary endpoint (incidence per 1,000 person years, stage 0: 52 [37, 72]; stage 1: 100 [77, 129], stage 2: 94 [77, 116]; stages 3 to 4: 255 [185, 352]; HR (95% CI); P < 0.001], which was mirrored in survival analyses (all-cause death and HF hospitalization: Plog-rank < 0.001). The net result of awaiting AVR (median time 3.1 years) was an accumulation of cardiac damage, which partially resolved at 1-year.
Cardiac damage stage is associated with an increasing risk of all-cause mortality and HF hospitalization in patients with moderate AS. The degree of damage accumulates as patients await AVR, which partially recovers post-AVR."

Without effective medical therapies, intervention mainly relies on timely valve replacement, although silent myocardial and valvular damage may progress before symptoms arise. Early, non-invasive detection of disease activity is a crucial unmet need.
To review circulating and mechanistic biomarkers reflecting the core pathogenic pathways of CAVD and asses their potential for early detection and patient-specific risk stratification.
Narrative review of literature focusing on traditional protein biomarkers, emerging non-coding RNAs, and extracellular vesicles (EVs) associated with lipid oxidation and inflammation, bone and mineral metabolism, extracellular matrix (ECM) remodelling, endothelial dysfunction and non-coding RNA regulation.
Traditional protein biomarkers-such as lipoprotein(a), osteopontin, fetuin-A, galectin-3 and matrix metalloproteinases-offer insights into the disease and correlate with disease burden but lack sensitivity for detecting early-stage CAVD. Emerging non-coding RNA markers, including long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) and microRNAs (like miR-30b and miR-125b), show promise as predictive and diagnostic tools by mediating key molecular pathways involved in calcification and inflammation. EVs, which carry proteins, lipids and nucleic acids across all pathogenic pathways, provide stable and comprehensive signatures that enhance risk stratification compared to conventional markers. Notably, no single biomarker has demonstrated sufficient sensitivity or specificity across all stages of the disease. Combining proteins, RNAs and EV cargo into integrative, multimodal panels-supported by proteomics and transcriptomics-provides the greatest potential for early detection and patient-specific management. However, further validation in prospective cohorts and standardization of assays are necessary before clinical implementation.
Biomarker-guided approaches could revolutionize CAVD management by enabling early detection and patient stratification before irreversible valvular damage occurs."

With recent clinical trials indicating that transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) is at least on par with surgical aortic valve replacement (SAVR) in treating lower risk patients, there has been a rise in TAVR uptake in younger, lower risk patients, leading to an increased likelihood of bioprosthetic valve degradation within a patient's lifetime. This shift in treatment has changed the landscape of interventional cardiology, incentivising the Heart Team to now plan for the initial procedure with subsequent interventions in mind. While traditional multi-slice computed tomography image-based risk assessments are sufficient for initial valve placement, they fall short in their ability to accurately predict post-procedural outcomes and future interventions. Therefore, the need to balance competing risks to optimise patient outcomes over multiple interventions requires innovation. CT-derived computational techniques are being developed to incorporate biomechanics and fluid dynamics into the risk assessment process to allow more comprehensive analysis of the risks associated with different procedures. The goal of this review is to provide an overview of computational techniques that are being developed for the purposes of optimising outcomes in both the index and valve-in-valve interventions and to give cardiologists an understanding of how they may use computational modelling as an additional tool in the lifetime management of aortic stenosis."

A multicentre cross-sectional study.
We analysed data from the Searching for Atrial Fibrillation and Early Recruitment of Heart Failure in HCM registry, collected between 2018 and 2023.
Patients with HCM (n=499) aged ≥18 years from 12 institutions (Shizuoka Prefecture, Japan) were consecutively enrolled.
Clinical parameters, along with data from a short form of the Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire (KCCQ-12), were collected. The association between each clinical parameter and the KCCQ-12 score was analysed. Clinical parameters with a significant univariable association (p<0.05) were used in a multiple regression model to investigate independent clinical parameters associated with the KCCQ-12 score. The coefficients and relative importance of each parameter included in the multiple regression model were also evaluated.
In the univariable analysis, KCCQ-12 scores exhibited significant associations with 21 clinical parameters, including sex, left ventricular morphology and the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI). The multiple regression model with 12 parameters that had a significant univariable association exhibited an adjusted R2 of 0.48. In this model, the PSQI (standardised coefficient -0.39; p<0.001), history of sustained ventricular tachycardia or fibrillation, history of atrial fibrillation (-0.23; p<0.001), female sex (-0.19; p=0.035), systolic blood pressure (0.17; p=0.040), lateral E/e prime (-0.17; p=0.049) and A wave (-0.14, p=0.049) were independently associated with the KCCQ-12 score with high relative importance.
In patients with HCM, we investigated the association between the KCCQ-12 score and various clinical parameters. PSQI, as well as known heart failure-related clinical parameters, was significantly associated with the KCCQ-12 score. Visualising the associations of various clinical parameters with the KCCQ-12 score will help physicians to consider factors linked to the decline in QOL in patients with HCM."

To explore what factors have led us to consider more than 50% of the global population special, we assessed access to transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) by sex on national and local levels and studied post-TAVI outcomes by sex within our centre.
Population statistics from census data were compared against British Cardiovascular Intervention Society (BCIS) audit and local data.Using the National Institute for Cardiovascular Outcomes Research TAVI database, a retrospective analysis of 1049 consecutive patients from 2013 to 2023 was conducted at our UK tertiary centre.Primary outcomes were all-cause death, a three-point composite of major adverse cardiac events (MACE) comprising death, non-fatal myocardial infarction and non-fatal stroke during TAVI admission, and post-TAVI survival.
Nationally, females comprise 60% of over 75-year-olds; however, TAVI was performed more frequently in males: nationally (55.2% vs 44.8%, p<0.01) and locally (53.2% vs 46.8%, p<0.01). Males were 1.82 times more likely to undergo TAVI.Locally, females undergoing TAVI were older and had worse renal function, higher frailty and greater transvalvular gradients. Males had more cardiovascular comorbidity.In-hospital mortality and MACE did not differ by sex. Median survival was longer in females (1350 days vs 1728 days, p=0.02). Regression analysis demonstrated female sex as a predictor of increased survival (HR 0.73, 95% CI 0.61 to 0.88, p<0.01). Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, atrial fibrillation, frailty and poor mobility were identified as predictors of reduced survival.
In this retrospective, observational study, we have demonstrated an under-representation of females undergoing TAVI. This observation is likely of multifactorial cause, including different disease recognition, referral, investigation and treatment practices.We observed no difference in procedural death or MACE, but longer female survival, despite higher baseline age, frailty and renal impairment."

Zeitschrift fur Gefasskrankheiten,"Background: Bilateral symptoms of peripheral artery disease may be rarely caused by isolated atherosclerotic aortic stenosis or short occlusion. Standard therapies have been open surgery, balloon angioplasty and implantation of selfexpanding stents and stentgrafts. Materials and methods: In this retrospective study 54 consecutive patients were treated under local anaesthesia with a balloon-expandable endograft. Endpoints were safety, ankle-brachial and toe-brachial index (ABI, TBI), walking distance, clinical stage and re-interventions at long-term. Results: There were 36 women and 18 men, mean age 68 years; 48 patients suffered from claudication, 6 patients had rest pain with skin lesions in 3 cases. The technical success rate was 100%. There was an immediate average improvement of ABI from 0.76 +/- 0.26 at rest before intervention to 0.88 +/- 0.31 at rest after stentgraft implantation into the aortic stenosis. TBI improved from 0.48 +/- 0.17 to 0.58 +/- 23 at rest. Mean follow-up was 1 to 8 years (mean 4.46) years. Average walking distance improved from 124 m to 612 m. Of the 6 patients with rest pain or skin lesions all except 1 patient improved to at least claudication stage with a painfree walking distance over 200 m. No complications such as aortic rupture, dissection or peripheral embolisation occurred, 2 patients needed surgical revision of their calcified common femoral arteries at the access sites. Three patients developed at long-term recurrent stenosis due to the compression of stentgrafts by the calcified plaque burden which was solved by balloon angioplasty or implantation of an additional aortic stentgraft. Conclusions: Endovascular treatment of aortic stenosis or occlusion is feasible under local anaesthesia with good functional results, very low mortality and morbidity and durable results."

While transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) has shown early advantages over surgical aortic valve replacement (SAVR) in women, long-term sex-specific outcomes remain unclear. To evaluate outcomes at 5 years comparing TAVR versus SAVR a systematic review and meta-analysis was performed.
A systematic literature review was conducted, identifying all randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing TAVR with SAVR which included women with completed 5-year follow-up. The primary outcome was the composite of all-cause mortality or disabling stroke. Meta-analysis was performed using both random-effects and fixed-effect models. The study protocol was registered in PROSPERO (CRD420251004394).
Six RCTs were included with a total of 3,094 women (1,587 TAVR and 1,507 SAVR). Overall, no significant difference was observed in the primary outcome between TAVR and SAVR (Incidence Rate Ratios [IRR] 1.00, 95% Confidence Interval [CI]: 0.88-1.13, p = 0.98). Meta-regression did not find any association between key clinical covariates and the primary outcome. Trial sequential analysis demonstrated that the extracted sample size met the required information size, but a definitive treatment effect was not confirmed.
While TAVR shows an advantage over SAVR at 1-year follow-up in women, all-cause mortality or disabling stroke are similar in TAVR and SAVR at 5 years. Future studies must include sex-disaggregated reporting of both primary and secondary outcomes in order to comprehensively weigh risks and benefits of each intervention and inform personalized treatment strategies.

We retrospectively reviewed patients who underwent ARR (VSRR or Bentall) between 2002 and 2023, excluding those with aortic stenosis, prior AVR, endocarditis, or partial root replacement. Patients were categorized as single-clamp VSRR (S-VSRR, n=251), multiple-clamp VSRR (M-VSRR, n=16), failed VSRR (F-VSRR, n=10), and primary Bentall (n=548).
VSRR was unsuccessful, or required multiple cross-clamp attempts in 9.4% of cases. Failure occurred in 1.0% of aneurysm and 2.5% of dissection cases (p=0.28). Bentall patients were older (58 ± 14 years) than S-VSRR (48.2 ± 14.2 years) and M-VSRR (48 ± 13 years; p < 0.01). Preoperative severe AR was most frequent in F-VSRR (70%). Preservation succeeded in 83% with moderate-to-severe AR versus 89% with none-to-mild AR. Leaflet repair was more common in M-VSRR (43.8%) than S-VSRR (19.5%; p=0.02). In unadjusted analysis, F-VSRR was associated with more bleeding-related reoperations and longer ICU and hospital stays. At follow-up, 85.6% of S-VSRR and 68.7% of M-VSRR had none-to-mild AR. Mortality and reoperation rates were low across groups.
VSRR was technically challenging or unsuccessful in about 10% of cases, especially with advanced AR.

However, other mechanisms contributing to mitral regurgitation may coexist as a result of further structural abnormalities. SAM might occur because of the increased septal thickness alone or due to simultaneous MV or subvalvular apparatus anomalies, such as mitral leaflet elongation, papillary muscle body anomalies, accessory papillary muscles or additional papillary muscle heads. Additionally, anomalous mitral chordae or the recently described mitral-aortic discontinuity (leading to a longer anterior mitral leaflet (AML)) can contribute to abnormal physiology. A closed aortomitral angle may also contribute. During intraoperative echocardiographic assessment, it is important to thoroughly evaluate the MV and the regurgitant jet to understand the mechanism(s) that cause MR in HCM patients. Although myectomy alone is frequently enough to correct SAM, concomitant MV procedures may be needed, especially when the septum is thin (<16-18 mm) and/or there is intrinsic MV disease. Detection of concomitant regurgitation mechanisms beyond SAM can eventually be identified preoperatively, either by direct structural detection (valve prolapse), by pharmacological palliation of SAM with vasopressors and negative inotropic agents or suspected by identification of anteriorly and centrally directed regurgitant mitral jets. Surgical techniques that can be employed to contribute to SAM elimination include plication/extension/retention plasty of the AML, resection/release/reorientation of papillary muscles, division of anomalous chordae, edge-to-edge repair, or, at times, prosthetic MV replacement. If there is structural MV disease concomitant to HCM, appropriately tailored techniques to address the MV may be used. Transoesophageal echocardiography at the end of the procedure should demonstrate elimination of SAM, resolution of LVOT obstruction, and appropriate coaptation of the MV leaflets and nearly resolution of MR. Provocation with inotropes can be used to ensure no latent obstruction persists."

Case reports,"Double aortic arch (DAA) is a rare congenital vascular anomaly that is typically diagnosed in infancy. In adult patients undergoing transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR), an undetected DAA can present unique anatomical and procedural challenges.
A 71-year-old woman with end-stage renal disease and severe aortic stenosis was incidentally found to have a DAA during preprocedural TAVR evaluation. The device was inserted via the right femoral artery, as it provided the largest vessel diameter and most favorable anatomy for device passage. The pronounced curvature of the aortic arch created an unfavorable anatomy that hindered advancement of the delivery system, even with multiple attempts using a double-stiff wire technique. Ultimately, a snare-assisted approach enabled successful navigation and valve deployment. The patient later developed postprocedural stroke, and the use of cerebral embolic protection was limited by her complex arch anatomy.
This case highlights the critical role of comprehensive imaging and individualized procedural planning in managing rare vascular anomalies during TAVR. It provides practical insight into overcoming severe arch tortuosity with snare-assisted techniques, offering educational value for interventionalists encountering similar structural challenges.
Snare-assisted techniques offer a practical solution for TAVR in patients with complex arch anatomy when standard approaches fail."

Cardiothoracic imaging,"Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) requires multimodality imaging for accurate diagnosis, risk assessment, and management strategies. Echocardiography serves as the primary imaging tool, evaluating left ventricular wall thickness, outflow tract gradients, and mitral valve morphology. It provides essential diagnostic information and guides treatment decisions, with stress echocardiography particularly valuable for detecting dynamic gradients in obstructive HCM and supporting preoperative planning for interventions such as myectomy. Cardiovascular MRI complements echocardiography through superior resolution, enabling detailed assessment of myocardial mass, flow dynamics, and comprehensive tissue characterization. Late gadolinium enhancement and extracellular volume measurements enhance prognostic evaluation and risk stratification. Cardiac MRI excels at helping distinguish HCM from phenocopies like infiltrative or storage diseases and detecting myocardial disarray, microvascular dysfunction, and abnormalities in myocardial metabolism. Nuclear imaging proves crucial for identifying HCM phenocopies, including transthyretin amyloidosis and sarcoidosis, providing specific diagnostic capabilities. Cardiac CT, while having a secondary diagnostic role, becomes invaluable for evaluating coronary anatomy in patients considered for septal reduction therapies, ensuring comprehensive preoperative assessment. This integrated multimodal approach provides comprehensive HCM evaluation, enabling precise diagnosis, robust risk stratification, and individualized treatment planning. Each modality contributes unique strengths that collectively enhance clinical decision-making and optimize patient outcomes in this complex myocardial disease.

We report the case of a male patient in his 70s with recurrent melena and profound anemia requiring multiple transfusions. Extensive initial investigations, including gastroscopy and colonoscopy, failed to identify a bleeding source. The diagnosis was suspected after echocardiography confirmed critical AS and was later confirmed by capsule endoscopy, which revealed bleeding small bowel angiodysplasia. Instead of pursuing direct endoscopic treatment of the angiodysplasia, the decision was made to address the underlying cause with transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI). Following the procedure, the patient's hemoglobin stabilized, and subsequent enteroscopy confirmed resolution of the angiodysplasia. This case highlights that in patients with AS and obscure GIB, maintaining a high index of suspicion for Heyde's syndrome is crucial. It demonstrates that timely intervention with TAVI can serve as a definitive treatment by resolving the bleeding diathesis through correction of the shear-stress platelet insult and underscores the importance of a multidisciplinary approach between cardiology and gastroenterology to achieve optimal patient outcomes."

However, catheter malposition and inadequate venting are not uncommon because of limited visibility. Although transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) can assist in catheter monitoring, TEE-guided management strategies remain underreported. This study aimed to characterize catheter-related issues and describe effective troubleshooting approaches.
We retrospectively analyzed intraoperative TEE findings in 304 patients who underwent open-heart surgery at Kochi University Hospital, including 200 with LV venting and 104 with LA venting. TEE records of catheter-related events and corrective maneuvers were reviewed, and challenges in TEE assessment were identified.
No catheter-related injuries were observed. In the LV group, TEE identified failure of ventricular entry (n = 5), impingement on papillary muscles or the apex (n = 18), and catheter-induced mitral regurgitation (n = 11). Residual air was frequently localized distant from the catheter tip. In the LA group, misplacement into pulmonary veins (n = 9) or the left atrial appendage (LAA) (n = 2) was noted. Venting was ineffective in cases of acute LV distension during antegrade cardioplegia or due to Thebesian venous return. In some cases, deep catheter placement resulted in incomplete drainage of the right-sided LA.
Both LA and LV venting have distinct pitfalls. TEE facilitates identification and correction of catheter-related problems, but structured training in TEE assessment is essential to optimize outcomes."

We evaluated the clinical utility of the 6MWD by quantifying the gap between the expected and observed physical performance and estimating its determinants.
Outpatients with wild-type (ATTRwt)-CM were investigated. Standardized echocardiographic, laboratory and clinical assessments were performed. A regression formula derived from a healthy local population sample was applied to predict the expected 6MWD. Associations with 6MWD were analyzed by linear regression, adjusted for age and height. Explanatory multivariable models using backward elimination, regularization and clinical reasoning were calculated.
100 patients were analyzed. Their mean age was 78.7 (6.3) years and 86% were men. The mean observed 6MWD was 310 (113) m, which corresponded to about 65% of the expected performance. Significant predictors of the 6MWD were (ordered by decreasing explanatory power): high-sensitivity Troponin T, NT-proBNP, NAC disease stage, estimated glomerular filtration rate, atrial fibrillation, hemoglobin, hepatic vein dilation, mitral E-wave maximum velocity, left ventricular ejection fraction, and the tricuspid valve maximal regurgitation pressure gradient. Multivariable models yielded an R² of up to 45.9% with a root mean squared error of 82.9 m.
Physical performance as measured by the 6MWD in patients with ATTRwt-CM was remarkably compromised. Laboratory and imaging markers indicative of disease severity and congestion predicted the 6MWD in these patients. Cardiovascular markers explained a fair amount of 6MWD variability."

Case reports,"Degenerative mitral regurgitation (DMR) is associated with substantial morbidity and mortality if left untreated. While surgical repair remains the gold standard, mitral transcatheter edge-to-edge repair (M-TEER) is an established alternative for patients at high surgical risk. However, recurrent MR after initial M-TEER remains a therapeutic challenge and is associated with poor outcomes.
A 77-year-old patient presented with recurrent heart failure symptoms due to MR after prior CARILLON® device implantation for secondary MR at an external hospital in September 2019. Transoesophageal echocardiography revealed degenerative mitral valve disease characterized by a complex combination of posterior leaflet prolapse and anterior leaflet flail, resulting in a severe eccentric regurgitant jet.The patient underwent successful M-TEER with the MitraClip® system in December 2021. In June 2023, the patient was re-hospitalized for recurrent heart failure symptoms. Imaging revealed severe recurrent MR originating lateral to the implanted device. A redo M-TEER was performed using the PASCAL® system, requiring careful navigation through a narrow residual lateral orifice. The procedure resulted in a durable reduction to mild MR with sustained clinical stability at 18-month follow-up.
This case illustrates the anatomical challenges of DMR and demonstrates the feasibility and durability of redo M-TEER in high surgical risk patients with recurrent MR. It emphasizes the importance of individualized anatomical assessment and tailored device selection in complex valve anatomies."

Transcatheter edge-to-edge repair (TEER) is a viable treatment, but its long-term survival impact, particularly across sexes, remains underexplored. We aimed to assess relative survival (RS) and excess mortality (EM) in patients undergoing TEER for significant MR, with a focus on sex-based differences. Methods: We analyzed 253 patients treated with TEER between October 2015 and August 2024, stratified by sex. Observed survival (OS) was calculated using the actuarial life table method; expected survival (ES) was estimated via the Ederer II method using matched population data. Primary endpoints were RS and EM; secondary endpoints included mortality differences by MR subtype. Results: OS at 1, 2, and 3 years was 88.9%, 87.4%, and 78.9%, respectively. EM peaked in the first year (7.8%) and declined thereafter. RS was lower than in the general population, primarily due to persistently reduced RS and elevated EM in men. Women achieved RS comparable to matched peers from year one. Sex was not an independent predictor of mortality (HR 0.88, 95% CI 0.38-2.03, p = 0.771). Conclusions: In patients with significant MR undergoing TEER, EM was concentrated in the first year. Women reached RS comparable to the general population, while men showed persistent excess mortality. Sex was not independently associated with survival after adjustment."

Its prevalence and prognostic significance in athletes remain uncertain, raising important questions for pre-participation screening, eligibility for competition, and long-term follow-up. Methods: We systematically searched PubMed, Scopus, and EMBASE databases from inception through August 2025 for original studies reporting MVP prevalence in athletes, diagnosed by echocardiography or pathological assessment. Data on study characteristics, diagnostic definitions, prevalence, arrhythmias, and outcomes were independently extracted by three reviewers. Methodological quality was appraised using the National Institutes of Health Quality Assessment Tool for Observational Cohort and Cross-Sectional Studies. Results: Twelve studies published between 1987 and 2024 met inclusion criteria, enrolling 19,463 athletes from diverse sports and competitive levels. A total of 407 MVP cases were identified, corresponding to a crude pooled prevalence of 2.4%. Prevalence estimates varied substantially (0.2-20%), reflecting heterogeneity in study populations and diagnostic definitions. When all studies were pooled using a random-effects model, the overall prevalence was 2.0% (95% CI 1.2-2.8%). A sensitivity analysis restricted to contemporary, unselected athletic cohorts yielded a prevalence of 1.1% (95% CI 0.4-1.9%), closely aligning with population-based estimates. Ventricular arrhythmias were more frequent than supraventricular arrhythmias, particularly in association with bileaflet prolapse, leaflet thickening, or significant mitral regurgitation. Most athletes were asymptomatic, and only one prospective study provided long-term follow-up, confirming a generally benign prognosis, though rare adverse events (atrial fibrillation, valve surgery) were documented. Conclusions: MVP is relatively uncommon in athletes and occurs at rates similar to the general population. In most cases, prognosis is favorable and should not preclude sports participation. Nonetheless, recognition of high-risk phenotypes with arrhythmogenic potential highlights the need for individualized evaluation and tailored surveillance strategies in sports cardiology practice."

This case highlights the critical need for early diagnosis and intervention. An 18-year-old female presented with orthopnea, low-grade fever, chest tightness, and pulmonary edema. She had experienced dyspnea, weight loss, recurrent abdominal pain, and chronic anemia over the past six months. Examination revealed congested lungs, sweating, tachycardia, and laboratory findings indicative of inflammation. Echocardiography identified multiple obstructing masses in the left atrium moving into the left ventricle during diastole, causing severe mitral regurgitation. Imaging revealed old infarcts in the brain, liver, and spleen. Blood cultures were positive for Enterococcus faecalis, and empirical antibiotics were initiated. Urgent surgery was performed, including left atrial myxoma resection, mitral valve replacement with a bioprosthetic valve, left atrial appendage closure, and closure of the interatrial septum. Postoperative echocardiography confirmed normal left ventricular function and a well-functioning bioprosthetic mitral valve. The patient tolerated the procedure well and was discharged on a regimen of oral antibiotics for six weeks.
Infected cardiac myxomas, though rare, pose significant risks due to their potential for systemic embolization and severe complications. This case emphasizes the necessity of comprehensive diagnostic evaluation and timely surgical intervention to prevent catastrophic outcomes.
This case underscores the importance of a multidisciplinary approach and early surgical intervention in managing complex cases of infected cardiac myxoma with systemic embolization. Our findings reinforce the need for vigilance in diagnosing and treating such rare but life-threatening conditions."

Mitral Transcatheter edge-to-edge repair (M-TEER) has become a groundbreaking treatment option for high-risk patients ineligible for conventional surgery, with the MitraClip system standing as the most widely validated and utilized device in this field.
This study aimed to evaluate the immediate procedural outcomes and long-term clinical results of MitraClip interventions in Turkish patients with secondary mitral regurgitation. The primary objectives were to determine the rate of procedural success according to standardized Mitral Valve Academic Research Consortium (MVARC) criteria and to assess the proportion of patients achieving optimal mitral regurgitation reduction (MR ≤ 1+) at hospital discharge. The secondary objectives were to identify independent clinical, echocardiographic, and procedural predictors associated with rehospitalization for heart failure and all-cause mortality during follow-up, and to evaluate the durability of mitral regurgitation reduction and functional improvement over the medium-term follow-up period.
This retrospective study included 140 Turkish patients with moderate-to-severe (grade 3+) or severe (grade 4+) SMR who underwent MitraClip treatment between 2021 and 2024, with a median follow-up of 23.5 months (interquartile range [IQR]: 14.0–27.0). MR severity was assessed by comprehensive echocardiographic evaluation according to current guidelines, and post-procedure MR was classified as ≤ 1 + or > 1 + for outcome analyses.
The study population had a median age of 75.0 (IQR: 68.0–78.0) years, with 42.9% being female. Procedural success according to MVARC criteria was achieved in 137 patients (97.9%), while MR ≤ 1 + at discharge was observed in 95 patients (67.9%). During follow-up, 56.4% of patients required rehospitalization, and the mortality rate was 7.1%. Significant improvement in functional capacity was observed, with 88.6% of patients improving by at least one New York Heart Association (NYHA) functional class at 1-month follow-up (from 100% NYHA class III-IV at baseline to 11.4% class III, 70.0% class II, and 18.6% class I post-procedure). Multivariate analysis revealed that estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) (Hazard ratio [HR] 0.95, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.91–0.99, p = 0.03), atrial fibrillation (HR 1.62, 95% CI: 1.02–2.57, p = 0.04), and post-procedure MR severity (MR grade > 1 + vs. ≤1+) (HR 1.73, 95% CI: 1.13–2.65, p = 0.01) were associated with rehospitalization. Mortality risk was associated with lower hemoglobin (HR 0.92, 95% CI: 0.86–0.99, p = 0.04), and severe MR (HR 2.54, 95% CI: 1.09–5.92, p = 0.03).
MitraClip intervention demonstrated high procedural success rates in Turkish patients with SMR, leading to significant reduction in MR severity and improvement in NYHA functional class. While rehospitalization and mortality rates aligned with previous studies, specific clinical factors were identified as being associated with clinical outcomes.

The aim of this study was to understand M-TEER outcomes stratified by the extent of EMCD.
One-year outcomes from the randomized CLASP IID (Edwards PASCAL Transcatheter Valve Repair System Pivotal Clinical Trial) trial (NCT03706833) in prohibitive surgical risk patients with 3+ or 4+ DMR were analyzed by baseline EMCD stages (stage 0, no EMCD; stage 1, left ventricular remodeling; stage 2, left atrial remodeling; stage 3, pulmonary hypertension and/or tricuspid regurgitation; stage 4, right ventricular dysfunction).
The analysis included 211 patients: 53.1% in stages 0, 1, and 2 (n = 112), 13.3% in stage 3 (n = 28), and 33.6% in stage 4 (n = 71). Stages 0, 1, and 2 were combined because there were few patients in stage 0 (n = 3) and stage 1 (n = 1). At baseline, patients with more advanced cardiac damage had more comorbidities, lower functional and quality-of-life measures, and greater mitral regurgitation severity. One-year rates of clinical events among all stages were comparable for major adverse events (P = 0.343) and all-cause mortality (P = 0.644) and significantly different for heart failure hospitalization (P = 0.012). Patients in all stages achieved comparable echocardiographic and quality-of-life improvements at 1 year, including mitral regurgitation ≤1+ (P = 0.474), left ventricular diastolic (P = 0.619) and systolic (P = 0.676) volumes, and Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire score (P = 0.335), with significant improvements from baseline (P < 0.05 vs baseline for all).

From August 2022 through April 2024, forty patients with unsuccessful SRTs who underwent TA-BSM were matched 1:3 to patients having TA-BSM as only invasive procedure for oHCM. The primary outcome was procedural success, defined as resting/provoked left ventricular outflow tract (LVOT) gradient < 30/50 mmHg and mitral regurgitation (MR) grade ≤1+ (of 4+) at 3-month follow-up.
Patients with prior SRT had higher incidences of preoperative right (20% vs. 4%) and left bundle branch block (10% vs. 2%) and non-sustained ventricular tachycardia (20% vs. 3%). At 3-month follow-up, procedural success was achieved in 34 (85%) patients with prior SRT and 106 (88%) with primary TA-BSM. Resting LVOT gradient was significantly reduced in both prior SRT (17 vs. 79 mmHg) and primary TA-BSM groups (13 vs. 73 mmHg). Mitral regurgitation improved (achieving ≤grade 1+) in 36 (90%) of 40 patients in the prior SRT group and in 111 (92%) of 120 patients in the primary TA-BSM group (P = 0.75). In addition, the quality of life was significantly improved following surgery.
TA-BSM with intraoperative real-time transesophageal echocardiographic guidance can provide satisfactory outcomes in oHCM patients. Equipoise of outcomes following TA-BSM supports its application in symptomatic patients after all types of failed SRT."

Myocardial work derived from noninvasive pressure-strain loop is a novel and promising afterload-independent approach to evaluate LV performance. We hypothesized that it may provide diagnostic and prognostic utility in these patients. This study aimed to evaluate myocardial work parameters in patients with significant primary mitral regurgitation, and explore their association with postinterventional LV ejection fraction and clinical composite events.
The study prospectively enrolled 180 patients with severe primary mitral regurgitation at baseline and patients were followed up for postinterventional LV function (>12 months) and clinical events (24.0 [23.3-24.6] months). Logistic regression and Cox proportional hazards regression analyses were performed as appropriate.
Compared with patients exhibiting postinterventional LV ejection fraction ≥50%, individuals with LV ejection fraction <50% demonstrated lower LV global longitudinal strain, global work index (GWI), global constructive work (GCW), and global work efficiency (P<0.001 for all) and higher global wasted work (P=0.001). Preinterventional LV global longitudinal strain, GWI, GCW, and global work efficiency were independent predictors of postinterventional LV dysfunction (P<0.05 for all). The predictive power of logistic regression models comprising LV global longitudinal strain, GWI, and GCW were similar but stronger than the model comprising LV ejection fraction. Preinterventional LV global longitudinal strain, GWI, GCW, and global work efficiency were independently associated with the risk of composite clinical events during follow-up (P<0.001 for all).
Myocardial work parameters, especially GWI, GCW, and global work efficiency, are independent predictors of postinterventional LV dysfunction and are associated with the occurrence of postinterventional clinical composite events."

Mitral transcatheter edge-to-edge repair (M-TEER) is an established intervention for severe mitral regurgitation in human patients and has recently emerged as a promising intervention in dogs. The prospect of a minimally invasive intervention for dogs is a breakthrough development and simultaneously raises important questions of procedural timing, documenting benefit vs. risk, and outcomes compared to surgical repair or medical therapy alone. The evolution of M-TEER in humans has been documented through early feasibility studies, randomized clinical trials comparing M-TEER to medical therapy or surgical repair, and national and international registries. This review focuses on M-TEER technologies, patient selection, procedural performance, and outcomes in humans and dogs. A major goal of this review is to draw upon the extensive human experience as potentially useful in guiding the rollout in dogs and to review the many lessons learned in the human experience that may be relevant to M-TEER in dogs."

This study proposes a deep learning model for segmentation of knee articular cartilage in conventional proton density fat-saturated MRI sequences to assess cartilage morphology for subsequent injury grading.
This retrospective study was conducted at two radiology centers, involving 254 knees from 254 patients who had previously undergone MRI scans. The training-internal validation cohort included 219 knees from Center 1. The external validation cohort comprised 35 knees from Center 2. Two musculoskeletal radiology experts manually annotated the cartilage regions. A 3D Res U-net model was employed for segmentation, and its performance was compared with 3D U-net and 3D V-net models. Segmentation results were evaluated using the Dice coefficient and Jaccard index.
The 3D Res U-net model demonstrated superior segmentation performance compared to the other deep learning methods. For cartilage in the lateral femorotibial joint, medial femorotibial joint, and patellofemoral joint, the average Dice coefficients with 3D Res U-net were 0.871, 0.860, and 0.858 in internal validation and 0.846, 0.837, and 0.819 in external validation, respectively. The Jaccard index followed a similar trend.
The 3D Res U-net model improves knee cartilage segmentation in conventional MR imaging, contributing to the understanding of cartilage morphology and the improvement of clinically relevant decisions."

Digital health,"Artificial intelligence (AI) is on the verge of reshaping cancer diagnostics through integration into digital pathology workflows. Despite the progression of AI towards real-world deployment, challenges in interpretability, validation, and clinical integration persist. AI models support the interpretation of stains including haematoxylin and eosin, enabling tumour classification, grading, and biomarker quantification, with clinical applications for targets such as HER2 and PD-L1. In addition, AI models enable the quantification of subtle microscopic patterns with prognostic and predictive values across tumour types. Herein, we provide an overview of the applications of AI in pathology and address emerging regulatory and ethical considerations. We also discuss the disparities in adoption across care settings and emphasise the importance of validation, human oversight, and post-deployment monitoring for the responsible implementation of AI in pathology-driven workflows. Furthermore, we highlight the technical advancements driving these developments, particularly the transition from hand-crafted machine learning workflows to deep learning, self-supervised learning for foundation models, multimodal models, and agentic AI."

Accurate identification of phase-separating proteins is therefore essential for elucidating the molecular mechanisms underlying these condensates. We present PhaseNet, a dual-task computational framework designed to both distinguish LLPS proteins from non-LLPS proteins and classify LLPS proteins into self-assembling (PS-Self) and partner-dependent (PS-Part) categories. In the first task, PhaseNet integrates features from pretrained protein language models (ESM), sequence encodings (ZSCALE and BLOSUM), and a modular architecture combining CNN-BiGRU and multi-head attention mechanisms. These heterogeneous features are fused using an attention-guided strategy and optimized with HSIC-based regularization to enhance discriminative performance. For the second task, PhaseNet employs Lasso-based feature selection on ESM-derived embeddings, followed by a stacking ensemble of five classifiers: Random Forest, Extra Trees, GBDT, XGBoost, and MLP. Comprehensive benchmarking across multiple independent test sets demonstrates that PhaseNet surpasses existing LLPS predictors in both general identification and fine-grained classification. This modular and interpretable framework offers a robust tool for the systematic discovery and annotation of phase-separating proteins."

We present the first study to classify stages of retinal degeneration in a well-established preclinical model using both optical coherence tomography (OCT) and histological images, and to predict visual acuity from OCT images. The Royal College of Surgeon's (RCS) rat, a widely used and well-characterized model of retinal degeneration, was used. Starting postnatal day (P) 21, 35 rats of both sexes were tested for visual acuity, OCT, and histology at defined time points. OCT (n=62,070) and histological (n=16,306) images were split into training, validation, and testing sets. A ResNet18 model was trained and compared against human observer classification. Paired OCT and visual acuity data were used to train a predictive model. This study reveals that ResNet18 classify retinal degeneration stages from OCT images with 95.95% accuracy (F1 = 94.93%) and histological images with 90.71% accuracy (F1 = 91.57%), performing comparably to human observers. Visual acuity was predicted from OCT images with a mean squared error of 0.011 and mean absolute error of 0.069. Deep learning enables accurate and objective classification of retinal degeneration stages from multimodal imaging and can predict functional outcomes. This framework, validated in a preclinical model, establishes a path for AI-based, cross-species monitoring of retinal degeneration and therapeutic response over time."

Computed tomography (CT), valued for non-invasive, high-resolution imaging, is essential for identifying bone metastatic lesions. However, these small, morphologically diverse, low-contrast lesions, combined with complex tumor microenvironments and computational limitations, challenge deep learning models' accuracy and real-time applicability. We propose BM-DETR, a Transformer-based model integrating spatial-contextual enhancement module (SCEM) to enhance low-contrast lesion features through channel attention and spatial mixing, AttentionUpsample for superior multi-scale feature fusion via dual-branch upsampling, and dilated transformer attention block (DTAB) to improve contextual modeling, addressing transformer limitations in local detail capture while optimizing efficiency. Evaluated on OsteoScan dataset, BM-DETR achieves mAP50 of 0.9376, and on BMSeg dataset, mAP50 of 0.9139, surpassing state-of-the-art methods. Balancing high accuracy with computational efficiency, BM-DETR's potential for edge deployment supports early screening and intelligent diagnosis of bone metastases.

This study employed terahertz time-domain spectra and absorption spectra coupled with three machine learning algorithms-Random Forest (RF), Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Deep Neural Network (DNN)-for the classification and identification of five spices (garlic, green pepper, Zanthoxylum bungeanum, Toona sinensis, and Qin pepper) as well as their binary mixtures. For single-component spices, all three models achieved classification accuracies exceeding 95% for both time-domain and absorption spectra. Among these models, the SVM model exhibited the best performance, with accuracies of 96.82% for time-domain spectra and 98.75% for absorption spectra. When classifying binary mixtures, models based on time-domain spectra significantly outperformed those based on absorption spectra. Notably, the DNN model demonstrated superior capability in this context, achieving an accuracy of 94.97% for the green pepper-Zanthoxylum bungeanum mixture. To further improve classification accuracy, an innovative multimodal classification model integrating time-domain and absorption spectra was developed. This multimodal model achieved an outstanding accuracy of 98.85%. Collectively, these results confirmed the effectiveness of terahertz spectroscopy combined with machine learning for spice identification, thereby providing robust technical support for nondestructive testing and quality monitoring in the global spice industry."

A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis.,Stephen Hilkia Pramatya; Dija Melati Sastri; Citrawati Dyah Kencono Wungu; Herley Windo Setiawan; Indah Mohd Amin; Muhammad Febian Zufar; Ahmad Nur Fikri Abror,10.1016/j.rmed.2025.108492,2025-11-13,Respiratory medicine,"Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer death worldwide. Because predicting benefit from immunotherapy in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) remains difficult, we conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis evaluating the prognostic accuracy of AI models-using radiomic, genomic, and proteomic data-to predict overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) in immunotherapy-treated NSCLC.
Following PRISMA 2020, we searched PubMed, SAGE, Taylor & Francis, EBSCOhost, and Preprints.org for studies using AI (machine or deep learning) to predict OS and/or PFS in immunotherapy-treated NSCLC. Hazard ratios (HRs) with 95% CIs were pooled using fixed- or random-effects models according to heterogeneity, with subgroup analyses by data modality and AI approach.
Twenty-three studies comprising 19,189 patients were included. High-risk groups identified by AI models had significantly poorer OS (pooled HR = 2.33, 95% CI: 2.13-2.56; I2 = 65%; p < 0.00001) and PFS (pooled HR = 2.95, 95% CI: 2.31-3.77; I2 = 75%; p < 0.00001). Among modalities, proteomic data provided the highest prognostic accuracy for OS (HR = 6.16, 95% CI: 2.03-18.70; I2 = 0%). Deep learning approaches consistently outperformed traditional machine learning models.
AI, especially proteomic/genomic approaches, strongly stratifies survival after NSCLC immunotherapy; deep learning's superior accuracy highlights its promise for precision oncology.
AI-driven prognostic models, particularly those utilizing proteomic and genomic data with deep learning architectures, show strong predictive capability in NSCLC immunotherapy outcomes. Future work should focus on prospective validation, standardization of AI methods, and multicenter trials to support the clinical integration."

Single-beat myocardial tagging in exercise cardiovascular magnetic resonance (Ex-CMR) enables assessment of myocardial deformation at both rest and during exercise. In this study, we developed the myocardial torsional reserve (MTR), a quantitative metric of exercise-induced rotational deformation, and evaluated its potential as a marker of abnormal myocardial mechanics in patients with overt or exercise-induced heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF).
Free-breathing balanced steady-state free precession single-beat tagging images were acquired at rest and post-exercise (stress). Apical and basal rotation angles were measured at end-systole in short-axis planes relative to an equilibrium configuration. Torsion was defined as the difference between basal and apical rotation normalized by the distance between slices. MTR was defined as the ratio of stress to rest torsion. We retrospectively analyzed data from 94 participants of a prospective multicenter study who underwent 3T Ex-CMR using a supine ergometer. All patients underwent invasive exercise testing before Ex-CMR. Established invasive thresholds defined patient cohorts. Intra- and inter-observer repeatability of image analysis was evaluated using the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC). Group differences in MTR were analyzed using ANOVA with post hoc comparisons.
After excluding 27 participants due to arrhythmias, rest and stress slice misalignment, or triggering issues, 67 participants were included: 24 healthy controls, 17 with non-cardiac dyspnea, 15 with exercise-induced HFpEF, and 11 with overt HFpEF. MTR measurement was successful in 76% of cases without arrhythmias and demonstrated good to excellent repeatability: inter-observer ICC=0.90 [0.70, 0.97] and intra-observer ICC=0.95 [0.83, 0.98]. MTR was equally reduced in exercise-induced HFpEF (1.1±0.1) and overt HFpEF (1.2±0.2) compared to healthy controls (1.7±0.4, p<0.01 for each comparison) and to patients with non-cardiac dyspnea (1.6±0.4; p<0.001 and p<0.01, respectively). MTR was comparable between healthy controls and non-cardiac dyspnea patients (p=0.978).
Ex-CMR-derived MTR enables quantification of exercise-induced rotational deformation and mechanical reserve through single-beat myocardial tagging. In a pilot clinical study, MTR values distinguished patients with exercise-induced or overt HFpEF from individuals with non-cardiac dyspnea or healthy controls, supporting its potential utility as a marker of abnormal myocardial response to exercise."

The method was developed for systems with a relatively stable spatial distribution, such as event related potentials (ERP)-based systems. The method's correctness and its ability to detect patterns in electroencephalography (EEG) data were evaluated through two separate studies. The first study aimed to confirm the method's reliability under conditions where the regions of interest (ROIs) were precisely known and directly observable both in the raw data and in individual saliency maps. The second study, more exploratory in nature, revealed coherent and medically interpretable ROIs that were not visible in the measurement data and nearly absent from individual saliency maps. In that study, the averagedLIME successfully uncovered general patterns that would otherwise remain hidden. To further contextualize the proposed approach, we compared the interpretability results obtained with averagedLIME against those produced by two widely used reference techniques - SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) and Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping (Grad-CAM). The results demonstrated that averagedLIME yielded more consistent and generalizable activation patterns compared to these reference approaches. The obtained results further support the hypothesis that under certain conditions (relatively stable spatial distribution), the averaged saliency maps can support more general interpretations of CNN model behavior than individual maps. Thus, the averagedLIME method has the potential to significantly enhance the transparency of deep learning-based systems in neuro-informatics and diagnostic applications."

However, knowledge about their interacting proteins is limited since reliable identification methods are lacking. We developed an integrated approach combining thermal proteome profiling (TPP) and deep transfer learning (DTL) modeling to efficiently identify cellular targets of PFAS. TPP measured PFAS binding proteins and the affinities by nanospray liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry, while DTL models were constructed to predict PFAS-protein affinities using neural network algorithms. TPP results revealed that PFASs uniquely destabilized the proteome of HepG2 cells, unlike the stabilizing effects by other xenobiotics. Key protein targets for three representative PFASs (PFOA, GenX and Novec 649) were identified, which exhibited weak binding affinities (median EC50 ≈ 30 μM). The number of protein targets increased with molecular weights among the three PFASs. The DTL model achieved a higher Pearson correlation coefficient of 0.89, and reduced mean squared errors by 54 % over previous models for drug-protein interactions. Notably, TPP and DTL jointly pinpointed ribosomal proteins as novel targets of GenX, potentially linking it to cell apoptosis through disrupted protein synthesis. Biolayer interferometry validated GenX binding to RPL4 protein, driven by electrostatic interactions and halogen bonds. This integrated approach effectively uncovers novel PFASs targets, advancing insights into their adverse health effects."

A DL approach along with the Tada formula and manual delineation were employed to quantify the volume of traumatic intracerebral haemorrhage (n = 141). In a separate cohort of patients with cerebral contusion oedema, participants were divided into high-risk (n = 56) and low-risk (n = 66) subgroups according to the Glasgow outcome scale at 21 days. The volume of haematoma was calculated using the aforementioned DL approach. A model integrating haematoma and oedema was developed, referred to as the oedema index (EI). Marshall computed tomography (CT) classification, A5 (+1) CT classification, oedema volume (EV), and EI were applied to evaluate the severity of oedema.
The volume estimation of DL approach yielded a volume percentage error of 3.59 % when compared to manual delineation. Regarding predictive efficacy for oedema severity, the area under the curve (AUC) for EV (0.840) was higher than that of the Marshall CT classification (0.664), A5 (+1) CT classification (0.692), and EI (0.731) (all P < .05). Furthermore, the combination of EI and the Marshall CT classification resulted in an AUC increase of 0.081 compared to the Marshall CT classification alone (P = .021), while the combination of EI and the A5 (+1) CT classification led to an AUC increase of 0.075 compared to the A5 (+1) CT classification alone (P = .013).

Patients who respond well to preoperative immunotherapy and achieve a complete response may potentially avoid surgery. Leveraging whole slide images (WSIs) from endoscopic biopsies, this study aims to construct a predictive model using a deep learning approach to identify potential pathological complete response (pCR) in CRC patients undergoing preoperative immunotherapy.
CRC patients who received preoperative immunotherapy from West China Hospital, Sichuan University were retrospectively included and randomized into the training and the validation sets at a 3:1 ratio. Using pathological outcomes as the reference standard, a predictive model was developed based on the H&E-stained WSIs of endoscopic biopsy, incorporating the Swin Transformer architecture and a self-attention mechanism augmented by convolutional neural networks (CNNs). And the Clustering-constrained Attention Multiple Instance Learning (CLAM) framework was used to optimize pathological image analysis. Through attention-based visualization, the top 5 % of patches most influential for determining tumor response to preoperative immunotherapy were identified.
The pCR rate was 30.6 % (22/72) in the training cohort and 30.4 % (7/23) in the validation cohort. The predictive model yielded an area under curve (AUC) of 0.830. Attention-based visualization in the validation set revealed that among the top 5 % of patches contributing to the prediction, 62.25 % were tumor patches and 37.75 % were non-tumor patches.

Nevertheless, policy-level interventions remain fragmented due to the lack of reliable and deployable detection technologies. Bridging this gap requires accurate, interpretable, and real-time fatigue monitoring systems capable of informing practical decision-making in transportation safety management. To address this challenge, we propose an end-to-end EEG-based fatigue detection model, Scale-Enhanced Transformer and Dynamic Graph Convolutional Network (SET-DGCN). The model captures multi-scale temporal dependencies and spatial brain-region interactions by integrating convolutional embeddings, attention mechanisms, and learnable graph structures. Extensive evaluations on both a driving simulation dataset and the publicly available SEED-VIG dataset confirm that SET-DGCN outperforms mainstream convolutional neural network (CNN)-based, graph convolutional network (GCN)-based, and Transformer-based models in terms of accuracy and F1-score, while maintaining strong cross-subject generalization. To enhance both interpretability and application relevance, a component-level attribution method (COAR) is employed to evaluate the functional contribution of model modules, while SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) analysis is used to uncover brain region-specific patterns across fatigue stages. Based on these neural insights, a set of multi-level policy and design recommendations is proposed, ranging from infrastructure enhancements to adaptive in-vehicle systems and individualized interventions, to provide a comprehensive framework for mitigating fatigue among young drivers in real-world transportation contexts."

The developed system integrates a compact hardware platform with rotating multi-view imaging and artificial intelligence-based analysis. Multi-focal length image fusion mitigates defocus issues, and attention mechanisms enhance key feature extraction under suboptimal imaging conditions. The detection model achieves error rates below 1 % for WBC counting and ∼2 % for classification. Clinical validation using 80 samples showed strong consistency with reference methods, yielding correlation coefficients of 0.99469 (lymphocytes), 0.98436 (neutrophils), and 0.98625 (monocytes), with an approximate deviation of 4 %. The system operates with simple loading and initiation steps, ensuring ease of use in decentralized medical settings.

Understanding their linked dynamics and shared influencing factors is crucial for effective mitigation. However, despite extensive advancements, there are still certain gaps in incorporated analytical frameworks that signify the reciprocal spatio-temporal interplay among these phenomena, especially regarding microclimate variations and Land Use and Land Cover (LULC) changes and vice versa. This comprehensive review highlights the systematic evolution and the crucial significance of LULC, microclimate variables, and empirical and GIS-based techniques, incorporating machine learning approaches, while rigorously evaluating more than seventy-four reported scientific studies. Approximately 30-32 percent of studies employed hybrid learning models (e.g., CNN-LSTM) to examine UHI, while 60-65 percent used ensemble techniques (e.g., Random Forest, Gradient Boosting) for flood danger analysis. Deep learning is an effective tool for modelling complicated, nonlinear relationships, whereas ensemble models are valued for interpretability and multi-source information integration. However, the sector lacks scalable, models leveraging real-time IoT statistics and accounting for urban morphological and climatic variability. By synthesizing cutting-edge findings, this overview offers insights into the bodily and data-driven interlinkages between urban flooding and UHIs, supporting more resilient and sustainable city planning. Urban flooding and UHI phenomenon are critical urban climate challenges, and their interactions amplify hydrological and thermal stresses, threatening urban livability, infrastructure resilience, and public health. Despite advances in machine learning and geospatial technologies, most of the previous studies examine UHI and flooding separately, overlooking microclimatic variations, urban morphology, real-time IoT integration, and model transferability. This review synthesizes recent geospatial and AI-based approaches to assessing UHI-urban flood interactions and identifies key methodological and geographical gaps. A unified data-driven framework is proposed to simulate compound hazards and enhance urban climate resilience. Peer-reviewed studies reported during the time span of 2010-2025 were systematically reviewed using the PRISMA 2020 protocol, with literature sourced from Scopus, Web of Science, ScienceDirect, and Google Scholar. Studies were categorized by hazard type, analytical technique, and validation metrics (RMSE, R2, MAE). Ensemble machine learning methods, notably Random Forest and Gradient Boosting, dominated flood modelling (61-65 %), while CNN-LSTM hybrid models were mostly used for UHI (30-32 %). CNN-LSTM performed best for moderate-resolution spatiotemporal data, whereas transformers and graph neural networks (GNNs) excelled for complex, large-scale scenarios. Key gaps include model interpretability and IoT integration. Transparent, geospatial AI frameworks are essential for data-driven, climate-resilient urban planning."

Recently, graph neural network (GNN)-based methods have been explored for this task, but they often rely on predefined, explicit graph structures. In practice, such prior structures may be incomplete, noisy, or unavailable. To overcome these limitations, we propose Progressive Fusion Networks with Adaptive Graph Structure Learning (PFN-AGSL), aiming to optimize the graph structure and effectively fuse multi-view (omics) representations in a hierarchical manner for accurate subtype prediction. PFN-AGSL incorporates a graph structure learning module comprising global guidance and local refinement blocks, which preserves essential structural patterns while refining local connections. Based on the learned topology, the information aggregation module generates view-specific embeddings. These embeddings are then integrated through a progressive fusion strategy that continuously combines shallow-to-deep information, mitigating information loss during integration. Extensive experiments on three cancer datasets show that PFN-AGSL achieves superior performance compared with state-of-the-art methods. Ablation studies further confirm the crucial contributions of graph structure learning and progressive fusion. These results highlight the effectiveness of PFN-AGSL, demonstrating its potential as a promising tool for cancer subtype classification."

The nnU-Net DL framework was trained for prostate autocontouring using axial T2-weighted (T2W) prostate MRIs from five public datasets. By controlling training set size, three sources of domain shift were evaluated: dataset, scanner vendor/field strength, and image acquisition/annotation protocol. 66 prostate MRIs were used for external evaluation and training/evaluation of an in-house model. The Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC) and 95 % Hausdorff distance (HD) evaluated the model-produced contours.
The performance gap (Δ) between intra/inter-domain evaluation showed that domain shift from scanner vendor/field strength (ΔDSC = 0.33, Δ95 % HD = 246.86 mm) and image acquisition/annotation protocols (ΔDSC = 0.20, Δ95 % HD = 14.70 mm) had greater impact than that from dataset (ΔDSC = 0.06, Δ95 % HD = 3.69 mm), although all were significant (p < 0.05). External evaluation showed that the mixed-domain trained model performed well but was less robust than the in-house model (median (IQR) DSC/95 % HD = 0.87 (0.06)/3.75 (4.47)mm, 0.90 (0.03)/1.03 (1.29) mm, p < 0.05, respectively).
We highlight for the first time the domain shift effect of image acquisition/annotation protocol, even with images acquired using the same scanner vendor/field strength. Understanding the effect of multiple sources of domain shift has enabled us to train a robust model that can be safely clinically deployed."
PubMed,deep learning,Colorectal disease diagnosis with deep triple-stream fusion and attention refinement.,Abdulfattah Ba Alawi; Abdullah Ammar Karcioglu; Ferhat Bozkurt,10.1016/j.compmedimag.2025.102669,2025-11-14,Computerized medical imaging and graphics : the official journal of the Computerized Medical Imaging Society,"Colorectal cancer constitutes a significant proportion of global cancer-related mortality, underscoring the imperative for robust and early-stage diagnostic methodologies. In this study, we propose a novel end-to-end deep learning framework that integrates multiple advanced mechanisms to enhance the classification of colorectal disease from histopathologic and endoscopic images. Our model, named TripleFusionNet, leverages a unique triple-stream architecture by combining the strengths of EfficientNetB3, ResNet50, and DenseNet121, enabling the extraction of rich, multi-level feature representations from input images. To augment discriminative feature modeling, a Multi-Scale Attention Module is integrated, which concurrently performs spatial and channel-wise recalibration, thereby enabling the network to emphasize diagnostically salient regions. Additionally, we incorporate a Squeeze-Excite Refinement Block (SERB) to selectively enhance informative channel activations while attenuating noise and redundant signals. Feature representations from the individual backbones are adaptively fused through a Progressive Gated Fusion mechanism that dynamically learns context-aware weighting for optimal feature integration and redundancy mitigation. We validate our approach on two colorectal benchmarks: CRCCD_V1 (14 classes) and LC25000 (binary). On CRCCD_V1, the best performance is obtained by a conventional classifier trained on our 256-D TripleFusionNet embeddings-SVM (RBF) reaches 96.63% test accuracy with macro F1 96.62%, with the Stacking Ensemble close behind. With five-fold cross-validation, it yields comparable out-of-fold means (0.964 with small standard deviations), confirming stability across partitions. End-to-end image-based baselines, including TripleFusionNet, are competitive but are slightly surpassed by embedding-based classifiers, highlighting the utility of the learned representation. On LC25000, our method attains 100% accuracy. Beyond accuracy, the approach maintains strong precision, recall, F1, and ROC-AUC, and the fused embeddings transfer effectively to multiple conventional learners (e.g., Random Forest, XGBoost). These results confirm the potential of the model for real-world deployment in computer-aided diagnosis workflows, particularly within resource-constrained clinical settings."

Three CNN models were trained on EEG data recorded from aEEG monitors from 92 preterm infants (23-41 weeks postmenstrual age) without major neurological complications and with normal cognitive outcomes at 2 years. The best-performing model based on MAE was applied to a broader cohort of 148 infants to assess the relationship between predicted age difference (PAD = EMA - PMA) and neurodevelopmental outcome using the Bayley Scales of Infant and Toddler Development (BSID-III).
The best models achieved 87 % and 84 % accuracy within ± 1 week of actual PMA and a mean absolute error of 0.63 and 0.55 weeks. Infants with severely abnormal cognitive outcomes had significantly lower PAD scores compared to those with normal outcomes (P < 0.001). PAD and MAE showed moderate predictive value (AUC 0.69 and 0.77, respectively).
CNN-based EMA estimation from EEG recorded via aEEG monitors is accurate and correlates with long-term cognitive outcomes in preterm infants.
This study demonstrates the clinical potential of automated EEG maturity tracking using EEG as a real-time biomarker for neurodevelopmental risk."
PubMed,deep learning,Research on a novel gene sequence prediction and homomorphic encryption method based on Mamba-VMD.,Xiaoyong Liu; Zhuhui Tan; Peikang Tang; Pei Lu; Xi Lu,10.1016/j.compbiolchem.2025.108780,2025-11-11,Computational biology and chemistry,"Gene sequence prediction not only effectively identifies homologous genes but also provides crucial insights into gene function and evolutionary relationships, making it one of the significant research directions in the field of bioinformatics. Given the high sensitivity of bioinformatics data, particularly gene sequences, plaintext transmission and processing in cloud environments pose risks of privacy leakage. To address this, this study innovatively proposes an analytical method combining Mamba neural network-based gene sequence prediction with homomorphic encryption, enabling secure data transmission while employing deep learning for sequence prediction. Using the monkeypox virus experimental ID SRX17751190 and sequencing ID SRR21755835 as examples, the study first decomposes the original gene sequence using VMD modal decomposition, then predicts the gene sequence from the decomposed components using the Mamba neural network, and finally performs homomorphic encryption and spatial similarity analysis on the predicted data in a cloud computing environment. Experimental results demonstrate that the average MAE, MSE, RMSE, MAPE, and MSPE for the top ten predicted gene sequences are 0.0140, 0.0003, 0.0190, 0.6527, and 789.52959, respectively, with an average CKKS homomorphic encryption computation error of 0.582492456. This ensures secure similarity calculations for gene sequence data in cloud environments."

The coexistence of both conditions is not uncommon, and since they share overlapping symptoms, echocardiographic findings, and biomarkers of myocardial damage, the diagnosis of infiltrative cardiomyopathy often remains masked. This underdiagnosis of cardiac amyloidosis in patients with symptomatic aortic stenosis can result in untimely and insufficient treatment. The objectives of this monograph are to analyze the predictors of cardiac amyloidosis caused by senile or wild type transthyretin in patients with symptomatic aortic stenosis, determine whether they constitute a higher-risk population, and explore the available therapeutic alternatives."

Methods “edgeR” was used to calculate differentially expressed genes (DEGs) for bulk-RNAseq. GO, KEGG, and GSEA analyses were performed on the DEGs. Aortic valves from 8 AS patients and 8 non-AS patients were collected for proteomic sequencing. After DEG analysis, five algorithms were used to identify hub genes. ROC curves were constructed for the hub genes. Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNAseq) was applied to systematically elaborate the mechanism in AS pathogenesis. Results Transcriptome data showed that AS was accompanied by high expression of genes such as MMP9, CXCL8, and SPP1, with significant activation of hypoxia, inflammatory response, and fibrosis. Proteomic sequencing of calcified AS revealed significantly enhanced hypoxic response, TNF-α signaling, and extracellular matrix (ECM) formation. Sixteen hub genes, including ITGB3, ITGAV, and MMP9, were identified by five algorithms, all with high diagnostic efficacy (AUC &amp;gt; 0.75). PCR experiments confirmed that MMP9 and PLAU were highly expressed in calcified aortic valves ( P &amp;lt; 0.05). scRNAseq revealed that in highly calcified regions, MMP9 and PLAU were mainly distributed in endothelial cells, monocytes, and macrophages, participating in the differentiation of monocytes and macrophages and relating to lipid metabolism and proinflammatory responses. Conclusion The 16 hub genes can assist in the diagnosis of aortic stenosis, and MMP9 and PLAU may participate in AS development by regulating the proinflammatory effects of monocytes and macrophages."

Cardiopulmonary exercise testing (CPET) and myocardial mechanics analysis may identify subclinical dysfunction and impaired functional capacity. To evaluate the relationship between functional capacity (by % predicted peak VO2), ventilatory efficiency (VE/VCO2 slope), and myocardial mechanics (speckle tracking echocardiography—STE), and myocardial work (MW) indices) in moderate AS with preserved EF. Methods: We prospectively enrolled 107 patients with moderate AS (AVA 1.0–1.5 cm2; mean gradient 20–40 mmHg; EF ≥ 50%). Functional capacity was classified as preserved (≥83% predicted VO2) or reduced (&lt;83%). Ventilatory efficiency was defined as good (&lt;30) or poor (≥30) VE/VCO2 slope. STE assessed left ventricular (LV), left atrial (LA), and right ventricular (RV) strain, as well as myocardial work indices. Results: Patients with reduced % predicted VO2 had higher LV end-systolic volume (p = 0.035), lower stroke volume index (p = 0.020), and smaller indexed aortic valve area (p = 0.025), with trends toward lower GLS and myocardial work. In contrast, patients with poor ventilatory efficiency (VE/VCO2 ≥ 30) showed significant impairments in global longitudinal strain (GLS, p = 0.002), LA reservoir strain (PALS, p = 0.019) and LA conduit strain (LA Scd, p &lt; 0.001), RV free wall strain (RW FWS, p = 0.029), and myocardial work indices (lower GWI and GCW, higher GWW, reduced GWE; all p &lt; 0.05). LA Scd emerged as the strongest predictor of poor ventilatory efficiency. (receiver operating characteristic (ROC) area under the curve (AUC) 0.723, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.623–0.823, p &lt; 0.001). Conclusions: In moderate AS with preserved EF, impaired ventilatory efficiency is more strongly associated with subclinical LV, LA, and RV dysfunction than reduced % predicted VO2, highlighting the key role of RV impairment. Integrating CPET and STE improves phenotyping, identifying high-risk patients who may benefit from closer surveillance or early intervention. These findings are exploratory and hypothesis-generating; longitudinal data are needed to confirm prognostic implications."

However, their reliability is hindered by the lack of patient-specific boundary conditions, particularly measured flow rates. This study addresses this knowledge gap by introducing a method for estimating flow division in aortic branches. The geometry of the lesional aorta was first repaired to obtain a near-healthy reference geometry. An iterative CFD simulation was then employed to estimate the flow division in the branches of the diseased aorta. Specifically, empirical boundary conditions from healthy individuals were used to predict the outlet pressures of reference geometry, which were subsequently converted into resistance models. These resistance models were then assigned to the outlets of the diseased aorta to predict the inlet pressure. The discrepancy between the predicted and target inlet pressures was iteratively minimized by adjusting the inlet pressure of the reference model until convergence was achieved. The final flow division in the branches of the diseased aorta was then obtained. The performance of the proposed method was investigated in three patients with aortic dissection or aneurysm. The proposed method predicted lower flow rates in branches with severe stenosis, which was more consistent with physiological expectations. Furthermore, the predicted blood pressure differed significantly from that obtained using the traditional method and was closer to the target values. The proposed method provides a practical solution for specifying boundary conditions in hemodynamic studies when clinically measured flow rates are unavailable."

Large language models (LLMs) could automate this process, yet LLMs are limited by their propensity for calculation errors and factual hallucinations. Pipelines that separate LLM-based data extraction from deterministic score computation may improve reliability and transparency. Methods We conducted a retrospective diagnostic study at a quaternary heart center in Germany (January 2020 – July 2023). Patients with atrial fibrillation (n=179) from an ablation registry and patients with severe aortic stenosis (n=76) evaluated by a heart team were included. Five LLMs (DeepSeek-R1, Qwen3, GPT-4 Turbo, Llama 3.1, and PaLM 2) were tested in standalone and pipeline configurations to compute HAS-BLED, CHA₂DS₂-VASc, and EuroSCORE II scores from routine clinical reports. Accuracy was assessed by comparing predictions to expert-adjudicated ground truth, using root mean squared error (RMSE), Krippendorff’s alpha for categorical agreement, and calibration analysis. Results Pipeline-generated scores showed substantially higher agreement with expert adjudication than standalone LLMs and treating clinicians (mean Krippendorff’s alpha: 0.79 vs 0.32 vs 0.31) and demonstrated superior calibration. The Qwen3-based pipeline, achieved the highest accuracy with lower RMSEs than clinicians for HAS-BLED (0.20 vs 0.87), CHA₂DS₂-VASc (0.53 vs 1.08), and EuroSCORE II (1.99 vs 2.05). Conclusion LLM-based pipelines enable accurate, well-calibrated, and scalable cardiovascular risk score computation from unstructured real-world clinical data, outperforming clinicians and standalone LLMs with the potential to reduce clinician workload and support evidence-based care."

However, there is currently no consensus in clinical guidelines regarding the optimal treatment approach for LVAD-associated AR. Case summary We report a case of a female patient who developed AR following LVAD implantation. This patient exhibited an open-like configuration of left ventricular outflow tract (LVOT), with no calcified stenosis in the supravalvular region and a lack of anchoring anatomical structures at the junction of the LVOT and sinus-tubular junction. This anatomical configuration posed a high risk of prosthetic valve displacement during conventional transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR). Therefore, we employed a novel TAVR system (Taurus Trio) equipped with a locator, which effectively prevented downward migration of the prosthetic valve after implantation. Discussion This case indicates the potential advantages and efficacy of the Taurus Trio valve in TAVR for AR Post-LVAD. We plan to conduct long-term follow-up to further explore and optimize the treatment protocol."

Chernyavskiy; Viacheslav V. Danilov,10.3389/fcvm.2025.1602780,2025-11-13,Frontiers in Cardiovascular Medicine,"Transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) is a highly effective treatment for patients with severe aortic stenosis. Accurate valve positioning is critical for successful TAVI, and highly accurate real-time visualization—with minimal use of contrast—is especially important for patients with chronic kidney disease. Under fluoroscopic conditions, which often suffer from low contrast, high noise and artifacts, automatic segmentation of anatomical structures using convolutional neural networks (CNNs) can significantly improve the accuracy of valve positioning. This paper presents a comparative analysis of various CNN architectures for automatic aortic root segmentation on angiographic images, with the aim of optimizing the TAVI process. The experimental evaluation included models such as FPN, U-Net++, DeepLabV3+, LinkNet, MA-Net, and PSPNet, all trained and tested with optimally tuned hyperparameters. During training dynamics, DeepLabV3+ and U-Net++ showed stable convergence with median Dice scores around 0.88. However, when evaluated at the patient level, MA-Net and PSPNet outperformed all other models, achieving Dice coefficients of 0.942 and 0.936, and an average symmetric surface distance of 4.1 mm. The findings underscore the potential of incorporating automatic segmentation methods into decision-support systems for cardiac surgery—reducing contrast agent use, minimizing surgical risks, and improving valve positioning accuracy. Future work will focus on expanding the dataset, exploring additional architectures, and adapting the models for real-time application."

However, a detailed methodological description that includes the surgical approach and imaging planes is lacking. The aim of this study was to standardize SE performed via a subxiphoid surgical approach and to provide reference values for future research. Methods SE was performed in 19 female German Landrace pigs under general anesthesia using a defined imaging protocol. After the induction of general anesthesia, a small subxiphoid incision was made to optimize the image quality for SE. The echocardiographic imaging protocol was adapted from human 2D-transthoracic echocardiography and included apical 2-, 3-, and 5-chamber views and Doppler measurements of blood flow and tissue velocities. Furthermore, speckle tracking was used to assess left ventricular (LV) and right ventricular (RV) myocardial deformation. Results During SE, the animals were under stable anesthesia with a heart rate of 65 ± 12 beats per minute, and a mean arterial pressure of 88 ± 12 mmHg. Blood gas values were within physiological ranges. High-quality images of both ventricles were consistently achieved using the established imaging protocol. One animal showed a severe aortic stenosis and was excluded from the analysis. The biplane LV stroke volume was 45 ± 13 ml and the LV ejection fraction was 67% ± 11%. LV-global longitudinal strain (GLS) was −22.4% ± 3.3%, and RV free wall longitudinal strain was −23.7% ± 5%. The V max of the aortic valve was 1.6 ± 0.3 m/s. Conclusion SE offers a standardized and reproducible imaging technique for the assessment of high-quality apical views in swine models. This study provides procedural guidance and reference values for translational research applications."

Tan; Robert Levine; Maria Carmo Pereira Nunes,10.1186/s44156-025-00094-z,2025-11-12,Echo Research and Practice,"Abstract Background Rheumatic mitral stenosis (MS) is characterised by structural alterations that reduce the size of the valvular orifice. In addition, changes in valve geometry may have haemodynamic consequences that extend beyond the narrowed orifice, influencing the overall clinical presentation of MS. The aim of this study was to develop an index to assess the haemodynamic severity of the stenosis. Methods A total of 186 patients with rheumatic MS who underwent comprehensive three-dimensional (3D) transoesophageal echocardiographic assessment were included. Dedicated software was used to extract a range of morphological variables to evaluate mitral valve geometry, including diameter, area, height, volume, and the aortic–mitral angle. To quantify the volume enclosed within the stenotic structure, we developed the 3D Doming Index (DI), calculated by dividing the valvular volume (tenting volume) by the theoretical volume of a cylinder generated by the mitral annulus and valvular height (tenting height). Linear regression models were employed to identify determinants of the mean pressure gradient. Results The 3D Doming Index demonstrated a significant association with the transmitral pressure gradient in the multivariate model, after adjusting for confounders including age, sex, heart rate, pulmonary artery systolic pressure, net atrioventricular compliance (C n ), and left atrial volume. Incorporation of the 3D Doming Index into the model improved overall performance. Conclusions The geometric configuration of the mitral valve contributes to the haemodynamic burden of obstruction in rheumatic MS. The 3D Doming Index offers valuable insight into the relationship between valve anatomy and the resultant haemodynamic impact of the stenosis."

This review aims to provide a practical, device-specific decision-making framework for TAVI prosthesis selection, synthesizing the latest evidence (2023–2025) to address the challenge of individualized choice in an era of device proliferation. We conducted a detailed review of current TAVI models from leading manufacturers (Medtronic, Abbott, Boston Scientific, Biotronik, etc.), examining their technical specifications, design innovations, and data from recent international clinical trials and registries. A comparative analysis was performed based on key parameters: delivery profile, resheathability/repositionability, sealing mechanisms, hemodynamic performance, and complication rates. Modern TAVI prostheses demonstrate significant advancements. Self-expanding nitinol frames offer superior adaptability and lower profiles (as low as 14 Fr). Innovations in sealing technology have drastically reduced the incidence of moderate-to-severe paravalvular leak (PVL) to below 2–3%. Supra-annular leaflet designs provide superior hemodynamics. Clinical outcomes show excellent 30-day mortality rates (1.1–2.0%) and durability estimates of 10–15 years. Variation exists between devices in rates of permanent pacemaker implantation and coronary access. The current generation of TAVI prostheses represents a mature technology offering high safety and efficacy. The key development vectors are focused on further device miniaturization, enhancing long-term durability, and expanding indications. This analysis provides a novel, clinically oriented comparison that moves beyond technical specifications to guide optimal device selection based on specific patient anatomy and clinical characteristics."

A review of precise risk assessment in the contemporary era of transcatheter edge-to-edge mitral and tricuspid valve repair,Felix Ausbuettel; Carlo Federico Fichera; Felix Ausbuettel; Carlo Federico Fichera,10.3389/fcvm.2025.1693291,2025-11-14,Frontiers in Cardiovascular Medicine,"Transcatheter edge-to-edge mitral and tricuspid valve repair (M-TEER, T-TEER) have emerged as meaningful treatment modalities among patients at high surgical risk suffering from valvular heart disease. While previous research has shown that optimal patient selection is crucial for treatment outcomes, recent studies have identified a multitude of factors that independently influence mortality. Although these findings can significantly support clinical decision-making, the large number of available studies renders an overview of this topic challenging. In this review, we provide a comprehensive overview of the currently identified factors associated with increased mortality after TEER. We also summarize the current evidence on published risk scores that stratify mortality risk after M-TEER and T-TEER. We aimed to provide clinical decision-making support for optimal patient selection and referral to TEER and to identify remaining gaps in evidence."
OpenAlex,valvular heart disease,Characterization of Left Ventricular Hemodynamic Forces in Mitral Regurgitation Using 4-Dimensional-Flow Magnetic Resonance Imaging,Monisha Ghosh Srabanti; Ali Fatehi Hassanabad; Lyes Kadem; Julio Garcia,10.1177/30494826251395620,2025-11-13,Journal of the Heart Valve Society,"Background: Mitral regurgitation (MR) is one of the most common valvular heart diseases. Despite the recognized importance of hemodynamic force (HDF) in cardiology, its exploration in MR has been limited. Therefore, using a retrospective observational study design, we aimed to investigate the potential of noninvasively assessed systolic and diastolic HDF derived from 4-dimensional-flow magnetic resonance imaging (4D-flow MRI) as markers for determining MR. Method: The study cohort included 15 controls (19-61 years) and 26 MR patients (20 with primary and 6 cases with secondary MR, 33-75 years) classified into trivial-to-severe MR through cardiac MRI. The 3 T/4D-flow MRI sequence was used to assess left ventricular (LV) HDF (integral of intraventricular pressure gradients over the LV cavity) in 3 directions (lateral-septal, inferior-anterior, and apical-basal) using “Segment,” v2.2 R6410. Results: A negative coefficient for peak-systolic apical-basal HDF corresponded to decreased ejection fraction (β = −8.1, SE = 3.3, t = −2.5, P = .03), and a positive association was found between LV mass index and peak-systolic apical-basal HDF (β = 25.6, SE = 11.1, t = 2.3, P = .04). Peak-systolic apical-basal and E-wave apical-basal (diastolic HDF at E-wave time point) HDF emerged as significant predictors in detecting severe MR (Estimate = 2.2, P = .007; Estimate = 1.8, P = .015, respectively). The peak-systolic apical-basal HDF was also notably correlated with age in moderate-severe MR ( r = 0.88, P = .022). Conclusion: Mitral regurgitation affects early diastolic filling and peak systolic ejection, indicated by peak-systolic and E-wave HDF in the apical-basal direction, offering insights into dynamic flow patterns and LV remodeling. Hemodynamic force analysis could enhance risk stratification and guide therapeutic decisions, complementing traditional diagnostic methods for improved MR management."

Veeken,"Abstract Objectives Autoantibodies represent a serological hallmark of systemic sclerosis (SSc). Heart involvement in SSc patients includes diastolic dysfunction, conduction block, pericardial effusion, altered left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF), valvular pathology, as well as myocardial inflammation and/or fibrosis. To characterize the role of anti-RNA polymerase III (RNAPIII) antibody positivity in the pathophysiology of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)-related cardiac involvement in SSc patients. Method We retrospectively analyzed four SSc patients with anti-RNAPIII antibodies who developed cardiac complications after COVID-19. This study was approved by the University of Osaka Clinical Research Review Board. Results All patients were female and had been diagnosed within the past 3 years. Case 1 presented with elevated myocardial enzymes and severe cardiac injury requiring mechanical circulatory support. The diagnosis of COVID-19-related fulminant myocarditis was made. The other three patients did not have elevated myocardial enzymes but had elevated brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) or N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) and pericardial effusion or decreased LVEF and respiratory distress, suggesting the appearance of COVID-19-induced cardiac dysfunction. Conclusion Patients with anti-RNAPIII-positive SSc may have an increased risk of developing cardiac complications after COVID-19. The pathogenesis may involve angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2)-mediated mechanisms, which may include reducing ACE2 expression, leading to increased angiotensin II activity and induce cytokine storm. These results underline the importance of understanding the interplay between autoimmune diseases and infections in promoting immune-mediated cardiac injury. Further investigation is needed to characterize the role of anti-RNAPIII antibodies in the pathophysiology of COVID-19-related cardiac involvement."
OpenAlex,valvular heart disease,Temporal Prognostic Factors in Elderly Patients with Acute Heart Failure: A Cohort Study from a Spanish Emergency Department,Itziar Ostolaza Tazón; Héctor Alonso Valle; Pedro Muñoz Cacho,10.20944/preprints202511.0861.v1,2025-11-13,Preprints.org,"Background/Objectives: Acute heart failure (AHF) is a common cause of hospitalization in older adults, associated with high morbidity and mortality. In this population, frailty, comorbidity, and functional variability significantly influence prognosis. This study evaluated short-term (30-day) and long-term (1-year) mortality predictors in elderly patients with AHF treated in the emergency department (HED), considering clinical variables, comorbidities, and precipitating factors (PFs). Materials and Methods: An observational cohort study was conducted based on a secondary analysis of older patients with AHF included in the Epidemiology of Acute Heart Failure in Emergency Departments (EAHFE) registry, treated at Hospital Universitario Marqués de Valdecilla (HUMV) between 2007 and 2022. Clinical, laboratory, and PF-related variables were collected. The primary outcome was all-cause mortality at 30 days and 1 year. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were performed. Results: A total of 548 patients were included (mean age: 80.7 years), of whom 78.6% required hospitalization, mainly in the Internal Medicine department. Mortality was 11.1% at 30 days and 29.9% at 1 year. Age, valvular heart disease, dementia, and elevated creatinine levels were independently associated with higher mortality. Hypoxemia and low-output symptoms were linked to short-term mortality, while NYHA class III and anemia were associated with long-term mortality. Among PFs, acute coronary syndrome (ACS) was related to worse short-term outcomes, whereas rapid atrial fibrillation (AF) was inversely associated with long-term mortality. Conclusions: The prognostic relevance of risk factors differs between short- and long-term outcomes in older patients with AHF. Incorporating clinical characteristics and PFs into risk stratification models may support individualized management and guide follow-up strategies tailored to the geriatric profile. This multidimensional approach is essential to improve clinical decision-making and outcomes in a highly vulnerable population."

Using a prospective multicentre cohort of patients treated for IE, we compared the performance of the 2023 ESC classification to that of 2015 ESC, 2019 European Heart Rhythm Association (EHRA) and 2023 Duke-International Society for Cardiovascular Infectious Diseases (ISCVID) classifications in patients with or without cardiac implantable electronic devices (CIEDs). Methods A total of 1180 patients treated for IE between January 2017 and October 2022 were categorised as having either definite or possible/rejected IE within each classification. The gold standard diagnosis of IE was independently adjudicated by experts as ‘certain’ or not. Definite and ‘certain’ cases of IE were cross-tabulated to calculate sensitivity, specificity and accuracy. Suspicion of lead IE was defined by specific anatomical or metabolic features of cardiac lead infection on imaging; or by pulmonary embolism without valvular vegetation; or by positive culture of a lead extracted during open-heart surgery. Results In the 269 patients with CIEDs, 208 (77.3%) were adjudicated as ‘certain IE’; 2023 Duke-ISCVID and 2023 ESC classifications achieved higher sensitivity (97.1% and 93.8%, respectively) but markedly lower specificity (31.1% and 41.0%, respectively) than 2015 ESC and 2019 EHRA classifications. In the 159 patients with CIEDs and lead IE (78.6% ‘certain IE’), while sensitivity remained high for all classifications, specificity dropped for 2023 Duke-ISCVID and 2023 ESC classifications (11.8% and 32.4%, respectively), but not for 2019 EHRA classification (67.6%). In the 911 patients without CIEDs (81.0% ‘certain IE’), sensitivity was higher than 96% for all classifications and specificity was 55.5%, 52.6% and 48.0% for 2015 ESC, 2023 Duke-ISCVID and 2023 ESC classifications, respectively. Conclusions The 2023 ESC and 2023 Duke-ISCVID classifications had a higher sensitivity but a lower specificity than the 2015 ESC classification in patients with CIEDs, especially among those with lead IE. In patients with CIEDs, the 2019 EHRA classification was the most accurate."

OpenAlex,valvular heart disease,Left ventricular false tendons as incidental findings in a case of sudden cardiac death: What is their role?,Luca Cerra; Eleonora Nardi; Giovanni Aulino; Matteo Polacco; Antonio Oliva; Vincenzo Arena,10.1016/j.jflm.2025.103025,2025-11-11,Journal of Forensic and Legal Medicine,"Sudden death (SD) can be defined as the unexpected natural death of a healthy individual occurring within the first hour after the onset of symptoms or, if death is unwitnessed, within 24 h of the victim being seen in a healthy state. In people younger than 35 yo, when the cause of SD is"" cardiac"" (sudden cardiac death-SCD), it is mainly due to cardiomyopathies and channelopathies. Among the predictors of SCD, obesity (a well-established independent risk factor for cardiovascular diseases) has been found to increase arrhythmic risk (i.e., every 5-unit increment in BMI confers a 16 % higher risk of SCD). We herein describe an autoptic case of an obese 32-year-old woman (BMI of 49.9), who was discovered deceased in her bed at home. Interestingly, at the heart examination, the presence of an abnormality in the tendon apparatus of the anterior mitral valve leaflet was observed. In fact, an accessory tendon chord connecting the apex of the leaflet to the distal third of the antero-lateral papillary muscle was found in addition to an unusual retiform appearance (""web-like"") of the whole mitral valve tendon apparatus. At histological examination of the ventricular myocardium, foci of confluent interstitial and perivascular myocardiosclerosis, along with perivascular fibrosis of coronary intramyocardial were observed. According to the literature, the valvular findings observed could plausibly account for the cause of death. In particular, a fatal arrhythmia due to the above-described tendons apparatus abnormality may developed. Nevertheless, obesity, which is a well-established risk factor for adverse cardiovascular events, may have contributed independently of the accessory chordal tendon. This case underscores the intricate interplay between the existence of left ventricular false tendons (LVFTs) and an elevated risk of ventricular tachycardia. From a speculative point of view, an LVFT may induce mechanical stretch in the interventricular septum, leading to heightened automaticity and triggering premature ventricular beats or arrhythmias. Comprehensive awareness of these structural anomalies and their morphological attributes is crucial for establishing correlations with potentially fatal arrhythmias and for formulating targeted preventive interventions."

Objectives We evaluated clinical outcomes with GLP-1 RA use post-TAVI in patients with T2D. Methods We conducted a retrospective cohort study using the TriNetX network, including 25,184 adults (≥18 years) with T2D who underwent TAVI (2015-2023). Patients were stratified based on GLP1-RA initiation within 14 days post-TAVI. Baseline characteristics, comorbidities, medications, and laboratory data were balanced using 1:1 propensity score matching (PSM). Cox models estimated hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for events from one-month post-TAVI until most recent follow-up. Results PSM yielded 1,101 patients per group, with a mean age of 73 years and 39% female. Mean follow-up duration was 2.2±1.1 and 2.6±1.8 years for GLP1-RA users and non-users, respectively. GLP1-RA use was also associated higher survival probability (HR 0.708 [95% CI, 0.583-0.859]), and lower rates of all-cause hospitalization (HR 0.790 [95% CI, 0.706-0.885]), major cardiovascular events (HR 0.849 [95% CI, 0.749-0.963]), and acute heart failure exacerbation (HR 0.785 [95% CI, 0.677-0.909]), acute kidney injury (HR 0.843 [95% CI, 0.719-0.988]), and major kidney events (HR 0.665 [95% CI, 0.510-0.866]). No differences were observed in acute myocardial infarction, cerebral infarction, or cardiac arrest. Conclusions In patients with T2D undergoing TAVI, GLP1-RA use are associated with significant survival benefits and improved cardiorenal outcomes. However, these findings are limited by the observational design, high comorbidity burden, lack of data on medication compliance and specific cause of death. Prospective trials are warranted to confirm these benefits."

Pulmonary hypertension is an important and grave hemodynamic consequence of mitral stenosis. Persistent pulmonary hypertension leads to increase right heart pressure, Right Ventricular Hypertrophy (RVH) and subsequently right heart failure. There are various electrocardiographic parameters and criteria of Right Ventricular Hypertrophy (RVH) for diagnosis of pulmonary hypertension in various disease. Different ECG parameters and criteria of Right Ventricular Hypertrophy (RVH) have different predictive value for diagnosis of pulmonary hypertension in MS patient. Echocardiography is an important non-invasive investigation for diagnosis, monitoring and selection of treatment and for prediction of mortality in MS patient. Obtaining good quality of 2D echocardiography is problematic in remote areas and they are not feasible for wide spread use due to cost and availability. So, ECG may be a guide for selecting appropriate patient for further testing. Objectives: This study was planned to identify more accurate parameters of ECG for prediction of pulmonary hypertension and Right Ventricular Hypertrophy (RVH) in patients with mitral stenosis. Methodology: This cross-sectional observational study was conducted in the Department of Cardiology, DMCH, from March 2018 to February 2019. A total of 100 patients with mitral stenosis (MS) who met the inclusion and exclusion criteria were enrolled. Detailed clinical history, physical examination, and baseline investigations were recorded for all participants. The study population was divided into two groups: Group I:MS patients without pulmonary hypertension (PASP &lt; 35 mmHg). Group II: MS patients with pulmonary hypertension (PASP ≥ 35 mmHg). A 12-lead ECG and Doppler echocardiogram were performed within 24 hours of the patient’s first contact. Fourteen different ECG parameters and criteria for right ventricular hypertrophy (RVH) were assessed. Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS version 22.0 for Windows. Results: 14 patients were found in group I and 86 patients were found in group II. Among the Group-II patents 18 patients had mild pulmonary hypertension (PASP = 35 ≤ 50 mmHg), 47 patients had moderate pulmonary hypertension (PASP = 50 ≤ 70 mmHg) and 21 patients had severe pulmonary hypertension (PASP ≥ 70 mmHg). Average age of patient in group-I: was 38.71 ± 9.6 years and average age of patients in group-II was 43.8 ± 13.1 years (p = 0.16) Sex distribution was also identical between 2 groups (p = 0.92). This study showed that among the different ECG criteria for detection of RVH in mitral stenosis patients (Which is a surrogate marker for pulmonary hypertension), only a few had good predictive value. In mild pulmonary hypertension, only R in V1 ≥ 7 mm has sensitivity (66.7%), specificity (100%), PPV (100%) and NPV (37.5%). In moderate and severe pulmonary hypertension, R in V1 ≥ 7 mm, R/S in V1 &gt; 1 andR in V1+S in V5 ≥ 10 mm had good sensitivity (60.5% and 63.2%; 65.1% and 68.4%; 53.5% and 63.2% respectively), good specificity (100% and 100%; 100% and 100%; 100% and 100% respectively), good PPV (100% and 100%; 100% and 100%; 100% and 100% respectively) and NPV (19% and 22.2%; 21.1% and 25%; 16.7% and 22.2% respectively). Conclusion: The sensitivity of the ECG parameters was as a whole low to moderate in detection of pulmonary hypertension by assessing presence of RVH. However, certain ECG criteria for RVH detection in mitral stenosis patients have acceptable predictive value only in moderate to severe pulmonary hypertension."

Studies have showed trace element concentrations varied in patients with AF and may be involved in the pathogenesis of AF. However, no data is currently available for those with VHD. Methods Urine samples as well as clinical data were collected from 72 VHD patients with AF (VHDAF) and 72 VHD patients without AF (VHD) and further analyzed for a panel of trace elements: lithium, manganese, cobalt, copper, zinc, arsenic, selenium, strontium, Cadmium, mercury, thallium, lead. Quantile g-computation was adopted to explore the joint effect of the 12 trace elements on AF in this population, and internal validation was performed using 1,000 bootstrap re-samples. Results Compared with the VHD group, Sr levels were reduced, while Mn, Cu and Hg concentrations were increased in the VHDAF group. Quantile g-computation model indicated a significant association between the mixtures of the 12 urinary trace elements and AF in patients with heart valve disease (adjusted OR: 2.051; 95% CI: 1.180–3.565; p = 0.011). Positive partial effect was owing to Cu (weight: 0.43) and Hg (weight: 0.18), while negative partial effect mainly attributed to Sr (weight: 0.43) and Li (weight: 0.23). Conclusion VHDAF patients had higher Cu levels and lower Sr levels, and the two elements have been supposed to exert the largest influence on AF. Further research is needed to establish the causal relationships."

Although the initial insult is driven by autoimmune responses triggered by Group A Streptococcus infection, the sustained progression of valvular fibrosis involves a complex interplay of persistent immune activation, chronic inflammation, and, critically, long‐term mechanical stress. Mechanical forces arising from altered hemodynamics and structural valve deformation perpetuate valvular interstitial cell activation, endothelial‐to‐mesenchymal transition, and extracellular matrix remodeling, thereby driving fibrosis even after acute inflammation resolves. Current therapeutic options to halt or reverse mitral valve fibrosis are limited, with surgical repair or replacement remaining the primary interventions for advanced disease. Advancing mechanistic understanding through physiologically relevant models, coupled with early diagnostic strategies and multitargeted antifibrotic approaches, holds promise for preserving valve function. Integrating molecular insights with scalable public health measures may ultimately mitigate the global burden of rheumatic heart disease and improve outcomes for affected populations."

This review outlines the complex interplay of traditional, transplant-specific, and recipient- and donor-related risk factors that sustain a high cardiovascular burden post-transplantation. While kidney function restoration reduces uremic toxins and improves cardiometabolic parameters, new challenges arise from immunosuppressive therapies, persistent hypertension, post-transplant diabetes mellitus, and chronic inflammation. Common cardiovascular complications include coronary artery disease, heart failure, valvular disease, peripheral artery disease, and refractory hypertension. Risk stratification tools and guidelines often fail to account for transplant-specific variables, resulting in suboptimal management. Although some pharmacological strategies and careful antihypertensive regimens show promise, most evidence is extrapolated from non-transplant populations due to the lack of dedicated randomized controlled trials. Emerging therapies like SGLT2 inhibitors, GLP-1 receptor agonists and non-steroidal mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists hold potential but require further validation in this population. Moreover, sex disparities persist in access to transplantation and in post-transplant outcomes, with men generally experiencing higher cardiovascular risk but women potentially facing greater relative mortality. The review underscores the urgent need for transplant-specific cardiovascular research, personalized therapeutic strategies including precision medicine, and greater inclusion of women in research. Optimizing cardiovascular outcomes in KTRs will require multidisciplinary collaboration, rigorous evidence generation, and an integrated approach to risk prediction, prevention, and treatment."

This pathology is the most prevalent valvular heart disease worldwide and is associated with a poor prognosis. Despite extensive research, no pharmacological treatments are available to slow or reverse valvular degeneration, making aortic valve replacement the only current therapeutic option. This lack of clinical success may stem from an incomplete understanding of the disease's mechanisms and the limitations of current preclinical models, which do not fully replicate the complexity of CAVD and its associated risk factors and comorbidities. Indeed, while existing models offer valuable insights, a deeper understanding of CAVD requires incorporating comorbidities, gender-specific mechanisms, and dynamic cellular and tissue-level changes. This review aims to provide the reader with an overview of preclinical models developed in recent years to study CAVD, assessing their strengths and limitations. We review how these models can be used to mimic and/or investigate the cellular and molecular mechanisms involved in CAVD development, and highlight how key risk factors and comorbidities can be incorporated to enhance the translational potential of research. We hope that this approach will help guide researchers in selecting the most appropriate model for their studies, with the goal of advancing the identification of effective therapeutic candidates."

Its natural course varies significantly based on the different etiologies and its diagnosis can influence the disease's management and prognosis. Clinical case: 29-year-old male, with a history of having suffered from Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia at the age of 4 with complete remission of the disease demonstrated at that time by bone marrow aspirate and immunophenotype, having been treated with anthracyclines. On this occasion, he attended due to the presence of sudden onset dyspnea and hemoptysis, for which in the first instance, due to the previously mentioned history, an attempt was made to rule out pulmonary thromboembolism with chest Angio tomography, which was corroborated by said study and demonstrating the presence of two intracavitary thrombi. Therefore, a transthoracic echocardiogram was performed, highlighting severe dilation of the left ventricle. Management for heart failure was adjusted based on structural alteration demonstrated by echocardiography, with favorable clinical evolution. Conclusions: The natural history of dilated cardiomyopathy is not easy to establish due to the wide heterogeneity of its etiology and the different rates of progression depending on it. In some cases, there may be functional recovery after acute myocardial damage, for example, in cardiomyopathy induced by tachycardia or in that induced by cardiotoxic drugs. In other cases, stabilization of the disease and systolic dysfunction and, in others, sudden death may be observed."
