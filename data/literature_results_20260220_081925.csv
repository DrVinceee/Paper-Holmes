PubMed,aortic stenosis,Outpatient Cardiac Rehabilitation and Long-Term Clinical Outcomes After Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement.,Koki Takegawa; Yoshitaka Iwanaga; Koshiro Kanaoka; Shoko Chishaki-Kawabata; Haruka Matsuura; Tetsuo Sasano; Yuichi Nishioka; Tomoya Myojin; Tatsuya Noda; Tomoaki Imamura; Yoshihiro Miyamoto,10.1111/jgs.70356,2026-02-19,Journal of the American Geriatrics Society,"Transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) has become the standard treatment for severe aortic stenosis, particularly among very old adults, and long-term comprehensive management post-TAVR is becoming increasingly important. Although cardiac rehabilitation (CR) is strongly recommended for patients with heart failure (HF) or post-cardiac surgery, cohort studies evaluating the long-term efficacy of CR in patients who have undergone TAVR are scarce. This study aimed to examine the association between outpatient CR and long-term clinical outcomes post-TAVR utilizing a nationwide administrative claims database in Japan.
Among 46,885 patients who underwent TAVR between April 2014 and March 2021, 34,165 patients who participated in inpatient CR and were discharged alive were included. Patients were categorized by outpatient CR participation. After propensity score matching, the primary outcome, a composite of all-cause mortality and HF hospitalization, was compared over a 3-year period.
Among the eligible patients, 29,552 (86.5%) were aged ≥ 80 years, and 22,805 (66.7%) were female. The participation rate in outpatient CR was 10.2%, with no observed increasing trend over the years. Advanced age, female sex, dementia, and multiple comorbidities were associated with non-participation in CR. The outpatient CR group exhibited reduced risk for the primary outcome (hazard ratio: 0.87, 95% confidence interval: 0.79-0.96) with a median follow-up of 734 days.
The participation rate in outpatient CR after TAVR remains low, with identifiable barriers in Japan. Participation was associated with improved outcomes, suggesting a beneficial management strategy for older patients post-TAVR."
PubMed,aortic stenosis,Long-term prognostic value of cardiopulmonary exercise testing in patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.,Leopoldo Ordine; Grazia Canciello; Salvatore Di Napoli; Roberto Polizzi; Daniela Pacella; Raffaella Lombardi; Giovanni Esposito; Maria-Angela Losi,10.1093/eschf/xvag013,2026-02-03,ESC heart failure,"Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is a heterogeneous myocardial disorder characterized by left ventricular hypertrophy. The role of cardiopulmonary exercise testing (CPET) in predicting major adverse cardiac events (MACE) remains incompletely understood, particularly over long-term follow-up and independently of baseline symptoms.
We longitudinally studied 154 HCM patients (age 43 ± 16 years; 27% female), who underwent symptom-limited CPET. At baseline, 98 patients were in New York Heart Association (NYHA) Class I, 48 in Class II, and 8 in Class III. Septal reduction therapies (SRT), progression to end-stage HCM (ES-HCM), sudden cardiac death (SCD), heart failure-related death (HF), and heart transplantation (HT) represented a composite MACE endpoint.
Over a mean follow-up of 12 ± 9 years, 38 patients experienced MACE (SRT = 9; ES-HCM = 11; SCD = 10; HF/HT = 8). In multivariable analysis, independent predictors of MACE were percentage predicted peak VO2 (PVO2%) < 60 [hazard ratio (HR) 4.16, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.89-9.14; P < .001], and NYHA Class >I (HR 2.27, 95% CI 1.06-4.89; P = .036). By using SRT as a competing risk, the only predictor of MACE became PVO2% < 60 (HR 3.966, 95% CI 1.626-9.670; P = .002). Among asymptomatic patients (i.e. NYHA Class I), only PVO2% < 60 remained a significant predictor of MACE (HR 5.611, 95% CI 1.635-19.253; P = .006), with risk divergence evident after nearly 15 years of follow-up. The result was also confirmed in the competing risk analysis.
In this long follow-up study, CPET is a powerful prognostic tool in HCM. A reduced peak VO2 identifies those at higher risk, highlighting the potential for CPET to improve risk stratification, even among patients classified as NYHA Class I."
PubMed,aortic stenosis,Effect of mavacamten on sudden cardiac death risk scores in obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.,Paolo Usai; Eve Cariou; Erwan Donal; Damien Eyharts; Nicolas Cohen; Claire Lucas; Adrien Al Wazzan; Miloud Cherbi; Romain Itier; Pauline Fournier; Gilbert Habib; Olivier Lairez,10.1093/eschf/xvag003,2026-02-03,ESC heart failure,"Obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (oHCM) is associated with both haemodynamic impairment and increased arrhythmic risk, including sudden cardiac death (SCD). Risk stratification relies on the European Society of Cardiology (ESC) HCM Risk-SCD model, complemented by cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) assessment of myocardial fibrosis. Myosin inhibitors such as mavacamten improve obstruction and induce reverse remodelling, but their impact on arrhythmic risk score remains unknown. The objective was to analyse the impact of mavacamten on the evolution of the ESC rhythm score in patients with obstructive HCM.
Consecutive patients with symptomatic oHCM treated with mavacamten between October 2023 and June 2025 at four French referral centres for cardiomyopathies were retrospectively included. Clinical, echocardiographic, and CMR data were collected at baseline and after 6 months of therapy. Arrhythmic risk was calculated using the ESC HCM Risk-SCD model; patients with late gadolinium enhancement (LGE) ≥ 15% of left ventricular (LV) mass were reclassified into the high-risk category.
Among 186 eligible patients, 161 were included (mean age 62 ± 14 years, 55% male). At baseline, arrhythmic risk was classified as high in 6%, intermediate in 9%, and low in 85%. After 6 months of mavacamten, significant improvements were observed in New York Heart Association class (III: 35 to 2%, P < .001), resting LV outflow tract (LVOT) gradient (45 ± 31 to 12 ± 9 mmHg, P < .001), provoked gradient (80 ± 32 to 25 ± 19 mmHg, P < .001) and N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) levels. The median expected 5-year SCD risk decreased from 2.1% (1.7-3) to 1.4% (1.1-1.8) (P < .001). In high-risk patients, the score decreased from 7.7% (7.4-8.4) to 4.6% (4.5-6.0) (P = .001). European Society of Cardiology Risk-SCD reduction was entirely attributable to modifiable parameters: rest/Valsalva LVOT gradients (-33/-57 mmHg), left atrial diameter (-1.2 mm), and septal thickness (-1.5 mm, all P < .001). Mean HCM Risk Score reduction was 0.7% with heterogeneous inter-patient response, but homogeneous efficacy across centres (P = .206). Considering LGE, the proportion of patients with a high rhythmic risk fell from 16% to 15%. During a median follow-up of 19 months, no patient experienced SCD or required secondary prevention implantable cardioverter-defibrillator; two new non-sustained ventricular tachycardia episodes were recorded.
Mavacamten therapy was associated with marked haemodynamic and symptomatic improvements and a reduction in the ESC-based SCD risk in obstructive HCM. While these findings need to be confirmed and were not paralleled by a reduction in arrhythmic events, they suggest that myosin inhibition may influence arrhythmic risk stratification. Prospective studies with longer follow-up are required to determine whether such favourable remodelling translates into true arrhythmic protection."

This study aimed to clarify how metabolic remodelling relates to disease phenotypes in HCM. We used desorption electrospray ionization imaging mass spectrometry (DESI-IMS) to compare myocardial lipid signatures in patients who required septal reduction therapy (SRT) and those who did not.
In this prospective study, patients with HCM undergoing either right-ventricular biopsy or surgical septal myectomy were enrolled. Frozen 10 µm sections were analysed using DESI-IMS, and mass spectra were compared with volcano plots after signal-intensity normalization. Candidate ions showing |log2 fold change| ≥ 1 and P < .05 were annotated using the Human Metabolome Database.
Overall, 61 patients were analysed (34 [55.7%] were female; mean age 64.5 ± 15.9 years). Of these, 43 (70.5%) had obstructive HCM and 20 underwent SRT (SRT, n = 20; non-SRT, n = 41). The SRT group displayed a 3.3-fold higher signal for m/z 463.23, identified as testosterone glucuronide (P < .001). SRT remained the only predictor of elevated testosterone-glucuronide intensity in confirmatory regression (β = 1.991, P = .004), even after adjusting for age at diagnosis and the presence of hypertension, which significantly differed in baseline characteristics between the SRT and non-SRT groups.
DESI-IMS revealed selective accumulation of testosterone glucuronide in hypertrophied myocardium from patients needing SRT, suggesting that androgen-linked metabolic remodelling plays a role in advanced obstructive physiology in HCM."

Traditional management strategies follow a step-by-step approach, prioritizing guideline-directed medical therapy (GDMT) and reserving interventional (surgical or percutaneous) options only in case of persistent symptoms or worsening HF after GDMT. However, greater experience with the use of percutaneous procedures, even in high-risk patients, could support a more integrated approach, which exploits the synergistic effects of medical and interventional therapies to increase the tolerability of one vs the other, thereby improving quality of life and outcomes through their synergic effects. This expert opinion paper summarizes current data and evolving practices in the management of VHD in patients with HF, including secondary mitral regurgitation, aortic stenosis, aortic regurgitation, and tricuspid regurgitation."

This study aims to review the literature on the use of Cook Medical Custom-Made Devices (CMDs) incorporating an inner retrograde LSA branch and report a single-center experience with this approach.
A retrospective analysis was conducted on patients treated in a single high-volume aortic referral center between November 2023 and August 2025. Patients included underwent Zone 2 TEVAR using a CMD stent graft with a single retrograde inner LSA branch (Cook Medical, Bjaeverskov, Denmark). Literature on CMDs for LSA preservation was also reviewed to contextualize findings.
Sixty patients underwent LSA revascularization in Zone 2 TEVAR, including 28 carotid-subclavian bypasses, eight in-situ fenestrations, 16 off-the-shelf branched devices, and eight Cook Medical CMDs, of which seven single LSA inner branches and one was incorporated with a fenestration. All LSA branch CMD cases were elective, with a 100% technical success rate. Two early reinterventions were performed: one for a persistent Type Ia endoleak managed with proximal coil embolization, and another for a Type IIIc endoleak treated by relining the LSA stent graft. One postoperative death occurred due to cerebral embolization. There were no instances of branch occlusion, device migration, or target vessel stenosis during a short-term follow-up.
CMD LSA branch endografts represent a valid solution for complex Zone 2 aortic pathology, offering full endovascular repair with individualized anatomical adaptation over off-the-shelf solutions. Our outcomes demonstrate early feasibility with high technical success; however, further studies with larger cohorts and long-term follow-ups are warranted."

This review presents a comprehensive synthesis of its pharmacologic mechanisms, hemodynamic effects, clinical applications, and potential adverse outcomes in this complex setting. We delineate clinical scenarios in which vasopressin may be advantageous, critically appraise the current evidence, and support a physiology-guided, individualized approach to treatment. Patient profiles that may particularly benefit include advanced or mixed cardiogenic shock with low systemic vascular resistance, tachyarrhythmia-related shock, post-cardiac arrest shock, acute right ventricular failure, mitral stenosis, prosthetic mitral valve thrombosis, dynamic left ventricular outflow tract obstruction, Takotsubo syndrome, and severe aortic stenosis. In these settings, vasopressin's non-adrenergic mechanism of action may improve perfusion pressure while mitigating catecholamine-related adverse effects. We also outline clinical scenarios of cardiogenic shock in which vasopressin use may be detrimental and discuss its implications in patients receiving mechanical circulatory support. Finally, we highlight the need for prospective studies to optimize vasopressor selection in this high-risk and heterogeneous population."
PubMed,aortic stenosis,Post-Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement Acute Severe Mitral Regurgitation: A Case Report.,AlMothana Manasrah; Farid Khan; Priyanka Singh; Alon Yarkoni,10.1002/ccd.70522,2026-02-18,Catheterization and cardiovascular interventions : official journal of the Society for Cardiac Angiography & Interventions,"Transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) has become the standard of care for patients with severe aortic stenosis (AS) who are at elevated surgical risk. Although generally well tolerated, TAVR can be associated with uncommon but potentially serious complications, including acute mitral regurgitation (MR) following valve deployment.
We present the case of a 94-year-old woman with symptomatic severe AS who developed acute, new-onset severe MR immediately after TAVR. Preprocedural imaging had shown no significant MR. The patient experienced acute hemodynamic compromise with pulmonary edema and hypotension, necessitating prompt medical intervention with vasopressors, diuretics, and noninvasive ventilation. Postoperative imaging excluded structural mitral valve (MV) damage and suggested impaired leaflet coaptation. The severity of MR improved markedly over the subsequent days, and at 1-year follow-up, only trace MR was observed. The likely mechanism was transient ischemic dysfunction of the posteromedial papillary muscle due to hypotension.
New-onset severe MR following TAVR is an uncommon yet clinically significant complication that necessitates prompt identification and intervention. In cases where intraprocedural hypotension occurs, transient papillary muscle dysfunction should be considered as a potential underlying mechanism, particularly when the MR is reversible and not associated with structural MV abnormalities or evidence of myocardial ischemia."

PubMed,aortic stenosis,Influence of breathing-induced motion on hemodynamics following fEVAR with renal stenting.,Alessandra Corvo; Stéphane Avril; Alberto Aliseda; Stéphan Haulon; Fanette Chassagne,10.1007/s10439-026-04024-w,2026-02-18,Annals of biomedical engineering,"Fenestrated EndoVascular Aneurysm Repair (fEVAR) has been demonstrated to be an excellent treatment for complex abdominal aortic aneurysms. In addition to the aortic endograft, bridging stent-grafts (SG) are deployed within the renal arteries, resulting in rare but serious renal complications. This study aims to assess renal artery hemodynamic changes post-fEVAR, including the effect of respiration-induced renal deformation.
Pre-fEVAR models were segmented from CT scans (patients involved in clinical trial NCT04724863), while post-fEVAR models were created from structural simulations that included respiratory-induced deformation. Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulations applied inflow velocity waveforms at the supraceliac aorta and Windkessel boundary conditions at the outlets. A dynamic mesh was implemented to reproduce renal deformation during breathing, and inspiration and expiration static configurations were analyzed.
Post-fEVAR reduction in renal artery flow was detected, together with recirculation regions near the SG protrusions into the aorta. Higher time-averaged wall shear stress was observed in the unstented section of the renal arteries. The comparison between static and dynamic mesh simulations reveals that renal artery motion has negligible effect on the flow. Finally, velocity fields were compared to metrics used clinically to assess renal stenosis, to build a model for the prediction of renal complications in silico.
This study evaluates the impact of renal stenting on flow, accounting for respiratory-induced deformation. It shows a minimal influence on overall hemodynamics, but significant reduction of renal flow post-fEVAR. Future studies should evaluate a patient cohort who experienced renal complications to correlate CFD metrics with post-operative clinical outcomes."

MEDLINE, Embase, Web of Science and Cochrane CENTRAL were searched from inception to June 28, 2024. Vascular diseases studied, data sources, methods and outcomes were recorded. Critical appraisal was conducted using the PROBAST and TRIPOD+AI guidelines. Overall, 288 studies were included with an exponential rise from 2017 onwards. The majority of studies addressed aortic pathologies (33%), carotid stenosis (30%), and foot ulcers (25%), while few focused on peripheral artery disease (6%). Most were observational using retrospective (81%) or prospective data (15%), and one clinical trial was included. Dice coefficient (51%) and accuracy (36%) were the most commonly reported performance metrics with infrequent use of AUROC (17%). Only 15% of studies had a low risk of bias and overall adherence to the TRIPOD+AI checklist was relatively poor at 57%. Overall, we suggest greater attention to peripheral artery disease; for dice coefficient and AUROC to be used in segmentation and discrimination tasks, respectively; and for the TRIPOD+AI statement to be consulted early on during model development."

In this retrospective single-centre study, 129 consecutive patients with echocardiographically confirmed severe aortic stenosis (mean age, 83.1 ± 6.3 years; 46 men, 83 women) underwent same-session ECG-gated (3 mm) and Non-ECG-gated (5 mm) non-contrast CT between 21 March 2020 and 16 April 2025. AVC was quantified using Agatston and volume methods. Agreement between non-gated and gated scores was assessed by Pearson correlation, Bland-Altman analysis, and Deming regression. Diagnostic performance for sex-specific Agatston thresholds (≥2000 units men, ≥1300 units women) was evaluated using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis.
Volume scores on non-ECG-gated CT correlated more strongly with ECG-gated CT scores than Agatston scores (r = 0.95 vs. 0.69, P < 0.001). Bland-Altman analysis demonstrated substantial negative bias and proportional error for Agatston scores (mean difference, -921.1 units; limits of agreement, -2900.8 to +1058.6), while volume scores showed minimal bias and no proportional error (+16.5 mm3; -648.5 to +681.4). Deming regression confirmed closer agreement for volume scores (slope, 1.02; R2 = 0.90). ROC analysis showed higher area under the curve values for volume scores (0.976 for men, 0.975 for women) than for Agatston scores (0.946 and 0.967, respectively).
Non-ECG-gated CT enables reliable quantification of aortic valve calcium in severe aortic stenosis. Volume scoring demonstrates superior agreement and diagnostic performance compared with Agatston scoring, supporting its use as a robust, density-independent metric for opportunistic assessment of AVC on routine chest CT."

Case reports,"A myocardial bridge causes a specific intraluminal flow pattern and can affect endothelial function, response to vasoactive agents, development of atherosclerosis and a patient's prognosis. Additionally, the reliability of preoperative functional assessment, including fractional flow reserve (FFR) and reasonable patient's selection for myotomy or coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) may be controversial.
A 63-year-old man presented with shortness of breath. Echocardiography revealed severe aortic regurgitation and left ventricular dilatation. Coronary angiography revealed a myocardial bridge in the anterior descending artery (LAD) without atherosclerosis. The myocardial bridge caused 75% stenosis in systole due to compression and kinking, and 25% stenosis in diastole by visual assessment, with a FFR of 0.80 and instantaneous wave-free ratio of 0.88. Quantitative assessment showed a minimal luminal diameter of 0.79 mm in systole, corresponding to 72.7% stenosis. A median sternotomy was performed. Following aortic cross-clamping and aortic valve replacement, the myocardial bridge was completely divided. However, the unroofed segment appeared thin and diffusely spastic. The unroofed segment of the LAD was longitudinally incised and enlarged using a free right internal thoracic artery (ITA) patch, which was ∼25 × 12 mm. There were no post-operative complications. Post-operative coronary angiography confirmed the enlargement of the unroofed segment. Vascular remodelling caused normalization of the diameter 6 months later.
Myotomy concomitant with patch plasty using the ITA can be effective and durable option for myocardial bridges, particularly when expected CABG patency may be suboptimal because of moderate diastolic stenosis or a distal myocardial bridge location."

Zeitschrift fur Gefasskrankheiten,"Background: To evaluate safety, technical success, and long-term outcomes of endovascular therapy (EVT) in severely calcified aortoiliac occlusive disease (AIOD), focusing on lesion characteristics and the presence of coral reef aorta (CRA). Patients and methods: This single-center retrospective study included 216 patients with angiographically confirmed calcified abdominal aortic stenosis (mean PACSS 3.7 ± 0.8) treated with EVT between 2005 and 2023. Of these, 33 patients had coral reef aorta (CRA). Patients were stratified by lesion location and CRA presence. Primary endpoints were 30-day adverse events and technical success (residual stenosis <30%). Secondary endpoints were major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE), major adverse limb events (MALE), and all-cause mortality. Cox regression identified predictors of outcome. Results: Technical success was achieved in 81.9%. Thirty-day mortality was 0.5%. At 10 years, freedom from MACE was significantly lower in patients with non-bifurcation abdominal aortic stenosis (56% vs. 76%; aHR 2.13, p < .05) and lowest in CRA (30% vs. 71%; aHR 3.17, p < .05). Independent predictors of MACE were CRA, chronic total occlusion (aHR 3.38, 95% CI 1.57-7.29), critical limb-threatening ischemia (aHR 3.67, 95% CI 1.74-7.75), and age (aHR 1.06 per year, 95% CI 1.01-1.11). MALE was more frequent in patients with peripheral arterial disease (aHR 2.07, 95% CI 1.12-3.81), CRA (aHR 2.51, 95% CI 1.17-5.40), and current smokers (aHR 5.10, 95% CI 1.23-21.0). Conclusions: CRA and non-bifurcation abdominal aortic stenosis are associated with reduced long-term freedom from MACE after EVT. These findings define high-risk subgroups within calcified AIOD and highlight the prognostic value of anatomical lesion characteristics for treatment planning and follow-up."

The aim of this study was to evaluate the safety of NDD following TAVR in nonagenarians. From November 2011 to May 2024, a total of 104 nonagenarian patients underwent transfemoral TAVR at our institution and 32 of them (31.7%) were discharged the day after the index procedure. NDD patients were compared to patients discharged later. The primary endpoints were device success and early safety according to Valve Academic Research Consortium-3 (VARC-3) criteria.
After propensity score matching, 29 well balanced pairs of patients were selected. At 30 days, NDD patients showed a higher early safety (93.1% vs. 69.0%; P = 0.04) and similar device success compared to those discharged later (89.7% vs. 100%; P = 0.48). No differences in all-cause death (3.4% vs. 17.2%; P = 0.20) and rehospitalization (13.8% vs. 13.8%; P = 1.00) were reported in NDD and no-NDD patients at 1 year.
In conclusion, NDD after TAVR has been shown to be a safe and effective strategy also in nonagenarian recipients, in which a shorter length of stay may help to avoid hospitalization-related complications."

Here, we present the first data indicating a role for caldesmon-1 (CALD1) in calcified aortic valve disease (CAVD) pathogenesis. Analysis of publicly available single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) datasets revealed that CALD1 shows prominent upregulation in aortic valve stenosis (AS) cases when compared to normal subjects. Histological examination demonstrated that CALD1 protein expression is elevated in calcified AS valves and co-localises with α-smooth muscle actin (a myofibroblast biomarker) and vimentin, indicating its association with activated valvular interstitial cells (VICs). Bioinformatic analysis showed that CALD1-positive cells predominantly synthesize extracellular matrix components, including COL1A1. Functional experiments using CALD1-depleted VICs revealed that CALD1 is required for maintaining spindle-shaped morphology, actin polymerisation, and proliferative capacity. Moreover, CALD1 loss significantly impaired osteoblast differentiation and attenuated VIC calcification. Bulk RNA-seq combined with pathway analysis demonstrated that CALD1-mediated actin polymerisation positively regulates key osteogenic and valvulopathy-related genes, including RUNX2 and ALPL. Collectively, these findings identify CALD1 as a novel regulator of VIC phenotypic plasticity and osteogenic transition during CAVD progression, providing mechanistic insight and a target for potential AS therapy."

With rising TAVR numbers, appropriate patient selection becomes more important. Identifying patients with the highest long-term benefit from the procedure is especially challenging in this elderly patient cohort. Barthel Index (BI) is a commonly used tool to assess the patients' capability of activities of daily life.
In this single-center study, we analyzed BI of patients receiving TAVR for severe symptomatic AS at our center in 2018 and 2019. BI had been collected by nursing personnel during clinical routine and 475 patients could be analyzed. Median BI was 90 points and was used as cut-off to define two groups of patients: lesser frail patients with higher BI (≥ 90; n = 255) and more frail patients with lower BI (< 90; n = 220). Patients with lower BI were older (83 vs. 80 years; p < 0.01) with higher surgical risk score (STS-score 4.1% vs. 2.5%; p < 0.01), and worse renal function (CKD in 49.5% vs. 31.8%; p < 0.01). Long-term survival differed significantly: only 117 patients (53.1%) in the low BI group were still alive 4-years after TAVR vs. 204 patients (80.0%) in the higher BI group. Further analyses revealed that combining STS score and BI significantly improved mortality prediction (C index for STS score 0.626; C index for combined STS score and BI 0.683; p < 0.01).
This is the first analysis evaluating the prognostic value of BI on long-term survival after TAVR. Albeit assessing only the patient's functional status and no detailed medical history, BI is a strong discriminator for frail patients. Moreover, it allows identification of patients at higher risk of mortality within the first 4 years after TAVR and should therefore be considered for evaluation of patients with severe AS."

It focuses on indications, imaging-guided sizing, operative technique, outcomes, and complications to clarify where SuAVR meaningfully complements or substitutes conventional surgical aortic valve replacement and transcatheter aortic valve implantation.
Modern studies show SuAVR consistently shortens cardiopulmonary bypass and cross-clamp times by 25-50%, produces low discharge gradients and larger effective orifice areas, and is particularly advantageous in elderly patients, small annuli, redo operations, and concomitant procedures. Routine multidetector-row computed tomography perimeter sizing and meticulous annular decalcification have reduced clinically relevant paravalvular leak to low single digits, whereas higher implantation and conservative ballooning have lowered permanent pacemaker implantation rates toward single digits. Mid-term durability is encouraging, with 95-97% freedom from structural valve deterioration and 94-97% freedom from reintervention at 5  years. Conduction-system injury, transient thrombocytopenia, and residual pacemaker risk remain the principal trade-offs.
With Heart-Team selection and standardized computed tomography-first workflows and implant technique, SuAVR is a valuable surgical option that expands minimally invasive and complex surgical candidacy. Definitive adoption requires randomized long-term comparisons and standardized pacemaker-avoidance protocols."

To identify the key predictors associated with hospital readmission in older adults after TAVR.
This retrospective study analyzed the clinical data of 558 older adults who underwent TAVR between 2018 and 2023 at a tertiary hospital in Seoul. Statistical analyses included descriptive statistics, chi-square tests, and logistic regression using Statistical Package for Social Sciences 29.
Of the 558 patients, 21.7% were readmitted. Significant predictors included male sex, hospital stay exceeding 10 days, high N-terminal pro B-type natriuretic peptide levels, and elevated age-adjusted Charlson comorbidity index scores.
This study emphasizes the role of patient severity in predicting readmission after TAVR in older adults. Key risk factors include elevated cardiac biomarkers, high comorbidity, prolonged hospitalization, and male sex. Integrating these into discharge planning may enhance nurse-led interventions and support safer care transition."

Data on the success of restoring sinus rhythm (SR) and subsequent MR/TR improvement remain limited. This study reports findings from the prospective Berlin-FMTR registry, which included patients with AF and newly diagnosed moderate or worse functional MR or TR undergoing cardioversion or ablation.
Eighty patients (46% male, median age 73.7 years) with persistent AF and at least moderate MR or TR underwent rhythm control via cardioversion or catheter ablation. Follow-up assessments were conducted at 3 and 12 months. After a mean of 11.6 ± 9 months, 45 patients (56%) remained in SR. At 12 months, 56% of patients with baseline moderate or worse MR improved to mild MR. Among those in SR, this rose to 77% versus 38% with AF recurrence. Only patients in SR showed significant improvements in LVEF, left atrial size, and heart failure symptoms. Similarly, 54% of patients with at least moderate TR at baseline improved to mild TR at 12 months. Among those maintaining SR, 70% showed TR improvement, compared to 35% with recurrent AF. Right ventricular function (TAPSE, RV diameter/volume) improved only in those in SR.
Restoring and maintaining SR led to significant reductions in MR and TR severity and cardiac remodeling. These findings support rhythm control as a key therapeutic strategy in patients with AF and functional MR/TR."

However, the long-term clinical impact of MR persistence or progression has not been well stratified. We aimed to evaluate the proportion, clinical benefits, and prognostic value of maintaining mild MR one year after M-TEER.
This multicenter registry-based analysis included 1,865 patients who achieved mild MR at discharge following M-TEER. At one year, patients were classified as having stable MR (≤ mild) or worsening MR (≥ moderate). The frequency of left atrial (LA) and left ventricular (LV) reverse remodeling and tricuspid regurgitation (TR) improvement were assessed from baseline to one year. Clinical endpoints-including all-cause mortality and heart failure hospitalization-were evaluated beyond one year after M-TEER up to two years. Worsening MR occurred in 28.4% of patients. Compared with the worsening MR group, the stable MR group demonstrated significantly more frequent LA and LV reverse remodeling (38.4% vs. 28.1%, and 44.7% vs. 31.1%, respectively; both p<0.001).　Improvement in TR (≥ grade 1) was also more prevalent in the stable MR group (32.4% vs. 20.6%, p<0.001). Worsening MR was independently associated with increased risk of adverse clinical outcomes (hazard ratio: 2.02; 95% confidence interval: 1.26-3.23; p=0.003).
Maintaining MR within mild at one-year post-M-TEER is associated with favorable cardiac reverse remodeling and improved clinical prognosis. These findings underscore the importance of long-term MR surveillance and its implications for outcome optimization following M-TEER."

The purpose of this study was to evaluate 2-year survival and MR recurrence in patients who underwent MV repair for DMR with concomitant tricuspid valve (TV) disease between 2016 and 2018.
This is a post hoc analysis of outcomes from a randomized trial (N = 401; 39 sites) evaluating the effects of TV repair during MV surgery for patients with DMR and moderate or less tricuspid regurgitation. Eighty-seven patients (21.7%) were excluded because they underwent MV replacement (32 planned and 9 conversions) or did not have isolated DMR or evaluable echocardiographic data during 2 years. The primary endpoint was a composite of the incidence of all-cause mortality, recurrent severe MR, or MV reoperation (ie, treatment failure) during 2 years. Multivariable modeling identified risk factors for recurrent MR.
Among 314 eligible patients (median age: 67.4; female: 24.2%), 1.0% (3 of 307) had moderate MR and 0.7% (2 of 307) had severe MR at discharge. Thirty-day all-cause mortality rate was 1.0%. At 2 years, 3.5% (11 of 314) had died, and 2.2% (7 of 314) had MV reoperation. Among 295 survivors free of MV reoperation with evaluable echocardiograms, 9.2% (27 of 295) had moderate MR, 1.4% (4 of 295) had severe MR, and 2.5% (7 of 275) had a mean MV gradient >5 mm Hg. The incidence of death, MV reoperation, or severe MR during 2 years was 8.0% (25 of 313). Patients with anterior or bileaflet MV pathology were at higher risk for treatment failure compared with patients with posterior leaflet pathology (OR: 2.48; 95% CI: 1.09-5.68; P = 0.03).
In this international trial with echocardiographic core laboratory adjudication, the rate of survival free from MV reoperation or any episode of severe MR during 2 years was 92% in patients with DMR and concomitant TV disease. These outcomes show that surgical repair achieves high success and durability during 2 years in these patients, providing a contemporary benchmark for clinical decision-making and future trials.

We present the case of a 46-year-old male with post-myocarditis dilated cardiomyopathy, severely reduced left ventricular ejection fraction (21%), severe functional mitral and tricuspid regurgitation, and NYHA class IV heart failure. Despite optimal medical therapy, including inotropic support, the patient progressed to multiorgan dysfunction necessitating renal replacement therapy. A HeartMate 3 LVAD was implanted as a bridge to transplantation. The postoperative course was complicated by severe right ventricular failure, requiring prolonged inotropic support and careful hemodynamic management. Despite these challenges, the patient successfully underwent orthotopic heart transplantation. His postoperative evolution was favorable, with stable graft function and good clinical recovery documented during follow-up.
Right ventricular failure remains a major complication following LVAD implantation, significantly impacting outcomes. While LVADs have revolutionized the management of end-stage heart failure, heart transplantation continues to represent the definitive therapy offering superior long-term survival."

An 82-year-old woman with permanent atrial fibrillation and severe mitral and tricuspid valve regurgitation presented with complete atrioventricular block and a ventricular escape rhythm at 28 bpm. A temporary transvenous pacing catheter inserted via the right internal jugular vein failed to achieve consistent ventricular capture and became entrapped at 45 cm, forming a knot near the venous introducer. Given the patient's frailty and high surgical risk, a multidisciplinary team opted for a fully percutaneous strategy for removal. After definitive pacemaker implantation, the knotted catheter was successfully retrieved using a stepwise approach: engagement of the loop with a deflectable ablation catheter, externalization through a femoral sheath, and extraction using a 13-F dilator sheath to minimize venous trauma.
This case highlights procedural pitfalls during emergency temporary pacing without fluoroscopy and illustrates a safe, creative percutaneous solution for knot retrieval using tools familiar to electrophysiology and lead extraction operators."

Preoperative echo-cardiography showed a hyperdynamic left ventricle with preserved systolic function. During surgery, the patient developed hypotension, tachycardia, and desaturation. Transesophageal echocardiography revealed severe mitral regurgitation and turbulent flow consistent with left ventricular outflow tract obstruction. Hemodynamic stability was achieved through vasopressor therapy and volume management. The patient developed pulmonary edema but subsequently recovered and was discharged on day 35. This case demonstrates the importance of intraoperative transesophageal echo-cardiography to identify left ventricular outflow tract obstruction during liver transplant. Dynamic left ventricular outflow tract obstruction should be considered in hemodynamic collapse, and early echocardiographic assessment can guide effective intervention."

In a retrospective monocentric analysis of patients who received TMTVR, a modified version of the essential frailty toolset (EFT) was calculated from four categories: gait speed, cognitive impairment, hemoglobin, and serum albumin. Cox proportional hazards models were used to examine the association between EFT frailty and all-cause mortality.
A total of 206 patients were analyzed; median age was 76 [72-82] years, and 55% were male. According to the EFT, 49 patients (24%) were non-frail, 127 patients (62%) were pre-frail, and 30 patients (15%) were frail. Estimated survival at 2 years was 88 ± 5% for non-frail patients, 74 ± 5% for pre-frail patients, and 62 ± 10% for frail patients, with a hazard ratio of 1.54 (95% CI 1.16-2.04; p = 0.003) per standard deviation of EFT score. This association remained virtually unchanged when adjusted for other risk factors and Fried physical frailty, but disappeared when adjusted for the multidimensional prognostic index (MPI), which is based on a comprehensive geriatric assessment. A stepwise approach using EFT in all patients and MPI only in pre-frail EFT patients resulted in two risk categories with a 4.4-fold (95% CI 2.3-9.4) difference in 2-year mortality between categories.
The EFT has prognostic value for patients undergoing TMTVR. Due to its simplicity, the EFT could serve as a first-line frailty assessment tool to guide therapeutic decision-making, potentially in a stepwise approach with MPI."

Although they are traditionally linked to distinct ""rheumatogenic"" and ""nephritogenic"" strains and have different immunopathogenesis, their simultaneous occurrence in the same patient is extremely rare and the mechanism has not been fully elucidated.
In this study, a 15-year-old male patient who developed ankle pain and edema of the eyelids and extremities following a history of throat infection is presented. Laboratory findings were consistent with nephritic syndrome and elevated ASO levels, and echocardiography revealed rheumatic carditis with multivalve involvement. The patient was diagnosed with concurrent APSGN and ARF, and was treated with benzathine penicillin, oral prednisolone, furosemide, and antihypertensive therapy. While kidney parameters returned to normal during follow-up, mild valvular regurgitation findings persisted.
Systematic review research was conducted in the following four databases: PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science and Google Scholar published from inception to September 15, 2025. A total of 36 cases were analyzed for clinical and laboratory characteristics, treatment protocols, and follow-up results. The presented case was evaluated comparatively with these data.
Studies meeting the following criteria were included: (1) full-text articles available in English, (2) case reports, case series or letters to the editor, and (3) information provided on patient demographics, clinical presentation, laboratory findings, treatment and follow-up results. Articles that did not meet these criteria or were review articles without original case data were excluded.
Of the 36 cases analyzed, 86.1% were pediatric. The most common clinical findings were edema (63.8%), fever (55.5%), and hypertension (55.5%). The most common cardiac finding was mitral regurgitation (32/36, 88.8%). Corticosteroids were used in 16/36 cases (44.4%). Kidney recovery was reported in 26/27 cases with follow-up (96.2%), whereas persistent cardiac sequelae were reported in 19/27 cases (70.3%), with mitral regurgitation being the most frequent residual lesion (16/27, 59.2%).
The simultaneous occurrence of APSGN and ARF is a rare but clinically important entity requiring a multidisciplinary approach. While the kidney prognosis is generally favorable, cardiac sequelae frequently persist and may progress. Therefore, after acute nephritic manifestations are controlled, clinical attention should shift to long-term cardiac surveillance and secondary prevention; in patients presenting with APSGN, clinicians should maintain a low threshold for echocardiography when clinical, electrocardiographic, or systemic findings raise suspicion for concurrent rheumatic carditis."

This retrospective study evaluated 95 patients who underwent surgical secundum ASD closure, all of whom received preoperative and postoperative transthoracic echocardiography (TTE). Patient characteristics from preoperative TTE, as well as sex and age, were analyzed to identify predictors of MR. Follow-up TTE was conducted at 1 month, 3 months, 6 months, 1 year, and 2 years post-procedure, with all patients successfully completing the 2-year follow-up.
The univariate logistic regression analysis indicated that age, gender, LA, RA-VD, RA-HD, RV, ASD diameter, AS diameter, PAP, and peak tricuspid regurgitation velocity may serve as predictors of MR worsening. Subsequent multiple logistic regression analysis revealed that LA size was an independent predictor of MR worsening and acted as a protective factor. Our research indicates a marked reduction in right cardiac system after ASD closure, with significant remodeling of the LA within the first 6 months. The relative size of the LV increased notably within 2 years. The postoperative changes in LA differed between the worsening MR group and the non-worsening MR group.
In conclusion, 'prophylactic' mitral annuloplasty during ASD surgery may prove advantageous for patients with an enlarged LA, and the presence of additional risk factors associated with mitral annuloplasty heightens the recommendation for concurrent intervention."

However, there is limited evidence on its effectiveness in achieving reverse remodeling. Our aim was to assess the effects of TEER over time and to compare the effects of TEER plus GDMT vs. GDMT alone on echocardiographic parameters.
A systematic search of MEDLINE, EMBASE, and CENTRAL was conducted from inception to November 16, 2023. Eligible studies included patients with SMR treated with TEER and echocardiographic follow-ups. We evaluated changes in left ventricular end-diastolic diameter (LVEDD), left ventricular end-systolic diameter (LVESD), left ventricular end-diastolic volume (LVEDV), left ventricular end-systolic volume (LVESV), left atrial volume (LAV), left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) and NTproBNP levels.
Of 9,290 identified studies, 38 met inclusion criteria. After TEER, statistically significant reductions were observed in LVEDD (-1.63 mm), LVESD (-1.20 mm), LVEDV (-14.21 mL), and LVESV (-9.24 mL). Changes in LAV (-5.70 mL) and LVEF (+1.10%) were not statistically or clinically meaningful. NT-proBNP decreased substantially (-1,340 pg/mL). In comparative analyses, TEER plus GDMT did not show statistically significant differences vs. GDMT alone for any parameter, including LVEDD (-1.02 mm), LVEDV (-11.98 mL), LVEF (-0.14%), and LVESV (-5.29 mL). TEER reduced grade 3-4 MR from 99% to 9%.

TEER results in statistically significant but clinically small changes in echocardiographic parameters, and no clear advantage over GDMT alone. These findings should be interpreted with caution given the high heterogeneity and low certainty of evidence. Further studies are needed to define which SMR patient subgroups may derive meaningful reverse-remodeling benefit from TEER.

However, its full impact on the cardiovascular system, especially on right heart function, is not yet fully understood. Understanding this relationship is important because the right ventricle (RV) is critical for maintaining cardiovascular function. Dysfunction of the RV, which may be contributed by conditions like MR, is strongly associated with poor clinical outcomes. Despite its importance, comprehensively studying MR's effect on the RV has been challenging due to the complex, interdependent nature of cardiovascular dynamics, limited patient data, and the difficulty in synthesizing disparate information to clarify the left heart-right heart connection.
The primary goal of this study is to investigate the effects of MR on cardiovascular hemodynamics and RV function by integrating 3D models of the left heart with a closed-loop 0D models of the entire cardiovascular system. We further conduct detailed analyses using patient-specific models to explore how various system modifications impact the RV, providing insights into the nuanced effects of MR on the right heart.
This analysis provides several clinically relevant insights. First, progressive MR markedly increases RV afterload and predisposes the RV to dysfunction, even when intrinsic RV contractility is preserved or enhanced. Second, MR-specific severity indices and left-heart metrics alone fail to capture the true burden on the right heart; RV impairment can progress despite stable or only modestly changing MR descriptors. Finally, these findings highlight the need to incorporate direct assessment of RV structure and function into the evaluation of MR, as RV vulnerability plays a critical role in determining patient risk and guiding management decisions."

Case reports,"Ring annuloplasty failure after mitral valve repair frequently occurs after long-term follow up. Valve-in-ring transcatheter mitral valve replacement (TMVR) is an emerging therapeutic option for this high surgical risk condition. While a dual-chamber implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) is frequently utilized for sudden cardiac death prevention in this population, valve-in-ring TMVR intraprocedural difficulty associated with atrial lead presence is rarely known.
A 76-year-old male, with history of coronary artery bypass graft surgery and mitral ring annuloplasty experienced recurrence of severe mitral regurgitation. Due to high surgical mortality risk and unsuitable anatomy of mitral valve for transcatheter edge-to-edge repair, this patient underwent mitral valve-in-ring TMVR. Using transvenous-transseptal access, a 26 mm SAPIEN-3 prosthetic valve was delivered to the mitral area. However, as the patient has a history of dual-chamber ICD, a prosthetic valve cannot pass through during delivery, due to atrial lead entanglement. To overcome this difficulty, atrial septum balloon dilatation manoeuvre was done to facilitate valve delivery, which resulted in successful prosthetic valve delivery and deployment at the mitral position with satisfactory results.
Valve delivery difficulty due to atrial lead entanglement can occur during valve-in-ring TMVR in patients with dual-chamber ICD implantation history. Atrial septum balloon dilatation can be performed to overcome this problem."

Truncating variants in exons 1-29 typically produce non-syndromic SVAS through elastin haploinsufficiency, whereas C-terminal variants are linked to autosomal dominant cutis laxa. However, clinically and mechanistically well-characterized variants in the distal part of this ""stenotic zone,"" such as exon 28, remain uncommon.
We conducted a retrospective family-based case report with standardized clinical evaluation, serial echocardiography, and trio whole-exome sequencing with Sanger confirmation and conservation analysis.
A female infant presented at 1 month with severe sinotubular junction narrowing (Z-score -4.8, peak gradient 24 mmHg), severe peripheral pulmonary artery stenosis, a small atrial septal defect, and moderate mitral regurgitation. Her father had severe SVAS with mild PPAS and prior aortic root enlargement, without syndromic features. Trio sequencing identified a novel heterozygous ELN exon 28 frameshift variant, c.1879_1883dup (p.Ala629LeufsTer15), inherited from the father. Ala629 is fully conserved, and the duplication introduces a premature stop codon, consistent with nonsense-mediated decay and elastin haploinsufficiency. At 9 months, SVAS progressed (peak gradient 35 mmHg), while PPAS gradients regressed by >40%.
This novel exon 28 ELN frameshift expands the non-syndromic SVAS spectrum and illustrates a characteristic pattern of progressive aortic stenosis with improving PPAS, supporting ELN testing and targeted longitudinal surveillance in similar patients and families."

We evaluated the value of right heart catheterization (RHC) and the 2022 ESC/ERS pulmonary hypertension (PH) definition prior to a mitral valve procedure for the prediction of PH several months thereafter. We studied 274 patients (mean age 68 ± 11 years) with at least moderate MR (84% degenerative, 11% functional, 5% combined) undergoing RHC (baseline) followed by surgical (70%) or transcatheter (30%) valve repair/replacement who had an echocardiogram after a median follow-up of 3 months. PH was defined as a mean pulmonary artery pressure (mPAP) > 20 mmHg and was subclassified by mean pulmonary artery wedge pressure (mPAWP) and pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR). The PH follow-up probability was assessed by peak tricuspid regurgitant velocity and indirect PH signs. At baseline, 143/274 (52%) patients had any PH: 40 had isolated post-capillary, 65 had combined pre- and post-capillary (CpcPH), 27 had pre-capillary, and 11 had unclassified PH. Follow-up PH probability was low in 149, intermediate in 73, or high in 42 patients. There was a progressive increase in baseline mPAP, mPAWP, and PVR (p < 0.001 for all) in patients with low, intermediate or high follow-up PH probability. Patients with baseline CpcPH had a nearly 11-fold higher risk (odds ratio 10.7) for a high follow-up PH probability compared to those without PH. In conclusion, in MR patients the hemodynamic constellation according to the 2022 ESC/ERS PH definition predicts the PH probability several months after a mitral valve procedure."

This study aimed to evaluate factors affecting the durability of bio-prosthetic pulmonary valves, with an emphasis on the angle of implantation as well as age, size or materials of prosthetic valve.
Of the 50 consecutive patients with TOF who underwent redo-PVR due to prosthetic valvular failure (PVF) between January 2001 and May 2020, 36 had good images for measuring implantation angle on computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging, or angiography. We defined the angle of implantation as the angle between an imaginary axial line from the center of the prosthetic valve and an imaginary parallel line from the point where the line meets the anterior wall of main pulmonary artery on sagittal planes.
The median age at total repair of TOF was 13.4 months (interquartile range [IQR], 8.4-22.3 months) and the median age at initial PVR was 10.1 years (IQR, 8.4-12.2 years). The mean interval from initial PVR to redo-PVR was 10.1±3.6 years and follow-up duration was 15.6±2.5 years after initial PVR. The implantation angle (<30° or ≥45°) was significantly related with early (<10 years after PVR) PVF.
The risk for early PVF was relatively lower when the implantation angle was between 30° and 45°. We should be careful to implant a prosthetic valve with an adequate angle to maintain a laminar flow in the pulmonary position for better durability."

We reported the case of a 22-year-old female with a history of pulmonary valve stenosis for which she underwent balloon dilatation at the age of five years. She presented with primary amenorrhoea and a history of anosmia was noted. Hormonal investigations revealed hypogonadotropic hypogonadism and a hypothalamic-pituitary MRI identified complete agenesis of the olfactory bulbs. A diagnosis of KS was made. Genetic testing for the KAL1 gene was negative. The patient was put on hormone replacement therapy in order to achieve her puberty and promote general well-being Conclusion: This case represents the first reported association between KS and pulmonary valve stenosis, highlighting the need for further molecular biological research to explore other genes that may explain this connection."

We examined whether the number, components, and complexity of CKM domains influence outcomes and years of life lost (YLL) in patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation (AF) receiving direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs).
We included 17,378 AF patients (mean age 76.1±10.7 years; 40.9% women) on DOACs from a multicenter Taiwanese database (2012-2021). Patients were followed until outcomes, death, or study end.
Overall, 18.2%, 35.0%, 32.2%, and 14.6% of patients had 0, 1, 2, and 3 CKM domains. Women more often exhibited kidney, metabolic, or combined domains. Clinical risks rose stepwise with domain number; patients with 3 domains had the highest risks of ischemic stroke/systemic embolic event/acute coronary syndrome (adjusted hazard ratio (aHR) 1.60, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.25-2.05), major bleeding (aHR 2.60, 95%CI 2.00-3.38), heart failure hospitalization (aHR 2.83, 95%CI 2.38-3.37), all-cause mortality (aHR 1.80, 95%CI 1.58-2.06), acute kidney injury (aHR 3.42, 95%CI 2.76-4.25), and major adverse renal events (aHR 20.84, 95%CI 14.14-30.71; all p<0.001).

Cardiac involvement in IM has been associated with worse outcomes, but evidence to support specific screening and management algorithms for cardiac comorbidities in IM is still limited.
For this observational study, 37 adult IM patients recruited from the rheumatology outpatient clinic at Ludwig-Maximilians-University Hospital between August 2023 and January 2025 completed a questionnaire on IM characteristics, management, clinical events, and cardiac disease. Self-reported data were verified and complemented using clinical records. The main study endpoints included the incidence of cardiomyopathy, documented cardiac arrhythmias, and myocardial infarction following the diagnosis of IM.
The median age at last follow-up was 60 years and 35.1% were male. The most common cardiac symptoms reported by study participants included dyspnoea (45.9%), congestion/oedema (40.5%), palpitations (32.4%), and chest pain (18.9%). Arterial hypertension was diagnosed in 27% after IM had been established. Supraventricular and ventricular arrhythmias were documented in 10.8% and 5.4%, respectively. Echocardiography was performed in all study participants, revealing left ventricular diastolic dysfunction in 35.1%. Severe structural heart disease and cardiac adverse events, including acute myocardial infarction, severe valvular disease, and left ventricular systolic dysfunction, were documented only in isolated cases of IM.
Cardiac symptoms, risk factors, and structural abnormalities are prevalent in a substantial proportion of patients with IM. Routine cardiologic assessment, including echocardiography, may be advisable. Further evidence from prospective longitudinal studies is needed to optimize screening algorithms and multidisciplinary management."

This study aimed to identify age- and sex-specific factors influencing prognosis in elderly patients with HFmrEF/HFpEF to improve risk stratification and guide personalized treatment.
This observational, ambispective study was conducted at Papa Giovanni XXIII Hospital, Bergamo, from June 2017 to August 2022, enrolling patients >65 years with HFmrEF/HFpEF [New York Heart Association (NYHA) Class II-IV] according to ESC guidelines. Data collected included demographics, medical history, echocardiograms, and lab tests. Follow-up lasted at least 1 year, with outcomes defined as a composite of all-cause death, urgent heart transplant, HF hospitalization, and emergency department referral for decompensated HF. Findings were validated using the Swedish HF registry with a similar cohort.
Among 2263 HF patients, 971 HFmrEF/HFpEF patients (56.8% males, mean age 79.2 years) were analysed. Males had a higher prevalence of cardiovascular risk factors (e.g. diabetes, obesity, coronary artery disease). The composite outcome occurred more frequently in males (20.6 vs 17.14 per 100 patient years; IRR = 1.20, P = .035). Multivariable analysis identified male sex (HR 1.40, 95% CI 1.13-1.73), age >80 years (HR 1.91, 95% CI 1.22-3.00), higher NYHA class, chronic kidney disease, and severe valvular heart disease as independent predictors of worse outcomes. Males had a 40% higher risk of the outcome compared with women (HR 1.40, 95% CI 1.13-1.73), while patients >80 years old had nearly double the risk compared with those aged 65-70 (HR 1.91, 95% CI 1.22-3.00). The validation analysis in the SwedeHF, adapting the same multiple Cox regression model on 20 950 selected patients, median age 79 years and 57.8% men, and observed between January 2017 and August 2022, showed similar independent risk factors for the composite outcome.

The Empire HF trial was an investigator-initiated, double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled trial of 190 participants with with a left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) of 40% or lower, with New York Heart Association (NYHA) Class I-III symptoms. Participants were randomized to receive either empagliflozin (at a dose of 10 mg once daily) or placebo, on top of recommended therapy for 12 weeks. The primary endpoint of this exploratory sub-study was changes in RV free wall strain (RVFWS) across the whole cohort. RVFWS was also stratified into tertiles based on baseline RVFWS. Secondary endpoints included changes in TAPSE and RV S' velocity.

Although many leaks are small and clinically insignificant, ≈1% to 5% of cases are associated with clinically relevant complications, such as heart failure symptoms and hemolytic anemia. Surgical reoperation is currently considered the first-line option; however, it encompasses high mortality and morbidity risks. In the past years, transcatheter PVL closure has proven to be highly effective when performed in experienced centers. Transcatheter PVL closure requires advanced imaging modalities, specialized materials, and techniques, reflecting the high complexity of the procedure.

Although these changes are physiological, pregnant women with congenital cyanotic heart disease are known to have an increased risk of maternal heart failure, premature birth, intrauterine growth retardation, increased number of cesarean sections, and even maternal death. According to the World Health Organization, cardiovascular diseases (CVD) are the most common cause of indirect maternal deaths. The aim of this study was to assess how well obstetricians and cardiologists manage the care of a pregnant woman with cardiovascular disease.
This survey-based study included 45 obstetricians and 30 cardiologists. There is no ready-made scale or survey on the relevant subject. Therefore, the survey questions were created by us as a result of the literature review. In the survey, questions were asked to examine clinical decision-making tendencies and attitudes of obstetrics and cardiology doctors about recommending induced abortion in the first trimester in pregnant women with various heart diseases and about vaginal labor or cesarean section and infective endocarditis prophylaxis in term pregnancy.
Survey responses from obstetricians and cardiologists revealed significant differences in management approaches. Regarding first-trimester elective termination, cardiologists overwhelmingly recommended it for most conditions (eg, 100% for pulmonary arterial hypertension, 96.7% for EF < 30%/Class III-IV heart failure), whereas obstetricians showed greater hesitation or preference for cardiology consultation (eg, 48.9% had ""no opinion"" for Marfan syndrome with aortic dilatation). For mode of delivery at term, cardiologists predominantly recommended cesarean section, often with infective endocarditis prophylaxis, for specific high-risk conditions (eg, 100% for prosthetic valve, 96.7% for severe PAH). In stark contrast, the majority of obstetricians (ranging from 53.3% to 80.0% across various CVDs) opted to defer the decision by seeking a cardiology consultation. Statistical analysis confirmed significant differences (p<0.05) between the two specialist groups in most management decisions.
CVDs are the most common cause of non-direct maternal deaths. Patients should be closely monitored during pregnancy, labor and puerperium. Pregnant women with CVD should be evaluated by a multidisciplinary committee of competent physicians."

Oxidative stress is recognized as a key driver of atrial remodeling and arrhythmogenesis. Mitochondrial aldehyde dehydrogenase 2 (ALDH2) plays a critical role in detoxifying reactive aldehydes, and the rs671 single-nucleotide polymorphism (G→A, Glu504Lys) markedly reduces enzymatic activity, with a high prevalence in East Asian populations. In this retrospective study, we analyzed 403 NVAF patients and 14,326 hospitalized controls from Meizhou People's Hospital (2016-2020), aged ≥30 years (1:35.5 ratio), and constructed multiple propensity score-matched cohorts (1:15 to 1:2) to examine the association between ALDH2 rs671 and NVAF. The A allele frequency was significantly higher in NVAF patients than in the controls (32.0% vs. 24.2%, P < 0.001), causing an increased NVAF risk (OR = 1.472, 95% CI: 1.266-1.711).

Nationwide, registry based cohort study.
Denmark.
Danish women born between 1950 and 1977 and alive at 45 years. Follow-up began on each woman's 45th birthday and ended on 31 July 2023. Of 969 424 eligible women, 92 619 were excluded because of thrombophilia, liver disease, arterial thrombosis or venous thrombosis, breast cancer, endometrial cancer, ovarian cancer, previous use of menopausal hormone therapy, or previous bilateral oophorectomy. Systemic menopausal hormone therapy was the intervention of interest.
Death as registered in the Central Persons Register. Secondary outcomes were cause specific mortality registered in the cause of death register (cardiovascular, cancer, or other mortality). Hazard ratios were estimated using Cox regression, adjusted for age, calendar year, parity, educational degree, income group quarter (based on quartiles), country of birth, diabetes, hypercholesterolemia, hypertension, atrial fibrillation, valvular disease, heart failure, and three or more hospital contacts between 44 and 45 years of age.
Of 876 805 women, 104 086 (11.9%) redeemed a prescription for menopausal hormone therapy, and 47 594 (5.4%) died, with a median follow-up time of 14.3 years (interquartile range (IQR) 7.9-21.0 years). Women who used menopausal hormone therapy had an incidence rate of 54.9 deaths per 10 000 person years compared to 35.5 per 10 000 person years in the unexposed group, corresponding to an adjusted hazard ratio of 0.96 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.93 to 0.98). Stratifying this by cumulative duration of menopausal hormone therapy use gave an adjusted hazard ratio after <1 years of menopausal hormone therapy of 1.01 (95% CI 0.98 to 1.05), after 1-2.9 years of use 0.94 (0.89 to 0.98), 3-4.9 years of use 0.90 (0.84 to 0.95), 5-9.9 years of use 0.89 (0.84 to 0.95), and over ≥10 years of use 0.98 (0.90 to 1.07). No unequivocal differences in cause-specific mortality were found between groups. Among the 703 women who underwent bilateral oophorectomy between 45-54 years, those who used menopausal hormone therapy experienced a 27-34% lower mortality hazard as compared to women who did not (median age at death for those who had taken menopausal hormone therapy 60.9 years (IQR 55.3-66.6 years) v 56.6 years (52.9-62.0 years) for those who had not).
This nationwide cohort study did not find menopausal hormone therapy was associated with increased mortality."

AACFD combines two periodicity detectors-(i) a YIN-style difference-function analysis of an adaptive SCG envelope and (ii) a short-window autocorrelation branch-operating on 3 s segments. The two branches are fused by feature-aware weighting based on signal-quality indices and multi-scale features; and a Hampel filter plus temporal consistency checks remove outlier windows. The algorithm is efficient enough for real time implementation on commodity hardware. AACFD was validated on 535 subjects spanning six heterogeneous datasets (sampling rates 200 Hz-5 kHz): lab oratory mechanocardiograms (MCG), controlled-breathing SCG (CEBS), motion-rich multichannel SCG (MC-SCG), valvular heart-disease clinics (VHD), invasive right-heart catheterization (RHC), and smartphone recordingsfrom300 atrial-fibrillation/sinus-rhythm subjects. For each recording we analyzed non-overlapping windows of 10, 20, 30, and 60 s and compared the SCG-derived mean HR with ECG derived (or telemetry) reference values. After ECG- and SCG-based quality control and temporal refinement, the mean per-subject mean absolute error (MAE) on 30-s windows was 0.99 bpm in MCG, 0.72 bpm in CEBS, 4.38 bpm in VHD, 1.34 bpm in MC-SCG after removal of recordings with corrupted ECG, 3.58 bpm in RHC, and 7.67 bpm in the smartphone cohort. Across all datasets, more than 90% of non-overlapping 10-60 s windows passed ECG- and SCG based quality control, so the reported errors reflect nearly the full usable recording duration rather than a few selected clean segments. This cross-dataset benchmark indicates that a short window hybrid YIN and autocorrelation routine, guarded by simple robustness checks, attains sub-bpm accuracy on resting datasets and clinically acceptable accuracy on several pathological cohorts using only a single accelerom eter axis. Importantly, AACFD is deliberately designed and evaluated for reliable window-averaged HR estimation on 10-60 s time scales rather than instantaneous beat-to-beat HR; deriving robust heart-rate-variability indices from SCG remains an important direction for future work."

Combining CPVI with linear ablation and ethanol infusion into the vein of Marshall (EI-VOM) (CPVI + PLUS) may improve patient outcomes.
This single-center retrospective study included hospitalized patients with PeNVAF who underwent their first radiofrequency ablation at Zigong First People's Hospital from August 2022 to August 2024. After propensity score matching (PSM), 132 patients were assigned to each group: the CPVI + PLUS group (combined EI-VOM and linear ablation) and the CPVI-only group. Outcomes were assessed at 3 and 6 months, including AF recurrence, complications, and cardiac function. Quality of life was evaluated at 6 months using the Atrial Fibrillation Effect on Quality-of-Life Questionnaire (AFEQT). The primary endpoints were AF recurrence rate and arrhythmia-free survival at 6 months after ablation; secondary endpoints included changes in cardiac function parameters, quality-of-life scores, and complication rates. Kaplan-Meier analysis was used to compare arrhythmia-free survival between the two groups, and univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were performed to identify risk factors for AF recurrence. In addition, a stacking ensemble model was developed to enhance prediction of AF recurrence after ablation.
There were no significant differences in baseline demographics, comorbidities, laboratory, or echocardiographic parameters between the two groups. The CPVI + PLUS group had a longer procedure time than the CPVI group, but intraoperative complication rates were similar. At 6-month follow-up, the CPVI + PLUS group showed significantly better AFEQT, left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF), left atrial diameter(LAD), and left ventricular end-diastolic diameter (LVEDD) compared to the CPVI group. Recurrence rates of AF were lower in the CPVI + PLUS group, and arrhythmia-free survival time was longer. Multivariate analysis identified coronary artery disease, heart failure, severe preoperative valvular regurgitation, intraoperative myocardial injury, longer AF course, and larger LAD as independent risk factors for recurrence. Additional ablation strategies and left atrial appendage occlusion were protective factors. The stacking ensemble model achieved high accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and ROC-AUC in both training and validation cohorts. Feature importance analysis consistently identified AF course, age, body mass index, B-type natriuretic peptide, LVEF, platelet count, and uric acid as core predictors of recurrence risk.
CPVI + PLUS significantly improved arrhythmia-free survival, cardiac function, and quality of life in patients with PeNVAF without increasing procedural risk. Multivariate and machine learning analyses confirmed that additional ablation and left atrial appendage occlusion were protective against recurrence, while heart failure, valvular regurgitation, and longer AF course increased risk. The stacking model showed excellent predictive performance, and key features identified may support precise risk stratification and individualized therapy."

Brain-PAD, derived from structural MRI, offers a promising biomarker of neurobiological aging, but its developmental course, within-group variability, and regional drivers remain incompletely understood. A three-dimensional convolutional neural network (3D-CNN) was trained exclusively on healthy controls (HC; n = 155) and then applied to independent BD (n = 122) and SZ (n = 161) groups. Brain-PAD was computed as predicted brain age minus chronological age. Age-by-group interactions, within-group dispersion, and sensitivity analyses (e.g., piecewise regression, inverse probability weighting) were conducted. Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping (Grad-CAM) was used to identify regional contributions to brain age predictions. The 3D-CNN achieved high accuracy in HC (MAE = 3.05 years, r = 0.96), with reduced accuracy in BD (MAE = 8.86, r = 0.51) and SZ (MAE = 9.01, r = 0.48). Mean Brain-PAD was significantly elevated in BD (+4.2 ± 10.2 years) and SZ (+6.7 ± 8.7 years) relative to HC (+0.7 ± 3.5 years). Age-by-group analyses revealed that BD and SZ exhibited elevated Brain-PAD at younger ages, converging toward HC trajectories by midlife, followed by renewed divergence beyond age 40. This pattern was supported by piecewise and spline models showing steeper negative slopes in BD and SZ compared with HC. Variance and quantile regression indicated greater heterogeneity in BD and SZ across the Brain-PAD distribution. Grad-CAM highlighted temporal and frontal regions as central contributors across all groups; in SZ, Brain-PAD correlated positively with whole-brain (r = 0.23, p = 0.004), frontal (r = 0.21, p = 0.009), and temporal (r = 0.20, p = 0.012) activations, whereas BD showed weaker and more diffuse associations. SZ and BD exhibit elevated Brain-PAD early in adulthood with greater heterogeneity than healthy controls. Frontotemporal regions contribute prominently to brain-age predictions, reflecting model sensitivity to age-informative structure. These findings support Brain-PAD as a group-level marker of apparent brain aging and motivate longitudinal study of midlife divergence."

The model combines a global keypoint detector with C2/C7 specialists localized via a multilayer perceptron to refine landmarks on high‑resolution patches. Trained on 5604 images and tested internally and on a challenging external cohort enriched for C7 obscuration (82%), it achieved excellent agreement with ground truth. Externally, intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs) were 0.97 for lordosis (mean absolute error [MAE] 2.6°), >0.99 for C2 slope (MAE 0.8°), and 0.93 for C7 slope (MAE 2.3°), with minimal bias and narrower limits of agreement than a single‑stage baseline. The model showed near-perfect repeatability (ICC > 0.99) and higher artificial intelligence-expert agreement (ICC 0.81-0.84) for C7 slope than inter-expert reliability (ICC 0.67). In failure cases, the pipeline corrected large global model errors (e.g., 10.22°- 0.22°). This robust, coarse‑to‑fine approach advances reliable, generalizable cervical alignment assessment in real‑world conditions."

To address the highly nonlinear and complex temporal characteristics of wind power, this paper investigates a hybrid deep learning model, TCN-SENet-BiGRU-Global Attention. The model integrates a Temporal Convolutional Network (TCN), Squeeze-and-Excitation Network (SENet), Bidirectional Gated Recurrent Unit (BiGRU), and a Global Attention mechanism to construct a multi-level feature extraction architecture. Specifically, TCN efficiently captures both long-term and short-term temporal dependencies, SENet enhances the impact of key variables by adaptively adjusting channel-wise feature weights, BiGRU models bidirectional temporal context, and the Global Attention mechanism focuses on informative time steps to better track dynamic changes in wind power. Experiments on multiple real-world datasets from a wind farm demonstrate that the proposed TCN-SENet-BiGRU-Global Attention model achieves consistently lower prediction errors and more stable performance than several representative baseline models, indicating its good robustness and promising application potential for complex short-term wind power forecasting tasks."

Using a prospective pediatric ophthalmology cohort of over 3000 children with longitudinal follow-up, our method estimates direct and indirect causal effects through intervention. Applied to myopia progression in children, our approach not only achieved good performance but also identified clinically plausible causal pathways. Refutation experiments with multiple falsification strategies confirm the robustness and reliability of causal effects. The approach is model-agnostic and suitable for digital health interventions requiring explainability. By incorporating unit-level causal reasoning into deep learning, this work advances transparent and reliable AI systems aligned with the goals of precision medicine and equitable healthcare."

However, most diagnostic models are based on single time-point data, overlooking longitudinal disease characteristics. Structural magnetic resonance imaging (sMRI) has been widely utilized in the study of AD. To address the need for multi-time series analysis in longitudinal AD research and the integration of features from different brain tissues, we propose a Multi-Branch Fusion Channel Attention Network (MBFCA-Net) for disease diagnosis. This network leverages the temporal correlations across longitudinal scans for effective AD detection. We further conduct retrospective interpretability analysis to quantify the contributions of brain regions across disease stages. This enables a detailed investigation of dynamic changes in brain regions associated with AD and normal aging. The results indicate that the importance of regions such as the amygdala, parahippocampal gyrus, and temporal lobe undergoes dynamic changes throughout the progression of AD. Furthermore, AD-related voxel clusters exhibit a developmental trend, shifting from the hippocampus to the temporal lobe and transitioning from a dispersed to a more aggregated distribution. Our study provides novel insights into the longitudinal patterns of AD-related changes, offering valuable contributions to early diagnosis and pathological understanding of the disease."

However, due to ethical constraints and anatomical differences in animal models, the failure modes underlying human gastrulation remain poorly understood. To elucidate these failure modes, we introduce FATE-MAP (Failure Analysis and Trajectory Evaluation via Mechanistic-AI Prediction), an integrated platform that combines high-throughput perturbations of human 2D gastruloids with quantitative phenotypic mapping, predictive deep learning, and mechanistic morphogen modeling. Analyzing over 2000 drug-treated human 2D gastruloids, we mapped a phenotypic morphospace that separates canonical patterning, in which primitive-streak fates are correctly specified and radially organized, from failure modes, defined as departures from this organization and marked by a loss of a required fate and/or radial symmetry. To predict and interpret patterning outcomes, FATE-MAP combines a transformer linking chemical structure to phenotype with PDE simulations of morphogen transport and cell fate specification, and projects both outputs onto the experimentally defined morphospace. Applying this framework, we flagged two clinical molecules as potential teratogens and identified two parameters, cell density and SOX2 stability, that form orthogonal morphospace axes along which canonically patterned gastruloids systematically vary. FATE-MAP thus provides a roadmap for decoding human developmental trajectories and accelerating safe therapeutic discovery."

This study addresses the urgent need for a robust consensus taxonomy to facilitate precision treatment for ESCC. We employed a network-based approach to elucidate the interconnections among eight existing classification systems, leading to the identification of four distinct consensus molecular subtypes (ECMSs): ECMS1-MET (metabolic), characterized by dysregulated metabolic pathways and NFE2L2 activation; ECMS2-CLS (classical), featuring upregulated cell cycle and canonical signaling pathways; ECMS3-IM (immunomodulatory), marked by robust immune activation and elevated PD-1 expression; and ECMS4-MES (mesenchymal), associated with mesenchymal transition, stromal activation, and VEGF signaling. To improve clinical applicability, we developed an image-based framework (imECMS) that utilizes spatial organization features (SOFs) quantified from autodelineated hematoxylin‒eosin (H&E)-stained whole-slide images through deep learning algorithms. The imECMS classifier assigns patients to one of the four ECMS subtypes, which correlate with distinct molecular characteristics, prognoses, and responses to neoadjuvant chemotherapy and immunotherapy. Validation across multiple independent cohorts confirmed that the imECMS accurately classifies ESCC subtypes from histopathological images, offering a robust and effective tool for precision medicine. In summary, the ECMS/imECMS subtyping systems we developed are the most robust frameworks for ESCC to date, providing clear biological insights and a foundation for clinical stratification and targeted therapies."

Although AI has demonstrated efficacy in pneumothorax detection using chest X-rays (CXR), it has yet to be applied for decision-making regarding subsequent treatment. This study aims to develop and evaluate an AI-based system capable of predicting the necessity of chest tube drainage (CTD) in spontaneous pneumothorax patients based on CXR and clinical data. A two-stage AI model was developed: (1) segmentation and quantification of pneumothorax size from CXR using deep learning and (2) prediction of CTD necessity using machine learning models integrating pneumothorax size and patient clinical parameters. The AI model was trained using CXR images and clinical information from 163 pneumothorax patients. Model performance was assessed using area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC), sensitivity, specificity, and inference time. The AI model demonstrated high segmentation accuracy for pneumothorax (DSC, 76.95%; MAE, 5.06%). In predicting CTD necessity, the AUROC for the AI model incorporating pneumothorax ratio and clinical data was 89.68 (95% CI, 78.57-98.02), outperforming models without pneumothorax ratio (AUROC, 84.13) or with pneumothorax ratio alone (AUROC, 71.03). The sensitivity and specificity of the optimized AI model were 80.95% and 100%, respectively. The mean inference time was 0.75 ± 0.06 s, demonstrating potential for real-time clinical application. This study presents an AI-based clinical decision support system capable of accurately predicting the need for CTD in spontaneous pneumothorax patients. By integrating AI-driven pneumothorax quantification and clinical parameters, the model improves decision-making efficiency and accuracy. Future studies with larger datasets and prospective validation are warranted to further refine and validate this approach."

Early diagnosis is critically important, as treatment outcomes are significantly improved when BC is identified at an initial stage. Although considerable research has been conducted on BC classification utilizing deep learning techniques, there remains a deficiency of comprehensive models that effectively integrate robust feature extraction with balanced learning methodologies. To address this limitation, we introduce BreasTransNeXt, a new hybrid deep learning framework that synergizes the convolutional inductive bias inherent in ConvFormer with the efficient global attention mechanisms of a hybrid transformer architecture, thereby facilitating robust multi-scale feature representation. Furthermore, to mitigate class imbalance and enhance model generalization, the BC dataset is augmented through the application of a Wasserstein Generative Adversarial Network with gradient penalty, which generates high-fidelity synthetic images for both malignant and healthy classes. Additionally, BreasTransNeXt incorporates a hybrid attention mechanism comprising of local, channel, and global branches, which are integrated via adaptive gating; this design enhances feature representation by capturing fine-grained lesion characteristics, inter-feature correlations, and long-range contextual dependencies. The proposed model is rigorously evaluated against traditional convolutional neural network approaches and state-of-the-art vision transformer architectures. Experimental findings demonstrate that BreasTransNeXt consistently outperforms these methods, achieving an accuracy of 0.9710, recall of 0.9808, precision of 0.9808, and F1-score of 0.9808, thereby underscoring its potential as a reliable tool for early BC detection."

To address this challenge, we developed a computer-assisted diagnostic framework that combines the Virchow foundation model, pretrained on 1.5 million whole-slide images, with multi-instance learning (MIL) to classify psoriasis and eczema from digitized histopathology slides. Using an internal dataset (n = 40) and an external validation cohort (n = 40), equally balanced between both conditions and annotated by board-certified dermatopathologists, our best-performing configuration (Virchow + CLAM) achieved 85% accuracy, a macro-averaged F1 score of 0.80, and an AUC of 0.81 on the external cohort. This substantially outperformed baseline convolutional neural networks, which reached 61% accuracy, and models relying solely on pretrained feature extractors without MIL, which achieved an average accuracy of 68.8%. In a reader study on the same external cohort, individual dermatopathologist accuracies ranged from 47.5 to 70.0%, with a majority-vote consensus accuracy of 62.5%; our method outperformed both the average individual reader and the consensus under histology-only conditions. Furthermore, the model generates attention heatmaps that provide supportive visual context by highlighting regions associated with model predictions. Importantly, this study is designed as a methodological proof-of-concept conducted under controlled, histology-only conditions and is not intended for direct clinical deployment. Rather than demonstrating clinical readiness, it illustrates the potential of domain-specific foundation models combined with MIL for addressing diagnostically challenging inflammatory dermatoses."

This may result in delayed examinations or use of CT, especially in emergency settings. To enable ad-hoc MRI scans and rule out increased intracranial pressure or intracranial mass lesions, we combined various acceleration techniques with Deep-Learning reconstruction, generating ultra-fast diagnostic images sufficient to exclude critical pathologies.
Thirty-six MRI datasets of infants with a median age of 35.2 months (SD ± 23.2) and anesthesia-free imaging were retrospectively evaluated. Imaging was performed using ultra-fast T2-weighted sequences in three planes (slice thickness 5 mm; total acquisition time 47s). Four readers evaluated subjective image quality using a 5-point Likert-scale. Readers were asked to indicate how safe they felt about assessing possible midline displacement or mass lesion. For semi-quantitative analysis, readers reported diameters of lateral and third ventricles. Gwet's AC2 and intraclass correlation (ICC) were used for interrater agreement.
94.4% of datasets showed at least acceptable diagnostic confidence. Readers felt confident excluding acute intracranial pathology. 52.1% of ultra-fast sequences demonstrated good to excellent image quality. 72.6% were rated with good or excellent diagnostic confidence. Interrater reliability demonstrated almost excellent agreement of diagnostic confidence (Gwet's AC2 ≥ 0.886) and image quality (Gwet's AC2 ≥ 0.942).

However, capturing transcriptome, epigenome and 3D genome from the same single cells remains challenging. Here we present scHiCAR (single-cell Hi-C with assay for transposase-accessible chromatin and RNA sequencing), a plate-based combinatorial barcoding method that simultaneously profiles mRNA, open chromatin and chromosome conformation capture from the same cells. Compared to existing single-cell 3D genome methods, scHiCAR more efficiently enriches long-range cis-interactions anchored at candidate CREs (cCREs). Applied to 1.62 million mouse brain cells and complemented with a deep-learning-based loop caller, scHiCAR accurately defines cell-type-specific transcriptomes, accessible cCREs and 5-kb-resolution enhancer-promoter pairs across 22 brain cell types. scHiCAR also performs robustly in challenging tissues such as skeletal muscle, enabling trimodal single-cell-level analysis of gene regulation dynamics during muscle stem cell regeneration. By providing a scalable and cost-effective system for single-cell trimodal analysis of gene-regulatory landscapes in complex tissues, scHiCAR reveals gene-locus-specific regulatory roles of 3D genome reorganization in transcriptional control."
PubMed,deep learning,Classification of dysphagia severity after lateral medullary infarction with deep learning.,Taeheon Lee; Bo Hae Kim; Kihwan Nam; Jin-Woo Park,10.1038/s41598-026-40751-9,2026-02-19,Scientific reports,"Dysphagia is a common and debilitating complication in patients with lateral medullary infarction (LMI), affecting up to 100% of cases and significantly impairing quality of life. Accurate classification of early dysphagia severity is essential for timely intervention and personalized rehabilitation planning. This study aimed to develop and validate a deep learning algorithm using acute-phase diffusion-weighted MRI to classify dysphagia severity in LMI patients. A retrospective cohort of 163 patients with confirmed acute LMI was analyzed. Dysphagia severity was determined by videofluoroscopic swallowing studies (VFSS), categorizing patients into severe and non-severe groups. Lesion regions were manually labeled and preprocessed for model training. Transformer-based deep learning architecture, the Hierarchical Vision Transformer (Hier-ViT), was employed due to its capacity to model spatial hierarchies and global image context. The model achieved an accuracy of 0.85, with a precision of 0.70, recall of 0.75, F1-score of 0.72, and an area under the ROC curve (AUC) of 0.69. These findings suggest that Hier-ViT can effectively classify dysphagia severity in LMI patients using early MRI, offering a potential tool for early risk stratification. While the model shows a high accuracy, the modest AUC suggests that further refinement and multi-modal integration are necessary to improve its discriminative power in imbalanced clinical datasets."
PubMed,deep learning,Hybrid deep neural network with PCA based features optimization for enhancing brain tumor classification.,Binay Kumar Pandey; Digvijay Pandey; Tsair-Fwu Lee; Mesfin Esayas Lelisho,10.1038/s41598-026-39154-7,2026-02-19,Scientific reports,"Brain tumors have been an important medical concern. This is primarily due to their growth patterns have been hard to predict and their medical needs have been complicated. This work proposes emphasis on a hybrid PCA DenseNet121 convolutional neural network mechanism. The model is intended to improve classification accuracy among four specific classifications: Glioma, Meningioma, Pituitary, and No Tumor. The model incorporates deep features with traditional texture descriptors to obtain an entire set of features. Specifically, it combines the Gray Level Co-occurrence Matrix (GLCM) and Local Ternary Pattern (LTP) with the Color Coherence Vector (CCV). Experimental integrity was a primary focus of this study. To preclude data leakage, the feature extraction and optimization pipeline was strictly partitioned between the training and testing datasets. The implementation of the CCV is methodologically supported by a specific preprocessing stage. In this stage, MRI intensity distributions are quantized into 27 discrete bins. This process classifies pixels as coherent or incoherent based on their spatial connectivity. This method captures subtle relationships between intensity clusters. These associations significantly improve the structural data provided by GLCM as well as LTP. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) has been employed to deal with the resultant feature space in many dimensions. This method preprocesses the feature vector beforehand to the training phase. The PCA transformation has been almost exclusively adapted to the training data, giving them highly significant. This approach eradicates anticipating bias despite ensuring that the model has applicability across diverse situations. The proposed approach has produced an accuracy of 95.89% with regard to classification. This performance has been confirmed by the measurements for the precision, recall, and a F1 score that have retained the same upon 94%. The findings indicate that incorporating multimodal descriptors alongside deep features provides a comprehensive representation of tumor features. This integration minimizes misclassification. It also ensures stable learning patterns throughout the diagnostic process. Additionally, the training and validation processes for each accuracy and loss constantly coincide. This indicates that the model performed an effective task of reducing down on too much excessive overfitting. The elevated degree of performance has been caused by the successful use of dropout normalization. After that, systematic information shuffling enhances the learning process more reliable with an extensive variety of clinical data sets."
PubMed,deep learning,Pneumonia detection from enhanced chest X-Ray images based on Double SGAN model.,Zhijing Xu; Haoyang Zhang,10.1038/s41598-026-39785-w,2026-02-19,Scientific reports,"Medical imaging plays a crucial role in clinical diagnosis, however, deep learning models often struggle with imbalanced datasets, which has a negative impact on the accuracy and robustness of pneumonia image classification. This study proposes a deep learning based diagnostic system for pneumonia detection using chest X-ray images. Using the pneumonia MNIST dataset, including pediatric lung images. To address the issue of class imbalance and improve generalization ability, we innovatively propose a Double SGAN model. Firstly, apply spectral normalization to all generator and discriminator layers for stable training and improve performance. Secondly, self-attention mechanisms are integrated into the convolutional layers of the generator to better capture complex image features. Finally, the hinge loss function is used during the training process to further improve learning efficiency. On this basis, this study constructed the ResNet18-SA classification model, which embeds spatial attention mechanism in the residual module of the lightweight network ResNet18 to focus on key feature regions related to pneumonia diagnosis and suppress background noise interference. The experimental results show that the ResNet18-SA model outperforms traditional models in terms of accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score, reaching 95.83%, 95.87%, 95.21%, and 95.52%, respectively."

Endovascular stents typically consist of a metal framework and a flexible membrane graft designed to reopen obstructed aortic segments and maintain blood flow through the true lumen. Consequently, stents are widely used to treat aortic expansion diseases and aortic occlusive stenosis. However, traditional stents have limitations in terms of adaptability to complex anatomical structures, long-term durability, biomechanical stability, and reliance on radial support force for fixation, lacking active fixation mechanisms. These shortcomings remain the primary causes of postoperative complications, significantly impacting the quality of life for patients with aortic dissection.                                                           Methods:                     The research status of the endovascular stent was discussed in depth, and the main factors for the optimal design of the stent (geometry, pattern configuration, additional fixtures, and optimization methods) were analyzed and summarized according to the complications targeted by the repair device.                                                           Results:                     The composition structure, working principle, and development status of the stent grafts under review are elaborated in detail. Stent grafts attempt to alleviate postoperative complications through three approaches: enhancing the flexibility of the stent framework, improving the fit between the vessel wall and the stent, and reducing vascular injury. Blood flow guiding channels are established to alleviate the obstruction of branch blood flow. Additional self-anchoring devices are added to adapt to the dynamic remodeling of blood vessels.                                                           Discussion:                     The effects of various factors, including geometric parameters, structural design, and parameter optimization techniques, on the optimization of stent primary mechanical performance are discussed. The current research status of functional improvement methods for stents is also summarized.                                                           Conclusion:                     Refining the quantitative relationship between stent structural parameters and mechanical performance, as well as exploring the balance criteria between flexibility and radial support force, represent promising directions for future development. These objectives necessitate further in-depth analysis and research."

With a focus on the prevalent psychological complications following the onset of this condition, this study aimed to explore the correlation between antenatal depression and Corona disease anxiety, personality traits, and postpartum depression during the COVID-19 pandemic.                                                           Materials and Methods:                     This cross-sectional descriptive-analytical study investigated women receiving care at health centers affiliated with Kerman University of Medical Sciences during the last month of their pregnancy and the postpartum period in 2022. Following the acquisition of informed consent, participants were assessed using various measures, including demographic and obstetric information, the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale, the Corona Disease Anxiety Scale (CDAS), and the NEO Personality Inventory-Revised during their third trimester of pregnancy. The same group of participants completed the Edinburgh Depression Scale and the Corona Disease Anxiety Scale (CDAS) 4-6 weeks after childbirth.                                                           Results and Discussion:                     There was a significant correlation between family income, unwanted pregnancy as perceived by both the mother and father, and antenatal depression. Additionally, marital satisfaction played a significant role in postpartum depression. Furthermore, antenatal depression was significantly associated with neuroticism, agreeableness, and physical symptoms related to Corona disease anxiety. Personality traits, with the exception of extroversion and conscientiousness, and various domains of Corona disease anxiety, excluding psychological symptoms, were also significantly associated with postpartum depression.                                                           Conclusion:                     During pandemics or epidemics, such as the COVID-19 outbreak, experiencing mental distress during pregnancy can contribute to mental health issues during the postpartum period. This risk is particularly true in individuals with unique personality traits, emphasizing the need for increased focus on mental health within prenatal care during these crises."

Method:                     This cross-sectional study was conducted in Kerman, Iran. Data were collected from patients who visited Afzalipour Hospital in Kerman more than twice during the COVID-19 epidemic from the end of February 2020 to March 21, 2021. We conducted two key analyses: 1. Mixed effect logistic regression was used to check the relationship between the variables and COVID-19 severity. 2. Mixed effect linear regression was used to check the relationship between the variables and the length of stay in the hospital.                                                           Results:                     The findings indicated that the most important risk factors for the severity of COVID-19 were heart diseases (OR=1.67,95%CI:1.20-2.30), increasing age (OR=2.23 for age&gt;54, 95%CI:1.70- 2.90), male gender (OR=1.47,95%CI:1.10-1.96), respiratory diseases other than asthma, and frequency of admission (OR=1.60,95%CI:1.20-2.15). All patients who underwent readmission experienced a shorter duration of hospitalization during their subsequent admission (OR=0.94,95%CI:0.91,0.96) and had a higher mortality rate (30% within 14 days, 26.6% between 14-90 days). Patients readmitted at intervals of 14-90 days and greater than 90 days exhibited lower disease severity compared to those readmitted within the 0-14 day period.                                                           Conclusion:                     Examining readmissions, the severity of COVID-19, and the length of hospital stay in affected patients are important factors for planning and allocating resources for COVID-19 management and treatment. These factors can help policymakers develop effective clinical guidelines for hospitalization or outpatient treatment of COVID-19 patients and contribute to reducing the burden of disease in the community."

Kinovea, as an accessible motion-analysis software, provides both visual and quantitative feedback. However, its application in supporting technique development among beginner athletes remains insufficiently explored. Aim: This study aims to describe the use of Kinovea in biomechanics training and examine its contribution to the awareness of kinematic characteristics and movement techniques among beginner athletes. Methods: A descriptive qualitative design involved 72 beginner athletes aged 18–25 years selected through purposive sampling. Data were collected over 16 weeks through interviews, field observations, and motion video recordings analyzed using Kinovea. Kinematic data focused on joint angles, stride behavior, and movement phases during walking, running, and the flight phase. Qualitative data were analyzed using content analysis with NVivo 12, while kinematic results were interpreted descriptively to identify performance patterns and areas for technical refinement. Result: Kinematic analysis showed coordinated joint-angle patterns across all phases. Walking analysis identified arm swing angles of 50.9°–58.8° and leg separation angles of 64.3°–67.2°, indicating a stable gait rhythm. The running analysis revealed knee angles of 68.8°–69.8° and elbow angles of 87.6°–89.1°, indicating efficient propulsive mechanics. The flight phase demonstrated knee angles of 81.2°–87.8° and elbow angles of 80.4°–88.3°, suggesting effective momentum use and postural stability. These measurements supported stride-efficiency assessment and technique evaluation. Qualitative findings revealed that Kinovea enabled athletes to interpret movement phases and identify technical inefficiencies through slow-motion and frame-by-frame visualization. Conclusion: Kinovea supports basic motion analysis by providing clear kinematic information and helping beginner athletes observe and refine their movement techniques. The findings also offer practical value for coaches by enabling more precise identification of inefficient patterns and guiding targeted corrections during early-stage training."

OpenAlex,deep learning,Combating Data and Target Shifts in Visual Tasks,Zhaorui Tan,10.17638/03194353,2031-01-01,University of Liverpool,"The rapid advancement of deep learning models for visual tasks has led to significant progress in many domains. However, a key challenge remains: ensuring that models can generalize effectively to unseen samples or novel classes, especially in real-world scenarios where training data-target pairs are often limited or unavailable, and test data may exhibit shifts in both data and targets. This thesis addresses the problem of shifts across data and targets, proposing novel methods to improve model generalization and transferability in complex settings. The thesis identifies the different shift scenarios for visual tasks and presents their problem forms. The research first relaxes the static target distribution assumption in Multi-Domain Generalization (mDG) tasks, introducing the General Multi-Domain Generalization (GMDG) objective to improve generalization under varying data shifts. Specifically, Extensive experiments validate that GMDG is feasible for classification, segmentation, and regression tasks. Further considering extreme target distribution shifts where even unknown novel classes emerge, the study also explores logical regularization techniques for tasks such as Generalized Category Discovery (GCD), mDG+GCD, and Class Incremental Learning (CIL), proposing a sample-based logical regularization term (L-Reg) to enhance data-, target-, and all-shift generalization. Additionally, a partial logic framework is introduced to address challenges in CIL, enabling models to retain room for unknown classes during training. This is further extended by the Partial-Logic Regularization (PL-Reg), which improves generalization across GCD, mDG+GCD, and transferability for CIL tasks. Furthermore, the thesis proposes a novel Semantic-aware Data Augmentation (SADA) framework for cross-modality generalization in text-to-image synthesis (T2Isyn), text-image retrieval (TIR), and image-text retrieval (ITR) tasks. This framework ensures semantic preservation across text and image modalities, improving both semantic consistency and image quality in cross-modality tasks. The methods proposed in this thesis offer significant advancements in visual generalization and transfer scenarios, providing theoretical insights and practical solutions for handling data shifts, target shifts, and multi-modalities in complex scenarios. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of the proposed methods, demonstrating their superior performance across a range of tasks."
OpenAlex,deep learning,Antecedents and consequences of Green-tech FDI in emerging markets,Zhuoran Liu,10.17638/03195308,2031-01-01,University of Liverpool,"As environmental pressures intensify, attracting sustainable foreign direct investment (FDI), particularly green-tech FDI, has become a critical pathway for emerging markets to achieve environmental sustainability. However, existing research remains fragmented, offering limited insights into why green-tech FDI enters emerging markets and how it affects regional green innovation. This thesis addresses these gaps by systematically examining both the antecedents and consequences of green-tech FDI through three empirical studies using regional data from China. Study 1 and Study 2 focus on the antecedents of green-tech FDI. Study 1 examines how host-country conditions can attract green-tech FDI, highlighting the role of environmental management information disclosure (EMID) by domestic firms in reducing information gaps and strengthening green market–seeking motives. Study 2 shifts attention to the active decision-making of green-tech FDI, showing that under uncertainty, green-tech foreign investors engage in identity-based bandwagon learning by imitating peers with similar green identities, thereby mitigating investment risks. Study 3 turns to the consequences of green-tech FDI. It demonstrates that, due to the technological complexity of green innovation and limited absorptive capacity in emerging markets, green-tech FDI may generate crowding-out effects rather than purely positive spillovers. Adopting a network perspective, the study further finds that universities play a key moderating role: through broad linkages and deep collaborations, they help mitigate negative spillovers and facilitate the diffusion of green technologies. Together, the three studies advance the literature on sustainable FDI by differentiating green-tech FDI from general FDI and identifying the specific mechanisms that shape its entry decisions and local innovation outcomes. Practically, the findings provide guidance for emerging-market governments and firms on how to attract and manage sustainable investment, balance growth with environmental objectives, and strengthen local innovation ecosystems."
OpenAlex,deep learning,A UAV-Based Framework for Community-Scale Residential Building Energy Modelling in China,Mengfan Jin,10.17638/03195460,2029-01-01,University of Liverpool,"With increasing emphasis on energy efficiency and carbon emission reduction in the building sector, rapid and scalable energy modelling of existing buildings is critical for retrofit projects and policy development. Conventional surveys, data collection and energy modelling processes remain labour-intensive and impractical for large-scale applications, and energy modelling often dominates project time and cost. Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) equipped with high-resolution and infrared cameras now offer fast and safe exterior surveys, showing great potential in building energy assessments. Yet, a systematic framework for UAV integration, from image capture through processing to inputs for building energy simulation, has not been established. This research addresses these challenges by developing a structured framework for community-scale building energy modelling, which integrates UAV photogrammetry to accelerate data acquisition, reduce labour, and shorten energy modelling time for retrofit projects. The framework is designed to minimise prior data requirements while maximising automation and retaining sufficient accuracy and reliability. It also addressed systemic issues, such as the lack of data necessary to fully exploit the potential of available technologies in the context of this study. To achieve this research objective, a mixed-methodology approach, combining desk studies and fieldwork, was adopted. First, a comprehensive review of UAV-based building energy studies mapped the current applications and available tools, proposing a preliminary framework. Fieldwork then encompassed a pilot study and a detailed case study. In the pilot test, a single building was surveyed to identify an optimal toolchain for flight planning, image capture, photogrammetric reconstruction, model generation, and selection of a simulation platform. The resulting refined framework was applied to a case study of a 39-building community, and it was demonstrated that further automation was necessary. The potential for automation was then further explored. Geomatic algorithms, machine learning, and deep learning techniques were compared, and the combination that best balanced accuracy and processing time was selected for 3D model generation and window-to-wall ratio (WWR) extraction. In parallel, an archetype library of residential buildings in the Hot Summer Cold Winter (HSCW) zone in China was compiled to facilitate the assignment of thermal parameters. Finally, a reusable community-scale building energy modelling (CBEM) workflow was assembled in Grasshopper using Ladybug Tools components to process the aforementioned inputs. In conclusion, this study integrates UAV photogrammetry, GIS-based geomatic algorithms, machine learning, and graphical programming to develop an UAV-CBEM framework. The outcomes establish a foundation for scalable UAV-based building energy assessments, enhancing applicability in data-limited and large-scale settings worldwide."

OpenAlex,deep learning,Unsupervised Deep-learning Methods for Low-dose Computed Tomography Reconstruction,Ran An,10.17638/03194237,2027-01-01,University of Liverpool,"Computed tomography (CT) has become an indispensable imaging technique in medical diagnostics and industrial applications, owing to its non-invasive nature and high resolution in visualizing object internal structures. While X-ray CT (X-ray computed tomography) significantly enhances lesion detection capabilities, excessive exposure to X-ray radiation raises substantial health concerns, including elevated cancer risks and potential genetic damage. Although low-dose CT (LDCT) protocols reduce radiation safety concerns, they inevitably introduce severe noise and artifacts, which might compromise diagnostic accuracy. Recent advances in supervised deep learning approaches have demonstrated remarkable success in LDCT reconstruction. However, the reliance on paired training data severely limits their deployment in practical CT applications. This fundamental constraint highlights the critical importance of developing unsupervised reconstruction methods. Although existing unsupervised LDCT methods have made notable progress, they still face challenges requiring systematic solutions. This thesis makes three contributions to advance the field of unsupervised LDCT reconstruction: 1. Current dual-domain self-supervised LDCT denoising methods typically neglect the heterogeneity of the non-stationary Gaussian noise levels in low-dose sinograms and usually treat them as common images without appropriately controlling the denoising strength. The denoisers employed by them, which are based on classic convolutional neural networks (CNN), will lead to blurring artifacts in the reconstructed images if directly used for sinogram denoising. In addition, the denoising strength in the sinogram and image domains must be well-balanced to avoid introducing over-blurring or secondary artifacts in the reconstructed images, but existing approaches do not focus on this crucial point. To address these limitations, this thesis proposes a novel end-to-end dual-domain self-supervised framework for LDCT denoising. It employs Dropblock layers to adaptively localize the effect of convolution for sinogram denoising and sets a weighted average between the denoised sinograms and their noisy counterparts to better control the denoising strength, thus effectively reducing the blurring artifacts and leading to a well-balanced dual-domain denoising. Numerical experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and superior performance of the proposed method. 2. Existing normalizing flows (NFs)-based unsupervised LDCT reconstruction methods face challenges in both image quality and computational efficiency. On one hand, they typically utilize a two-way transformation strategy between noisy images and latent variables, which could easily lead to detail loss and secondary artifacts in the reconstructed images. On the other hand, training NFs on high-resolution CT images is computationally intensive. Although conditional normalizing flows (CNFs) can mitigate computational costs by learning conditional probabilities, existing approaches rely on labeled data for conditionalization, leaving unsupervised CNFs-based LDCT reconstruction a challenge. To tackle these issues, this thesis proposes a novel unsupervised LDCT iterative reconstruction algorithm based on CNFs. The proposed method employs a strict one-way transformation strategy during the alternating optimization in the dual spaces to prevent detail loss and secondary artifacts, and proposes a novel unsupervised conditionalization strategy for CNFs, thus achieving efficient training and inference on high-resolution images. The proposed method illustrates high-quality and relatively fast unsupervised reconstruction. Experiments across two datasets demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed method by rivaling several state-of-the-art methods. 3. Current diffusion model-based LDCT reconstruction methods solely employ the prior distributions learned from normal-dose CT data but neglect the valuable priors in low-dose data, which contain information about the characteristics of low-dose noise and artifacts. In addition, their reconstruction speed suffers from multiple sampling steps, presenting low efficiency. Breaking new ground in prior utilization, this thesis proposes a novel unsupervised LDCT iterative reconstruction algorithm based on dual denoising diffusion probabilistic models (DDPM), which leverages both normal-dose and low-dose priors. Specifically, the proposed method employs two DDPMs to learn the prior distributions from normal-dose and low-dose images, respectively, and incorporates them into a joint iterative reconstruction framework. To accelerate the reconstruction, partial diffusion sampling and single-pass deterministic reconstruction strategy are utilized in the proposed method, as well as the spaced OS-SART approaches. Experiments at different dose levels demonstrate the outstanding performance and fast speed of the proposed reconstruction algorithm. Through these innovations and contributions, this thesis addresses some significant challenges in current deep-learning-based unsupervised LDCT reconstruction methods, and proposes three novel unsupervised reconstruction algorithms. The proposed methods effectively improve the performance and efficiency of LDCT reconstruction under different unsupervised learning conditions, and provide some new perspectives and inspirations for future research."
OpenAlex,deep learning,From Sparse to Dense: Label-Efficient Weakly Supervised Segmentation for Images and Videos,Jian Wang,10.17638/03195330,2027-01-01,University of Liverpool,"Obtaining high-quality annotated data has become a primary bottleneck for training deep learning models, particularly for dense prediction tasks like semantic segmentation and video salient object segmentation. The demand for meticulous, pixel-level labeling makes fully-supervised approaches prohibitively expensive and limits their scalability. This thesis directly confronts this issue by proposing and systematically investigating a label-efficient ""sparse-to-dense'' paradigm. The core objective is to develop innovative frameworks that can learn from sparse, inexpensive weak supervision—such as image-level tags or scribbles—and intelligently propagate this minimal information to generate complete, pixel-accurate dense predictions. The major part of this thesis focuses on the ""sparse-to-dense'' challenge within Weakly Supervised Semantic Segmentation (WSSS) for images, where models learn from only image-level tags. Dominant approaches rely on Class Activation Maps (CAMs) as initial object seeds. However, CAMs inherently activate only the most discriminative object regions, leading to incomplete pseudo-labels. This gives rise to the central problem of activation densification: the critical process of expanding these sparse activations to cover the full extent of an object. Our research addresses this challenge through a progressive, multi-faceted strategy. Our exploration begins with a foundational framework (C3) designed to rectify the intrinsic flaws of initial CAMs. We propose a synergistic mutual calibration method. This method leverages the discrepancies between the two maps to generate local prototypes, which are simultaneously utilized to complete missing object parts and suppress background noise, yielding a significantly more accurate and complete initial seed. This foundational work immediately reveals the limitation of single-prototype instability and its inability to capture diverse features. Building on this foundation, we then develop architecture-specific strategies to address deeper limitations of the prototype-based approach. For Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) (C4), the use of a single prototype proves insufficient to capture significant intra-class variation. In response, we introduce an Optimal Transport (OT)-assisted framework that effectively mines multiple, diverse prototypes, thereby yielding more comprehensive activation maps. However, while C4 solves the intra-class diversity problem, the inherent local context constraint of the CNN architecture becomes the new bottleneck, fundamentally limiting the quality of globally-aware feature extraction needed for optimal multi-prototype assignment. This limitation necessitates a shift in architectural focus from CNNs to Vision Transformers. In the ViT architecture (C5), a new challenge arises where the token gap between the discriminative class token and varied patch tokens leads to incomplete activation. To bridge this gap, we leverage a tailored application of Optimal Transport, where the algorithm is tasked with learning a comprehensive proxy to ensure complete object activation. Despite these architectural advances (C3-C5), the overall WSSS performance hit a ceiling. This is fundamentally limited by the sparse supervision of class labels, which cannot provide precise boundary information. To break this ceiling, our WSSS exploration culminates in a universal enhancement strategy (C6) that transcends architecture-specific designs by leveraging Visual Foundation Models (VFMs). We resolve the conflict between the discriminative nature of initial CAMs and the VFM's need for holistic prompts. By modeling the CAM foreground as a graph and employing spectral analysis, our method intelligently selects a diverse set of prompt points that represent the overall structure of the foreground object. This guides the VFM to generate superior, boundary-aware supervision that can universally enhance any WSSS pipeline. Subsequently, the thesis extends the ""sparse-to-dense'' paradigm to the dynamic domain of video, addressing Weakly Supervised Video Salient Object Segmentation (WSVSOS) (C7) from sparse scribble annotations. In this specific context, the challenge evolves into spatio-temporal densification, which requires both full-object coverage within each frame and temporal consistency across the video sequences. To this end, we introduce the core CFMR framework, which utilizes Spatio-Temporal co-regulation. This framework is subsequently enhanced (CFMR+) by integrating the VFM guidance strategy from C6, which provides high-quality spatial priors essential for ensuring both high spatial detail and inter-frame consistency. By enforcing both intra-frame and cross-frame consistency between these two streams, our method effectively propagates the sparse initial signal to generate dense and temporally coherent saliency masks. In conclusion, this thesis presents a comprehensive and cohesive investigation into label-efficient segmentation tasks, offering a suite of innovative and effective strategies for the ""sparse-to-dense'' challenge. Our work establishes a progressive roadmap that systematically overcomes architectural and semantic limitations, culminating in highly robust and generalized densification pipelines. Our extensive experimental results on standard benchmarks validate the state-of-the-art performance of these methods, providing robust solutions to a long-standing problem in the computer vision field."

OpenAlex,deep learning,Diseño y construcción de un sistema predictivo de congestión de tráfico basado en aprendizaje automático,Zehan Li,,2026-07-17,UPM Digital Archive (Technical University of Madrid),"Resumen: Este proyecto desarrolla un sistema de predicción de la intensidad del tráfico urbano mediante técnicas de aprendizaje profundo, con el objetivo de mejorar la toma de decisiones de movilidad. A diferencia de otras plataformas centradas en la visualización del estado actual, la solución propuesta busca anticipar comportamientos futuros, y se plantea como una alternativa abierta, replicable y específicamente orientada a la predicción. Para lograrlo, se ha diseñado una arquitectura modular basada en el lenguaje Python, capaz de integrar múltiples fuentes de datos abiertos: registros históricos del tráfico, datos históricos de situación meteorológica, y coordenadas espaciales de los sensores de medición. El sistema aplica un proceso de limpieza, interpolación temporal y transformación de variables, incluyendo la codificación cíclica del tiempo y la conversión espacial a coordenadas UTM, lo que permite una fusión precisa entre datos geográficos y meteorológicos mediante técnicas como la ponderación por distancia inversa (IDW). El modelo predictivo se basa en una red neuronal LSTM, especialmente adaptada para secuencias temporales multivariables. Se entrena utilizando una estrategia de ventana deslizante a 32 muestras (7 horas y 45 minutos) para predecir la intensidad de tráfico en el siguiente intervalo. El sistema incorpora además mecanismo de IterableDataset para manejar grandes volúmenes de datos de entrenamiento sin comprometer la estabilidad del entorno. Los resultados obtenidos muestran una precisión robusta en escenarios de validación, con errores de predicción (MAE y RMSE) aceptable. Además, se ha desarrollado una interfaz web interactiva, que permite el despliegue local del sistema, con capacidad de ingestión de datos en tiempo real y visualización directa de las predicciones. Ente trabajo demuestra la viabilidad técnica y operativa de aplicar aprendizaje profundo al análisis de tráfico urbano, y sienta las bases para su evolución futura hacia sistemas más generalizables, robustos y útiles en contexto reales de ciudad inteligente. Abstract This Project develops an urban traffic intensity prediction system using deep learning techniques, with the aim of improving mobility decision-making. Unlike other platforms focused on visualizing the current state, the proposed solution seeks to anticipate future behaviors, and is positioned as an open, replicable alternative specifically oriented towards prediction. To achieve this, a modular architecture based on the Python language has been designed, capable of integrating multiple open data sources: historical traffic records, historical weather situation data, and spatial coordinates of measurement sensors. The system applies a process of cleaning, temporal interpolation, and variable transformation, including cyclic encoding of time and spatial conversion to UTM coordinates, allowing for precise fusion between geographical and meteorological data through techniques such as inverse distance weighting (IDW). The predictive model is based on an LSTM neural network, especially adapted for multivariate time sequences. It is trained using a sliding window strategy of 32 samples (7 hours and 45 minutes) to predict traffic intensity in the next interval. The system additionally incorporates an IterableDataset mechanism to handle large volumes of training data without compromising the stability of the environment. The obtained results show robust accuracy in validation scenarios, with acceptable prediction errors (MAE and RMSE). Furthermore, an interactive web interface has been developed, allowing for the local deployment of the system, with the capacity for real-time data ingestion and direct visualization of predictions. This work demonstrates the technical and operational feasibility of applying deep learning to urban traffic analysis and lays the groundwork for its future evolution towards more generalizable, robust, and useful systems in real smart city contexts."
OpenAlex,deep learning,Deep Learning-Based Data Hiding Technique for Medical Images,Hadjer SAIDI,,2026-06-26,University of Biskra Theses Repository (University of Biskra),"This thesis introduces novel deep learning-based frameworks for secure medical image steganography, addressing the critical challenge of protecting sensitive patient information while preserving diagnostic quality. Medical images present unique security requirements due to their dual nature: containing both critical visual data for diagnosis and sensitive patient metadata, which conventional steganographic techniques do not adequately address. Our work presents two complementary approaches to this challenge. First, we develop a Mask-RCNN based framework that intelligently identifies diagnostically insignificant regions within medical images for strategic data embedding. By combining this regionaware detection with Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) embedding in the frequency domain, our method achieves remarkable imperceptibility with Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR) values exceeding 115 dB while maintaining high payload capacity. Second, we propose a clinical quality-aware convolutional neural network architecture that leverages an encoder-decoder framework for end-to-end steganography. This approach employs parallel processing paths with scaled residual learning to embed secret medical images within cover images while preserving diagnostic features. Extensive experimentation across multiple medical imaging modalities (CT, MRI) from datasets including MIDRC-RICORD-1B, and IQ-OTH/NCCD, demonstrates that our method achieves a good trade-off between payload and imperceptibility. The frameworks developed in this thesis achieve an optimal balance between embedding capacity, imperceptibility, and robust secret recovery, providing healthcare institutions with effective tools for safeguarding patient privacy while maintaining the integrity of medical diagnostics. This work significantly advances the field of medical image security and establishes a foundation for future innovations in secure healthcare information systems."
OpenAlex,deep learning,A Novel Deep-Learning-Based Approach for Estimating High-Resolution InSAR Parameters,"Dell Amore, Luca; Carcereri, Daniel; Demir, Begüm; Rizzoli, Paola",,2026-06-01,elib (German Aerospace Center),"Nowadays, SAR Interferometry (InSAR) represents one of the most powerful tools to perform complex tasks, such as retrieving Earth’s surface topography and monitoring its deformations. However, denoising strategies are crucial for the generation of reliable and high-quality InSAR products. In this framework, we propose a complete and generalized theoretical and statistical model to physically describe and simulate a noise-free interferogram, together with its corresponding noisy version, starting from the knowledge of the InSAR acquisition geometry and of the underlying topography. A deep-learning-based model is then trained in a fully-supervised manner to estimate high-resolution InSAR parameters, i.e. coherence and interferometric phase, leveraging the proposed statistical model. In particular, an accurate assessment of the network’s estimation performance is conducted by comparing it to state-of-the-art denoising filters, such as Boxcar and Phi-Net and showing the added value of the proposed theoretical modifications to the state-of-the-art literature."
