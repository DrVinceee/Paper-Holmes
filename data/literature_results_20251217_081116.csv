PubMed,aortic stenosis,Market Competition and Use of Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement in the United States.,Sara Sakowitz; Syed Shahyan Bakhtiyar; Yas Sanaiha; Sameer Hirji; Sara Pereira; Shayan Ebrahimian; Radoslav Zinoviev; Richard J Shemin; Peyman Benharash,10.1016/j.jacadv.2025.102313,2025-12-15,JACC. Advances,"Transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) has transformed the gold standard management of aortic stenosis (AS). Following device approval, surrounding market competition was noted to spur institutional adoption. With the exponential growth of TAVR, it remains unclear how market competition may influence utilization.
The authors sought to evaluate the association of hospital market competition with TAVR utilization in the contemporary period.
All adults undergoing TAVR or surgical aortic valve replacement for AS from 2018 to 2021 were tabulated from 7 Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project State Inpatient Databases. Market competition was calculated using the Herfindahl-Hirschman Index, based on a variable radius comprising 75% of total discharges for each institution. Patients treated at hospitals in high market competition areas were grouped as competitive (others: noncompetitive).
Among 137,734 patients undergoing surgical aortic valve replacement or TAVR, 83,650 (61%) were competitive. The 2 groups were of clinically similar age, sex, and preoperative comorbidity burden. Following risk-adjustment, treatment at a high market competition hospital was associated with significantly greater likelihood of receiving TAVR (adjusted OR [AOR]: 1.68; CI: 1.26-2.23). On age stratification, this effect remained true across age strata, with the greatest effects noted among patients <50 years (AOR: 1.54; CI: 1.12-2.11) and 50 to 60 years (AOR: 1.30; CI: 1.14-1.48). Moreover, care at a high market competition center was linked with similar odds of mortality and composite complications but significantly greater per-patient costs.
Increasing hospital market competition was linked with increased likelihood of TAVR, particularly among younger populations. Our findings suggest regional competition may be 1 variable that influences clinical practice in the treatment of AS."
PubMed,aortic stenosis,Continuous Assessment of Left Ventricular Outflow Obstruction in Transcatheter Aortic Valve Implantation.,Yu Ando; Atsushi Sugiura; Masanori Yamamoto,10.1016/j.jaccas.2025.106523,2025-12-15,JACC. Case reports,"Left ventricular outflow tract (LVOT) obstruction is a rare but fatal complication after transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI). Early detection and timely intervention are essential for favorable clinical outcomes.
We report a case of LVOT obstruction diagnosed and dynamically monitored via a SavvyWire (Haemonetics). A 78-year-old woman underwent transfemoral TAVI for severe valve stenosis, and continuous hemodynamic monitoring by the SavvyWire identified a significant aorto-left ventricular pressure gradient with systemic hypotension immediately after valve deployment, indicating LVOT obstruction. Prompt administration of intravenous fluids and vasopressors resulted in rapid hemodynamic stabilization.
This case underscores the utility of the SavvyWire for immediate detection and management of dynamic LVOT obstruction, potentially improving safety profiles in TAVI procedures.
Continuous monitoring of the aorto-left ventricular pressure gradient can facilitate early diagnosis of LVOT obstruction in TAVI procedures."
PubMed,aortic stenosis,Therapeutic Effects on Ectopic Burden and LV Ejection Fraction in a Patient With Aortic Stenosis Undergoing TAVR.,Anna Nather; Charis Costopoulos; Sharad Agarwal,10.1016/j.jaccas.2025.106419,2025-12-16,JACC. Case reports,"The etiology of reduced left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) is often multifactorial, making it difficult to isolate a primary cause.
A patient presented with symptomatic heart failure, severe aortic stenosis, reduced LVEF (35%), and frequent premature ventricular contractions (PVCs). Transcatheter aortic valve replacement led to modest improvement. Syncope later revealed high-degree trifascicular atrioventricular block, prompting cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT). Despite CRT and optimized medical therapy, LVEF declined, and PVC burden increased. PVC ablation at the left ventricular outflow tract reduced PVC burden to <1%, restoring LVEF to 55%.
This case highlights the complex interaction between aortic stenosis, conduction disease, and ventricular ectopy. Although transcatheter aortic valve replacement and CRT offered partial benefit, significant improvement occurred only after PVC ablation, supporting the concept of ectopy-induced cardiomyopathy and its reversibility after rhythm control.
In persistent cardiomyopathy, PVCs should be considered a reversible cause, warranting stepwise and multimodal management."

Cardiovascular interventions,"Right ventricle-pulmonary artery (RV-PA) coupling is prognostically important in valvular heart disease.
The authors performed a systematic review and meta-analysis to quantify the association of RV-PA coupling with clinical endpoints after intervention for aortic stenosis (AS), mitral regurgitation (MR), and tricuspid regurgitation (TR).
The primary outcome was all-cause mortality, and the secondary outcome was a composite of major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE). A random-effects model was used to compute pooled effect estimates, and summary receiver-operating characteristic curves identified optimal RV-PA thresholds.
In total, 30 interventional studies (N = 12,992) met eligibility criteria, including 14 AS (n = 6,100), 12 MR (n = 5,032), and 4 TR (n = 1,860) studies. Tricuspid annular plane systolic excursion (TAPSE) to pulmonary artery systolic pressure (PASP) was the most studied RV-PA coupling index. Reduced TAPSE/PASP was independently associated with all-cause mortality (AS adjusted HR: 1.69 [95% CI: 1.30-2.20]; MR adjusted HR: 1.94 [95% CI: 1.40-2.69]; P < 0.001) and the composite MACE (AS adjusted HR: 1.60 [95% CI: 1.29-2.00]; MR adjusted HR: 2.01 [95% CI: 1.54-2.62]; P < 0.001). There were significant nonlinear associations between TAPSE/PASP and adverse outcomes in AS and MR (P < 0.001). There were insufficient data to estimate a pooled effect-size in TR. Optimal TAPSE/PASP thresholds to predict all-cause mortality were ≤0.51 mm/mm Hg for AS interventions, ≤0.33 mm/mm Hg for MR interventions and ≤0.44 mm/mm Hg for TR interventions.
TAPSE/PASP is an independent predictor of outcomes after interventions for AS and MR. The disease-specific TAPSE/PASP cutoffs could be integrated into risk-stratification models to better predict mortality before valve interventions and improve patient selection."

Recently, basal septal bulge (BSB) has been reported as a predictor of CD. However, the impact of BSB on CD using ACURATE neo/neo2 remains unclear. We hypothesized that the left bundle branch could be damaged in patients with large BSB even by low radial force. This study investigated the predictors of CD after TAVR using ACURATE neo/neo2 and the impact of BSB on CD.
We retrospectively analyzed 518 patients who underwent TAVR with ACURATE neo/neo2 in a single center. New-onset CD was defined as 30-day new permanent pacemaker implantation or new left bundle branch block lasting until discharge. The endpoints were the predictors of CD and the effect of BSB.
The incidence of CD was 11.0%. Multivariate analysis showed that complete right bundle branch block (odds ratio [OR]: 3.45; 95% CI: 1.63-7.30), membranous septum length <2 mm (OR: 2.14; 95% CI: 1.19-3.85), and BSB ≥3 mm (OR: 2.17; 95% CI: 1.22-3.86) were independent baseline predictors of CD. Postdilatation was the sole procedural predictor (OR: 2.28; 95% CI: 1.03-5.02). The risk of CD could be stratified according to the number of baseline predictors in patients with BSB ≥3 mm (0: 9.5%, 1: 26.1%, 2: 66.7%, p < 0.0001).
BSB was significantly associated with CD in ACURATE neo/neo2, and CD risk could be stratified using baseline factors in patients with large BSB. These findings might be beneficial for periprocedural management and TAVR strategy."

This case is unique for a 35-year-old female with progressive high-degree AV block and dual heterozygous variants (MYH7 c.748A > T, DES c.553G > A), supplementing HCM's clinical-genetic spectrum.
The patient had 11-year post-exertional chest pain (aggravated recently), family history of sudden cardiac death, hypotension (87/46 mm Hg), bradycardia (50 bpm). ECG progressed to complete heart block; echocardiography showed left atrial enlargement, septal thickening, apical trabecular hyperplasia; cardiac MRI revealed septal fibrosis. Pro-BNP (846 ng/L) and troponin T (12 ng/L) were elevated. Genetic testing found MYH7 (highly suspected pathogenic) and DES (suspected pathogenic) variants; family screening identified 2 affected individuals.
HCM, high-degree AV block, left atrial enlargement.
Dual-chamber pacemaker implantation, metoprolol + spironolactone.
Symptom relief, no perioperative complications; long-term follow-up initiated.
HCM with high-degree AV block needs genetic testing; pacemaker implantation and long-term monitoring are key for preventing sudden cardiac death. Family screening is vital for risk stratification."

This systematic review and meta-analysis compares clinical outcomes in patients with and without SGLT2i following TAVR. Major electronic databases were systematically searched through April 2025 for studies evaluating SGLT2i following TAVR. Risk ratios (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) were pooled using a random-effects model. A P value of ≤0.05 was considered statistically significant. Two studies with 1534 patients undergoing TAVR (679: SGLT2i; 855: no SGLT2i) were included. SGLT2i therapy led to a significant reduction in HF hospitalization (RR: 0.56; 95% CI: 0.32-0.99; P = 0.05); however, no differences in all-cause (RR: 0.48; 95% CI: 0.13-1.72; P = 0.26) and cardiovascular mortality (RR: 0.53; 95% CI: 0.19-1.48; P = 0.22) were noted. SGLT2i are associated with a statistically and clinically significant reduction in HF hospitalization; however, no reduction in mortality was observed following TAVR. Further randomized controlled trials are warranted to support future guideline recommendations regarding SGLT2i following TAVR."

We aimed at evaluating the early clinical outcomes of TAx vs transfemoral (TF) access for TAVR.
We conducted a retrospective observational study stemming from the prospective RISPEVA registry, including all consecutive patients undergoing TAVR since 2013 at our Institution, where TAx is the only alternative access site whenever TF is contraindicated.
A total of 2164 patients were included: 60 (2.8 %) in the TAx group, and 2104 (97.2 %) in the TF group. Notably, no patient required alternative accesses or was referred for surgical aortic valve replacement. Baseline characteristics, including surgical risk scores such as EuroScore II (TAx = 5.3 ± 5.7, TF = 3.6 ± 3.7, p < 0.001) and comorbidities such as prior myocardial infarction (TAx = 10 [17.2 %], TF = 157 [8.1 %], p = 0.025), were clearly disfavoring the TAx group. Despite higher procedural times in the TAx group (69 ± 24 vs 59 ± 13 min, p < 0.001), procedural success rates were high in both groups (TAx = 58 [96.7 %], TF = 2077 [98.7 %], p = 0.191). Similarly, at 1-month follow-up there were no significant differences in all-cause mortality (TAx = 1 [1.7 %], TF = 26 [1.2 %], p = 0.534), stroke (TAx = 1 [1.7 %], TF = 11 [0.5 %], p = 0.287), myocardial infarction (TAx = 1 [1.7 %], TF = 8 [0.4 %], p = 0.224), major vascular complication (TAx = 4 [6.7 %], TF = 90 [4.3 %], p = 0.329), or major bleeding (TAx = 1 [1.7 %], TF = 36 [1.7 %], p = 1), as well as their composite (TAx = 7 [11.7 %], TF = 155 [7.4 %], risk difference = 4.3 % [95 % confidence interval - 3.9 % to 12.5 %], p = 0.210). Similar findings were obtained at multivariable adjusted analyses and those based on inverse probability of treatment weighting, despite their limited reliability given low event-per-variable ratios and instability.
In this single-center retrospective study, TAx TAVR was feasible whenever TF was not envisionable, and yielded quite favorable short-term clinical outcomes. While promising, these findings remain descriptive and hypothesis-generating, thus requiring additional prospective and randomized validation."

The aim of this study was to compare the 1-year clinical outcomes, including valve performance, in patients undergoing TAVR with the S3UR compared to the SAPIEN 3 or SAPIEN 3 Ultra (S3/S3U). Patients with severe native aortic stenosis who underwent TAVR with either the S3UR or the S3/S3U valve were matched using propensity scores. Predictors of 1-year outcomes were identified. A subgroup analysis of patients who underwent post-TAVR CT was conducted. Among 4,908 patients, 312 matched pairs were assessed. At 1-year, compared to the S3/S3U group, the S3UR group exhibited lower all-cause mortality (HR: 0.42; 95% CI: 0.18-0.96; p = 0.041). The S3UR group demonstrated superior hemodynamic performance, including lower transvalvular gradients, larger effective orifice areas, and decreased incidence of severe prosthesis-patient mismatch and paravalvular leak. In patients who underwent post-TAVR CT (n = 280), prevalence of hypoattenuated leaflet thickening (HALT) at 30-day was lower in the S3UR group compared to S3/S3U (5.7% vs 16.2%; p = 0.006). In multivariate analysis, the S3UR group was independently associated with lower 1-year mortality and reduced HALT. In this propensity score-matched cohort, compared with the S3/S3U group, the S3UR group demonstrated favorable clinical outcomes and superior hemodynamic performance. In subgroup analysis, S3UR was also associated with a lower HALT incidence."
PubMed,aortic stenosis,Impact of clonal hematopoiesis of indeterminate potential on prognosis in patients with severe aortic valve stenosis: a meta-analysis.,Huang Sun; Ruijie Li; Xingyu Cao; Huawei Wang; Peng Ding; Yan Ang; Xiying Guo,10.1007/s00392-025-02823-0,2025-12-15,Clinical research in cardiology : official journal of the German Cardiac Society,"Clonal hematopoiesis of indeterminate potential (CHIP), commonly involving TET2 and DNMT3A mutations, is increasingly recognized as a cardiovascular risk factor, but its prognostic role in severe aortic valve stenosis (AVS) remains unclear. This study aimed to systematically evaluate the impact of CHIP on survival in AVS patients undergoing valve replacement.
A systematic search of PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, and Scopus through May 2025 identified observational studies of CHIP in AVS patients undergoing valve replacement. Eligible studies used validated genomic sequencing methods to identify CHIP and reported mortality outcomes. Two reviewers independently extracted study characteristics, outcomes, and related variables. Pooled hazard ratios (HRs) were calculated, with subgroup analyses by mutation type and geographic region, and meta-regression to assess effect modifiers. Risk of bias was assessed using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale, and sensitivity and publication bias analyses were also assessed.
Five studies with 1,175 patients were included. CHIP showed a non-significant trend toward increased all-cause mortality (HR = 1.58; 95% CI: 0.97-2.57; P = 0.0687; I2 = 64.8%). When defined by TET2 mutations, CHIP was significantly associated with worse survival (HR = 1.91; 95% CI: 1.43-2.56; P < 0.001, I2 = 0%), whereas DNMT3A mutations were not. In Western cohorts, CHIP was significantly associated with increased mortality (HR = 1.65; 95% CI: 1.28-2.12; P < 0.0001; I2 = 38.7%). Meta-regression identified body mass index (BMI) as a significant modifier of the CHIP-mortality association (P = 0.0069).
CHIP, particularly TET2-related mutations, is associated with poorer survival in patients with severe AVS undergoing valve replacement. In Western populations, CHIP was significantly associated with increased mortality. Higher BMI further strengthened this association across all patients. These findings indicate that CHIP may be a potential marker for risk stratification and preventive strategies, but confirmation in larger and more diverse cohorts is required."

Case reports,"Anomalous coronary artery from the opposite sinus is a rare congenital anomaly with potentially fatal outcomes. Anomalous right coronary artery (ARCA) with a malignant interarterial course is strongly linked to sudden cardiac death Beyond description of anatomy, optimal management requires careful diagnostic evaluation and individualized decision-making.
We present 3 cases of ARCA with malignant interarterial course: 1) an 80-year-old man with severe aortic stenosis, 2) a 61-year-old woman with exertional angina and interarterial narrowing, and 3) a 25-year-old asymptomatic woman with ventricular ectopy and significant proximal narrowing. Each case highlights unique diagnostic challenges and therapeutic considerations.
Coronary computed tomography angiography is the gold standard for defining anatomy, whereas functional testing, cardiac magnetic resonance, and invasive imaging refine risk stratification. Management ranges from surveillance with lifestyle modification in low-risk, asymptomatic patients to surgical correction (unroofing, reimplantation, or coronary artery bypass grafting) in young or high-risk individuals. We summarize these principles in a practical flowchart to guide clinicians.
Early recognition, structured diagnostic work-up, and risk-based individualized management are essential to prevent adverse outcomes in ARCA. This case series provides both illustrative clinical examples and an evidence-based framework for evaluation and management."

We studied predictors of progression and clinical outcomes in moderate AS to improve risk stratification and add to the existing literature.
Data collected through the Tempus Next care pathway intelligence platform at our tertiary referral center were retrospectively analyzed. The reports of echocardiograms performed from October 2017 to January 2020 were screened for descriptive or quantitative evidence of moderate AS. Follow-up extended until January 2022. Clinical data were extracted following manual chart review. Socioeconomic variables were collected based on zip-code-aggregated United States census data. The endpoints were progression from moderate to severe valvular AS, all-cause mortality, all-cause hospitalization, and heart failure (HF) hospitalization. The final multivariable model was selected using a variable selection algorithm inspired by greedy causal discovery algorithms.
A total of 34 450 echocardiograms (N = 25 204 patients) were screened during the inclusion period; 367 patients met inclusion criteria and were included in the final analysis. Progression to severe AS was noted in 172 patients (median time to progression 16 months). The final predictive models after variable selection exhibited modest predictive power: progression to severe AS, AUC = 0.68; all-cause mortality, 0.797; all-cause hospitalization, 0.629; heart failure hospitalization, 0.744. Variables predictive for the endpoints included comorbidities, echocardiographic variables, and demographics.
Our findings support further work and exploration of a paradigm shift in the assessment and management of AS, moving beyond traditional measures to a multiparametric model incorporating a broader spectrum of clinical, echocardiographic, and socioeconomic variables."

Simple biomarkers to predict mid-term mortality are still needed. This study evaluated the prognostic value of the preprocedural neutrophil percentage-to-albumin ratio (NPAR) for 2-year all-cause mortality after TAVR.
A total of 618 patients undergoing TAVR between 2013 and 2023 were retrospectively analyzed. NPAR was calculated as neutrophil percentage × 100 / albumin (g/dL), and patients were classified into tertiles. The prognostic role of NPAR was assessed using Cox regression, Kaplan-Meier survival analysis, and receiver operating characteristic curves.
Baseline characteristics were similar across tertiles, but higher NPAR was associated with elevated inflammation and lower albumin levels. In multivariable Cox analysis, high NPAR independently predicted 2-year mortality (T3 vs. T1: hazard ratio [HR] 2.75, 95% CI 1.77-4.28; P < .001). In a model including both categorical NPAR and Society of Thoracic Surgeons Predicted Risk of Mortality (STS-PROM), tertile 3 of NPAR (HR 2.49, 95% CI 1.61-3.85; P < .001) and STS-PROM (HR 1.31, 95% CI 1.12-1.53; P = .001) remained independent predictors, indicating incremental prognostic value of NPAR beyond established surgical risk scores. Kaplan-Meier curves showed the lowest survival in the highest tertile (35.9% mortality at 2 years). Receiver operating characteristic analysis confirmed NPAR had the best discriminatory ability (area under the curve = 0.703).
Preprocedural NPAR is an independent, low-cost, and readily available biomarker for predicting mid-term mortality after TAVR. Its integration into risk models may improve prediction accuracy and help guide patient management."

We retrospectively analyzed 1054 patients undergoing transfemoral transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) for tricuspid aortic valve stenosis with LAA, defined as an annulus area > 430 mm2, using either a BE-THV (SAPIEN 3, Edwards Life Sciences) or SE-THV (Evolut R/PRO, Medtronic). The 7-year cumulative incidences of all-cause mortality and bioprosthetic valve failure (BVF) were evaluated in the overall cohort and the propensity score (PS)-matched cohort.
Among the 1054 patients with LAA, 829 (78.7 %) received a BE-THV. The PS-matched population resulted in 218 pairs. The cumulative incidence of all-cause mortality 7 years after TAVI was comparable between the BE-THV and SE-THV groups in the overall cohort (58.6 % vs. 67.6 %, log-rank P = 0.848) and the PS-matched cohort (53.2 % vs. 69.9 %, log-rank P = 0.173). In the overall cohort, the BE-THV group demonstrated a lower exposure-adjusted BVF rate as compared with the SE-THV, although the difference was not significant (6.1 vs. 9.6 events per 1000 patient-years, P = 0.258). This trend became pronounced after PS matching (3.3 vs. 9.9 events per 1000 patient-years, P = 0.017), which was also confirmed by Gray's test (P = 0.032).
In the current analysis focusing on patients with LAA, the BE-THV and SE-THV groups had a comparable long-term prognosis, but the BE-THV group had a lower BVF rate than did the SE-THV group.

The most common LF cause was reduced LVEF (n = 228, 55.9%), while preserved LVEF included five aetiologies: (1)mixed aetiologies (n = 65, 36.1%), (2)small LV cavity (n = 58, 32.2%), (3)significant isolated mitral regurgitation (n = 39, 21.7%), (4)significant isolated tricuspid regurgitation (n = 13, 7.2%), (5)significant isolated mitral stenosis (n = 5, 2.8%). Over a median follow-up of 15 (IQR 6 - 36) months obtained in 302 patients, 159 (52.6%) reached the primary composite endpoint, 108 (35.8%) died and 91 (30.8%) were hospitalized due to HF. LF aetiology was not associated with outcomes. Independent predictors of the primary endpoint were severe MR (adj.HR 1.71, p = 0.04) and TR (adj.HR 1.47, p = 0.04). Aortic valve replacement (adj.HR 0.76, p < 0.001) and mean transvalvular gradient ≥ 40 mmHg (adj.HR 0.39, p < 0.001) were protective.
The main cause of LFAS is reduced LVEF, while in preserved LVEF mixed causes and small LV volume prevailed, without association with the outcome. Severe mitral and tricuspid regurgitation were strongly associated with worse outcomes, while valve replacement and mean transvalvular gradient ≥ 40 mmHg emerged as protective factors."

However, temporal trends in mortality remains poorly understood. This study aimed to compare survival after urgent versus elective TAVR using a reconstructed individual patient data (IPD) meta-analysis.
PubMed, Embase, and Scopus were searched through August 2025. Studies reporting Kaplan-Meier (KM) survival curves for urgent versus elective TAVR were included. Survival data were digitally extracted from published KM curves, and IPD were reconstructed algorithmically using a two-stage approach. Kaplan-Meier curves and Cox frailty models estimated survival and hazard ratios (HRs). Landmark analysis at one-year post-procedure and restricted mean survival time (RMST) were also employed to compare survival.
Eleven studies including 77,108 patients were identified. Kaplan-Meier curves were available for 76,108 patients (urgent: 5,683; elective: 71,425) and used for reconstructed IPD analysis. Urgent TAVR was associated with higher early mortality (HR 1.83, 95% CI: 1.73-1.93; p < 0.001), with convergence beyond one year (HR 1.01, 95% CI: 0.84-1.22; p = 0.83). RMST analysis demonstrated a 6.5-month overall survival advantage in favor of elective TAVR (p = 0.001).
Urgent TAVR is associated with significantly increased early mortality compared with elective TAVR. These findings highlight the prognostic implications of procedural timing and support early referral for elective intervention in patients with severe AS."

As indications expand toward younger, low-risk and asymptomatic patients, the clinical paradigm is shifting from isolated valvular intervention to lifetime valve management. This requires balancing procedural planning to optimize the index procedure with long-term considerations, including prosthesis durability, coronary re-accessibility, need for TAVI-in-TAVI, and risk of patient-prosthesis mismatch and conduction abnormalities. Prosthesis and patient-related challenges remain central. Bicuspid aortic valve and small aortic annulus are anatomical features associated with an increased post-TAVI risk of paravalvular leak, patient-prosthesis mismatch, and conduction disturbances, though outcomes have improved with new-generation devices and meticulous preprocedural planning. Durability concerns are particularly relevant in younger patients, with TAVI-in-TAVI offering a feasible reintervention strategy yet raising issues of coronary re-access and potential patient-prosthesis mismatch. Conduction disturbances and permanent pacemaker implantation remain frequent after TAVI, underscoring the importance of implantation techniques and physiologic pacing strategies. Furthermore, concomitant coronary artery disease requires individualized revascularization strategies, with an increasing role of invasive physiological assessment. Beyond device-related factors, medical therapy may favourably influence clinical outcomes in patients undergoing TAVI, both in pre- and post-procedural setting. In this era of expanding indications, achieving durable, favourable outcomes requires a comprehensive approach that integrates anatomical and clinical considerations, individualized device selection, careful lifetime planning, and optimization of pharmacologic therapy."

Left atrial (LA) dysfunction is an established prognostic marker in various clinical settings. This study aimed to evaluate the correlation between LA function, assessed by strain parameters, and the incidence of permanent pacemaker (PPM) implantation or major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) in patients with SAS undergoing TAVI. A total of 157 patients with SAS treated with TAVI between January 2019 and April 2021 were screened. Patients with pre-existing cardiac implanted devices or permanent atrial fibrillation were excluded. The mean follow-up was 24 ± 13 months. LA function was assessed using transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) by measuring three strain parameters: LA reservoir strain (LASr), LA conduit strain (LASct), and LA contractile strain (LAScd). The study endpoints were the association between these strain parameters and the occurrence of PPM implantation or MACE during follow-up. Ninety-nine patients were included in the analysis. During follow-up, 43 patients experienced MACE. Mean values for LASr, LASct, and LAScd were 29.5 ± 12.7%, -18.7 ± 11.0%, and - 18.5 ± 7.3%, respectively. Patients requiring PPM implantation showed significantly reduced LA strain values compared to those who did not (LASr: 13.1% vs. 33.2%; LASct: -10.1% vs. -21.0%; LAScd: -6.7% vs. -21.6%, p < 0.001). Similarly, patients who developed MACE had reduced strain values compared to those without events (LASr: 21.9% vs. 35.4%; LASct: -14.3% vs. -21.8%; LAScd: -9.9% vs. -25.5%, p < 0.001). Pre-TAVI LA dysfunction, assessed through LA strain, is closely associated with increased risk of PPM implantation and MACE."

With a focus on the prevalent psychological complications following the onset of this condition, this study aimed to explore the correlation between antenatal depression and Corona disease anxiety, personality traits, and postpartum depression during the COVID-19 pandemic.                                                           Materials and Methods:                     This cross-sectional descriptive-analytical study investigated women receiving care at health centers affiliated with Kerman University of Medical Sciences during the last month of their pregnancy and the postpartum period in 2022. Following the acquisition of informed consent, participants were assessed using various measures, including demographic and obstetric information, the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale, the Corona Disease Anxiety Scale (CDAS), and the NEO Personality Inventory-Revised during their third trimester of pregnancy. The same group of participants completed the Edinburgh Depression Scale and the Corona Disease Anxiety Scale (CDAS) 4-6 weeks after childbirth.                                                           Results and Discussion:                     There was a significant correlation between family income, unwanted pregnancy as perceived by both the mother and father, and antenatal depression. Additionally, marital satisfaction played a significant role in postpartum depression. Furthermore, antenatal depression was significantly associated with neuroticism, agreeableness, and physical symptoms related to Corona disease anxiety. Personality traits, with the exception of extroversion and conscientiousness, and various domains of Corona disease anxiety, excluding psychological symptoms, were also significantly associated with postpartum depression.                                                           Conclusion:                     During pandemics or epidemics, such as the COVID-19 outbreak, experiencing mental distress during pregnancy can contribute to mental health issues during the postpartum period. This risk is particularly true in individuals with unique personality traits, emphasizing the need for increased focus on mental health within prenatal care during these crises."

Method:                     This cross-sectional study was conducted in Kerman, Iran. Data were collected from patients who visited Afzalipour Hospital in Kerman more than twice during the COVID-19 epidemic from the end of February 2020 to March 21, 2021. We conducted two key analyses: 1. Mixed effect logistic regression was used to check the relationship between the variables and COVID-19 severity. 2. Mixed effect linear regression was used to check the relationship between the variables and the length of stay in the hospital.                                                           Results:                     The findings indicated that the most important risk factors for the severity of COVID-19 were heart diseases (OR=1.67,95%CI:1.20-2.30), increasing age (OR=2.23 for age&gt;54, 95%CI:1.70- 2.90), male gender (OR=1.47,95%CI:1.10-1.96), respiratory diseases other than asthma, and frequency of admission (OR=1.60,95%CI:1.20-2.15). All patients who underwent readmission experienced a shorter duration of hospitalization during their subsequent admission (OR=0.94,95%CI:0.91,0.96) and had a higher mortality rate (30% within 14 days, 26.6% between 14-90 days). Patients readmitted at intervals of 14-90 days and greater than 90 days exhibited lower disease severity compared to those readmitted within the 0-14 day period.                                                           Conclusion:                     Examining readmissions, the severity of COVID-19, and the length of hospital stay in affected patients are important factors for planning and allocating resources for COVID-19 management and treatment. These factors can help policymakers develop effective clinical guidelines for hospitalization or outpatient treatment of COVID-19 patients and contribute to reducing the burden of disease in the community."

Kinovea, as an accessible motion-analysis software, provides both visual and quantitative feedback. However, its application in supporting technique development among beginner athletes remains insufficiently explored. Aim: This study aims to describe the use of Kinovea in biomechanics training and examine its contribution to the awareness of kinematic characteristics and movement techniques among beginner athletes. Methods: A descriptive qualitative design involved 72 beginner athletes aged 18–25 years selected through purposive sampling. Data were collected over 16 weeks through interviews, field observations, and motion video recordings analyzed using Kinovea. Kinematic data focused on joint angles, stride behavior, and movement phases during walking, running, and the flight phase. Qualitative data were analyzed using content analysis with NVivo 12, while kinematic results were interpreted descriptively to identify performance patterns and areas for technical refinement. Result: Kinematic analysis showed coordinated joint-angle patterns across all phases. Walking analysis identified arm swing angles of 50.9°–58.8° and leg separation angles of 64.3°–67.2°, indicating a stable gait rhythm. The running analysis revealed knee angles of 68.8°–69.8° and elbow angles of 87.6°–89.1°, indicating efficient propulsive mechanics. The flight phase demonstrated knee angles of 81.2°–87.8° and elbow angles of 80.4°–88.3°, suggesting effective momentum use and postural stability. These measurements supported stride-efficiency assessment and technique evaluation. Qualitative findings revealed that Kinovea enabled athletes to interpret movement phases and identify technical inefficiencies through slow-motion and frame-by-frame visualization. Conclusion: Kinovea supports basic motion analysis by providing clear kinematic information and helping beginner athletes observe and refine their movement techniques. The findings also offer practical value for coaches by enabling more precise identification of inefficient patterns and guiding targeted corrections during early-stage training."
