This study aimed to investigate the accuracy of SS risk prediction using pre-procedural CT by comparing it to the actual SS risk observed on post-procedural CT during TAV-in-TAV.
We retrospectively evaluated 139 consecutive patients who underwent TAVR with a balloon-expandable valve. The predicted valve-to-sinotubular junction (VTSTJ) length and calcium volume of each coronary cusp were measured on pre-procedural CT. The observed VTSTJ length was assessed on post-procedural CT. High SS risk was defined as VTSTJ < 2.0 mm in either the right or left coronary cusp. Pre-procedural CT classified 78 patients into the high predicted SS (PSS) risk group; 77 (98.7%) showed a high observed SS (OSS) risk on post-procedural CT. Among the 61 patients classified as having low PSS risk, 44 (72.1%) were found to have high OSS risk post-TAVR. In this subgroup, patients with high OSS risk had a significantly higher proportion of non-coronary cusp calcium volume (NCC-CV) compared to those with low OSS risk (median 48.7% [interquartile range (IQR): 42.1-55.2] vs. 39.2% [IQR: 33.7-45.4]; p = 0.004). Multivariable logistic regression revealed NCC-CV ≥ 41.6% as an independent predictor of high OSS risk during TAV-in-TAV (odds ratio: 12.59 [95% confidence interval: 4.20-44.14], p < 0.001).
Asymmetric NCC calcification was associated with discrepancies in SS predictions on pre-procedural CT."

Hemoglobin (Hb) levels are physiologically different in males and females, and sex differences are increasingly recognized to play an important role in the prognosis of many cardiovascular diseases, including aortic valve stenosis. We aimed to evaluate the prognostic role of preoperative anemia, RDW, and periprocedural transfusions in TAVI patients followed up to 2 years, especially focusing on sex-related differences. 609 patients (median age 83 years, 53.9% females) undergoing TAVI at Verona University Hospital between March 2010 and June 2019 were retrospectively evaluated. Anemia before TAVI was highly prevalent (55.0%) in our population, mostly mild to moderate. Females were less anemic than males (48.8% versus 62.3%, p = 0.001) but experienced more vascular complications and were more frequently transfused within 30 days of the procedure (43.3% versus 28.8%, p < 0.001). Overall, anemic patients at baseline had a 2-year survival lower than non-anemic patients (Log-rank 5.915, p = 0.015). Similarly, patients with baseline RDW > 15% had reduced survival at 2 years compared to patients with normal RDW (Log-rank 14.038, p < 0.001). Grouping for sex, these differences only persisted in males. Multivariable analyses showed that hematological variables, such as periprocedural transfusions and RDW, were significant predictors of 2-year mortality in males but not in females. Our study highlights significant sex-related differences in the role of hematological parameters as independent predictors of 2-year mortality after TAVI."

Electronic health record (EHR)-based nudges improve adherence to treatment but have not been widely evaluated in valvular heart disease.
In this multicenter study across three diverse U.S. health systems, an automated, non-interruptive EHR-embedded nudge was implemented within the echocardiography report of patients with a first diagnosis (index echo) of severe AS. The study primarily targeted patients whose index echo was ordered by non-cardiac specialty providers. The primary endpoint was referral to a cardiac specialist within 90 days. Secondary endpoints were a composite of completed cardiac specialty visit or aortic valve replacement (AVR) within 90 days, and AVR within 6 months. Analyses compared pre- and post-nudge cohorts using propensity score matching and multivariable logistic regression models. A difference-in-difference analysis was conducted to evaluate whether the nudge's effect differed by referring provider specialty (cardiac vs. non-cardiac).
5,009 patients (mean age 78±11 years, 57% men, 88% White, 69% symptomatic) were identified. After propensity score matching (Total n=3,840, Pre-nudge: 2,560 patients, post-nudge: 1,280 patients), referral to cardiac specialty care increased from 94% pre-nudge to 97% post-nudge (p<0.001), and the composite outcome improved from 89% to 93% post-nudge (p=0.003). Among non-cardiac specialty providers, all three outcomes of referral (89% to 96%, p<0.001), composite outcome (83% to 88%, p=0.017) and AVR within 6 months were higher post-nudge (33% to 39%, p=0.016). In the multivariable logistic regression model of the full-cohort, the nudge was independently associated with higher odds of referral (aOR 1.62, 95% CI 1.15-2.30; p=0.006) and composite outcome (aOR 1.40, 95% CI 1.10-1.79; p=0.007), with a significant interaction indicating that the effect was most pronounced among non-cardiac specialty providers (p<0.001).
A non-interruptive, scalable, EHR-embedded nudge within echocardiography reports improved referral to cardiac specialty care and treatment in patients with newly diagnosed severe AS, particularly among non-cardiac specialty providers. These findings support the role of non-interruptive, automated nudges in standardizing guidelines-based care in severe AS."
PubMed,aortic stenosis,Vascular Calcification and Heart Failure: A Bidirectional Mendelian Randomization and Mediation Analysis.,Yajie Cai; Mengmeng Zhu; Qian Xu; Xi Cheng; Yiwen Li; Yanfei Liu; Yue Liu,10.1111/jebm.70124,2026-02-21,Journal of evidence-based medicine,"Although basic research and observational clinical studies have shown an association between vascular calcification (VC) and heart failure (HF), the low level of evidence cannot directly indicate a causal relationship, and no Mendelian randomization (MR) study has been conducted to explore the relationship between VC and HF.
This study used bidirectional, multivariable, and mediation MR to comprehensively analyze the associations between different VC subtypes and HF as well as its subtypes from multiple perspectives. Accessible genome-wide association study (GWAS) data of VC were included, covering coronary artery calcification (CAC), abdominal aortic calcification (AAC), and calcific aortic valve stenosis (CAVS). Accessible public GWAS data of HF were also included, covering overall heart failure (HFall), ischemic heart failure (IHF), non-ischemic heart failure (ni-HF) recently published in Nature Genetics, and GWAS data of ni-HF with reduced ejection fraction (ni-HFrEF) and ni-HF with preserved ejection fraction (ni-HFpEF) which were classified based on ejection fraction.
After sensitivity analysis and multiple correction, the following findings were obtained: (1) VC significantly increases the risk of HF. Specifically, CAC, AAC, and CAVS all significantly increase the risks of HFall and IHF; only CAVS is associated with an increased risk of ni-HF, while CAC and AAC have no impact on ni-HF; VC has no impact on ni-HFrEF or ni-HFpEF. (2) HF also promotes the progression of VC, indicating a bidirectional causal relationship between the two. Specifically, HFall and IHF significantly increase the risks of CAC and AAC; IHF increases the risk of CAVS; no reverse causal relationship is found between ni-HF (including its subtypes) and VC. (3) After two-step MR and multivariable MR correction, atrial fibrillation (AF) is found to partially mediate the causal effect of CAVS on HFall, with a mediation proportion of 21.65%.
This study reveals a bidirectional causal relationship between VC and HF through two-sample bidirectional MR, suggesting that early detection and management of VC are conducive to the prevention and treatment of HF, especially in high-risk populations such as those with ischemic heart disease. Controlling HF also helps delay the progression of VC and improve vascular status, which is the cornerstone of the prognosis of various cardiovascular diseases. Mediation analysis identifies AF as an important mediating factor, suggesting that screening and intervention of AF may be the key link to block the ""VC → AF → HF"" pathway, providing new genetic evidence for the prevention and treatment of HF."

Cardiovascular Imaging,"Aortic stenosis (AS) is characterized by fibrotic and calcific remodeling of the valve, but their sex- and morphology-specific contributions to disease severity remain incompletely characterized.
This cross-sectional analysis enrolled 448 AS patients with preserved flow (left ventricular ejection fraction ≥50%, stroke volume index >35 mL/m²) who underwent comprehensive echocardiography and cardiac CT, severity was classified by both peak aortic jet velocity and indexed aortic valve area (AVA), and stratified by sex and valve morphology (bicuspid [BAV] or tricuspid [TAV] aortic valve). Mean age was 64.6±10.1 years, 48.2% were female, and 54.5% had BAV. Calcification metrics showed consistent, significant correlations with peak aortic jet velocity (e.g., √Calcific volume density : R = 0.571, P<0.001) and indexed AVA (R = -0.466, P<0.001) across all subgroups. In contrast, fibrotic volume density demonstrated minimal or non-significant correlations with severity indices and lacked a proportional association across severity stages. Pronounced sex- and morphology-specific patterns were observed. Specifically, in severe AS classified by both peak aortic jet velocity and indexed AVA, women with BAV had higher fibrotic volume density than men (P=0.017 and 0.062), while men exhibited greater calcification (Both P<0.001). Among TAV patients, men had higher calcific volume density (Both P<0.001) and similar fibrotic volume density (P=0.792 and 0.923) than women.
Valvular calcification is the tissue component more strongly and consistently associated with disease severity in AS, irrespective of whether assessed by peak aortic jet velocity or indexed AVA. Fibrosis represents a distinct phenotypic feature, particularly prominent in women with BAV."

Lipoprotein(a) has anti-fibrinolytic properties; therefore, aspirin may reduce cardiovascular disease risk among individuals with high Lp(a). This analysis sought to determine the association of aspirin with incident AVC and AS across Lp(a) and LDL-C levels.
This observational study included up to 6598 participants in the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis. Aortic valve calcium was measured on non-contrast cardiac computed tomography. Multivariable Cox hazards regression assessed the association of self-reported regular aspirin use (≥3 days/week) with incident AVC and severe AS, stratified by Lp(a) and LDL-C. Aortic valve calcium and Lp(a) values were not reported to participants.
Mean age was 62 years, 53% were women, 23% reported regular aspirin use, 8% developed AVC (median 8.9 years), and 1% developed severe AS (median 16.7 years). Among individuals with elevated Lp(a), regular aspirin use was associated with a lower risk of incident AVC (Lp(a) ≥75 mg/dL: hazard ratio (HR) .42, 95% confidence interval (CI) .19-.93; Lp(a) ≥100 mg/dL: HR .17, 95% CI .04-.67) and severe AS (Lp(a) ≥50 mg/dL: HR .13, 95% CI: .04-.47; Lp(a) ≥75 mg/dL: HR .02, 95% CI .001-.29). For participants with elevated LDL-C, there was no association of regular aspirin use with incident AVC (LDL-C ≥130 mg/dL: HR 1.02, 95% CI .66-1.58; LDL-C ≥160 mg/dL: HR 1.51, 95% CI .53-4.28) or severe AS (LDL-C ≥100 mg/dL: HR .70, 95% CI .39-1.26; LDL-C ≥130 mg/dL: HR .46, 95% CI .14-1.47).
In this exploratory analysis of prospective observational cohort data, regular aspirin use was associated with a lower risk of AVC and severe AS in persons with high Lp(a), but not high LDL-C. Confirmatory studies are required to determine the role of aspirin in the prevention of AVC and AS for persons with high Lp(a)."

Those artifacts remain uncontrollable despite scanner-provided B0 shimming based on low-order spherical harmonic shapes. To mitigate those artifacts for higher image fidelity, the development of advanced B0 shimming techniques is demanding and typically requires knowledge of cardiac B0 conditions across patient populations. We recently proposed a new simulation approach to derive cardiac B0 distributions from readily available chest-abdomen-pelvis CT structural images based on first principles of classical electrodynamics. This approach is able to calculate the air-tissue interface-induced magnetic field variation across the body from diverse subjects using regular CT images. While the computational method has been step-by-step validated in previous work, a comprehensive demonstration in patients has been missing.
The aim of this study is to validate our proposed structural CT-derived cardiac B0 magnetic field computation approach using a side-by-side comparison between simulation and in vivo measurement obtained from the same cohort of clinical subjects.
Six subjects (female: 3, male: 3, age: 54.5 ± 17.2 years) with aortic stenosis or cancer who underwent clinically-indicated CT scans of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis were consented to undergo additional in vivo cardiac B0 measurement on a 3T MRI scanner. B0 distributions in the heart were computed based on CT images using our recently proposed approach and in vivo B0 maps acquired experimentally. CT images and MRI-based anatomical images were co-registered before field calculation, followed by the side-by-side field comparison after computation using correlation analysis of inhomogeneous field values, as well as the comparison of first-order spherical harmonic coefficients after decomposing field maps and the residual B0 inhomogeneities after shim from first to fifth order.
Simulated B0 maps show excellent agreement with in vivo measured B0 maps and strong average correlation (r = 0.92). After first and second-order shim analyses, both field maps show highly similar residual local B0 field patterns, especially near cardiophrenic angles and in the heart's inferior region, demonstrating the authenticity of localized features beyond overall field congruency. Both groups also demonstrate the trend of decreasing residual B0 inhomogeneity after shimming from first to fifth order, and their absolute differences in the mean of all subjects range from 0.25 to 2.3 Hz across different SH orders.
The consistency between simulation and in vivo measurements of B0 field conditions in the human heart from patients exhibiting various cardiac conditions fully validates the established B0 simulation approach. This approach can accurately compute the air-tissue interface-induced inhomogeneous magnetic field shapes and amplitudes from readily available structural CT images, setting the stage for the development of tailored and advanced cardiac B0 magnetic field correction methods and more robust cardiac MRI."

This study aimed to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of the MBC regimen (Mavacamten plus a β-blocker or a calcium-channel blocker) versus the PBC regimen (placebo plus a β-blocker or a calcium-channel blocker) for treating Obstructive Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy from the perspective of the Chinese Healthcare System.
A Markov model was constructed using data from the EXPLORER-HCM clinical trial. Cost and utility inputs were sourced from public databases and published literature. Total costs, life-years (LY), quality-adjusted life years (QALY) and the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) were assessed. One-way deterministic sensitivity analysis and probabilistic sensitivity analysis were conducted to examine the robustness of the model.
Compared with the PBC regimen, Mavacamten treatment yielded an ICER of US$50 587.23/QALY. Its incremental cost was US$106 221.41, providing 2.1 additional QALY and 3.15 LY. Sensitivity analyses indicated that the drug price was the key driver influencing changes in the ICER value.
This study confirms that Mavacamten provides substantial health benefits to patients, but its relatively high ICER exceeds the commonly accepted willingness to pay."
PubMed,aortic stenosis,Scutellarin-eluting stents attenuate coronary restenosis by inhibiting the abnormal proliferation and migration of vascular smooth muscle cells through suppression of NF-κB signaling.,Li Zhang; Yuting Wang; Wei Min Gao; Wencong Gao; Ruoyan Ni; Jing Cai; Renhua Yang; Zhiqiang Shen; Bo He; Yu Zhuo; Peng Chen,10.1016/j.phymed.2026.157948,2026-02-11,Phytomedicine : international journal of phytotherapy and phytopharmacology,"Coronary restenosis remains a major challenge following percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), necessitating the development of effective stent-eluting drugs. Previous studies indicate that scutellarin protects vascular endothelial cells and exhibits anti-thrombotic and anti-platelet effects. Notably, our prior research demonstrated that scutellarin specifically counteracts oxidative stress-driven endothelial dysfunction, a key initiating event in restenosis. This combined evidence strongly suggests its potential against in-stent restenosis (ISR). Therefore, this study explores the efficacy of scutellarin in preventing ISR after PCI.
We investigated scutellarin, derived from Erigeron breviscapus, for its potential to prevent ISR following PCI.
The efficacy and mechanism of scutellarin were evaluated using both in vivo and in vitro models.
An experimental atherosclerosis model was established in APOE-/- mice. A coronary stenosis stent model was subsequently developed in minipigs through high-fat diet and balloon induced injury. Scutellarin-eluting stents with varying doses were implanted at stenosis sites. At 28 days post-PCI, multimodal imaging (QCA, OCT, IVUS) was performed to assess anti-restenosis efficacy. Additionally, in vitro H2O2-induced vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) were used to monitor proliferation and migration. Protein levels were measured to elucidate molecular mechanisms.
In APOE-/- mice, scutellarin significantly reduced lipid deposition in aortic plaques and suppressed inflammatory responses. In the porcine model, it markedly decreased neointimal thickness, neointimal area, and restenosis rates, while inhibiting inflammation. Collectively, these two in vivo models demonstrate that scutellarin-eluting stents effectively inhibit ISR. In vitro, scutellarin suppressed VSMCs proliferation and migration and mediated a shift from necrosis to autophagy-coordinated apoptosis. Mechanistically, scutellarin-mediated suppression of the synthetic phenotype switch in VSMCs was accompanied by the coordinated downregulation of both the Pl3K/AKT and IKKs/NF-κB cascades.
This study establishes the efficacy of scutellarin in mitigating ISR using two complementary in vivo models. Scutellarin-eluting stents in atherosclerotic minipigs overcome translational barriers through full interventional simulation. Furthermore, scutellarin inhibits VSMCs proliferation, migration and promotes autophagy-coordinated apoptosis by the coordinated downregulation of both the Pl3K/AKT and lKKs/NF-κB cascades.These findings highlight scutellarin as a promising candidate for next-generation bioactive stent coatings, bridging phytopharmacology and precision interventional cardiology."

Fatal adverse events during BPG administration have been reported. This study aimed to characterise the clinical features and outcomes of RHD patients who developed adverse events with BPG administration for RHD prophylaxis in Ethiopia.
Charts of Patients who received BPG for secondary prophylaxis of RHD and had fatal adverse events were reviewed. An online survey was also used to collect data on adverse events during BPG injection. The study was done in Ethiopia at Ayder, Tikur Anbessa, and Jimma University Hospital from January 1, 2017, to May 30, 2023. Data were collected using a structured questionnaire. Demographic, clinical, and echocardiographic features were documented and analysed.
All five chart review cases were female. Four of them had fatal adverse events. Four of them were aged > 18 years. All had clinical evidence of heart failure (HF) and echocardiographically advanced RHD, including severe tricuspid regurgitation (TR) and moderate to severe pulmonary hypertension (PHTN). Case 1 was 24 years old with severe mitral stenosis (MS). Case 2 was 19 years old with severe mitral regurgitation (MR). Case 3 was 14 years old with moderate to severe aortic regurgitation (AR) and moderate to severe MR. Case 4 was 43 years old with severe MS and moderate MR. Case 5 was 16 years old with moderate-severe MS, severe MR and atrial fibrillation. Four had received BPG before the event with no previous adverse reaction. None of our cases met the Level 1 Brighton criteria consistent with anaphylaxis. There were four deaths, three skin rashes, and one anaphylactic shock reported from the six RHD cases from the online survey.
We hypothesise that the coexistence of severe valve lesions with concomitant advanced HF may be an essential risk factor in BPG injection-related deaths rather than the presence of severe valve lesions alone. Heart failure and a failure of the compensatory mechanisms in BPG injection-related adverse circulatory reactions in advanced RHD with HF could be one of the major causes of these deaths. According to the literature, we recommend that patients with advanced RHD receive special attention regarding secondary BPG prophylaxis. For the introduction of less painful BPG injection, like the subcutaneous technique, further research is needed."

Artificial intelligence-enabled electrocardiography (AI-ECG) algorithms accurately estimate cardiovascular disease risk. We investigated the association between inadequate preventive dental care and the AI-ECG-estimated risk of atrial fibrillation, aortic stenosis, low ejection fraction, cardiac amyloid, cardiovascular aging, and all-cause mortality.
We retrospectively analyzed 266 637 Mayo Clinic patients (2018-2024) who completed a Social Determinants of Health Survey and had an ECG performed within 1 year of survey completion. AI-ECG algorithms generated continuous risk scores (0 or 1) for atrial fibrillation, aortic stenosis, low ejection fraction, and amyloid. Cardiac aging was assessed by delta age, calculated as AI-ECG-estimated physiological age minus the chronological age. Associations with preventive dental care were analyzed using logistic regression. Cox regression evaluated dental care predictiveness on all-cause mortality.
Among 266 637 individuals (mean age, 59.5±16.4 years; 51.1% women), 49 918 (18.7%) reported inadequate preventive dental care. These individuals had higher delta age and increased AI-ECG-predicted risks of atrial fibrillation, aortic stenosis, amyloid, and reduced ejection fraction (all P<0.001). In multivariable logistic regression models including all AI-ECG scores, inadequate preventive dental care was associated with higher probabilities of low ejection fraction (odds ratio [OR], 1.80 [95% CI, 1.69-1.91]), atrial fibrillation (OR, 1.10 [95% CI, 1.04-1.17]), aortic stenosis (OR, 1.90 [95% CI, 1.64-2.20]), amyloid (OR, 1.18 [95% CI, 1.12-1.25]), and higher delta age (OR, 1.03 [95% CI, 1.02-1.03]) (all P<0.001). Inadequate preventive dental care predicted all-cause mortality after adjusting for demographics, risk factors, and AI-ECG algorithms (HR, 1.45 [95% CI, 1.38-1.53], P<0.001).
Inadequate preventive dental care is associated with subclinical cardiovascular disease. AI-ECG algorithms may facilitate cardiovascular risk stratification among individuals with limited preventive dental care access."

This study aimed to investigate the association between RV damage detected by RV free wall longitudinal strain (RVFWLS) and outcomes in patients with severe aortic stenosis who underwent transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI).
A total of 768 patients with severe aortic stenosis who underwent TAVI and echocardiographic images for RV functional assessment were included from a retrospective multicenter TAVI registry. The primary outcome was a composite of all-cause death and hospitalization due to cardiovascular events.
During a median follow-up of 21 (12-30) months, 213 patients (28%) experienced the primary end points. In the multivariable Cox proportional hazards model, a higher absolute RVFWLS value was independently associated with better outcomes (adjusted hazard ratio [HR], 0.88 [95% CI, 0.84-0.91]). RVFWLS demonstrated incremental values superior to those of conventional RV parameters. Adding RVFWLS <17% as an RV damage (Stage 4) criterion in staging classification identified 272 (35%) patients in Stage 4. Patients with RVFWLS-incorporated Stage 4 had lower event-free survival than did those in the other stages (adjusted HR, 1.55 [95% CI, 1.35-1.77]).
In patients with severe aortic stenosis who underwent TAVI, RVFWLS was independently associated with outcomes and provided superior prognostic value than other conventional RV echocardiographic parameters. Incorporating RVFWLS in a staging classification for RV damage showed incremental value for predicting survival after TAVI over the original staging classification."

This study aimed to evaluate whether PCI before TAVR provides clinical benefit compared with conservative management in patients with significant coronary artery disease, using nationwide Swedish registry data.
This observational study included 2578 Swedish patients with significant coronary artery disease (≥50% angiographic stenosis or physiologically significant lesions) who underwent TAVR between 2008 and 2023. 1182 underwent PCI before TAVR, and 1396 were managed conservatively. The primary outcome was a composite of all-cause mortality, myocardial infarction, and urgent revascularization. Secondary outcomes included the individual components, cardiovascular mortality, any revascularization, stroke, and bleeding. The primary analysis used an instrumental variable approach based on each region's quarterly PCI treatment preference to account for confounding.
PCI was not associated with a significant difference in the primary composite outcome (instrumental variable-adjusted hazard ratio, 0.98 [95% CI, 0.85-1.14]; P=0.80) or in all-cause mortality, myocardial infarction, cardiovascular death, stroke, or urgent revascularization. PCI was, however, associated with a lower risk of any revascularization (adjusted hazard ratio, 0.46 [95% CI, 0.30-0.72]; adjusted P=0.002) and a higher risk of bleeding (instrumental variable-adjusted odds ratio, 1.59 [95% CI, 1.23-2.04]; adjusted P=0.002).
In this nationwide cohort, PCI before TAVR did not improve survival or reduce urgent revascularization but did reduce nonurgent revascularization at the cost of increased bleeding. Decisions should be individualized, balancing ischemic and bleeding risks and considering anticipated coronary access after TAVR."

Cardiovascular imaging,"Moderate aortic stenosis (AS) poses a substantial risk for adverse outcomes, yet its prognostic determinants and cardiac remodeling markers remain underexplored. This study aimed to evaluate prognostic factors, including left atrial strain, and their predictive value for adverse cardiac events in patients with moderate AS.
A retrospective cohort study included 1125 patients diagnosed with moderate AS between 2008 and 2019. Cardiac remodeling indices, including left atrial reservoir strain (LARS) and left ventricular global longitudinal strain, were assessed using speckle-tracking echocardiography. The primary outcome was cardiac death, while the secondary outcome was a composite of cardiac death or heart failure hospitalization.
Among the study population (median age, 74 years; 47.2% women), the Kaplan-Meier-estimated 5-year rates of cardiac mortality and the composite outcome were 16.7% and 33.9%, respectively, during a median follow-up of 42.8 months. Of the cardiac remodeling indices evaluated, LARS emerged as the most sensitive and independent predictor of cardiac death (adjusted hazard ratio, 0.948 per 1% increase; P=0.003) and the composite outcome (adjusted hazard ratio, 0.940 per 1% increase; P<0.001). Notably, the prognostic significance of reduced LARS persisted even after aortic valve replacement (hazard ratio, 2.177 for LARS <20.6% versus ≥20.6%; P=0.024). Furthermore, among all cardiac remodeling parameters analyzed, LARS showed the highest predictive performance for the composite outcome (C-index, 0.586 [95% CI, 0.541-0.632]) compared with other parameters.
LARS is a sensitive and independent prognostic marker in moderate AS, reflecting cardiac remodeling. Regular assessment of left atrial strain could enhance risk stratification and guide clinical management strategies in patients with moderate AS."
PubMed,aortic stenosis,Validation and longitudinal trajectory analysis of an AI-based ECG model for aortic stenosis: from community screening to pre-TAVR risk stratification.,Matthew W Segar; Kaleb D Lambeth; Alexander Postalian; Stephanie Coulter; Jasen Gilge; Naveed Razvi; Mohammad Saeed; Robert D Paisley; Ambarish Pandey; Mehdi Razavi,10.1093/ehjdh/ztag018,2026-03,European heart journal. Digital health,"Early aortic stenosis (AS) detection remains challenging, with many patients presenting late when left ventricular dysfunction may be irreversible. We evaluated whether longitudinal AI-enhanced ECG patterns can predict outcomes years before intervention and assessed the community screening potential of the AK-AVS model.
We conducted two complementary analyses: (1) community validation of the AK-AVS model in 3632 cardiovascular disease-free ARIC participants, and (2) longitudinal trajectory analysis of 7860 ECGs from 2040 TAVR recipients collected up to 10 years pre-procedure. Unsupervised clustering identified distinct AK-AVS trajectories, with mortality associations assessed using Cox regression and net reclassification improvement. In community screening (n = 16 moderate/severe AS), AK-AVS achieved an AUROC of 0.79, sensitivity 75%, and specificity 75% for moderate/severe AS. At hypothetical screening prevalences of 1-5%, positive predictive values improved to 3.1-14.3%. False-positive predictions identified individuals at 4-fold increased risk for future AS hospitalisation (HR 4.05, P < 0.001) and 52% increased risk for heart failure (HR 1.52, P = 0.02). In the TAVR cohort, trajectory analysis revealed three distinct patterns: Stable Low (19.3%), Accelerated Progression (23.6%), and Persistently High (57.1%). Elevated trajectory groups were older (78.4 and 77.8 vs. 72.6 years, P < 0.001) with higher pacemaker rates (16.4% and 17.3% vs. 10.7%, P = 0.008), despite similar hemodynamic severity. Both elevated patterns independently predicted mortality (Accelerated: HR 1.40, P = 0.03; Persistently High: HR 1.48, P = 0.005) and significantly improved risk reclassification beyond traditional risk scores (NRI 0.069-0.074).
Longitudinal AI-ECG trajectory patterns detect disease progression up to 4.5 years before TAVR and enhance mortality prediction beyond traditional risk scores. Community validation shows potential screening utility with 'false-positives' identifying future risk."

However, its neuroanatomical landscape remains poorly understood. In this study, we developed an optimized three-dimensional (3D) imaging approach that combined enhanced Clear, Unobstructed Brain Imaging Cocktails and Computational (CUBIC) tissue clearing and SWITCH-Off/On to visualize the neuronal architecture within calcified human aortic valves derived from patients undergoing aortic valve replacement surgery. Standard CUBIC analysis protocols have shown limited efficacy owing to poor clearing and antibody penetration in mineralized tissues. By integrating SWITCH chemistry before decalcification and refractive index matching, we achieved uniform delipidation, fluorescence preservation, and deep tissue labelling. Light-sheet fluorescence microscopy enabled high-resolution 3D reconstructions with an 80% success rate, revealing heterogeneous and spatially organized neuronal distributions across the aortic valve. This method offers a robust platform for studying valve innervation and its potential role in mechanosensing and disease progression, opening perspectives for neuro-targeted interventions in valvular heart disease."

Although cardiac rehabilitation (CR) is strongly recommended for patients with heart failure (HF) or post-cardiac surgery, cohort studies evaluating the long-term efficacy of CR in patients who have undergone TAVR are scarce. This study aimed to examine the association between outpatient CR and long-term clinical outcomes post-TAVR utilizing a nationwide administrative claims database in Japan.
Among 46,885 patients who underwent TAVR between April 2014 and March 2021, 34,165 patients who participated in inpatient CR and were discharged alive were included. Patients were categorized by outpatient CR participation. After propensity score matching, the primary outcome, a composite of all-cause mortality and HF hospitalization, was compared over a 3-year period.
Among the eligible patients, 29,552 (86.5%) were aged ≥ 80 years, and 22,805 (66.7%) were female. The participation rate in outpatient CR was 10.2%, with no observed increasing trend over the years. Advanced age, female sex, dementia, and multiple comorbidities were associated with non-participation in CR. The outpatient CR group exhibited reduced risk for the primary outcome (hazard ratio: 0.87, 95% confidence interval: 0.79-0.96) with a median follow-up of 734 days.
The participation rate in outpatient CR after TAVR remains low, with identifiable barriers in Japan. Participation was associated with improved outcomes, suggesting a beneficial management strategy for older patients post-TAVR."

The role of cardiopulmonary exercise testing (CPET) in predicting major adverse cardiac events (MACE) remains incompletely understood, particularly over long-term follow-up and independently of baseline symptoms.
We longitudinally studied 154 HCM patients (age 43 ± 16 years; 27% female), who underwent symptom-limited CPET. At baseline, 98 patients were in New York Heart Association (NYHA) Class I, 48 in Class II, and 8 in Class III. Septal reduction therapies (SRT), progression to end-stage HCM (ES-HCM), sudden cardiac death (SCD), heart failure-related death (HF), and heart transplantation (HT) represented a composite MACE endpoint.
Over a mean follow-up of 12 ± 9 years, 38 patients experienced MACE (SRT = 9; ES-HCM = 11; SCD = 10; HF/HT = 8). In multivariable analysis, independent predictors of MACE were percentage predicted peak VO2 (PVO2%) < 60 [hazard ratio (HR) 4.16, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.89-9.14; P < .001], and NYHA Class >I (HR 2.27, 95% CI 1.06-4.89; P = .036). By using SRT as a competing risk, the only predictor of MACE became PVO2% < 60 (HR 3.966, 95% CI 1.626-9.670; P = .002). Among asymptomatic patients (i.e. NYHA Class I), only PVO2% < 60 remained a significant predictor of MACE (HR 5.611, 95% CI 1.635-19.253; P = .006), with risk divergence evident after nearly 15 years of follow-up. The result was also confirmed in the competing risk analysis.
In this long follow-up study, CPET is a powerful prognostic tool in HCM. A reduced peak VO2 identifies those at higher risk, highlighting the potential for CPET to improve risk stratification, even among patients classified as NYHA Class I."
PubMed,aortic stenosis,Effect of mavacamten on sudden cardiac death risk scores in obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.,Paolo Usai; Eve Cariou; Erwan Donal; Damien Eyharts; Nicolas Cohen; Claire Lucas; Adrien Al Wazzan; Miloud Cherbi; Romain Itier; Pauline Fournier; Gilbert Habib; Olivier Lairez,10.1093/eschf/xvag003,2026-02-03,ESC heart failure,"Obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (oHCM) is associated with both haemodynamic impairment and increased arrhythmic risk, including sudden cardiac death (SCD). Risk stratification relies on the European Society of Cardiology (ESC) HCM Risk-SCD model, complemented by cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) assessment of myocardial fibrosis. Myosin inhibitors such as mavacamten improve obstruction and induce reverse remodelling, but their impact on arrhythmic risk score remains unknown. The objective was to analyse the impact of mavacamten on the evolution of the ESC rhythm score in patients with obstructive HCM.
Consecutive patients with symptomatic oHCM treated with mavacamten between October 2023 and June 2025 at four French referral centres for cardiomyopathies were retrospectively included. Clinical, echocardiographic, and CMR data were collected at baseline and after 6 months of therapy. Arrhythmic risk was calculated using the ESC HCM Risk-SCD model; patients with late gadolinium enhancement (LGE) ≥ 15% of left ventricular (LV) mass were reclassified into the high-risk category.
Among 186 eligible patients, 161 were included (mean age 62 ± 14 years, 55% male). At baseline, arrhythmic risk was classified as high in 6%, intermediate in 9%, and low in 85%. After 6 months of mavacamten, significant improvements were observed in New York Heart Association class (III: 35 to 2%, P < .001), resting LV outflow tract (LVOT) gradient (45 ± 31 to 12 ± 9 mmHg, P < .001), provoked gradient (80 ± 32 to 25 ± 19 mmHg, P < .001) and N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) levels. The median expected 5-year SCD risk decreased from 2.1% (1.7-3) to 1.4% (1.1-1.8) (P < .001). In high-risk patients, the score decreased from 7.7% (7.4-8.4) to 4.6% (4.5-6.0) (P = .001). European Society of Cardiology Risk-SCD reduction was entirely attributable to modifiable parameters: rest/Valsalva LVOT gradients (-33/-57 mmHg), left atrial diameter (-1.2 mm), and septal thickness (-1.5 mm, all P < .001). Mean HCM Risk Score reduction was 0.7% with heterogeneous inter-patient response, but homogeneous efficacy across centres (P = .206). Considering LGE, the proportion of patients with a high rhythmic risk fell from 16% to 15%. During a median follow-up of 19 months, no patient experienced SCD or required secondary prevention implantable cardioverter-defibrillator; two new non-sustained ventricular tachycardia episodes were recorded.
Mavacamten therapy was associated with marked haemodynamic and symptomatic improvements and a reduction in the ESC-based SCD risk in obstructive HCM. While these findings need to be confirmed and were not paralleled by a reduction in arrhythmic events, they suggest that myosin inhibition may influence arrhythmic risk stratification. Prospective studies with longer follow-up are required to determine whether such favourable remodelling translates into true arrhythmic protection."

Endovascular stents typically consist of a metal framework and a flexible membrane graft designed to reopen obstructed aortic segments and maintain blood flow through the true lumen. Consequently, stents are widely used to treat aortic expansion diseases and aortic occlusive stenosis. However, traditional stents have limitations in terms of adaptability to complex anatomical structures, long-term durability, biomechanical stability, and reliance on radial support force for fixation, lacking active fixation mechanisms. These shortcomings remain the primary causes of postoperative complications, significantly impacting the quality of life for patients with aortic dissection.                                                           Methods:                     The research status of the endovascular stent was discussed in depth, and the main factors for the optimal design of the stent (geometry, pattern configuration, additional fixtures, and optimization methods) were analyzed and summarized according to the complications targeted by the repair device.                                                           Results:                     The composition structure, working principle, and development status of the stent grafts under review are elaborated in detail. Stent grafts attempt to alleviate postoperative complications through three approaches: enhancing the flexibility of the stent framework, improving the fit between the vessel wall and the stent, and reducing vascular injury. Blood flow guiding channels are established to alleviate the obstruction of branch blood flow. Additional self-anchoring devices are added to adapt to the dynamic remodeling of blood vessels.                                                           Discussion:                     The effects of various factors, including geometric parameters, structural design, and parameter optimization techniques, on the optimization of stent primary mechanical performance are discussed. The current research status of functional improvement methods for stents is also summarized.                                                           Conclusion:                     Refining the quantitative relationship between stent structural parameters and mechanical performance, as well as exploring the balance criteria between flexibility and radial support force, represent promising directions for future development. These objectives necessitate further in-depth analysis and research."

With a focus on the prevalent psychological complications following the onset of this condition, this study aimed to explore the correlation between antenatal depression and Corona disease anxiety, personality traits, and postpartum depression during the COVID-19 pandemic.                                                           Materials and Methods:                     This cross-sectional descriptive-analytical study investigated women receiving care at health centers affiliated with Kerman University of Medical Sciences during the last month of their pregnancy and the postpartum period in 2022. Following the acquisition of informed consent, participants were assessed using various measures, including demographic and obstetric information, the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale, the Corona Disease Anxiety Scale (CDAS), and the NEO Personality Inventory-Revised during their third trimester of pregnancy. The same group of participants completed the Edinburgh Depression Scale and the Corona Disease Anxiety Scale (CDAS) 4-6 weeks after childbirth.                                                           Results and Discussion:                     There was a significant correlation between family income, unwanted pregnancy as perceived by both the mother and father, and antenatal depression. Additionally, marital satisfaction played a significant role in postpartum depression. Furthermore, antenatal depression was significantly associated with neuroticism, agreeableness, and physical symptoms related to Corona disease anxiety. Personality traits, with the exception of extroversion and conscientiousness, and various domains of Corona disease anxiety, excluding psychological symptoms, were also significantly associated with postpartum depression.                                                           Conclusion:                     During pandemics or epidemics, such as the COVID-19 outbreak, experiencing mental distress during pregnancy can contribute to mental health issues during the postpartum period. This risk is particularly true in individuals with unique personality traits, emphasizing the need for increased focus on mental health within prenatal care during these crises."

Method:                     This cross-sectional study was conducted in Kerman, Iran. Data were collected from patients who visited Afzalipour Hospital in Kerman more than twice during the COVID-19 epidemic from the end of February 2020 to March 21, 2021. We conducted two key analyses: 1. Mixed effect logistic regression was used to check the relationship between the variables and COVID-19 severity. 2. Mixed effect linear regression was used to check the relationship between the variables and the length of stay in the hospital.                                                           Results:                     The findings indicated that the most important risk factors for the severity of COVID-19 were heart diseases (OR=1.67,95%CI:1.20-2.30), increasing age (OR=2.23 for age&gt;54, 95%CI:1.70- 2.90), male gender (OR=1.47,95%CI:1.10-1.96), respiratory diseases other than asthma, and frequency of admission (OR=1.60,95%CI:1.20-2.15). All patients who underwent readmission experienced a shorter duration of hospitalization during their subsequent admission (OR=0.94,95%CI:0.91,0.96) and had a higher mortality rate (30% within 14 days, 26.6% between 14-90 days). Patients readmitted at intervals of 14-90 days and greater than 90 days exhibited lower disease severity compared to those readmitted within the 0-14 day period.                                                           Conclusion:                     Examining readmissions, the severity of COVID-19, and the length of hospital stay in affected patients are important factors for planning and allocating resources for COVID-19 management and treatment. These factors can help policymakers develop effective clinical guidelines for hospitalization or outpatient treatment of COVID-19 patients and contribute to reducing the burden of disease in the community."

Kinovea, as an accessible motion-analysis software, provides both visual and quantitative feedback. However, its application in supporting technique development among beginner athletes remains insufficiently explored. Aim: This study aims to describe the use of Kinovea in biomechanics training and examine its contribution to the awareness of kinematic characteristics and movement techniques among beginner athletes. Methods: A descriptive qualitative design involved 72 beginner athletes aged 18–25 years selected through purposive sampling. Data were collected over 16 weeks through interviews, field observations, and motion video recordings analyzed using Kinovea. Kinematic data focused on joint angles, stride behavior, and movement phases during walking, running, and the flight phase. Qualitative data were analyzed using content analysis with NVivo 12, while kinematic results were interpreted descriptively to identify performance patterns and areas for technical refinement. Result: Kinematic analysis showed coordinated joint-angle patterns across all phases. Walking analysis identified arm swing angles of 50.9°–58.8° and leg separation angles of 64.3°–67.2°, indicating a stable gait rhythm. The running analysis revealed knee angles of 68.8°–69.8° and elbow angles of 87.6°–89.1°, indicating efficient propulsive mechanics. The flight phase demonstrated knee angles of 81.2°–87.8° and elbow angles of 80.4°–88.3°, suggesting effective momentum use and postural stability. These measurements supported stride-efficiency assessment and technique evaluation. Qualitative findings revealed that Kinovea enabled athletes to interpret movement phases and identify technical inefficiencies through slow-motion and frame-by-frame visualization. Conclusion: Kinovea supports basic motion analysis by providing clear kinematic information and helping beginner athletes observe and refine their movement techniques. The findings also offer practical value for coaches by enabling more precise identification of inefficient patterns and guiding targeted corrections during early-stage training."

To achieve this aim the following research questions were postulated: <br/><br/>- What do the natural course and treatment pathways of severe aortic stenosis in children look like? Can watchful waiting be an alternative to immediate intervention (Chapter 2)? <br/>- What characterizes long-term outcome after surgical repair of valvar aortic stenosis, supravalvular aortic stenosis or aortic valve regurgitation in children (Chapters 3 and 5)? <br/>- What characterizes long-term clinical outcome after surgical aortic valve replacement with currently available valve substitutes for aortic valve disease in children (Chapter 4)? <br/>- What characterizes long-term outcome after reconstructive surgical treatment options for aortic valve disease in nonelderly adults, such as aortic valve repair and the Ross procedure (Chapters 6, 7 and 8)? <br/>- How can microsimulation be optimally implemented to better support the lifetime management of patients diagnosed with heart valve disease (Chapter 9)?<br/>"
OpenAlex,aortic stenosis,Reclassifying Aortic Stenosis Severity: Combined Energy Loss Index and Global Longitudinal Strain Assessment Identifies Subgroups with Differential Myocardial Function and May Improve Risk Stratification in Aortic Stenosis,Ahmed Abdelmohsen Zayed; Michel El Khoury; Bahy Abofrekha; Oluwakorede Akele; Hadi Itani; O. Khayat; Abdelrahman Abouelnas; Nadim Zaidan; Kevin Schesing,10.3390/medsci14010103,2026-02-20,Medical Sciences,"Background: Traditional echocardiographic assessment of aortic stenosis (AS) using aortic valve area (AVA) may overestimate severity due to pressure recovery phenomena, while subclinical myocardial dysfunction remains undetected despite preserved ejection fraction. This study evaluated whether energy loss index (ELI)—which accounts for pressure recovery—demonstrates superior correlation with global longitudinal strain (GLS), a marker of subclinical myocardial dysfunction, compared to conventional AVA-based classification in patients with moderate-to-severe AS and preserved left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF). Methods: This retrospective single-center study analyzed 149 patients with moderate-to-severe AS (AVA &lt; 1.5 cm2) and LVEF &gt; 50% from 2015 to 2019. Among 97 patients with severe AS by AVA (&lt;1.0 cm2), ELI was calculated using the formula ELI = (AVA × Aa)/(Aa − AVA) ÷ BSA, where Aa represents sinotubular junction cross-sectional area. Patients with ELI ≥ 0.6 cm2/m2 were reclassified as moderate AS. Spearman correlation assessed relationships between AVA, ELI, and GLS. Multivariable linear regression models determined independent predictors of myocardial dysfunction, adjusting for age, body surface area, hypertension, LVEF, and mean pressure gradient. Results: ELI reclassified 28 of 97 patients (29%) from severe to moderate AS. Reclassified patients had significantly better myocardial function, with less impaired GLS (−15.0 ± 3.9% vs. −12.1 ± 5.0%, p = 0.013) and higher LVEF (60.1 ± 6.2% vs. 56.5 ± 9.1%, p = 0.017) compared to non-reclassified patients. In the overall cohort, ELI demonstrated stronger correlation with GLS than AVA (r = −0.307, p = 0.0003 vs. r = −0.209, p = 0.0115). Critically, among patients with severe AS by AVA criteria, ELI maintained significant correlation with GLS (r = −0.443, p = 0.0003) while AVA showed no correlation (r = −0.144, p = 0.159). In multivariable analysis, ELI independently predicted GLS (β = 5.847, 95% CI: 2.85–8.84, p = 0.0002; adjusted R2 = 0.289), whereas AVA did not (β = 2.234, 95% CI: −1.08 to 5.55, p = 0.188; adjusted R2 = 0.234). When both parameters were included simultaneously, only ELI remained significant (p = 0.0024). Conclusions: In this retrospective cohort, ELI-based reclassification identified a subgroup of patients with less severe myocardial dysfunction as measured by GLS and LVEF, and ELI demonstrated superior correlation with subclinical myocardial dysfunction compared to AVA. These findings suggest ELI may provide a more physiologically reflective assessment of hemodynamic burden in AS with preserved LVEF. However, the absence of systematic symptom assessment and clinical outcome data represents critical limitations. Prospective studies with standardized symptom evaluation, longitudinal follow-up, and adjudicated clinical endpoints are required to determine whether ELI-based reclassification improves risk stratification and clinical decision-making before this approach can be recommended for routine practice."

Aims This study aims to assess sex-related differences in diagnostic and therapeutic delays to TAVI and to explore sex-related disparities in management and clinical characteristics of patients with severe aortic stenosis (AS). Methods and results This multicentre, observational study included 519 patients (46.1% women) with severe symptomatic AS referred for TAVI in 2023 across three European centres. Outcomes were assessed according to VARC-3. Female-specific clinical history was systematically collected. Women were older, with higher surgical risk (STS Score: 4.5 [3.0-6.6] vs 2.8 [1.7-4.0], p&amp;lt;0.001) and more advanced symptoms (NYHA functional class III-IV 87 vs 77,p=0.014). Aortic annulus dimensions and valve area were smaller in women (both p&amp;lt;0.001). Women experienced longer delays from symptom onset to diagnosis (3 [0-9] vs 1 [0-4] months, p&amp;lt;0.001), with notable inter-centre variability. However, time from diagnosis to TAVI was similar (3 [1-5] vs 2.5 [1-4.5] months, p=0.220). In-hospital mortality (2.5% vs 1.8%, p=0.555), bleeding, major vascular complications and conduction disturbances did not differ by sex. At six months functional status improved significantly; mortality (4.1% vs 5.3%, p=0.685), rehospitalisation and device success (84.6% vs 85.8%, p=0.252) were comparable between sexes. Female-specific characteristics, including pregnancy, gynaecological history and hormone therapy, were not significantly associated with clinical outcomes. Conclusions Women faced longer diagnostic delays, indicating persistent sex-based disparities in timely recognition of severe AS. Nevertheless, clinical outcomes after TAVI were similar between sexes supporting comparable treatment effectiveness."

The DurAVR transcatheter heart valve is designed to reproduce native leaflet shape and restore flow. Methods In a prospective study, patients with symptomatic severe aortic stenosis underwent transthoracic echocardiography and cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) before TAVR with DurAVR and at six months. Post-implant findings were compared with age-, sex-, and haemodynamics-matched controls without aortic valve disease. Ascending aortic flow displacement (FD) and flow reversal ratio (FRR) were quantified using phase-contrast imaging. Haemodynamic correlates of LV mass regression post-DurAVR were explored using multivariable analysis. Results One hundred and forty-one participants were studied with CMR (aortic stenosis, 60; DurAVR, 46; controls, 35). Thirty-nine patients had paired baseline and 6-month data. Compared to baseline, DurAVR reduced indexed FD (4.0±1.2 to 3.5±0.8 %/cm², P&amp;lt;0.005) and indexed FRR (3.9±1.0 to 2.6±0.7 %/cm², P&amp;lt;0.0001). Post DurAVR, indexed FD was comparable to controls (3.5±0.8 vs 3.5±1.3 %/cm², P=0.81) and indexed FRR approached control values (2.5±0.7 vs 2.2±0.8 %/cm², P=0.06). Left ventricular mass regressed by 18% (P&amp;lt;0.0001). In regression (R2=0.43), left ventricular mass regression was independently associated with the change in the mean transaortic gradient (relative contribution 68%, P=0.005) and change in systolic FRR (relative contribution 26%, P=0.03). Conclusion DurAVR THV implantation restored ascending aortic flow towards native physiology and was accompanied by left ventricular reverse remodelling at six months. Larger comparative studies should determine whether normalised post-implant flow translates into improved patient outcomes."
OpenAlex,aortic stenosis,Survival in patients with monoclonal gammopathy of unknown significance after transcatheter aortic valve replacement: a global retrospective propensity-matched real-world analysis,Lorenz Oelschläger; Dominik Rebafka; Christian Frerker; Thomas Stiermaier; Jan Morf; Jan Vorwerk; Anna Traub; Theo Leitner; Nikolas von Bubnoff; Cyrus Khandanpour; Ingo Eitel,10.1186/s40959-026-00456-4,2026-02-20,Cardio-Oncology,"Hematopoietic clonal disorders have previously been associated with cardiac diseases. Higher incidences of aortic valve stenosis have been observed not only in clonal hematopoiesis of indeterminate potential (CHIP) but also in monoclonal gammopathy of unknown significance (MGUS). However, studies investigating the outcome after transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) in MGUS are lacking. Investigate overall survival in MGUS patients after TAVI. We used the federated real-world data platform TriNetX to identify MGUS patients undergoing TAVI. Patients were divided into cohorts based on presence of MGUS, age or comorbidities and matched using the TriNetX propensity score matching tool. Overall survival was assessed after 1, 3 and 5 years. We identified 58,796 patients with TAVI procedure. Of these, 1039 patients (1.8%) were identified with co-occurring MGUS. Our study shows superior overall survival for patients without MGUS after TAVI in the overall cohort (HR:0.792 CI95% 0.657, 0.954, p = 0.014) and > 75 years of age (HR:0.797, CI95% 0.660, 0.961, p = 0.017) at the 5-year timepoint. 5-year overall survival did not differ in younger MGUS patients (< 75 years) or patients with co-occurring chronic kidney disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or heart failure (p > 0.05). In this real-world analysis in patients with MGUS undergoing TAVI, MGUS was associated with inferior outcomes after TAVI, especially for older (> 75 years) patients. Five-year overall survival did not differ among patients with common comorbidities. Our results suggest that MGUS may be linked to worse overall long-term survival following TAVI and highlights the need for further interdisciplinary cardiooncology research. Given the key methodological limitations, the present results should be considered as hypothesis-generating."
OpenAlex,aortic stenosis,Integrated Transcriptomic Analysis Identifies Novel Candidate Genes Associated with Calcific Aortic Valve Disease,Jing Chen; Shichao Guo; Junming Zhu; Haiou Hu; Bing Tang; Lingchen Huang; Chenhan Zhang; suwei Chen; Sanbao Chai; Zhiyu Qiao; Hanqiao Jiang,10.3390/genes17020246,2026-02-20,Genes,"Background: Calcified aortic valve disease (CAVD) is a prevalent valvular disorder in the elderly and a major cause of aortic stenosis. Surgical and transcatheter aortic valve replacement remain the primary treatments for advanced CAVD; however, effective pharmacological therapies to prevent or slow disease progression are lacking. Therefore, there is an urgent need to explore potential novel candidate biomarkers and therapeutic targets. Methods: In this study, transcriptomic data from multiple independent datasets were integrated to comprehensively characterize the transcriptional profile of CAVD. Feature genes were identified using complementary machine learning approaches, followed by functional pathway enrichment and protein–protein interaction (PPI) network analyses to uncover novel candidate genes associated with CAVD. Single-cell RNA sequencing (sc-RNA-Seq) data were further analyzed using pseudotime trajectory analysis to explore transcriptional dynamics during valve interstitial cells’ (VICs) osteogenic progression. Quantitative PCR and Western blot analyses of human calcified aortic valve tissues were used for validation. Results: A total of 119 CAVD-associated genes were identified, primarily involved in ossification, extracellular matrix organization, and cell–substrate adhesion. Among these, the ossification-associated genes BAMBI, HAND2, and MYOC exhibited potential discriminatory power between CAVD and control samples, with notable downregulation in calcified valves. Pseudotime analysis showed that the expression of these genes gradually decreased along the transcriptional trajectory associated with osteogenic differentiation. In addition, the analysis of relative immune signatures revealed negative correlations between these genes and multiple immune signatures. Conclusions: This study identifies novel candidate genes underlying CAVD pathogenesis and highlights BAMBI, HAND2, and MYOC as potential biomarkers and therapeutic targets, providing new insights into disease mechanisms and opportunities for novel interventions."

OpenAlex,aortic stenosis,Refining insights on type 2 diabetes and aortic valve replacement,P. F. Liu; Xiaoyu He; Zejun Song,10.1111/dme.70239,2026-02-18,Diabetic Medicine,"Davis and colleagues' longitudinal Fremantle Diabetes Study Phase II study makes a pivotal contribution by demonstrating that type 2 diabetes doubles the risk of incident aortic valve replacement (AVR) with distal symmetrical polyneuropathy (DSPN) and intensive glucose-lowering therapy as key associates.1 Its strengths include rigorous age, sex and postcode matching, long-term follow-up from 2008 to 2021, and integration of competing risk models that address critical limitations of prior research and reinforce the clinical relevance of its findings. Several underdeveloped dimensions could further enhance the study's translational value and we aim to elaborate on targeted recommendations to address these aspects. Our core suggestions focus on three interconnected areas to deepen understanding and clinical applicability. First, subgroup stratification is essential as the study aggregates type 2 diabetes participants. Stratifying by diabetes duration, such as less than 5 years, 5–10 years and more than 10 years, would clarify whether AVR risk accumulates linearly or if thresholds exist. Distinguishing between glucose-lowering medication classes, such as sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors versus insulin, could reveal if specific therapies modify valvular risk.2 Second, a mechanistic exploration of the DSPN-AVR association is needed beyond the common soil hypothesis.3 Investigating sarcopenia as a mediator, given its links to both DSPN and aortic stenosis progression,4 could identify modifiable targets like resistance training. Third, outcome granularity matters in distinguishing urgent versus elective AVR as the former carries a higher perioperative risk.5 Assessing post-AVR non-mortality outcomes, such as infections and renal dysfunction, would provide a more comprehensive view of the diabetes-related burden and guide perioperative management. These recommendations build on the study's robust foundation without undermining its core findings. By addressing subgroup-specific risk, mechanistic mediators and outcome detail, future research can refine risk stratification, identify targeted interventions and optimize personalized care for adults with type 2 diabetes at risk of severe valvular heart disease. Davis and colleagues' work rightly highlights the need for heightened clinical suspicion of aortic stenosis in older adults with type 2 diabetes, and these extensions will further strengthen its translational impact.

OpenAlex,aortic stenosis,Safety and efficacy of transcatheter aortic valve replacement in rheumatic aortic regurgitation: a prospective cohort study,Yaojie Wang; Yu Mao; Yang Liu; Mengen Zhai; Ping Jin; Y. Jonathan Zhang; Xiaojing Liu; Haibo Yang; Hua Zhang; Youjin Li; Jian Yang,10.3389/fcvm.2026.1662827,2026-02-18,Frontiers in Cardiovascular Medicine,"Background The prevalence of rheumatic aortic regurgitation (AR) is higher than that of aortic stenosis in developing countries, but the efficacy of transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) in high surgical risk patients with severe AR remains unknown. Our goal was to explore the differences in clinical outcomes of TAVR in patients with rheumatic and non-rheumatic AR. Methods 144 Rheumatic and 417 nonrheumatic patients with severe AR were prospectively enrolled from January 2018 to December 2021. All patients underwent transapical TAVR with J-Valve after evaluation by computed tomography angiography and transthoracic echocardiography before the procedure. The primary end point was 3-year all-cause mortality. Results The average age was 71.2 [interquartile range (IQR): 66.0–76.0] years, and the Society of Thoracic Surgeons score was 4.8 (IQR: 3.4–6.1) %. The proportion of patients with rheumatic AR who developed ≥ mild PVL was lower than the proportion of patients with non-rheumatic AR (5.6% vs. 11.3%, P &amp;lt; 0.001). At a median follow-up of 39.7 (IQR: 36.4–41.8) months, no difference was observed in the 3-year all-cause mortality ( P = 0.740) between the two groups. After multivariate adjustment, the Society of Thoracic Surgeons score, higher frailty and larger aortic angulation were associated with 3-year all-cause mortality. Conclusion For patients with rheumatic AR, the clinical outcomes were similar to those of patients with non-rheumatic AR. TAVR can be one of the feasible treatment options for such patients."

Zhigulina,10.17116/kardio20261901157,2026-02-18,Russian Journal of Cardiology and Cardiovascular Surgery,"Objective. The aim of the study was to apply a new echocardiographic technology in the visualization of turbulent blood flow and energy expenditure in healthy and patients with aortic stenosis. Materials and methods. Intraventricular blood flow studies were performed in 10 healthy subjects (average age 37±8 years) and 10 patients with aortic stenosis (average age 67±9 years) using the LISENDO 880LE premium ultrasound system (Fujifilm Corporation, Japan). Intracardiac blood flows were studied using a specialized software module Vector Flow Mapping (VFM). The structure of blood flow inside the left ventricle was assessed by the location of turbulence zones with the determination of the area, direction and acceleration of the vortex in certain phases of the cardiac cycle: isovolumic contraction, systole, diastole and atrial contraction. The results were calculated based on the average acceleration of blood flow and the area of turbulent flow in the outflow tract of the left ventricle. Results. Pressure gradients on the aortic valve and its opening area were evaluated to characterize aortic stenosis. The vortices formed during the filling of the left ventricle have a certain geometry and anatomical location that determine the directional blood flow during the shock discharge. The mechanics of myocardial contraction were assessed by three components: blood flows in the heart cavities, energy distribution and expenditure during the cardiac cycle, and their relationship between the area of turbulent flow and acceleration. Conclusion. Turbulence plays an important role in the normal functioning of the heart, supporting the movement and direction of blood flow. The energy dissipation during the cardiac cycle in aortic stenosis is determined by the area of the aortic valve opening, the zones of additional turbulence in the left ventricle, and the acceleration of turbulent vortices."

Of these, 33 patients had coral reef aorta (CRA). Patients were stratified by lesion location and CRA presence. Primary endpoints were 30-day adverse events and technical success (residual stenosis <30%). Secondary endpoints were major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE), major adverse limb events (MALE), and all-cause mortality. Cox regression identified predictors of outcome. <i>Results:</i> Technical success was achieved in 81.9%. Thirty-day mortality was 0.5%. At 10 years, freedom from MACE was significantly lower in patients with non-bifurcation abdominal aortic stenosis (56% vs. 76%; aHR 2.13, p < .05) and lowest in CRA (30% vs. 71%; aHR 3.17, p < .05). Independent predictors of MACE were CRA, chronic total occlusion (aHR 3.38, 95% CI 1.57-7.29), critical limb-threatening ischemia (aHR 3.67, 95% CI 1.74-7.75), and age (aHR 1.06 per year, 95% CI 1.01-1.11). MALE was more frequent in patients with peripheral arterial disease (aHR 2.07, 95% CI 1.12-3.81), CRA (aHR 2.51, 95% CI 1.17-5.40), and current smokers (aHR 5.10, 95% CI 1.23-21.0). <i>Conclusions</i>: CRA and non-bifurcation abdominal aortic stenosis are associated with reduced long-term freedom from MACE after EVT. These findings define high-risk subgroups within calcified AIOD and highlight the prognostic value of anatomical lesion characteristics for treatment planning and follow-up."

This systematic review and critical appraisal synthesizes the applications of computer vision in vascular surgery. MEDLINE, Embase, Web of Science and Cochrane CENTRAL were searched from inception to June 28, 2024. Vascular diseases studied, data sources, methods and outcomes were recorded. Critical appraisal was conducted using the PROBAST and TRIPOD+AI guidelines. Overall, 288 studies were included with an exponential rise from 2017 onwards. The majority of studies addressed aortic pathologies (33%), carotid stenosis (30%), and foot ulcers (25%), while few focused on peripheral artery disease (6%). Most were observational using retrospective (81%) or prospective data (15%), and one clinical trial was included. Dice coefficient (51%) and accuracy (36%) were the most commonly reported performance metrics with infrequent use of AUROC (17%). Only 15% of studies had a low risk of bias and overall adherence to the TRIPOD+AI checklist was relatively poor at 57%. Overall, we suggest greater attention to peripheral artery disease; for dice coefficient and AUROC to be used in segmentation and discrimination tasks, respectively; and for the TRIPOD+AI statement to be consulted early on during model development."

Evidence on the efficacy and safety of TAVR is scarce despite several cases of RAS recorded in China. This study aimed to evaluate the efficacy of TAVR in patients with RAS. A total of 359 patients were enrolled and divided into the RAS ( n = 71) and non-RAS ( n = 288) groups according to the World Heart Federation guidelines for rheumatic heart disease combined with computed tomography imaging. Propensity score matching was performed to ensure comparability between groups. A self-expanding valve was used in all the patients. Primary endpoints included technical success, device success, and 1-year composite outcomes. Short-term complications and anatomical differences were analysed. Patients with RAS had higher N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide levels and Society of Thoracic Surgeons scores, higher atrial fibrillation rates, and worse cardiac metrics (enlargement, valve regurgitation, and lower estimated glomerular filtration rates). The patients in the RAS group had fewer bicuspid valves, less calcification, more elliptical annuli, and larger left ventricular outflow tract/annulus area ratios. The RAS group had a higher prosthesis positioning and oversizing rate. Technical success, device success, and early safety rates were similar between groups. However, the RAS group had a higher pacemaker implantation and transcatheter heart valve displacement (THVD) risk, yet demonstrated superior 1-year outcomes. TAVR may be safe and effective for the treatment of RAS. The anatomical characteristics of patients with RAS increased the risk of THVD and pacemaker implantation. A high-release strategy and appropriate oversizing could partially alleviate the risk of THVD. TAVR, transcatheter aortic valve replacement; RAS, rheumatic aortic valve stenosis."
OpenAlex,aortic stenosis,Editorial: Diagnostic and predictive roles of computational cardiovascular hemodynamics in the management of cardiovascular diseases,Fuyou Liang; Yonghui Qiao; David Perpetuini; Harvey Ho,10.3389/fbioe.2026.1804586,2026-02-18,Frontiers in Bioengineering and Biotechnology,"Current clinical management of cardiovascular diseases relies heavily on medical imaging. However, structural indices derived from medical images, such as the degree of stenosis or aneurysm diameter, may not fully reflect the functional severity of disease (Liu et al., 2025b). Computational hemodynamics, therefore, serves as a critical complementary modality, offering functional insights that fill this gap (Makropoulos et al., 2024). This Research Topic presents 16 studies that collectively demonstrate computational cardiovascular hemodynamics not merely as a theoretical method for basic research, but as an evolving clinical tool capable of complementing diagnosis, predicting progression, and optimizing intervention.A primary limitation in clinical diagnosis arises from the reliance on invasive procedures or subjective assessments (Zhang et al., 2023). Computational hemodynamics addresses this by providing non-invasive functional quantifications (Li et al., 2025). Wang et al. tackled the limitations of using invasive pressure wire to assess the hemodynamic impact of intracranial atherosclerotic stenosis. Their study demonstrated the concordance between angiography-derived quantitative flow ratio and invasive non-hyperemic pressure ratio, establishing a wire-free methodology for assessing functional ischemia.To address the challenge of interpreting complex imaging data, Guo et al. developed an echocardiographic video-driven multi-task learning model (IE-CAD) that simultaneously estimates the Gensini score and cardiac functional parameters (e.g., global longitudinal strain, left ventricular ejection fraction, global work efficiency). This approach automates the diagnosis and grading of coronary artery disease, thereby effectively overcoming the subjectivity inherent in manual visual assessment. Additionally, Fan et al. proposed a multidisciplinary framework combining numerical simulation with deep learning to enhance the hemodynamic analysis of aneurysms, demonstrating how artificial intelligence can accelerate complex diagnostic workflows. Collectively, these studies highlight a paradigm shift towards non-invasive, automated, and functionally integrated diagnostic protocols that reduce reliance on operator subjectivity and invasive instrumentation.Risk stratification relying exclusively on geometric metrics often lacks the ability to fully capture the heterogeneity of disease (Hesse et al., 2024). To address that issue, hemodynamic metrics predicted by computational models, such as wall shear stress (WSS) and its derivatives, may serve as additional biomarkers, yet their predictive accuracy is contingent upon high-fidelity biomechanical representation (Qiao et al., 2022). Goetz et al. conducted comprehensive fluid-structure interaction (FSI) analyses 101 intracranial aneurysms (AnXplore), revealing that traditional rigid-wall assumptions overestimate WSS and induce significant deviations in the prediction of oscillatory shear index. Consequently, incorporating vascular wall compliance appears to be important for the precise characterization of rupture risk metrics.Extending the pursuit of realism from passive compliance to active biological modulation, Qin et al. employed a multimodal approach involving ultrasound, histology, and wire myography in a rat model to demonstrate that a decline in arterial smooth muscle active contractile force correlates with inflammatory exacerbation and matrix degradation. Yue et al. utilized FSI analysis with a multi-layered anisotropic model to explore the biomechanical function of the intraluminal thrombus (ILT) in abdominal aortic aneurysms, finding that the ILT provides a significant ""cushioning effect"" that attenuates wall stress and mitigates stress concentrations caused by medial degradation.In addition to these methodological refinements, recent studies have validated hemodynamic metrics as sensitive biomarkers across diverse pathologies. Armour et al. demonstrated a direct correlation between wall shear stress (WSS) patterns and disease severity in pulmonary arterial hypertension, thereby substantiating the utility of flow metrics in tracking disease progression. Similarly, Chen et al. addressed the clinical discrepancy between anatomical significance and functional risk, revealing that even ""mild"" coronary stenosis induces flow disturbances critical to plaque progression. Furthermore, Yu et al. elucidated the compression mechanics inherent to myocardial bridging, while Lv et al. quantified cerebral blood flow regulation defects in patients with an incomplete circle of Willis. Taken together, these findings indicate that computational modeling offers a quantitative framework to evaluate the hemodynamic impact of complex anatomical features and mechanical properties, thereby better assessing the dysfunctional severity or predict the progression of cardiovascular disease.The final phase of clinical management focuses on precise intervention and long-term prognosis, where computational modeling provide a robust platform for pre-operation planning, device optimization, and post-operation surveillance (Luan et al., 2023;Liu et al., 2025a). Šeman et al. reviewed the utility of computational modeling in managing valvular heart disease, highlighting its capacity to bridge the gap between clinical observation and theoretical prediction in complex pathologies like mixed valvular disease. By forecasting post-procedural hemodynamic profiles, these models can serve as a useful tool for reducing diagnostic uncertainty.Building upon its predictive capability, device-specific modeling is essential for optimizing interventional procedure. Yin et al. developed a fully coupled FSI model for bioprosthetic aortic valves and elucidated that kinematic parameters, especially wall shear stress and leaflet deformation undetectable by standard imaging, may provide critical insights for identifying the mechanical precursors of structural deterioration. Yang et al. demonstrated that the Niagara catheter's novel helical flow inducer significantly enhances perfusion efficiency. Through computational fluid dynamics, they confirmed that the induced helical flow suppresses stagnant zones, thereby mitigating thrombogenic risk.Effective clinical management extends beyond the immediate success of intervention, necessitating post-procedural assessment to monitor functional recovery and hemodynamic stability. Lv et al. highlighted the importance of integrating lifestyle into post-stenting care by investigating the combined effects of stent design and patient exercise intensity. Their findings revealed that exercise-induced hemodynamic variations significantly alter wall shear stress profiles, suggesting that physical activity levels can be prescribed to minimize restenosis risk. Paparella et al. utilized 2D speckle-tracking echocardiography (2D-STE) to quantify cardiac mechanics following AF ablation, identifying functional recovery and reverse remodeling that standard volumetric assessments fail to capture. Jensen et al. systematically quantified hemodynamics after aortic coarctation repair, demonstrating that despite anatomical correction, abnormal flow patterns often persist.The studies compiled in this Topic highlight the potential clinical significance of shifting from static structural assessment to dynamic functional evaluation in cardiovascular medicine. By validating non-invasive diagnostic tools, elucidating biomechanical risk factors, optimizing interventional devices and predicting long-term postoperative outcomes, computational hemodynamics is demonstrating its value as an indispensable component of precise patient management."

OpenAlex,deep learning,Combating Data and Target Shifts in Visual Tasks,Zhaorui Tan,10.17638/03194353,2031-01-01,University of Liverpool,"The rapid advancement of deep learning models for visual tasks has led to significant progress in many domains. However, a key challenge remains: ensuring that models can generalize effectively to unseen samples or novel classes, especially in real-world scenarios where training data-target pairs are often limited or unavailable, and test data may exhibit shifts in both data and targets. This thesis addresses the problem of shifts across data and targets, proposing novel methods to improve model generalization and transferability in complex settings. The thesis identifies the different shift scenarios for visual tasks and presents their problem forms. The research first relaxes the static target distribution assumption in Multi-Domain Generalization (mDG) tasks, introducing the General Multi-Domain Generalization (GMDG) objective to improve generalization under varying data shifts. Specifically, Extensive experiments validate that GMDG is feasible for classification, segmentation, and regression tasks. Further considering extreme target distribution shifts where even unknown novel classes emerge, the study also explores logical regularization techniques for tasks such as Generalized Category Discovery (GCD), mDG+GCD, and Class Incremental Learning (CIL), proposing a sample-based logical regularization term (L-Reg) to enhance data-, target-, and all-shift generalization. Additionally, a partial logic framework is introduced to address challenges in CIL, enabling models to retain room for unknown classes during training. This is further extended by the Partial-Logic Regularization (PL-Reg), which improves generalization across GCD, mDG+GCD, and transferability for CIL tasks. Furthermore, the thesis proposes a novel Semantic-aware Data Augmentation (SADA) framework for cross-modality generalization in text-to-image synthesis (T2Isyn), text-image retrieval (TIR), and image-text retrieval (ITR) tasks. This framework ensures semantic preservation across text and image modalities, improving both semantic consistency and image quality in cross-modality tasks. The methods proposed in this thesis offer significant advancements in visual generalization and transfer scenarios, providing theoretical insights and practical solutions for handling data shifts, target shifts, and multi-modalities in complex scenarios. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of the proposed methods, demonstrating their superior performance across a range of tasks."
OpenAlex,deep learning,Antecedents and consequences of Green-tech FDI in emerging markets,Zhuoran Liu,10.17638/03195308,2031-01-01,University of Liverpool,"As environmental pressures intensify, attracting sustainable foreign direct investment (FDI), particularly green-tech FDI, has become a critical pathway for emerging markets to achieve environmental sustainability. However, existing research remains fragmented, offering limited insights into why green-tech FDI enters emerging markets and how it affects regional green innovation. This thesis addresses these gaps by systematically examining both the antecedents and consequences of green-tech FDI through three empirical studies using regional data from China. Study 1 and Study 2 focus on the antecedents of green-tech FDI. Study 1 examines how host-country conditions can attract green-tech FDI, highlighting the role of environmental management information disclosure (EMID) by domestic firms in reducing information gaps and strengthening green market–seeking motives. Study 2 shifts attention to the active decision-making of green-tech FDI, showing that under uncertainty, green-tech foreign investors engage in identity-based bandwagon learning by imitating peers with similar green identities, thereby mitigating investment risks. Study 3 turns to the consequences of green-tech FDI. It demonstrates that, due to the technological complexity of green innovation and limited absorptive capacity in emerging markets, green-tech FDI may generate crowding-out effects rather than purely positive spillovers. Adopting a network perspective, the study further finds that universities play a key moderating role: through broad linkages and deep collaborations, they help mitigate negative spillovers and facilitate the diffusion of green technologies. Together, the three studies advance the literature on sustainable FDI by differentiating green-tech FDI from general FDI and identifying the specific mechanisms that shape its entry decisions and local innovation outcomes. Practically, the findings provide guidance for emerging-market governments and firms on how to attract and manage sustainable investment, balance growth with environmental objectives, and strengthen local innovation ecosystems."
OpenAlex,deep learning,A UAV-Based Framework for Community-Scale Residential Building Energy Modelling in China,Mengfan Jin,10.17638/03195460,2029-01-01,University of Liverpool,"With increasing emphasis on energy efficiency and carbon emission reduction in the building sector, rapid and scalable energy modelling of existing buildings is critical for retrofit projects and policy development. Conventional surveys, data collection and energy modelling processes remain labour-intensive and impractical for large-scale applications, and energy modelling often dominates project time and cost. Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) equipped with high-resolution and infrared cameras now offer fast and safe exterior surveys, showing great potential in building energy assessments. Yet, a systematic framework for UAV integration, from image capture through processing to inputs for building energy simulation, has not been established. This research addresses these challenges by developing a structured framework for community-scale building energy modelling, which integrates UAV photogrammetry to accelerate data acquisition, reduce labour, and shorten energy modelling time for retrofit projects. The framework is designed to minimise prior data requirements while maximising automation and retaining sufficient accuracy and reliability. It also addressed systemic issues, such as the lack of data necessary to fully exploit the potential of available technologies in the context of this study. To achieve this research objective, a mixed-methodology approach, combining desk studies and fieldwork, was adopted. First, a comprehensive review of UAV-based building energy studies mapped the current applications and available tools, proposing a preliminary framework. Fieldwork then encompassed a pilot study and a detailed case study. In the pilot test, a single building was surveyed to identify an optimal toolchain for flight planning, image capture, photogrammetric reconstruction, model generation, and selection of a simulation platform. The resulting refined framework was applied to a case study of a 39-building community, and it was demonstrated that further automation was necessary. The potential for automation was then further explored. Geomatic algorithms, machine learning, and deep learning techniques were compared, and the combination that best balanced accuracy and processing time was selected for 3D model generation and window-to-wall ratio (WWR) extraction. In parallel, an archetype library of residential buildings in the Hot Summer Cold Winter (HSCW) zone in China was compiled to facilitate the assignment of thermal parameters. Finally, a reusable community-scale building energy modelling (CBEM) workflow was assembled in Grasshopper using Ladybug Tools components to process the aforementioned inputs. In conclusion, this study integrates UAV photogrammetry, GIS-based geomatic algorithms, machine learning, and graphical programming to develop an UAV-CBEM framework. The outcomes establish a foundation for scalable UAV-based building energy assessments, enhancing applicability in data-limited and large-scale settings worldwide."

OpenAlex,deep learning,Unsupervised Deep-learning Methods for Low-dose Computed Tomography Reconstruction,Ran An,10.17638/03194237,2027-01-01,University of Liverpool,"Computed tomography (CT) has become an indispensable imaging technique in medical diagnostics and industrial applications, owing to its non-invasive nature and high resolution in visualizing object internal structures. While X-ray CT (X-ray computed tomography) significantly enhances lesion detection capabilities, excessive exposure to X-ray radiation raises substantial health concerns, including elevated cancer risks and potential genetic damage. Although low-dose CT (LDCT) protocols reduce radiation safety concerns, they inevitably introduce severe noise and artifacts, which might compromise diagnostic accuracy. Recent advances in supervised deep learning approaches have demonstrated remarkable success in LDCT reconstruction. However, the reliance on paired training data severely limits their deployment in practical CT applications. This fundamental constraint highlights the critical importance of developing unsupervised reconstruction methods. Although existing unsupervised LDCT methods have made notable progress, they still face challenges requiring systematic solutions. This thesis makes three contributions to advance the field of unsupervised LDCT reconstruction: 1. Current dual-domain self-supervised LDCT denoising methods typically neglect the heterogeneity of the non-stationary Gaussian noise levels in low-dose sinograms and usually treat them as common images without appropriately controlling the denoising strength. The denoisers employed by them, which are based on classic convolutional neural networks (CNN), will lead to blurring artifacts in the reconstructed images if directly used for sinogram denoising. In addition, the denoising strength in the sinogram and image domains must be well-balanced to avoid introducing over-blurring or secondary artifacts in the reconstructed images, but existing approaches do not focus on this crucial point. To address these limitations, this thesis proposes a novel end-to-end dual-domain self-supervised framework for LDCT denoising. It employs Dropblock layers to adaptively localize the effect of convolution for sinogram denoising and sets a weighted average between the denoised sinograms and their noisy counterparts to better control the denoising strength, thus effectively reducing the blurring artifacts and leading to a well-balanced dual-domain denoising. Numerical experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and superior performance of the proposed method. 2. Existing normalizing flows (NFs)-based unsupervised LDCT reconstruction methods face challenges in both image quality and computational efficiency. On one hand, they typically utilize a two-way transformation strategy between noisy images and latent variables, which could easily lead to detail loss and secondary artifacts in the reconstructed images. On the other hand, training NFs on high-resolution CT images is computationally intensive. Although conditional normalizing flows (CNFs) can mitigate computational costs by learning conditional probabilities, existing approaches rely on labeled data for conditionalization, leaving unsupervised CNFs-based LDCT reconstruction a challenge. To tackle these issues, this thesis proposes a novel unsupervised LDCT iterative reconstruction algorithm based on CNFs. The proposed method employs a strict one-way transformation strategy during the alternating optimization in the dual spaces to prevent detail loss and secondary artifacts, and proposes a novel unsupervised conditionalization strategy for CNFs, thus achieving efficient training and inference on high-resolution images. The proposed method illustrates high-quality and relatively fast unsupervised reconstruction. Experiments across two datasets demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed method by rivaling several state-of-the-art methods. 3. Current diffusion model-based LDCT reconstruction methods solely employ the prior distributions learned from normal-dose CT data but neglect the valuable priors in low-dose data, which contain information about the characteristics of low-dose noise and artifacts. In addition, their reconstruction speed suffers from multiple sampling steps, presenting low efficiency. Breaking new ground in prior utilization, this thesis proposes a novel unsupervised LDCT iterative reconstruction algorithm based on dual denoising diffusion probabilistic models (DDPM), which leverages both normal-dose and low-dose priors. Specifically, the proposed method employs two DDPMs to learn the prior distributions from normal-dose and low-dose images, respectively, and incorporates them into a joint iterative reconstruction framework. To accelerate the reconstruction, partial diffusion sampling and single-pass deterministic reconstruction strategy are utilized in the proposed method, as well as the spaced OS-SART approaches. Experiments at different dose levels demonstrate the outstanding performance and fast speed of the proposed reconstruction algorithm. Through these innovations and contributions, this thesis addresses some significant challenges in current deep-learning-based unsupervised LDCT reconstruction methods, and proposes three novel unsupervised reconstruction algorithms. The proposed methods effectively improve the performance and efficiency of LDCT reconstruction under different unsupervised learning conditions, and provide some new perspectives and inspirations for future research."
OpenAlex,deep learning,From Sparse to Dense: Label-Efficient Weakly Supervised Segmentation for Images and Videos,Jian Wang,10.17638/03195330,2027-01-01,University of Liverpool,"Obtaining high-quality annotated data has become a primary bottleneck for training deep learning models, particularly for dense prediction tasks like semantic segmentation and video salient object segmentation. The demand for meticulous, pixel-level labeling makes fully-supervised approaches prohibitively expensive and limits their scalability. This thesis directly confronts this issue by proposing and systematically investigating a label-efficient ""sparse-to-dense'' paradigm. The core objective is to develop innovative frameworks that can learn from sparse, inexpensive weak supervision—such as image-level tags or scribbles—and intelligently propagate this minimal information to generate complete, pixel-accurate dense predictions. The major part of this thesis focuses on the ""sparse-to-dense'' challenge within Weakly Supervised Semantic Segmentation (WSSS) for images, where models learn from only image-level tags. Dominant approaches rely on Class Activation Maps (CAMs) as initial object seeds. However, CAMs inherently activate only the most discriminative object regions, leading to incomplete pseudo-labels. This gives rise to the central problem of activation densification: the critical process of expanding these sparse activations to cover the full extent of an object. Our research addresses this challenge through a progressive, multi-faceted strategy. Our exploration begins with a foundational framework (C3) designed to rectify the intrinsic flaws of initial CAMs. We propose a synergistic mutual calibration method. This method leverages the discrepancies between the two maps to generate local prototypes, which are simultaneously utilized to complete missing object parts and suppress background noise, yielding a significantly more accurate and complete initial seed. This foundational work immediately reveals the limitation of single-prototype instability and its inability to capture diverse features. Building on this foundation, we then develop architecture-specific strategies to address deeper limitations of the prototype-based approach. For Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) (C4), the use of a single prototype proves insufficient to capture significant intra-class variation. In response, we introduce an Optimal Transport (OT)-assisted framework that effectively mines multiple, diverse prototypes, thereby yielding more comprehensive activation maps. However, while C4 solves the intra-class diversity problem, the inherent local context constraint of the CNN architecture becomes the new bottleneck, fundamentally limiting the quality of globally-aware feature extraction needed for optimal multi-prototype assignment. This limitation necessitates a shift in architectural focus from CNNs to Vision Transformers. In the ViT architecture (C5), a new challenge arises where the token gap between the discriminative class token and varied patch tokens leads to incomplete activation. To bridge this gap, we leverage a tailored application of Optimal Transport, where the algorithm is tasked with learning a comprehensive proxy to ensure complete object activation. Despite these architectural advances (C3-C5), the overall WSSS performance hit a ceiling. This is fundamentally limited by the sparse supervision of class labels, which cannot provide precise boundary information. To break this ceiling, our WSSS exploration culminates in a universal enhancement strategy (C6) that transcends architecture-specific designs by leveraging Visual Foundation Models (VFMs). We resolve the conflict between the discriminative nature of initial CAMs and the VFM's need for holistic prompts. By modeling the CAM foreground as a graph and employing spectral analysis, our method intelligently selects a diverse set of prompt points that represent the overall structure of the foreground object. This guides the VFM to generate superior, boundary-aware supervision that can universally enhance any WSSS pipeline. Subsequently, the thesis extends the ""sparse-to-dense'' paradigm to the dynamic domain of video, addressing Weakly Supervised Video Salient Object Segmentation (WSVSOS) (C7) from sparse scribble annotations. In this specific context, the challenge evolves into spatio-temporal densification, which requires both full-object coverage within each frame and temporal consistency across the video sequences. To this end, we introduce the core CFMR framework, which utilizes Spatio-Temporal co-regulation. This framework is subsequently enhanced (CFMR+) by integrating the VFM guidance strategy from C6, which provides high-quality spatial priors essential for ensuring both high spatial detail and inter-frame consistency. By enforcing both intra-frame and cross-frame consistency between these two streams, our method effectively propagates the sparse initial signal to generate dense and temporally coherent saliency masks. In conclusion, this thesis presents a comprehensive and cohesive investigation into label-efficient segmentation tasks, offering a suite of innovative and effective strategies for the ""sparse-to-dense'' challenge. Our work establishes a progressive roadmap that systematically overcomes architectural and semantic limitations, culminating in highly robust and generalized densification pipelines. Our extensive experimental results on standard benchmarks validate the state-of-the-art performance of these methods, providing robust solutions to a long-standing problem in the computer vision field."

Abstract This Project develops an urban traffic intensity prediction system using deep learning techniques, with the aim of improving mobility decision-making. Unlike other platforms focused on visualizing the current state, the proposed solution seeks to anticipate future behaviors, and is positioned as an open, replicable alternative specifically oriented towards prediction. To achieve this, a modular architecture based on the Python language has been designed, capable of integrating multiple open data sources: historical traffic records, historical weather situation data, and spatial coordinates of measurement sensors. The system applies a process of cleaning, temporal interpolation, and variable transformation, including cyclic encoding of time and spatial conversion to UTM coordinates, allowing for precise fusion between geographical and meteorological data through techniques such as inverse distance weighting (IDW). The predictive model is based on an LSTM neural network, especially adapted for multivariate time sequences. It is trained using a sliding window strategy of 32 samples (7 hours and 45 minutes) to predict traffic intensity in the next interval. The system additionally incorporates an IterableDataset mechanism to handle large volumes of training data without compromising the stability of the environment. The obtained results show robust accuracy in validation scenarios, with acceptable prediction errors (MAE and RMSE). Furthermore, an interactive web interface has been developed, allowing for the local deployment of the system, with the capacity for real-time data ingestion and direct visualization of predictions. This work demonstrates the technical and operational feasibility of applying deep learning to urban traffic analysis and lays the groundwork for its future evolution towards more generalizable, robust, and useful systems in real smart city contexts."
OpenAlex,deep learning,Deep Learning-Based Data Hiding Technique for Medical Images,Hadjer SAIDI,,2026-06-26,University of Biskra Theses Repository (University of Biskra),"This thesis introduces novel deep learning-based frameworks for secure medical image steganography, addressing the critical challenge of protecting sensitive patient information while preserving diagnostic quality. Medical images present unique security requirements due to their dual nature: containing both critical visual data for diagnosis and sensitive patient metadata, which conventional steganographic techniques do not adequately address. Our work presents two complementary approaches to this challenge. First, we develop a Mask-RCNN based framework that intelligently identifies diagnostically insignificant regions within medical images for strategic data embedding. By combining this regionaware detection with Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) embedding in the frequency domain, our method achieves remarkable imperceptibility with Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR) values exceeding 115 dB while maintaining high payload capacity. Second, we propose a clinical quality-aware convolutional neural network architecture that leverages an encoder-decoder framework for end-to-end steganography. This approach employs parallel processing paths with scaled residual learning to embed secret medical images within cover images while preserving diagnostic features. Extensive experimentation across multiple medical imaging modalities (CT, MRI) from datasets including MIDRC-RICORD-1B, and IQ-OTH/NCCD, demonstrates that our method achieves a good trade-off between payload and imperceptibility. The frameworks developed in this thesis achieve an optimal balance between embedding capacity, imperceptibility, and robust secret recovery, providing healthcare institutions with effective tools for safeguarding patient privacy while maintaining the integrity of medical diagnostics. This work significantly advances the field of medical image security and establishes a foundation for future innovations in secure healthcare information systems."
OpenAlex,deep learning,A Novel Deep-Learning-Based Approach for Estimating High-Resolution InSAR Parameters,"Dell Amore, Luca; Carcereri, Daniel; Demir, Begüm; Rizzoli, Paola",,2026-06-01,elib (German Aerospace Center),"Nowadays, SAR Interferometry (InSAR) represents one of the most powerful tools to perform complex tasks, such as retrieving Earth’s surface topography and monitoring its deformations. However, denoising strategies are crucial for the generation of reliable and high-quality InSAR products. In this framework, we propose a complete and generalized theoretical and statistical model to physically describe and simulate a noise-free interferogram, together with its corresponding noisy version, starting from the knowledge of the InSAR acquisition geometry and of the underlying topography. A deep-learning-based model is then trained in a fully-supervised manner to estimate high-resolution InSAR parameters, i.e. coherence and interferometric phase, leveraging the proposed statistical model. In particular, an accurate assessment of the network’s estimation performance is conducted by comparing it to state-of-the-art denoising filters, such as Boxcar and Phi-Net and showing the added value of the proposed theoretical modifications to the state-of-the-art literature."
