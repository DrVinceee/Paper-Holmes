Lipoprotein(a) [Lp(a)] constitutes an independent, causal risk factor for ASCVD and aortic valve stenosis. Elevated Lp(a) is found in approximately 20% of the Polish population. Lp(a) measurements have been recommended in all adult patients to improve cardiovascular risk stratification. As the testing rate remains insufficient, there is a need to facilitate the incorporation of Lp(a) into routine patient care. This clinically oriented review outlines (i) up-to-date evidence on the role of Lp(a) in cardiovascular diseases, (ii) recent real-world data on the characteristics of Polish patients with elevated Lp(a), and (iii) strategies for Lp(a) testing and management in light of the current national recommendations and the latest 2025 Focused Update of the 2019 ESC/EAS Guidelines for the management of dyslipidemias."

However, the precise underlying mechanisms are not fully understood.
This study aimed to establish a causal association between cardiometabolic diseases and CAVS by using genetic correlations and a bidirectional two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis.
Genome-wide association study (GWAS) data for seven cardiometabolic disorders and CAVS were obtained from the FinnGen consortium. The genetic correlations between two conditions were evaluated using the linkage disequilibrium score regression (LDSC) and high-definition likelihood (HDL) methods. MR analyses were conducted with inverse-variance weighted (IVW) regression as the principal method, complemented by weighted median, heterogeneity analysis, and sensitivity tests.
We identified 12 shared genes between cardiometabolic disorders and CAVS. Functional enrichment analysis revealed that these overlapping genes are involved in cholesterol homeostasis, vascular remodeling, smooth muscle proliferation, and lipid accumulation. MR analysis suggested a causal relationship between cardiometabolic disorders and CAVS.
Our study indicates significant genetic overlap between cardiometabolic disorders and CAVS. This finding provides valuable insights into the underlying mechanisms of their co-occurrence and has important implications for future therapeutic strategies.

We conducted a comprehensive search across PubMed, Cochrane Central, and Scopus from March 1975 until December 2024 for studies comparing AVR vs conservative management in asymptomatic severe AS patients with preserved left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF). Outcomes were analyzed using a random-effects model to pool odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Our pooled analysis included four randomized controlled trials (RCTs) encompassing a total of 1427 patients. AVR significantly reduced the incidence of major adverse cardiovascular and cerebral events (MACCEs) (OR 0.36; 95% CI 0.22-0.61; p = 0.0002) compared to conservative management. The incidence of all-cause mortality, 30-day peri-procedural mortality, cardiovascular mortality, and myocardial infarction was comparable between the two groups. AVR was associated with a significant reduction in stroke incidence (OR 0.59; 95% CI 0.37-0.95, p = 0.03) and unplanned cardiovascular hospitalization rates (OR 0.35; 95% CI 0.27-0.46, p < 0.00001). AVR significantly reduces MACCEs, stroke, and unplanned cardiovascular hospitalizations compared to conservative management, with comparable mortality and myocardial infarction rates between the groups.

However, it still has disadvantages such as high thresholds and impedance and unstable pacing in some patients.
Our center pioneered the following J-wire pacing technique: inserting a J-wire through the auxiliary access 8F sheath (for balloon-expandable valves) or the main access 20F sheath (for self-expanding valves) into the descending aorta and aligning it at the same height as the left ventricular wire creates a loop circuit between the J-wire and the left ventricular wire after the balloon or prosthesis has been inserted into the annulus. This study included a total of 26 patients. The impedance and threshold of traditional wire pacing and J-wire pacing were measured, and the pacing method with the lower threshold was selected as the intraoperative pacing method.
All 26 patients were assigned to the J-wire pacing group, achieving a 100% surgical success rate. The proportion of patients with a pacing threshold ≤5 V was significantly higher compared to traditional wire pacing (76.92% vs. 0%), while the proportion with a threshold ≥10 V was significantly lower (0% vs. 38.46%).
J-wire pacing offers improved safety and effectiveness compared to traditional wire pacing in TAVR procedures. We herein share this single-center experience, hoping to provide novel insights for the refinement of TAVR procedures."

Cardiovascular imaging,"Diagnosing cardiac amyloidosis (CA) on echocardiography can be challenging due to the imaging overlap between CA and more prevalent causes of a hypertrophic phenotype. This study sought to (1) evaluate the performance of artificial-intelligence (AI) derived measurements incorporated into the established multiparametric echocardiographic scoring system to detect CA; (2) develop and validate an AI-based deep-learning model for video-based detection of CA on echocardiography.
The study population comprised 5776 patients (CA, 2756; controls, 3020). The training data set included patients from the UK National Amyloidosis Center and Taiwan MacKay Memorial Hospital (CA, 2241; controls, 2130). External test data sets were obtained from the US Duke University Health System (CA, 334; LVH controls, 668) and Japan National Cerebral and Cardiovascular Center (CA, 181; LVH controls, 222).
The multiparametric echocardiographic score computed using AI-derived measurements achieved an accuracy of 79.5% (sensitivity, 75.4%; specificity, 81.5%) in the United States cohort and 79.7% (sensitivity, 81.6%; specificity, 78.1%) in the Japan cohort. The deep-learning model demonstrated accuracies of 96.2% (sensitivity, 96.8%; specificity, 95.7%) and 95.8% (sensitivity, 97.3%; specificity, 94.3%) in the internal validation and internal test sets, respectively. External validation of the deep-learning model showed accuracies of 87.5% (sensitivity, 86.6%; specificity, 87.9%) in the United States and 88.4% (sensitivity, 92.3%; specificity, 85.3%) in the Japanese cohort. Subgroup analysis demonstrated that the deep-learning model showed robust discrimination of CA from other hypertrophic phenocopies: CA versus hypertension (area under the curve [AUC], 0.92 [95% CI, 0.91-0.94]), CA versus hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (AUC, 0.91 [95% CI, 0.87-0.94]), CA versus aortic stenosis (AUC, 0.93 [95% CI, 0.90-0.95]), CA versus chronic kidney disease (AUC, 0.93 [95% CI, 0.91-0.95]). The deep-learning model was able to classify a greater proportion of patients compared with the AI-derived multiparametric echocardiographic score and achieved superior diagnostic accuracy (AUC, 0.93 [95% CI, 0.91-0.95] versus AUC, 0.88 [95% CI, 0.85-0.90]; P<0.001).
Both the multiparametric echocardiographic score computed from AI-derived measurements and the fully automated deep-learning model can accurately identify patients with CA in globally diverse cohorts, with the deep-learning model providing superior performance."

We retrospectively analyzed 737 consecutive patients who underwent TAVI. Patients were stratified into tertiles according to ALBI score. Baseline clinical, echocardiographic, laboratory features were compared across tertiles. The primary endpoint was long-term all-cause mortality; secondary endpoints included in-hospital mortality and major complications. Kaplan-Meier analysis assessed survival, and Cox-regression models evaluated predictors of long-term mortality after adjustment for conventional risk factors.
Higher ALBI tertiles were associated with a greater comorbidity burden, worse ventricular function, and elevated biomarkers of inflammation and cardiac stress. In-hospital mortality increased across tertiles (5.3%, 7.3%, 11.8%). Long-term mortality also rose progressively (7.3%, 9.8%, 11.8%), with 60-month survival rates of approximately 90% (T1), 88% (T2), and 73% (T3). ALBI score independently predicted long-term mortality (HR 1.86, 95% CI 1.23-2.82), along with chronic kidney disease and lower TAPSE. Restricted cubic spline analysis demonstrated a near-linear association between ALBI and mortality risk.
Preprocedural ALBI score is independently associated with both short and long-term mortality after TAVI and may reflect systemic vulnerability not captured by conventional risk models. Incorporating ALBI into preprocedural assessment could enhance risk stratification."

This initiative aims to strengthen the national development of cardiovascular devices.
Computational analyses, mechanical tests, and hydrodynamic tests (normocardic and accelerated fatigue) were performed. The BVC-F was evaluated in a range of 20 to 200 beats per minute for 30 min. The accelerated fatigue tests were carried out at a frequency of 1050-1080 beats/min for a period of 1 month, followed by implantation in five Yorkshire porcine models using extracorporeal circulation.
Finite element analysis indicated a low risk of fracture (stresses 73% below yield strength) and radial expansion (15.95%). Tests validated an effective orifice area of 2.25 cm², transvalvular gradients < 10 mmHg, and a regurgitant flow lower than 5%. Accelerated fatigue tests confirmed structural integrity equivalent to 2.2 years. In vivo porcine implantation (n = 5) was successful, maintaining a mean gradient of 10 ± 2 mmHg with no paravalvular leakage. Furthermore, the viability of a ViV procedure was validated, resulting in sufficient annulus expansion and stable hemodynamics.
The BVC-F INC achieved compliance with preliminary safety and efficacy standards. Nonetheless, extended and complex simulations are requisite to assess long-term mechanical behavior, wear resistance, and functional stability before human clinical trials."

A propensity-matched, retrospective study of consecutive aortic valve interventions from 2010 to 2023.
A single institution.
Patients with severe AS and reduced EF (<50%) undergoing aortic valve intervention.
The cohort was dichotomized by SAVR versus TAVR.
A total of 1,164 patients underwent an aortic valve intervention for severe AS with reduced EF (<50%), of which 240 (20.6%) had an isolated SAVR and 924 (79.4%) underwent a TAVR. Propensity matching yielded 205 pairs. The 30-day mortality and stroke rates were no different across groups. Paravalvular leak was significantly higher in the TAVR group, and there was a statistically nonsignificant trend toward more pacemakers in the TAVR group (p = 0.093). At 1 year, EF was similar between groups: 48% (IQR: 41-53) in the SAVR group versus 53% (IQR: 37-58) in the TAVR group (p = 0.431). Conversely, at 1 year, mean pressure gradients were higher in the TAVR group (10 [7-15] mmHg v 8 [7-10] mmHg, p = 0.040). The cumulative incidence of heart failure readmissions was higher in the TAVR group, although it was a statistically nonsignificant trend (p = 0.066). The cumulative incidence of aortic valve reintervention was similar across groups (p = 0.564). Kaplan-Meier survival estimates were significantly lower in the TAVR group (p = 0.016).
While surgery may optimize survival after aortic valve replacement in patients with reduced EF, these observational findings need to be verified by prospective randomized controlled comparisons."

This study aims to synthesise and update contemporary long-term TAVI versus SAVR data.
This study comprised a systematic review and meta-analysis and employed a Bayesian hierarchical design. Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing TAVI to SAVR in low-risk to intermediate-risk patients with at least 5-year follow-up were included. The primary outcome was 5-year all-cause mortality; secondary outcomes were the 5-year incidence of stroke and the 5-year incidence of the composite of mortality and stroke.
Time-to-event data were reconstructed. Relative risks (RRs) with 95% credible intervals (CrIs) were estimated from reported 5-year event rates using minimally informative priors. Sensitivity analyses were performed using various meta-analytical models, and using conventional frequentist random-effects and fixed-effects models for sensitivity purposes.
A total of six RCTs, enrolling 7249 low- to intermediate-risk patients reported 5-year outcomes (TAVI n=3704, SAVR n=3545). The 5-year all-cause mortality rate was 29.7% (28.2-31.2%, TAVI) and 27.6% (26.1-29.1%, SAVR). The median RR for all-cause mortality was 1.12 (95% CrI 1.02-1.22, heterogeneity τ2=0), with a 99.3% posterior probability that SAVR is superior to TAVI for this endpoint. For stroke, the median RR was 1.13 (95% CrI 0.93-1.39, heterogeneity τ2=0.04), resulting in an 88.0% posterior probability that SAVR outperformed TAVI for this outcome. These results were consistent across conventional frequentist random-effects and fixed-effects models employing p values (RR 1.13, 95% CI 1.05 to 1.22, p=0.001, and RR 1.12, 95% CI 1.03 to 1.23, p=0.011, respectively). There was no evidence for an interaction effect of surgical risk category (p=0.470).
In this meta-analysis of RCTs, TAVI resulted in a clinically relevant increase in all-cause mortality, and a high probability of an increased risk of stroke, at 5 years of follow-up in low-risk to intermediate-risk patients, when compared to SAVR."

Cardiovascular interventions,"Estimating the probability of major bleeding (MB) in patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) after transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) is important for decision-making regarding anticoagulation strategy.
The aim of this study was to identify independent predictors of MB to create a risk assessment score in patients with AF after successful TAVR.
In this ENVISAGE-TAVI AF (EdoxabaN Versus standard of care and their effectS on clinical outcomes in pAtients havinG undergonE Transcatheter Aortic Valve Implantation-in Atrial Fibrillation; NCT02943785) on-treatment analysis, a stepwise Cox regression model identified MB predictors from baseline patient characteristics. A simple point-based additive score was constructed using the variable β estimates from the selected model. Patients were stratified into low-, moderate-, and high-risk groups according to their risk assessment scores; the likelihood of MB was compared between groups.
Among 1,377 patients, 139 (10.1%) experienced MB (mean ± SD on-treatment follow-up: 1.3 ± 0.8 years). The independent predictors of MB formed the HARHP (low Hemoglobin, excessive Alcohol use, severe Renal impairment, history of Hypercholesterolemia, and Percutaneous coronary intervention performed within 30 days of TAVR) score, with each parameter given a weight of 1 or 2. The likelihood of MB for high-risk patients (score ≥ 4) was 6.5 times higher than for low-risk patients (score = 0 or 1) (HR: 6.54; 95% CI: 3.61-11.85; P < 0.0001) and 2.9 times higher than moderate-risk patients (score = 2 or 3) (HR: 2.86; 95% CI: 1.62-5.04; P = 0.0003). The C statistic for the HARHP score was 0.63 at 1-year follow-up and 0.62 at 2-year follow-up.
Five independent predictors of long-term MB were identified in patients with AF requiring oral anticoagulant agents after TAVR and formed the HARHP score to assess MB risk. Use of the HARHP score may improve patient outcomes."

This study examined acute outcomes of transcatheter aortic valve replacement versus surgical aortic valve replacement in a national cohort of patients with prior coronary artery bypass graft surgery.
Using the 2016-2021 Nationwide Readmissions Database, we identified adult patients (≥18 years old) with prior coronary artery bypass graft surgery undergoing transcatheter or surgical aortic valve replacement. Patients with concomitant cardiac procedures were excluded. Outcomes included in-hospital mortality, postoperative complications, hospitalization costs, length of stay, and 30-day nonelective readmissions. Multivariable regression models were employed to evaluate associations.
Among an estimated 566,705 patients, 3.0% of surgical aortic valve replacement recipients and 10.4% of transcatheter aortic valve replacement recipients had prior coronary artery bypass graft surgery. Use of surgical aortic valve replacement declined from 1,347 cases in 2016 to 593 cases in 2021, whereas transcatheter procedures increased from 8,464 to 10,821 cases (both Cuzick's test for trends < .001). After multivariable adjustment and surgical aortic valve replacement as reference, transcatheter aortic valve replacement was associated with reduced odds of in-hospital mortality (adjusted odds ratio 0.22, 95% confidence interval 0.10-0.46) and intraoperative (adjusted odds ratio 0.46, 95% confidence interval 0.24-0.89), respiratory (adjusted odds ratio 0.37, 95% confidence interval 0.26-0.53), and renal (adjusted odds ratio 0.50, 95% confidence interval 0.33-0.75) complications, along with shorter hospital length of stay (-2.7 days, 95% confidence interval -3.1 to -2.2 days) and lower costs (-$32,000, 95% confidence interval -$62,000 to -$180). No significant differences in 30-day readmissions were noted (adjusted odds ratio 0.68, 95% confidence interval 0.42-1.10).
Transcatheter aortic valve replacement offers lower mortality, fewer complications, and reduced costs compared with surgical aortic valve replacement, supporting its role as a favorable treatment for aortic stenosis in patients with prior coronary artery bypass graft surgery."

A comparative study was conducted involving 80 individuals: 40 patients with confirmed HCM and 40 sex- and age-matched controls (22 men, 18 women, mean age 55.3±13.3 years). All participants underwent a comprehensive examination at the cardiology department, including electrocardiography (ECG), echocardiography with full assessment of intracardiac hemodynamic parameters, Holter ECG monitoring, and laboratory tests. For molecular biological analysis, plasma expression levels of circulating microRNAs (-21, -29a, -133a) were determined for all participants using real-time polymerase chain reaction.
Circulating microRNA levels differed significantly between patients with HCM and the comparison group. The analysis showed a significant increase in the microRNA-21 expression (4.07 vs. 2.03; p&lt;0.001) and significant decreases in microRNA-29a (0.24 vs. 1.83; p&lt;0.001) and microRNA-133a (0.02 vs. 6.34; p&lt;0.001). ROC analysis demonstrated a high discriminatory ability of the studied microRNAs: microRNA-21 (AUC=0.887, sensitivity 89.7%, specificity 84.4%); microRNA-29a (AUC=0.884, sensitivity 92.3%, specificity 87.5%).
Increased expression of microRNA-21 and decreased expression of microRNA-29a are associated with myocardial fibrosis, while marked suppression of microRNA-133a reflects hypertrophic remodeling. These findings suggest that this microRNA panel holds promise as potential auxiliary markers for HCM, though clinical significance requires validation in larger, prospective studies."

We conducted a retrospective, observational multicentre study of patients younger than 1 year who underwent a Ross procedure. Clinical data were obtained from hospital records. Survival was analysed with Kaplan-Meier analysis and Cox regression, and reinterventions with competing-risk models.
Eighty-one children underwent a Ross procedure at a median age of 96 days (IQR 38-166) and a median weight of 4.5 kg (IQR 3.4-6.3), with a median follow-up of 3.8 years (IQR 0.6-10) with a maximum follow-up of 18.6 years. There were 23 (28.4%) deaths, with 15 (18%) occurring in-hospital. Ten-year survival was 72.7%. Longer cardiopulmonary bypass times and ECMO requirement were associated with in-hospital mortality, while younger age showed a borderline association (p = 0.05). At 10 years, the cumulative incidence of reintervention was 72.6%, mostly due to a high rate of RVPA conduit reintervention (52.2% at 10 years), but with a low pulmonary autograft reintervention rate (7.6% at 10 years).
Outcomes of Ross (-Konno) operations in patients younger than 1 year reflect the high complexity of this population. Early mortality is significant with acceptable long-term survival rates. The pulmonary autograft in aortic position has good durability with few reinterventions, while RVPA conduits have demonstrated a high number of reinterventions."

Nevertheless, an unexplained phenomenon known as the obesity paradox has arisen in the context of transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI), inquiring conventional beliefs. The obesity paradox refers to better clinical outcomes observed in obese individuals undergoing TAVI. These include reduced all-cause mortality, lower rates of procedural complications, and improved long-term survival rates compared to their lean counterparts. Several theories have been proposed to explain the obesity paradox in TAVI. One of the most popular is the adipose tissue-mediated cardioprotective effect hypothesis. It is known that adipose tissue could offer both protective and harmful effects on the cardiovascular system. These effects can be linked to the adipose tissue's distribution, extension, and intrinsic biological characteristics. Obesity has been associated with adipose tissue malfunction, leading to proinflammatory and deleterious effects on the cardiovascular system. As opposed to what is believed, it is suggested that a healthy obese phenotype might be facilitated by exercise, leading to outstanding cardiovascular benefits. A healthy obese phenotype is also associated with a secretome profile that has unique adipose tissue features like adequate fat storage and formation of lipid droplets, a significant capacity for adipogenesis, minimal extracellular matrix fibrosis, potential for angiogenesis, adipocyte browning, and limited infiltration or activation of macrophages. This article is presented as a specialized narrative review, synthesizing current evidence on the relationship between obesity and outcomes in patients undergoing TAVI."

We evaluated the prognostic value of high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP).
This single-center, prospective, observational registry enrolled consecutive patients with stroke within 1 week of onset. Transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) was not protocol-mandated but used at physician discretion, mainly for embolic-source evaluation. CAA was defined as any plaque ≥4 mm in thickness or a plaque with ulceration or mobile components on TEE. Patients were dichotomized by hsCRP at 3.0 mg/L. The primary outcome was 1-year major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE), including stroke, acute coronary syndrome, and vascular death. Among 1,214 patients, TEE was performed in 335; CAA was identified in 83 (24.8%). Seventy-six with hsCRP data were analyzed, with 1-year follow up obtained in 73 (96.1%). Over 1 year, 17 patients had at least 1 vascular event, yielding an event rate of 23.2%. The incidence of MACE was significantly higher in patients with hsCRP ≥3.0 mg/L than in those with hsCRP <3.0 mg/L (42.2% vs. 15.3%; log-rank P=0.010). In multivariable Cox analysis, hsCRP ≥3.0 mg/L independently predicted MACE (hazard ratio 4.68; 95% confidence interval 1.43-15.32).
Elevated hsCRP is independently associated with an increased risk of MACE in CAA-related stroke. hsCRP may aid risk stratification and underscores the role of systemic inflammation in this high-risk subgroup."

We investigated 70 consecutive patients with moderate to severe AS who underwent 99 mTc-pyrophosphate (PYP) scintigraphy at Kumamoto University Hospital between 2012 and 2020. The patients were divided into 2 groups based on 99 mTc-PYP scintigraphy positivity (n=15) or negativity (n=55). The sinus of Valsalva wall thickness and relative apical longitudinal strain (LS) index (RapLSI, apical LS / [basal LS + mid LS]) were significantly associated with 99 mTc-PYP scintigraphy positivity when adjusted for severe AS (odds ratio [OR] 3.76; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.36-10.38; P<0.05; and OR 20.7; 95% CI 2.00-215.44; P<0.05, respectively). Receiver-operating characteristic curve analysis showed that the sinus of Valsalva wall thickness had an area under the curve of 0.77 (95% CI 0.63-0.90; P<0.01) for 99 mTc-PYP scintigraphy positivity and that the best cut-off value was 1.75 mm (sensitivity 87%, specificity 55%). The 99 mTc-PYP scintigraphy positivity rate in patients with a sinus of Valsalva wall thickness ≥1.75 mm and RapLSI ≥1.0 was 66.7% and the negativity rate in those with a sinus of Valsalva wall thickness <1.75 mm and RapLSI <1.0 was 96.2%.
The sinus of Valsalva wall thickness was useful for predicting 99 mTc-PYP scintigraphy positivity in patients with AS."

The coexistence of supravalvular aortic stenosis, aneurysmal dilation, and infective endocarditis with vegetations in the aortic arch is exceedingly rare.
We describe an 8-year-old Arab boy from Syria with Williams syndrome who presented with fatigue, tachycardia, dyspnea, fever, chills, and night sweats. Transthoracic echocardiography revealed a dilated aortic arch with large vegetation at the origin of the brachiocephalic trunk and supravalvular aortic stenosis. Despite 10 days of intravenous antibiotic therapy, vegetations persisted, necessitating urgent surgery. The ascending aorta was replaced using the McGoon technique with complete excision of infected tissue. Postoperative recovery was uneventful, and follow-up imaging showed good left ventricular function without aortic gradient.
This case underscores the importance of early recognition and timely surgical intervention in preventing catastrophic outcomes in patients with Williams syndrome and complex cardiovascular involvement."

While isolated valvular heart disease (VHD) is well characterized, the impact of moderate aortic regurgitation (AR) with another concomitant moderate VHD remains unclear. Current guidelines focus mainly on isolated severe lesions, potentially underestimating moderate MVD. This study assessed the prevalence and prognostic impact of concomitant moderate VHD in patients with moderate AR.                                                           Methods and results                     We retrospectively analyzed 794 patients with ≥ moderate AR (2017–2023) from a dedicated echocardiographic database. Groups were: isolated moderate AR (n=178), isolated significant AR (n=214), and moderate AR plus ≥ one concomitant moderate VHD (n=402). Significant AR was defined by the presence of ≥1 echocardiographic severity criterion. Exclusion criteria included cardiomyopathy, prior cardiac surgery, LVEF &amp;lt;50%, or severe VHD other than AR. Follow-up was 24 months for a composite endpoint of all-cause mortality and heart failure hospitalization (HHF). VHD severity was graded per guidelines. Patients with moderate AR plus another VHD were older (79.9 vs. 66.4 years, p&amp;lt;0.001), with more comorbidities and larger left atria. During follow-up, 151 patients (18.8%) met the composite endpoint (63 HHF, 108 deaths). Moderate AR with another VHD independently predicted higher risk [HR 2.83 (95% CI: 1.32–6.03; p = 0.007)], comparable to isolated significant AR [HR 2.65 (95% CI: 1.23–5.70; p = 0.013)].                                                           Conclusions                     Moderate AR with another concomitant moderate VHD carries a prognosis similar to significant AR, indicating this combination is not benign and may be underestimated by current guidelines."

This study evaluates its feasibility and mid-term outcomes in concomitant aortic and mitral valve surgery.                                                           METHODS                     We retrospectively analyzed all consecutive patients undergoing endoscopic concomitant mitral and aortic valve surgery from January 2016 to July 2025. Cardiopulmonary bypass was established via peripheral cannulation. All procedures were performed through a right mini-thoracotomy using a 30° thoracoscope. The primary end-point was in-hospital mortality. Secondary end-points included major postoperative complications, a composite early outcome (in-hospital mortality, stroke, major bleeding requiring revision, postoperative myocardial infarction, or dialysis), and mid-term survival. Univariable logistic regression was used to identify predictors of the composite early postoperative outcome. Follow-up was 100% complete.                                                           RESULTS                     The analysis included 111 patients (median age 70 years [IQR 62–76], 55 males, median EuroSCORE II 3.3 [IQR 1.90–5.04]). The aortic valve was replaced in all cases. Mitral valve was repaired in 54 cases and replaced in 57. Concomitant procedures were performed in 44 cases. Median CPB and cross-clamp times were 198 [164–233] and 139 [117–160] min respectively. In-hospital mortality was 3.6%, with low rates of stroke (3.6%), bleeding (8.1%), and dialysis (5.4%). At a median follow-up of 46 months, overall survival was 87%. Reduced eGFR, coronary artery disease, chronic lung disease and peripheral arteriopathy were significantly associated with the composite early outcome.                                                           CONCLUSIONS                     Endoscopic technique can be successfully applied to combined aortic and mitral valve surgery, encouraging its broader adoption."

Methods                                            Clinical, anesthesia and CPB data were analyzed for 379 adults undergoing isolated mitral regurgitation repair. Platelet levels (1000/μL) were divided into three groups: low, 53–164 (                       n                       = 128); medium, 165–208 (                       n                       = 126); and high, 209–906 (                       n                       = 125). The primary endpoint was chest drainage volume (mL) at 24 postoperative hours. To delineate the degree and impact of rewarming, a variable “rewarming/cooling ratio” was defined as: peak rewarming temperature (°C) divided by nadir cooling temperature (°C). General linear models were used to evaluate factors associated with the volume of 24-h chest drainage.                                                                                Results                                            Mean flow rate was 2.7 ± 0.1 L/min/m                       2                       , nadir core temperature 30.7 ± 1.3°C and peak rewarming temperature 36.2 ± 0.5°C. The “rewarming/cooling ratio” averaged 1.133 ± 0.044.                                          Postoperatively, nadir platelet count was 115 ± 46 k/μL, and chest drainage averaged 344 ± 181 mL at 24 h. Two patients underwent re-exploration for bleeding (0.5%). Transfusion was required in 85 patients (22.4%).                                            Gender (F = 20.585,                       p                       &lt; 0.001), platelet count (F = 3.875,                       p                       = 0.024), fibrinogen (F = 4.241,                       p                       = 0.040), and chest incision (F = 58.097,                       p                       &lt; 0.001), rather than the rewarming temperature (F = 2.322,                       p                       = 0.128), were factors significantly associated with 24-h chest drainage.                                                                 A significant interaction existed between platelet levels and “rewarming/cooling ratio” (F = 3.717,                       p                       = 0.025), i.e., with a higher “rewarming/cooling ratio”, 24-h chest drainage tended to increase in the low platelet group, and to decrease in patients with high and medium platelet levels.                                                                                Conclusions                     In this series of patients undergoing isolated mitral regurgitation repair, gender, platelet count, fibrin and chest incision, rather than rewarming temperature, were independent factors significantly associated with postoperative bleeding. The impact of rewarming temperature on postoperative bleeding was modified by preoperative platelet levels. It is advisable to avoid excessive cooling during CPB and keep the cooling temperature at maximally allowable level."

While transcatheter edge‐to‐edge repair (TEER) improves symptoms and prognosis in selected patients, its effects on cardiac remodeling remain debated. This systematic review and meta‐analysis aimed to evaluate the impact of TEER on echocardiographic indices of cardiac remodeling.                                                           Methods                     PubMed, Scopus, and Cochrane Library were used to identify relevant studies assessing echocardiographic changes before and after TEER. Outcomes of interest were left ventricular (LV) ejection fraction, global longitudinal strain, LV end‐diastolic and end‐systolic volumes and LV end‐diastolic and end‐systolic diameter, tricuspid annular plane systolic excursion, pulmonary artery systolic pressure, and left atrial end‐systolic volume.                                                           Results                     Forty‐two studies (3987 patients) were included. TEER was associated with a significant increase in LV ejection fraction (mean difference [MD], 1.51% [95% CI, 0.47–2.55]), without significant improvement in global longitudinal strain. Significant LV remodeling was observed, with reductions in LV end‐diastolic volume (standardized MD, −0.26 [95% CI, −0.37 to −0.14]), LV end‐systolic volume (standardized MD, −0.21 [95% CI, −0.30 to −0.12]), LV end‐diastolic diameter (MD, −2.35 mm [95% CI, −3.66 to −1.04]) and left ventricular end‐systolic diameter (MD, −2.30 mm [95% CI, −3.86 to −0.74). TEER also improved right ventricular function (tricuspid annular plane systolic excursion [MD, 1.29 mm [95% CI, 0.60–1.97]) and reduced pulmonary artery systolic pressure (MD, −6.75 mm Hg [95% CI, −8.53 to −4.97). No significant improvement in left atrial end‐systolic volume was detected.                                                           Conclusions                     Available evidence suggests that TEER promotes significant cardiac remodeling in patients with secondary mitral regurgitation."

With a focus on the prevalent psychological complications following the onset of this condition, this study aimed to explore the correlation between antenatal depression and Corona disease anxiety, personality traits, and postpartum depression during the COVID-19 pandemic.                                                           Materials and Methods:                     This cross-sectional descriptive-analytical study investigated women receiving care at health centers affiliated with Kerman University of Medical Sciences during the last month of their pregnancy and the postpartum period in 2022. Following the acquisition of informed consent, participants were assessed using various measures, including demographic and obstetric information, the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale, the Corona Disease Anxiety Scale (CDAS), and the NEO Personality Inventory-Revised during their third trimester of pregnancy. The same group of participants completed the Edinburgh Depression Scale and the Corona Disease Anxiety Scale (CDAS) 4-6 weeks after childbirth.                                                           Results and Discussion:                     There was a significant correlation between family income, unwanted pregnancy as perceived by both the mother and father, and antenatal depression. Additionally, marital satisfaction played a significant role in postpartum depression. Furthermore, antenatal depression was significantly associated with neuroticism, agreeableness, and physical symptoms related to Corona disease anxiety. Personality traits, with the exception of extroversion and conscientiousness, and various domains of Corona disease anxiety, excluding psychological symptoms, were also significantly associated with postpartum depression.                                                           Conclusion:                     During pandemics or epidemics, such as the COVID-19 outbreak, experiencing mental distress during pregnancy can contribute to mental health issues during the postpartum period. This risk is particularly true in individuals with unique personality traits, emphasizing the need for increased focus on mental health within prenatal care during these crises."

Method:                     This cross-sectional study was conducted in Kerman, Iran. Data were collected from patients who visited Afzalipour Hospital in Kerman more than twice during the COVID-19 epidemic from the end of February 2020 to March 21, 2021. We conducted two key analyses: 1. Mixed effect logistic regression was used to check the relationship between the variables and COVID-19 severity. 2. Mixed effect linear regression was used to check the relationship between the variables and the length of stay in the hospital.                                                           Results:                     The findings indicated that the most important risk factors for the severity of COVID-19 were heart diseases (OR=1.67,95%CI:1.20-2.30), increasing age (OR=2.23 for age&gt;54, 95%CI:1.70- 2.90), male gender (OR=1.47,95%CI:1.10-1.96), respiratory diseases other than asthma, and frequency of admission (OR=1.60,95%CI:1.20-2.15). All patients who underwent readmission experienced a shorter duration of hospitalization during their subsequent admission (OR=0.94,95%CI:0.91,0.96) and had a higher mortality rate (30% within 14 days, 26.6% between 14-90 days). Patients readmitted at intervals of 14-90 days and greater than 90 days exhibited lower disease severity compared to those readmitted within the 0-14 day period.                                                           Conclusion:                     Examining readmissions, the severity of COVID-19, and the length of hospital stay in affected patients are important factors for planning and allocating resources for COVID-19 management and treatment. These factors can help policymakers develop effective clinical guidelines for hospitalization or outpatient treatment of COVID-19 patients and contribute to reducing the burden of disease in the community."

Kinovea, as an accessible motion-analysis software, provides both visual and quantitative feedback. However, its application in supporting technique development among beginner athletes remains insufficiently explored. Aim: This study aims to describe the use of Kinovea in biomechanics training and examine its contribution to the awareness of kinematic characteristics and movement techniques among beginner athletes. Methods: A descriptive qualitative design involved 72 beginner athletes aged 18–25 years selected through purposive sampling. Data were collected over 16 weeks through interviews, field observations, and motion video recordings analyzed using Kinovea. Kinematic data focused on joint angles, stride behavior, and movement phases during walking, running, and the flight phase. Qualitative data were analyzed using content analysis with NVivo 12, while kinematic results were interpreted descriptively to identify performance patterns and areas for technical refinement. Result: Kinematic analysis showed coordinated joint-angle patterns across all phases. Walking analysis identified arm swing angles of 50.9°–58.8° and leg separation angles of 64.3°–67.2°, indicating a stable gait rhythm. The running analysis revealed knee angles of 68.8°–69.8° and elbow angles of 87.6°–89.1°, indicating efficient propulsive mechanics. The flight phase demonstrated knee angles of 81.2°–87.8° and elbow angles of 80.4°–88.3°, suggesting effective momentum use and postural stability. These measurements supported stride-efficiency assessment and technique evaluation. Qualitative findings revealed that Kinovea enabled athletes to interpret movement phases and identify technical inefficiencies through slow-motion and frame-by-frame visualization. Conclusion: Kinovea supports basic motion analysis by providing clear kinematic information and helping beginner athletes observe and refine their movement techniques. The findings also offer practical value for coaches by enabling more precise identification of inefficient patterns and guiding targeted corrections during early-stage training."

OpenAlex,deep learning,Combating Data and Target Shifts in Visual Tasks,Zhaorui Tan,10.17638/03194353,2031-01-01,University of Liverpool,"The rapid advancement of deep learning models for visual tasks has led to significant progress in many domains. However, a key challenge remains: ensuring that models can generalize effectively to unseen samples or novel classes, especially in real-world scenarios where training data-target pairs are often limited or unavailable, and test data may exhibit shifts in both data and targets. This thesis addresses the problem of shifts across data and targets, proposing novel methods to improve model generalization and transferability in complex settings. The thesis identifies the different shift scenarios for visual tasks and presents their problem forms. The research first relaxes the static target distribution assumption in Multi-Domain Generalization (mDG) tasks, introducing the General Multi-Domain Generalization (GMDG) objective to improve generalization under varying data shifts. Specifically, Extensive experiments validate that GMDG is feasible for classification, segmentation, and regression tasks. Further considering extreme target distribution shifts where even unknown novel classes emerge, the study also explores logical regularization techniques for tasks such as Generalized Category Discovery (GCD), mDG+GCD, and Class Incremental Learning (CIL), proposing a sample-based logical regularization term (L-Reg) to enhance data-, target-, and all-shift generalization. Additionally, a partial logic framework is introduced to address challenges in CIL, enabling models to retain room for unknown classes during training. This is further extended by the Partial-Logic Regularization (PL-Reg), which improves generalization across GCD, mDG+GCD, and transferability for CIL tasks. Furthermore, the thesis proposes a novel Semantic-aware Data Augmentation (SADA) framework for cross-modality generalization in text-to-image synthesis (T2Isyn), text-image retrieval (TIR), and image-text retrieval (ITR) tasks. This framework ensures semantic preservation across text and image modalities, improving both semantic consistency and image quality in cross-modality tasks. The methods proposed in this thesis offer significant advancements in visual generalization and transfer scenarios, providing theoretical insights and practical solutions for handling data shifts, target shifts, and multi-modalities in complex scenarios. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of the proposed methods, demonstrating their superior performance across a range of tasks."
OpenAlex,deep learning,Antecedents and consequences of Green-tech FDI in emerging markets,Zhuoran Liu,10.17638/03195308,2031-01-01,University of Liverpool,"As environmental pressures intensify, attracting sustainable foreign direct investment (FDI), particularly green-tech FDI, has become a critical pathway for emerging markets to achieve environmental sustainability. However, existing research remains fragmented, offering limited insights into why green-tech FDI enters emerging markets and how it affects regional green innovation. This thesis addresses these gaps by systematically examining both the antecedents and consequences of green-tech FDI through three empirical studies using regional data from China. Study 1 and Study 2 focus on the antecedents of green-tech FDI. Study 1 examines how host-country conditions can attract green-tech FDI, highlighting the role of environmental management information disclosure (EMID) by domestic firms in reducing information gaps and strengthening green market–seeking motives. Study 2 shifts attention to the active decision-making of green-tech FDI, showing that under uncertainty, green-tech foreign investors engage in identity-based bandwagon learning by imitating peers with similar green identities, thereby mitigating investment risks. Study 3 turns to the consequences of green-tech FDI. It demonstrates that, due to the technological complexity of green innovation and limited absorptive capacity in emerging markets, green-tech FDI may generate crowding-out effects rather than purely positive spillovers. Adopting a network perspective, the study further finds that universities play a key moderating role: through broad linkages and deep collaborations, they help mitigate negative spillovers and facilitate the diffusion of green technologies. Together, the three studies advance the literature on sustainable FDI by differentiating green-tech FDI from general FDI and identifying the specific mechanisms that shape its entry decisions and local innovation outcomes. Practically, the findings provide guidance for emerging-market governments and firms on how to attract and manage sustainable investment, balance growth with environmental objectives, and strengthen local innovation ecosystems."
OpenAlex,deep learning,A UAV-Based Framework for Community-Scale Residential Building Energy Modelling in China,Mengfan Jin,10.17638/03195460,2029-01-01,University of Liverpool,"With increasing emphasis on energy efficiency and carbon emission reduction in the building sector, rapid and scalable energy modelling of existing buildings is critical for retrofit projects and policy development. Conventional surveys, data collection and energy modelling processes remain labour-intensive and impractical for large-scale applications, and energy modelling often dominates project time and cost. Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) equipped with high-resolution and infrared cameras now offer fast and safe exterior surveys, showing great potential in building energy assessments. Yet, a systematic framework for UAV integration, from image capture through processing to inputs for building energy simulation, has not been established. This research addresses these challenges by developing a structured framework for community-scale building energy modelling, which integrates UAV photogrammetry to accelerate data acquisition, reduce labour, and shorten energy modelling time for retrofit projects. The framework is designed to minimise prior data requirements while maximising automation and retaining sufficient accuracy and reliability. It also addressed systemic issues, such as the lack of data necessary to fully exploit the potential of available technologies in the context of this study. To achieve this research objective, a mixed-methodology approach, combining desk studies and fieldwork, was adopted. First, a comprehensive review of UAV-based building energy studies mapped the current applications and available tools, proposing a preliminary framework. Fieldwork then encompassed a pilot study and a detailed case study. In the pilot test, a single building was surveyed to identify an optimal toolchain for flight planning, image capture, photogrammetric reconstruction, model generation, and selection of a simulation platform. The resulting refined framework was applied to a case study of a 39-building community, and it was demonstrated that further automation was necessary. The potential for automation was then further explored. Geomatic algorithms, machine learning, and deep learning techniques were compared, and the combination that best balanced accuracy and processing time was selected for 3D model generation and window-to-wall ratio (WWR) extraction. In parallel, an archetype library of residential buildings in the Hot Summer Cold Winter (HSCW) zone in China was compiled to facilitate the assignment of thermal parameters. Finally, a reusable community-scale building energy modelling (CBEM) workflow was assembled in Grasshopper using Ladybug Tools components to process the aforementioned inputs. In conclusion, this study integrates UAV photogrammetry, GIS-based geomatic algorithms, machine learning, and graphical programming to develop an UAV-CBEM framework. The outcomes establish a foundation for scalable UAV-based building energy assessments, enhancing applicability in data-limited and large-scale settings worldwide."

OpenAlex,deep learning,Unsupervised Deep-learning Methods for Low-dose Computed Tomography Reconstruction,Ran An,10.17638/03194237,2027-01-01,University of Liverpool,"Computed tomography (CT) has become an indispensable imaging technique in medical diagnostics and industrial applications, owing to its non-invasive nature and high resolution in visualizing object internal structures. While X-ray CT (X-ray computed tomography) significantly enhances lesion detection capabilities, excessive exposure to X-ray radiation raises substantial health concerns, including elevated cancer risks and potential genetic damage. Although low-dose CT (LDCT) protocols reduce radiation safety concerns, they inevitably introduce severe noise and artifacts, which might compromise diagnostic accuracy. Recent advances in supervised deep learning approaches have demonstrated remarkable success in LDCT reconstruction. However, the reliance on paired training data severely limits their deployment in practical CT applications. This fundamental constraint highlights the critical importance of developing unsupervised reconstruction methods. Although existing unsupervised LDCT methods have made notable progress, they still face challenges requiring systematic solutions. This thesis makes three contributions to advance the field of unsupervised LDCT reconstruction: 1. Current dual-domain self-supervised LDCT denoising methods typically neglect the heterogeneity of the non-stationary Gaussian noise levels in low-dose sinograms and usually treat them as common images without appropriately controlling the denoising strength. The denoisers employed by them, which are based on classic convolutional neural networks (CNN), will lead to blurring artifacts in the reconstructed images if directly used for sinogram denoising. In addition, the denoising strength in the sinogram and image domains must be well-balanced to avoid introducing over-blurring or secondary artifacts in the reconstructed images, but existing approaches do not focus on this crucial point. To address these limitations, this thesis proposes a novel end-to-end dual-domain self-supervised framework for LDCT denoising. It employs Dropblock layers to adaptively localize the effect of convolution for sinogram denoising and sets a weighted average between the denoised sinograms and their noisy counterparts to better control the denoising strength, thus effectively reducing the blurring artifacts and leading to a well-balanced dual-domain denoising. Numerical experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and superior performance of the proposed method. 2. Existing normalizing flows (NFs)-based unsupervised LDCT reconstruction methods face challenges in both image quality and computational efficiency. On one hand, they typically utilize a two-way transformation strategy between noisy images and latent variables, which could easily lead to detail loss and secondary artifacts in the reconstructed images. On the other hand, training NFs on high-resolution CT images is computationally intensive. Although conditional normalizing flows (CNFs) can mitigate computational costs by learning conditional probabilities, existing approaches rely on labeled data for conditionalization, leaving unsupervised CNFs-based LDCT reconstruction a challenge. To tackle these issues, this thesis proposes a novel unsupervised LDCT iterative reconstruction algorithm based on CNFs. The proposed method employs a strict one-way transformation strategy during the alternating optimization in the dual spaces to prevent detail loss and secondary artifacts, and proposes a novel unsupervised conditionalization strategy for CNFs, thus achieving efficient training and inference on high-resolution images. The proposed method illustrates high-quality and relatively fast unsupervised reconstruction. Experiments across two datasets demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed method by rivaling several state-of-the-art methods. 3. Current diffusion model-based LDCT reconstruction methods solely employ the prior distributions learned from normal-dose CT data but neglect the valuable priors in low-dose data, which contain information about the characteristics of low-dose noise and artifacts. In addition, their reconstruction speed suffers from multiple sampling steps, presenting low efficiency. Breaking new ground in prior utilization, this thesis proposes a novel unsupervised LDCT iterative reconstruction algorithm based on dual denoising diffusion probabilistic models (DDPM), which leverages both normal-dose and low-dose priors. Specifically, the proposed method employs two DDPMs to learn the prior distributions from normal-dose and low-dose images, respectively, and incorporates them into a joint iterative reconstruction framework. To accelerate the reconstruction, partial diffusion sampling and single-pass deterministic reconstruction strategy are utilized in the proposed method, as well as the spaced OS-SART approaches. Experiments at different dose levels demonstrate the outstanding performance and fast speed of the proposed reconstruction algorithm. Through these innovations and contributions, this thesis addresses some significant challenges in current deep-learning-based unsupervised LDCT reconstruction methods, and proposes three novel unsupervised reconstruction algorithms. The proposed methods effectively improve the performance and efficiency of LDCT reconstruction under different unsupervised learning conditions, and provide some new perspectives and inspirations for future research."
OpenAlex,deep learning,From Sparse to Dense: Label-Efficient Weakly Supervised Segmentation for Images and Videos,Jian Wang,10.17638/03195330,2027-01-01,University of Liverpool,"Obtaining high-quality annotated data has become a primary bottleneck for training deep learning models, particularly for dense prediction tasks like semantic segmentation and video salient object segmentation. The demand for meticulous, pixel-level labeling makes fully-supervised approaches prohibitively expensive and limits their scalability. This thesis directly confronts this issue by proposing and systematically investigating a label-efficient ""sparse-to-dense'' paradigm. The core objective is to develop innovative frameworks that can learn from sparse, inexpensive weak supervision—such as image-level tags or scribbles—and intelligently propagate this minimal information to generate complete, pixel-accurate dense predictions. The major part of this thesis focuses on the ""sparse-to-dense'' challenge within Weakly Supervised Semantic Segmentation (WSSS) for images, where models learn from only image-level tags. Dominant approaches rely on Class Activation Maps (CAMs) as initial object seeds. However, CAMs inherently activate only the most discriminative object regions, leading to incomplete pseudo-labels. This gives rise to the central problem of activation densification: the critical process of expanding these sparse activations to cover the full extent of an object. Our research addresses this challenge through a progressive, multi-faceted strategy. Our exploration begins with a foundational framework (C3) designed to rectify the intrinsic flaws of initial CAMs. We propose a synergistic mutual calibration method. This method leverages the discrepancies between the two maps to generate local prototypes, which are simultaneously utilized to complete missing object parts and suppress background noise, yielding a significantly more accurate and complete initial seed. This foundational work immediately reveals the limitation of single-prototype instability and its inability to capture diverse features. Building on this foundation, we then develop architecture-specific strategies to address deeper limitations of the prototype-based approach. For Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) (C4), the use of a single prototype proves insufficient to capture significant intra-class variation. In response, we introduce an Optimal Transport (OT)-assisted framework that effectively mines multiple, diverse prototypes, thereby yielding more comprehensive activation maps. However, while C4 solves the intra-class diversity problem, the inherent local context constraint of the CNN architecture becomes the new bottleneck, fundamentally limiting the quality of globally-aware feature extraction needed for optimal multi-prototype assignment. This limitation necessitates a shift in architectural focus from CNNs to Vision Transformers. In the ViT architecture (C5), a new challenge arises where the token gap between the discriminative class token and varied patch tokens leads to incomplete activation. To bridge this gap, we leverage a tailored application of Optimal Transport, where the algorithm is tasked with learning a comprehensive proxy to ensure complete object activation. Despite these architectural advances (C3-C5), the overall WSSS performance hit a ceiling. This is fundamentally limited by the sparse supervision of class labels, which cannot provide precise boundary information. To break this ceiling, our WSSS exploration culminates in a universal enhancement strategy (C6) that transcends architecture-specific designs by leveraging Visual Foundation Models (VFMs). We resolve the conflict between the discriminative nature of initial CAMs and the VFM's need for holistic prompts. By modeling the CAM foreground as a graph and employing spectral analysis, our method intelligently selects a diverse set of prompt points that represent the overall structure of the foreground object. This guides the VFM to generate superior, boundary-aware supervision that can universally enhance any WSSS pipeline. Subsequently, the thesis extends the ""sparse-to-dense'' paradigm to the dynamic domain of video, addressing Weakly Supervised Video Salient Object Segmentation (WSVSOS) (C7) from sparse scribble annotations. In this specific context, the challenge evolves into spatio-temporal densification, which requires both full-object coverage within each frame and temporal consistency across the video sequences. To this end, we introduce the core CFMR framework, which utilizes Spatio-Temporal co-regulation. This framework is subsequently enhanced (CFMR+) by integrating the VFM guidance strategy from C6, which provides high-quality spatial priors essential for ensuring both high spatial detail and inter-frame consistency. By enforcing both intra-frame and cross-frame consistency between these two streams, our method effectively propagates the sparse initial signal to generate dense and temporally coherent saliency masks. In conclusion, this thesis presents a comprehensive and cohesive investigation into label-efficient segmentation tasks, offering a suite of innovative and effective strategies for the ""sparse-to-dense'' challenge. Our work establishes a progressive roadmap that systematically overcomes architectural and semantic limitations, culminating in highly robust and generalized densification pipelines. Our extensive experimental results on standard benchmarks validate the state-of-the-art performance of these methods, providing robust solutions to a long-standing problem in the computer vision field."

Abstract This Project develops an urban traffic intensity prediction system using deep learning techniques, with the aim of improving mobility decision-making. Unlike other platforms focused on visualizing the current state, the proposed solution seeks to anticipate future behaviors, and is positioned as an open, replicable alternative specifically oriented towards prediction. To achieve this, a modular architecture based on the Python language has been designed, capable of integrating multiple open data sources: historical traffic records, historical weather situation data, and spatial coordinates of measurement sensors. The system applies a process of cleaning, temporal interpolation, and variable transformation, including cyclic encoding of time and spatial conversion to UTM coordinates, allowing for precise fusion between geographical and meteorological data through techniques such as inverse distance weighting (IDW). The predictive model is based on an LSTM neural network, especially adapted for multivariate time sequences. It is trained using a sliding window strategy of 32 samples (7 hours and 45 minutes) to predict traffic intensity in the next interval. The system additionally incorporates an IterableDataset mechanism to handle large volumes of training data without compromising the stability of the environment. The obtained results show robust accuracy in validation scenarios, with acceptable prediction errors (MAE and RMSE). Furthermore, an interactive web interface has been developed, allowing for the local deployment of the system, with the capacity for real-time data ingestion and direct visualization of predictions. This work demonstrates the technical and operational feasibility of applying deep learning to urban traffic analysis and lays the groundwork for its future evolution towards more generalizable, robust, and useful systems in real smart city contexts."
OpenAlex,deep learning,A Novel Deep-Learning-Based Approach for Estimating High-Resolution InSAR Parameters,"Dell Amore, Luca; Carcereri, Daniel; Demir, Begüm; Rizzoli, Paola",,2026-06-01,elib (German Aerospace Center),"Nowadays, SAR Interferometry (InSAR) represents one of the most powerful tools to perform complex tasks, such as retrieving Earth’s surface topography and monitoring its deformations. However, denoising strategies are crucial for the generation of reliable and high-quality InSAR products. In this framework, we propose a complete and generalized theoretical and statistical model to physically describe and simulate a noise-free interferogram, together with its corresponding noisy version, starting from the knowledge of the InSAR acquisition geometry and of the underlying topography. A deep-learning-based model is then trained in a fully-supervised manner to estimate high-resolution InSAR parameters, i.e. coherence and interferometric phase, leveraging the proposed statistical model. In particular, an accurate assessment of the network’s estimation performance is conducted by comparing it to state-of-the-art denoising filters, such as Boxcar and Phi-Net and showing the added value of the proposed theoretical modifications to the state-of-the-art literature."

OpenAlex,deep learning,Assessing knowledge in policing,Tom Cockcroft; Jennifer Norman; Clare Rawdin,,2026-05-05,CLOK (University of Central Lancashire),"Assessment is one important component of effective learning design. The process of assessment can be explained as starting with an understanding of what a learner needs to know or be able to do by the end of the learning experience, what they have to do to achieve this and what method is best applied to ascertain if the learner has reached the required level (Cockcroft, 2023). Without assessment, educators and trainers would have limited awareness of the extent to which (if at all) they are cultivating learners’ knowledge, attitudes and skills, both as the learning proceeds (formative assessment) and at the end of learning (summative assessment). Traditionally, much police learning and associated assessment has been in-house / work-based. It has been delivered within local Learning and Development units, typically by former police officers (Stanko & Hohl, 2018) with portfolios predominantly used as the mode of assessment for practitioners. The embedding of a professionalisation agenda over the last decade, however, has led to a renewed focus on assessment for officers who have joined through the graduate entry routes (formally known as the Policing Education Qualifications Framework, PEQF; see Wood, 2018), and continue to join through the Police Constable Entry Pathways (PCEP). Framed by recent trends within police learning and specifically developments in the field of rape investigation, the aim of this chapter is twofold. Firstly, there is a focus on what the Soteria ‘deep dives’ revealed about the process of assessment. In this chapter the focus is focused on the the role of assessment within the portfolio-based Serious Sexual Assault Investigator’s Development Programme (SSAIDP). Secondly, an examination of what ‘best practice assessment’ might look like in the Rape and Serious Sexual Offending (RASSO) context"
