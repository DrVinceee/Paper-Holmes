PubMed,aortic stenosis,Sex differences in hemodynamics and remodeling patterns uncovered by automated Machine-Learning 3D echocardiography in aortic stenosis with preserved ejection fraction.,Andrea Barbieri; Vera Laus; Francesca Mantovani; Francesca Bursi; Niccolò Bonini; Silvia Bonatti; Benedetta Cherubini; Mattia Malaguti; Matteo Paolini; Marie-Annick Clavel; Giuseppe Boriani,10.1007/s10554-026-03637-5,2026-02-09,The international journal of cardiovascular imaging,"Women with aortic stenosis (AS) are underdiagnosed and undertreated compared to men and face a higher mortality risk despite similar symptoms and fewer comorbidities. Sex-specific differences in left ventricular (LV) remodeling may contribute to this disparity. We investigated whether a fully automated, machine-learning-based three-dimensional echocardiography (3DE) approach, the Dynamic Heart Model (DHM), improves the detection of these differences compared to conventional two-dimensional echocardiography (2DE). This study investigates sex-related differences in cardiac remodeling and hemodynamics in AS patients with a preserved ejection fraction (EF ≥ 50%), comparing results from 2D echocardiography (2DE) and 3D echocardiography (3DE) via the DHM. The study included 101 consecutive patients with AS (42% women) who were assessed with 2DE and DHM. Parameters such as LV volumes, mass (LVM), stroke volume (SV), and aortic valve area (AVA) were measured and indexed to body surface area (BSA). Sex-specific differences were analyzed, with a focus on identifying significant remodeling patterns. Women exhibited smaller LV end-diastolic volume (EDV) and end-systolic volume (ESV) by DHM compared to men (115 mL vs. 155 mL, p < 0.001; 51 mL vs. 66 mL, p < 0.001). Indexed EDV (EDVi) and ESV (ESVi) were also significantly lower in women (69 mL/m² vs. 84 mL/m², p < 0.001; 30 mL/m² vs. 34 mL/m², p = 0.002). LVM and indexed LV mass (LVMi) were significantly lower in women when measured by DHM (131 g vs. 163 g, p < 0.001; 75 g/m² vs. 89 g/m², p = 0.005), whereas 2DE did not reveal statistically significant differences. Women exhibited a more concentric LV geometry, as reflected by higher relative wall thickness than men (0.42 vs. 0.36; p = 0.04). Despite similar hemodynamic parameters, women had significantly smaller DHM-derived AVA (0.90 cm² vs. 1.20 cm², p < 0.001), correlating with reduced SV (64 mL vs. 90 mL, p < 0.001). This study highlights that significant sex-related differences in LV remodeling and AS severity are better captured by DHM than 2DE, emphasizing the importance of sex-specific considerations and accurate measurements in evaluating and managing AS."

PubMed,aortic stenosis,"PTFE Cuff Fenestration Reinforcement Demonstrates Low Endoleak Rates in PMEGs, Independent of Bridging Stent Type.",Jeremy D Darling; Camila R Guetter; Elisa Caron; Isa F van Galen; Jemin Park; Christina L Marcaccio; Patric Liang; Lars Stangenberg; Marc L Schermerhorn,10.1016/j.jvs.2026.01.036,2026-02-05,Journal of vascular surgery,"Both standard and low-profile endografts have been utilized for physician-modified endografts (PMEGs) to treat complex aortic aneurysms; however, recent data from a 2025 multi-institutional analysis suggest that low-profile devices are associated with type IIIc endoleak rates as high as 15% at 20-month follow-up. Early demonstrations of PMEG modifications, including fenestration reinforcement with PTFE cuffs, have proposed a possible remedy to these elevated endoleak rates. This analysis evaluates a single-center's experience with PTFE cuff reinforcement for PMEG fenestrations.
All PMEGs performed at our institution between 2016-2025 were retrospectively reviewed. Each PMEG included fenestrations that were individually reinforced with a PTFE cuff and an embolization coil, secured with a running locking Ethibond suture. Primary outcomes included target vessel-related (type Ic and IIIc) endoleaks and endoleak-related reintervention. Outcomes were analyzed on both per-patient and per-fenestration bases. Bridging stent type (iCAST versus VBX) was also evaluated as a potential modifier of outcomes, with secondary outcomes including stent patency and target vessel instability (TVI). Rates of endoleak at one month and beyond were reported using Kaplan-Meier estimates.
Overall, 229 PMEGs (100% low-profile; 861 PTFE cuffs) were included in our analysis with a median follow-up of 1.3 years. The median age was 76 years and patients were primarily white (89%) and male (72%). The majority of cases were done electively (82%) for juxtarenal aneurysms (65%). The median aneurysm diameter at time of repair was 62 mm, and 80% included >4 target vessel fenestrations. Through two years, 26% (N=42) of patients underwent an aneurysm- or PMEG-associated reintervention; of these, nearly half (N=21; 15% of all patients) were endoleak-related. The most common indication for endoleak-related reintervention was sac expansion from type II endoleaks (8.9%), Type Ic and IIIc endoleaks occurred in 2.2% and 1.1% of patients, respectively. Bridging stents included 358 iCAST and 489 VBX. Stent distribution differed significantly by vessel, yet no significant differences were observed in two-year patency (98% vs 99%), stent-related stenosis/occlusion (2.1% vs. 2.0%), or reintervention rates (1.0% vs 1.3%) (all P>.05). On a per-fenestration basis, type Ic and IIIc endoleaks occurred in 0.6% and 0.1% of fenestrations, respectively, with no difference based on stent type (iCAST: 0.7% vs. VBX: 0.8%; P=.23). Overall, freedom from target vessel instability at two years was >98% across all groups and vessels, without any difference in bridging stent type (98.3% vs. 98.6%; P=.82).
PMEG modification with individual fenestration reinforcement using a PTFE cuff and an embolization coil demonstrates effective fenestration sealing with notably low rates of target vessel-related endoleaks. Bridging stent choice does not appear to be a primary determinant of target vessel instability, endoleaks, or reinterventions, potentially underscoring the importance of fenestration modifications over stent platform differences. These findings suggest the value of utilizing this technique for PMEG customization in low-profile devices."
PubMed,aortic stenosis,Circulating biomarkers in serum from aortic valve stenosis patients predict sex-specific drug responses in valve myofibroblasts.,Brandon J Vogt; Megan Chavez; Nicole E Félix Vélez; Rayyan M Gorashi; Ryan R Reeves; Brian A Aguado,10.64898/2026.01.16.700010,2026-01-20,bioRxiv : the preprint server for biology,"Aortic valve stenosis (AVS) is a prevalent, sexually dimorphic cardiovascular disease characterized by fibro-calcification of the aortic valve leaflet. Sex differences in AVS arise in part from sexually dimorphic serum composition that differentially regulate valvular interstitial cell (VIC) myofibroblast activation. However, how individual serum factors contribute to sex-specific drug responses targeting VIC myofibroblast activation remains unknown. Here, we integrate serum proteomic profiling with in vitro drug screening using hydrogel biomaterials to identify sex-specific regulators of antifibrotic drug efficacy. We found that Insulin-like Growth Factor Binding Protein 2 (IGFBP2) serum levels are associated with resistance to the antifibrotic drug Evogliptin only in female VICs cultured with female AVS serum. This mechanism is driven by IGFBP2-mediated activation of Rho/ROCK and focal adhesion kinase signaling pathways that counteract Evogliptin treatment. Our findings reveal a sex-specific, serum-mediated mechanism of Evogliptin resistance and highlight IGFBP2 as a candidate biomarker for stratifying female AVS patients for Evogliptin treatment. More broadly, these findings underscore the importance of incorporating sex-stratified biomarker analyses into AVS therapeutic development to improve patient-specific treatment recommendations."

Aortic valvuloplasty (AVP) with pericardial patch has gained increasing attention, but its durability and clinical benefits remain uncertain.
We retrospectively analyzed pediatric patients (≤12 years) undergoing AVP with pericardial patch in our center between July 2017 and July 2025. Infants (<1 year) were analyzed separately as subgroups. Primary outcome was the change in aortic valve hemodynamics, including median peak gradient, median peak velocity, and degree of aortic regurgitation. Secondary outcomes included major complications, overall survival, and freedom from reoperation.
A total of 35 patients were included, with a median age of 2 years. Among them, 17 were infants, with a median age of 2 months. The median peak aortic valve gradient decreased from 67.0 mmHg to 33.0 mmHg (p < 0.001), and the median peak velocity decreased from 4.1 m/s to 2.9 m/s (p < 0.001), postoperatively. No new moderate or severe aortic regurgitation was observed early postoperatively, and preexisting lesions of this severity were resolved. There were no in-hospital deaths or severe complications. At four years, survival was 96% and freedom from reoperation 75.4% in the overall cohort; in infants, survival was 100% with 66.7% freedom from reoperation.
AVP with pericardium patch is a safe and effective procedure for congenital aortic stenosis and regurgitation in pediatric patients. It represents a promising surgical option for pediatric patients, including infants."

A 44-year-old male admitted to Taizhou Hospital of Zhejiang Province on December 29, 2018 was selected as the study subject. Whole-exome sequencing (WES) was carried out, and candidate variant was interpreted by following the guidelines from the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics (ACMG). For ALPK3 was considered an autosomal recessive gene, the WES results was considered insufficient to explain his phenotype. In April 2023, the proband's WES data were re-analyzed using updated annotation pipelines, and peripheral blood samples were collected from his first-degree relatives (mother and brother) for Sanger sequencing validation. Conservation analysis and protein structural modeling were performed to assess the impact of the variant. Clinical evaluation and genetic counseling were provided to the proband's family members. Relevant literature on ALPK3tv-induced HCM patients were searched in Wanfang Data Knowledge Service Platform, CNKI, and PubMed database using ""ALPK3"" and ""hypertrophic cardiomyopathy"" as keywords. Clinical characteristics of HCM patients with heterozygous ALPK3tv variants were summarized and compared with the clinical characteristics of HCM patients with positive sarcomere-associated gene variants (SARC+). This study was approved by the Medical Ethics Committee of Taizhou Hospital of Zhejiang Province Affiliated to Wenzhou Medical University (Ethics No.: K20230314).
The proband was a 44-year-old male who was transferred to our institution on December 29, 2018 due to ""chest tightness and pain for 6 months, exacerbated for 2 days"". Emergency coronary angiography was performed, which led to a preliminary diagnosis of ""acute coronary syndrome"", and the patient was admitted to the Cardiology Department for treatment. Based on electrocardiogram and echocardiogram findings, the diagnosis was revised as HCM. The patient's condition has stabilized post-coronary angiography, and he was discharged with improved condition. On January 2019, WES was conducted to determine the etiology of the proband's HCM. WES results identified a novel heterozygous c.2156dupC (p.Pro720ThrfsTer53) truncating variant in the ALPK3 gene. At that time, the inheritance pattern could not explain the phenotype. In 2022, a literature indicated that heterozygous ALPK3tv could lead to autosomal dominant HCM. Consequently, in April 2023, the proband's whole-exome data were re-annotated, revealing changes in the transcript and protein versions, with the updated site annotated as ALPK3 (NM_020778.5): c.1550dupC (p.Pro518ThrfsTer53). Sanger sequencing confirmed that the proband's mother and brother also carried this variant. The mother exhibited obstructive HCM, while the brother showed no related phenotype. Bioinformatics analysis demonstrated conservation of this site across multiple species, and the variant has resulted in the loss of a protein domain. Based on ACMG guidelines, the variant was classified as likely pathogenic. Literature review and Bayesian calculation further elevated the pathogenicity rating, indicating that this variant was the cause of HCM in the patient. Literature study revealed distinctions between HCM caused by this variant type and SARC+ HCM. The age of onset among heterozygous ALPK3tv patients was delayed by approximately 10 years compared to SARC+ patients. Both forms of HCM exhibited a male predominance, which was particularly marked in individuals with ALPK3tv. Electrocardiographic left ventricular hypertrophy was more prevalent in heterozygous ALPK3tv patients than in SARC+ patients. The incidence of apical or concentric hypertrophy patterns was higher in heterozygous ALPK3tv patients compared to asymmetric septal hypertrophy, which predominated in SARC+ patients. ALPK3tv patients exhibited lower penetrance and later onset compared to SARC+ patients. A positive correlation between left ventricular wall thickness and age was noted in female patients only.
In this pedigree, the proband has presented with HCM, characterized by echocardiographic evidence of apical left ventricular hypertrophy without significant outflow tract obstruction or extracardiac phenotypes. Although his mother and brother had carried the same heterozygous ALPK3 (NM_020778.5) c.1550dupC (p.Pro518ThrfsTer53), the mother exhibited severe obstructive HCM, while the brother was asymptomatic, suggesting incomplete or age-dependent penetrance within the family. This study has enriched the evidence for the pathogenicity of ALPK3tv among Chinese HCM pedigrees and underscored the importance of periodic literature reviews and genetic re-analysis for unresolved genetic testing results."
PubMed,aortic stenosis,Diagnostic performance of aortic valve calcium scoring for severe aortic stenosis in patients with chronic kidney disease.,Hesham Sheashaa; Juan M Farina; Isabel G Scalia; Kamal Awad; Mohammed Tiseer Abbas; Milagros Pereyra; Sherif Ahmed; Fatmaelzahraa Abdelfattah; Mahshad Razaghi; Abdelrahman Hafez; Ramzi Ibrahim; Said Alsidawi; Steven J Lester; David Fortuin; John Sweeney; Kristen Sell-Dottin; Chadi Ayoub; Reza Arsanjani,10.1016/j.ijcard.2026.134217,2026-02-03,International journal of cardiology,"Aortic valve calcium scoring (AVCS) via noncontrast Computed Tomography (CT) has emerged as a valuable adjunct to echocardiography in diagnosing aortic stenosis (AS). However, its diagnostic accuracy in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) -a population characterized by extensive extra-valvular calcification- remains unclear.
This retrospective multicenter study included 2909 adults who underwent AVCS and echocardiography between 2015 and 2025 across Mayo Clinic sites. Patients were stratified by glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) to assess AVCS diagnostic performance for severe AS in CKD vs non-CKD cohorts. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves, stratified by sex and eGFR categories, were used to evaluate diagnostic accuracy. Optimal thresholds were derived using Youden's index and compared with guideline-recommended cutoffs.
AVCS demonstrated high diagnostic accuracy in patients with preserved renal function (AUC 0.861), but performance declined with worsening CKD. AUC dropped to 0.791 (eGFR <60), 0.727 (eGFR <45), and 0.691 (eGFR <30). Specificity declined significantly across worsening eGFR, despite stable sensitivity. Sex-stratified analysis revealed similar results.
AVCS remains a reliable tool to rule out severe AS in patients with CKD, but declining specificity with worsening kidney function -likely due to nonvalvular calcification- highlights the risk of false positives. In CKD populations, AVCS thresholds should be interpreted cautiously and integrated with multimodal evaluation and clinical data."

This study aimed to examine perioperative changes in frailty among nonagenarian patients undergoing TAVI.
In this single-center observational analysis, 38 consecutive nonagenarian patients (7.3% of 523 TAVI cases) were evaluated. Frailty parameters-including grip strength, cognitive function (MMSE), overall physical performance (SPPB), gait speed, and activities of daily living (Katz index)-were measured before and after the procedure. No significant differences were observed between preoperative and postoperative values for grip strength (17.4 ± 7.1 vs. 16.1 ± 7.4 kgf, p = 0.102), MMSE (24.1 ± 3.9 vs. 24.3 ± 4.6, p = 0.923), or overall SPPB scores (8.7 ± 2.8 vs. 7.5 ± 3.0, p = 0.084). In contrast, gait speed decreased significantly from 0.8 ± 0.3 m/s to 0.7 ± 0.3 m/s (p = 0.001), and the Katz index also showed a small but statistically significant decline (p = 0.042). The proportion of patients with a walking speed below 0.9 m/s did not change significantly (67.6% vs. 83.8%, p = 0.146).
In a carefully selected nonagenarian cohort, TAVI did not substantially worsen most frailty indices. However, mild in-hospital declines in gait speed and ADL were observed, underscoring the importance of structured early rehabilitation strategies."

Surgical aortic valve replacement (SAVR) and transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) are established treatment options. Neurological complications such as subclinical cerebral ischemia, delirium, and postoperative cognitive decline can occur during either treatment; however, precise data on neurological impairment remain scarce.
The aim of this study was to compare neurological outcomes of patients undergoing TAVI or SAVR.
COSTA (Cognitive Outcome after Surgical and Transcatheter Aortic valve replacement) is a single-center sub-study of the randomized DEDICATE trial (clinicaltrials.gov ID: NCT04535076). Neurocognitive tests (memory, attention, language, executive functions), questionnaires on neuropsychology (cognitive failures questionnaire [CFQ], hospital anxiety, and depression scale [HADS]), and health-related quality of life (SF-36) were used before intervention and 3 months thereafter. Cranial magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was carried out post-intervention. In addition, there was a systematic assessment of delirium during the hospital stay.
The study cohort (mean age 71.8 years, 32% female) consisted of SAVR (n = 13) and TAVI (n = 18) patients. In the SAVR group, subsyndromal delirium was more common (54 vs. 11%, p = 0.017; OR = 8.58), visual recognition ability was worse (mean difference (MD) =  - 0.6 vs. + 0.3, p = 0.036, η2 = 0.14), and emotional impairment was numerically more declined (MD =  - 36.8 vs. - 4.7, p = 0.058, η2 = 0.12) when compared to the TAVI group.
In this small, exploratory sample, SAVR showed a trend toward less favorable neuropsychological outcomes compared with TAVI in patients with low-to-intermediate surgical risk.

While fibroblast activation in HCM has been noted in previous studies, the underlying regulatory mechanisms have not been thoroughly explored. In this study, we analyzed the latest single-nucleus sequencing (snRNA-seq) datasets related to HCM caused by the two most common mutations. We also examined the largest existing snRNA-seq and spatial transcriptomics datasets of HCM for external validation. Additionally, we conducted preliminary histopathological and molecular biology experiments to validate our findings and explore potential mechanisms. Our analysis revealed a phenotypic transformation of macrophages in both cases of HCM. These pro-inflammatory macrophages, driven by the high expression of ENPP2, mediated intercellular interactions that influenced fibroblast activation. The resulting increase in lysophosphatidic acid appeared to act as a plausible intermediary. Activated fibroblasts secreted substantial amounts of COL14A1, which is a critical component of myocardial fibrosis. These findings were consistent across different genetic backgrounds, suggesting their universal applicability in most HCM cases. Our study provides valuable insights into the mechanisms underlying myocardial fibrosis in HCM, highlighting the role of macrophage transformation and fibroblast activation. These findings offer potential for the identification of novel diagnostic or prognostic biomarkers and the development of targeted therapies with clinical translational potential."

Body mass index and indexed effective orifice area were calculated. The severity of PPM was assessed using the valve academic research consortium-3 criteria, and patients were categorized into (1) Insignificant PPM and (2) Significant PPM. Left ventricular geometries were classified based on the left ventricular mass index (LVMi) and relative wall thickness. Functional capacity was evaluated according to the New York Heart Association classification.
The mean age of the 91 patients who met the selection criteria was 64.2±8.9 years, and 44% were female and 56% were male. Sixteen patients (17.6%) were assigned to the significant PPM group. The median change in LVMi was -33 g/m2 in the insignificant PPM group and -14.5 g/m2 in the significant PPM group (p=0.037). Multivariate logistic regression demonstrated a significant association between LVMi change and significant PPM (odds ratio: 1.021, p=0.043). Although no significant change was observed in left ventricular geometry in either the groups, a significant difference was noted in the functional capacity changes (p=0.01).
Avoiding significant PPM provides better regression in LVMi and greater improvement in functional capacity; however, it is not sufficient for a significant change in left ventricular geometr y."

In the HFpEF model, EF1 significantly decreased at week 2 (19.1 ± 1.1 vs 25.8 ± 1.0%, p<0.001) compared to controls, while EF, GLS, and LSR were unaltered. At week 3, EF1 decreased further (18.1 ± 0.7%) alongside a significant reduction in GLS (p<0.01), while EF and LSR remained unchanged. IVRT increased early in the HFpEF model, followed by later left atrial (LA) enlargement. EF1, an early marker of systolic impairment, decreases early in HFpEF and afterload-induced dysfunction, accompanied by IVRT prolongation. LA dilatation appears later. These findings highlight the interplay between systolic and diastolic dysfunction in HFpEF progression."

However, data on the sex-related impact on bioprosthetic valve durability and very long-term clinical outcomes remain scarce. This study aimed to assess 10-year survival, prognosis, and valve performance in males and females undergoing TAVR with self-expanding bio-prostheses (CoreValve/Evolut R).
Consecutive patients with severe symptomatic aortic stenosis treated with TAVR between 2007 and 2014 at ten Italian centers were prospectively included in the Medtronic One Hospital Clinical Service (OHCS) database and included in the present analysis. The overall population was classified according to sex. The primary endpoint was a composite of all-cause mortality, heart failure rehospitalization, or stroke at 10 years. Secondary endpoints included the single components of the primary endpoint, cardiovascular death, and valve performance.
Among 1944 patients included in the analysis, 54.9% (n = 1068) were female. Compared to males, females were older and exhibited a higher baseline risk profile, characterized by more advanced renal disease and higher transvalvular gradients, yet they more frequently had preserved left ventricular ejection fraction and a lower prevalence of prior cardiovascular events. At 10 years, the primary endpoint occurred significantly more often in male patients, a finding that persisted after adjustment for relevant confounders (adjusted HR 1.15; p = 0.028) and was primarily driven by all-cause mortality. Structural valve deterioration, bioprosthetic valve failure, and valve performance were comparable between sexes at the 10-year follow-up.
Despite older age and increased procedural risk, female patients demonstrated more favorable long-term survival and similar valve durability compared to males over 10 years following TAVR with first-generation CoreValve/Evolut R prostheses. These findings underscore the long-term reliability of self-expanding valves and highlight the need for individualized, sex-specific strategies in TAVR patient selection and management."

Key evidence-based elements include early referral to the multidisciplinary Heart Valve Team, streamlined evaluation, upstream testing, prompt aortic valve replacement in many asymptomatic patients, more urgent treatment for symptomatic patients, and structured surveillance involving close working relationships between the referring clinician and Heart Valve Team when intervention is deferred.

PubMed,aortic stenosis,Histological investigation of persistent fifth aortic arch with arch obstruction in a neonate.,Seiji Asagai; Takeshi Shinkawa; Saeko Yoshizawa; Kei Inai,10.1016/j.jccase.2025.04.009,2025-08,Journal of cardiology cases,"Persistent fifth aortic arch (PFAA) is a rare congenital heart disease caused by maldevelopment of the primitive aortic arch and can cause obstruction of the aortic arch. The histological structure of a fifth aortic arch differs from that of normal aortic arches. Therefore, it is unclear whether the tissue of a fifth aortic arch can be safely utilized to reconstruct the aortic arch during surgical repair of arch obstruction. We herein report the case of a neonate who underwent surgical repair of a PFAA with interrupted aortic arch, right aortic arch, and aberrant left subclavian artery. Similar to those for a ductus arteriosus, the histological findings of the resected PFAA in this case showed intimal thickening, myxoid deposition in the intima and media, and proliferation and migration of smooth muscle cells into the intima. When reconstructing the aortic arch, we suggest that, if possible, the fifth aortic arch tissue be resected.
The histological findings of a persistent fifth aortic arch (PFAA) are important in determining the treatment strategy because the tissue may be unsuitable for reconstruction of the aortic arch. In the present case, the tissue of the PFAA was histologically similar to that of a ductus arteriosus and thus may have caused re-stenosis or formation of an aneurysm in the future. We therefore recommend resecting the PFAA tissue during aortic arch reconstruction."

Case Summary                     A middle-aged man with a history of intravenous drug use (IVDU) presented with fever, new apical systolic murmur, and widespread embolic phenomena affecting brain, spleen, kidneys, and lower limb. Transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) revealed a large posterior mitral leaflet vegetation with moderate-severe mitral regurgitation (MR). Blood and tissue cultures were negative. Next-generation sequencing (NGS) of an aspirated calf muscle abscess identified Rothia dentocariosa. Despite prolonged antimicrobial therapy and multidisciplinary care, persistent vegetations and high embolic risk prompted mitral valve replacement after interval stabilization of intracranial hemorrhages. He recovered without recurrent emboli and with stable prosthetic valve function.                                                           Conclusion                     Advanced molecular diagnostics like NGS can be crucial for identifying pathogens in culture-negative endocarditis. Multidisciplinary collaboration and individualized surgical timing are important for achieving optimal outcomes in complex cases with neurological complications."

This study examined the association between menopausal age, arrhythmic risk, and cardiovascular outcomes in women with MVP.                                                           Methods                     We included 299 female patients with MVP (mean age 58 ± 17 years) and clinical, echocardiographic, and ECG data. Menopausal status was classified as premature (&lt;40 years), early (40-45 years), expected age (45-55 years), undetermined age, or pre/perimenopausal. Arrhythmic MVP was defined by a composite of SCD or arrest, ventricular fibrillation (VF)/tachycardia, or frequent ventricular ectopy.

Results                                            Among postmenopausal women (69.2%), 3.8% had premature, 6.2% early, 49.5% expected-age, and 18.4% undetermined-age menopause. Menopausal hormone therapy (MHT) use was reported in 16.4% of postmenopausal women. There was a higher prevalence of arrhythmic MVP among women with premature-early menopause (52%) compared to other groups (                       P                        = .01). After multivariable adjustment, premature-early menopause remained significantly associated with an increased arrhythmic risk (OR, 3.97; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.33-11.8). During a mean follow-up of 4.7 ± 3.1 years, 53 composite events occurred. Premature-early menopause without MHT was associated with an increased risk of the composite of cardiovascular events (HR, 4.10; 95% CI, 1.41-11.9).

This study aimed to develop a mitral annuloplasty ring using decellularised tissue and evaluate its ability to suppress regurgitation in a degenerative mitral regurgitation (DMR) model.                                                           METHODS                     A 4 mm diameter annuloplasty ring was created using decellularized bovine tendon. Porcine mitral valve complexes (including the annulus, leaflets, chordae tendineae, and papillary muscles) were obtained from a slaughterhouse. The annulus was enlarged by 4 mm, and the two chordae tendineae of the posterior leaflet (P2) were severed. The DMR model, integrated into a pulsatile flow simulator, was repaired using a commercial—Physio II, Colvin-Galloway (CG) Future, Tailor band, and a decellularised tendon-based ring. Regurgitation control and effective mitral valve area (MVA) were compared (n = 6 for each group).                                                           RESULTS                     The regurgitation rate of the DMR model was 52.3 ± 3.4%, consistent with severe MR. Post-MVr with each ring, the regurgitation rates were 14.9 ± 3.1% (Physio II), 14.5 ± 1.1% (CG Future), 16.4 ± 1.7% (Tailor band), and 15.5 ± 3.0% (decellularised tendon-based biological ring). All of these rates were significantly reduced, with no significant differences among them. Effective MVA was comparable across groups: 2.46 ± 0.28 cm2 (Physio II), 2.33 ± 0.54 cm2 (CG Future), 2.28 ± 0.12 cm2 (Tailor band), and 2.27 ± 0.53 cm2 (decellularised tendon-based biological ring).

With a focus on the prevalent psychological complications following the onset of this condition, this study aimed to explore the correlation between antenatal depression and Corona disease anxiety, personality traits, and postpartum depression during the COVID-19 pandemic.                                                           Materials and Methods:                     This cross-sectional descriptive-analytical study investigated women receiving care at health centers affiliated with Kerman University of Medical Sciences during the last month of their pregnancy and the postpartum period in 2022. Following the acquisition of informed consent, participants were assessed using various measures, including demographic and obstetric information, the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale, the Corona Disease Anxiety Scale (CDAS), and the NEO Personality Inventory-Revised during their third trimester of pregnancy. The same group of participants completed the Edinburgh Depression Scale and the Corona Disease Anxiety Scale (CDAS) 4-6 weeks after childbirth.                                                           Results and Discussion:                     There was a significant correlation between family income, unwanted pregnancy as perceived by both the mother and father, and antenatal depression. Additionally, marital satisfaction played a significant role in postpartum depression. Furthermore, antenatal depression was significantly associated with neuroticism, agreeableness, and physical symptoms related to Corona disease anxiety. Personality traits, with the exception of extroversion and conscientiousness, and various domains of Corona disease anxiety, excluding psychological symptoms, were also significantly associated with postpartum depression.                                                           Conclusion:                     During pandemics or epidemics, such as the COVID-19 outbreak, experiencing mental distress during pregnancy can contribute to mental health issues during the postpartum period. This risk is particularly true in individuals with unique personality traits, emphasizing the need for increased focus on mental health within prenatal care during these crises."

Method:                     This cross-sectional study was conducted in Kerman, Iran. Data were collected from patients who visited Afzalipour Hospital in Kerman more than twice during the COVID-19 epidemic from the end of February 2020 to March 21, 2021. We conducted two key analyses: 1. Mixed effect logistic regression was used to check the relationship between the variables and COVID-19 severity. 2. Mixed effect linear regression was used to check the relationship between the variables and the length of stay in the hospital.                                                           Results:                     The findings indicated that the most important risk factors for the severity of COVID-19 were heart diseases (OR=1.67,95%CI:1.20-2.30), increasing age (OR=2.23 for age&gt;54, 95%CI:1.70- 2.90), male gender (OR=1.47,95%CI:1.10-1.96), respiratory diseases other than asthma, and frequency of admission (OR=1.60,95%CI:1.20-2.15). All patients who underwent readmission experienced a shorter duration of hospitalization during their subsequent admission (OR=0.94,95%CI:0.91,0.96) and had a higher mortality rate (30% within 14 days, 26.6% between 14-90 days). Patients readmitted at intervals of 14-90 days and greater than 90 days exhibited lower disease severity compared to those readmitted within the 0-14 day period.                                                           Conclusion:                     Examining readmissions, the severity of COVID-19, and the length of hospital stay in affected patients are important factors for planning and allocating resources for COVID-19 management and treatment. These factors can help policymakers develop effective clinical guidelines for hospitalization or outpatient treatment of COVID-19 patients and contribute to reducing the burden of disease in the community."

Kinovea, as an accessible motion-analysis software, provides both visual and quantitative feedback. However, its application in supporting technique development among beginner athletes remains insufficiently explored. Aim: This study aims to describe the use of Kinovea in biomechanics training and examine its contribution to the awareness of kinematic characteristics and movement techniques among beginner athletes. Methods: A descriptive qualitative design involved 72 beginner athletes aged 18–25 years selected through purposive sampling. Data were collected over 16 weeks through interviews, field observations, and motion video recordings analyzed using Kinovea. Kinematic data focused on joint angles, stride behavior, and movement phases during walking, running, and the flight phase. Qualitative data were analyzed using content analysis with NVivo 12, while kinematic results were interpreted descriptively to identify performance patterns and areas for technical refinement. Result: Kinematic analysis showed coordinated joint-angle patterns across all phases. Walking analysis identified arm swing angles of 50.9°–58.8° and leg separation angles of 64.3°–67.2°, indicating a stable gait rhythm. The running analysis revealed knee angles of 68.8°–69.8° and elbow angles of 87.6°–89.1°, indicating efficient propulsive mechanics. The flight phase demonstrated knee angles of 81.2°–87.8° and elbow angles of 80.4°–88.3°, suggesting effective momentum use and postural stability. These measurements supported stride-efficiency assessment and technique evaluation. Qualitative findings revealed that Kinovea enabled athletes to interpret movement phases and identify technical inefficiencies through slow-motion and frame-by-frame visualization. Conclusion: Kinovea supports basic motion analysis by providing clear kinematic information and helping beginner athletes observe and refine their movement techniques. The findings also offer practical value for coaches by enabling more precise identification of inefficient patterns and guiding targeted corrections during early-stage training."

Sievert; Jacob Zeitani,10.36922/bh025510076,2026-02-05,Brain & Heart,"Cardioembolic stroke remains one of the most severe manifestations of cardiovascular disease, with atrial fibrillation (AF) responsible for a large proportion of ischemic cerebrovascular events. Stroke prevention strategies are currently dominated by oral anticoagulation guided by CHA2DS2-VASc scores, which emphasize age and comorbidities and therefore have limited applicability in younger patients with low conventional risk profiles. Although bleeding risk is routinely assessed using tools such as HAS-BLED, lifelong anticoagulation may still confer a substantial cumulative hemorrhagic burden over decades of treatment. The left atrial appendage (LAA) represents the primary anatomical source of thromboembolism in AF, yet current guidelines largely restrict surgical or percutaneous LAA exclusion to patients with AF who have contraindications to anticoagulation, reflecting a predominantly reactive approach. This Perspective advocates reconsideration of prophylactic surgical LAA exclusion at the time of open mitral valve repair in younger patients. Although early mitral repair limits atrial remodeling, it does not abolish lifetime AF risk, and post-operative or late-onset AF remains frequent. Moreover, residual or recurrent mitral regurgitation promotes progressive atrial dilation and fibrosis, increasing long-term thromboembolic risk even in patients initially in sinus rhythm. By integrating atrial remodeling, LAA morphology and function, residual mitral pathology, and the limitations of lifelong anticoagulation, a selective preventive framework emerges. An anatomical brain-heart prevention strategy may reduce lifetime cerebrovascular risk and improve long-term outcomes. While prospective data are needed, existing evidence supports individualized discussion of prophylactic LAA exclusion during mitral valve repair in selected young patients with structural atrial disease."

However, data on the long-term prognostic impact of MR and its progression or regression over time remain limited, particularly across individual HCM subtypes. METHODS: Patients with HCM were retrospectively included from a Japanese multicenter registry and compared by MR severity (moderate or greater versus mild or less) within each subtype: hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy (HOCM), end-stage HCM (ES-HCM), and other HCM (including nonobstructive, midventricular obstruction, and apical HCM). RESULTS: Among 3602 patients (HOCM: n=837; ES-HCM: n=275; other HCM: n=2490), the prevalence of moderate or greater MR was highest in HOCM (36.3%), followed by ES-HCM (21.5%) and other HCM (8.5%). During a median follow-up of 5.3 (interquartile range, 2.1–9.3) years, the cumulative 5-year incidence of all-cause death or heart failure hospitalization was not significantly different between the moderate or greater MR and mild or less MR groups in HOCM (14.6% versus 12.4%; P =0.35) or ES-HCM (60.7% versus 54.7%; P =0.84). After adjustment for clinical covariates, no significant association was observed in either subtype (HOCM: hazard ratio, 1.13 [95% CI, 0.79–1.60], P =0.51; ES-HCM: hazard ratio, 0.84 [95% CI, 0.55–1.28], P =0.42). In contrast, in other HCM, moderate or greater MR was significantly associated with the higher 5-year cumulative incidence of all-cause death or heart failure hospitalization (34.2% versus 13.9%, P &lt;0.001), which remained significant after adjustment, with a significant interaction (hazard ratio, 1.45 [95% CI, 1.09–1.91], P =0.01; P interaction =0.02). MR severity improved over time in HOCM, showed no clear change in ES-HCM, and worsened in other HCM ( P &lt;0.001, 0.46, and &lt;0.001, respectively; P interaction &lt;0.001). CONCLUSIONS: In patients with HCM, moderate or greater MR was not associated with worse outcomes in HOCM or ES-HCM, but had significant prognostic implications in other HCM subtypes, suggesting the need for HCM subtype-specific MR management."

However, primary (degenerative) and secondary (functional) MR represent distinct disease entities, characterized by different pathophysiological mechanisms, clinical trajectories, and determinants of benefit. This review aims to provide an interventional cardiology-oriented synthesis of TEER, emphasizing the fundamental differences between primary and secondary MR and their i for patient selection, procedural strategy, and outcome interpretation. Methods: A targeted literature search was performed in PubMed and Embase to identify pivotal randomized trials, registries, guideline documents, and high-quality reviews addressing TEER in MR. The available evidence was synthesized narratively, with a focus on mechanistic insights, TEER-specific imaging and procedural endpoints, and clinically relevant outcomes.Results: In primary MR, TEER functions as a valve-centered therapy, with procedural success primarily determined by anatomical suitability and the balance between durable MR reduction and avoidance of elevated transmitral gradients. In secondary MR, TEER should be considered an adjunctive intervention within a comprehensive heart failure strategy, with benefit dependent on patient phenotype, myocardial substrate, optimization of background therapy, and appropriate timing. Emerging phenotypes, such as atrial functional MR, further challenge traditional classification and highlight the need for mechanism-based selection. Across MR subtypes, residual MR and transmitral gradients emerge as key post-procedural endpoints with differential prognostic implications. Conclusions: TEER represents a phenotype-specific intervention rather than a uniform solution for MR. Recognizing the distinct interventional paradigms of primary and secondary MR is essential to optimize patient selection, procedural decision-making, and clinical outcomes."

Wang; Bin Zhou,10.3389/fcvm.2026.1773671,2026-02-04,Frontiers in Cardiovascular Medicine,"The mitral valve apparatus comprises the annulus, valve leaflets, chordae tendineae, and papillary muscles, forming an integrated biomechanical unit essential for unidirectional blood flow. The leaflets and chordae are primarily derived from endocardial cells, and damage to these structures results in either mitral stenosis or mitral regurgitation, depending on the underlying pathology. This review compares three major mitral valve diseases, rheumatic mitral stenosis, congenital mitral stenosis, and myxomatous mitral valve prolapse, to highlight their distinct etiologies, molecular mechanisms, and structural endpoints. Rheumatic mitral stenosis is an acquired immune-mediated disease triggered by Group A streptococcal infection, in which molecular mimicry leads to autoantibody formation and chronic inflammation. Immune-cell infiltration and cytokine release drive the progression of leaflet fibrosis, commissural fusion, calcification, and pronounced chordal shortening, ultimately culminating in fixed obstruction. Large-scale genetic studies have not identified strong causal genes, instead revealing associations with immune-related risk loci, while valve-specific epigenetic mechanisms are poorly explored. Congenital mitral stenosis arises from developmental abnormalities of the mitral valve complex during embryogenesis and is classified into four anatomical subtypes. Due to its low incidence, the condition remains the least studied at the molecular and genetic levels. In contrast, myxomatous mitral valve prolapse is a degenerative, polygenic disorder driven by aberrant TGF β -dependent endothelial-to-mesenchymal transformation, valve interstitial cell activation, and extracellular matrix remodeling. Genetic studies have identified multiple causal genes, including FLNA , DCHS1 , DZIP1 , and TNS1 , underscoring its mechano-genetic origin. Despite their distinct causes, immune-mediated, developmental, and degenerative/genetic, all three diseases converge on progressive structural failure of the MV apparatus. Notably, pathological remodeling of the chordae plays a decisive role in disease progression and the need for surgical intervention. A deeper understanding of both shared and disease-specific mechanisms, particularly valve- and chordae-specific molecular regulation, is essential to advance translational research in mitral valve disease."

OpenAlex,mitral regurgitation,Clinical outcomes and management strategies for moderate aortic regurgitation in patients undergoing rheumatic mitral valve surgery,Chuang Liu; Zhou Liu; Jia-Jun Liang; Songhao Jia; Mingxuan Zhang; Peiyi Liu; Mao-zhou Wang; Xiao-long Wang; Hong-jia Zhang; Wen-jian Jiang,10.1038/s41598-026-37045-5,2026-02-03,Scientific Reports,"Additional exploration is required to determine how to treat patients with moderate aortic regurgitation (AR) in rheumatic mitral valve (MV) surgery. This study compared clinical outcomes in patients undergoing non-surgical treatment (NT) of aortic valve (AV), aortic valvuloplasty (AVP), and aortic valve replacement (AVR). This multicenter, retrospective observational cohort study included 338 moderate AR patients undergoing rheumatic MV surgery from January 2015 to January 2024. We followed up with patients for a median of 43.4 months. Furthermore, more-than-mild aortic valve dysfunction (AVD) in the follow-up period was our primary outcome. Our secondary outcomes were all-cause mortality and cardiac valve reoperation before discharge and during follow-up. We classified patients into three groups, namely, NT (n = 128), AVP (n = 91), and AVR (n = 119) groups, respectively. Moreover, 33.0%, 30.1%, and 3.9% of patients achieved our primary outcome, while 4.2%, 5.6%, and 9.6% of them attained our secondary outcomes in the three groups, respectively. We observed that fewer patients from the AVR group had achieved the primary outcome than those in the NT [adjusted relative risk (RR), 0.41; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.21-0.68; p = 0.002] and AVP groups (adjusted RR, 0.14; 95% CI, 0.04-0.43; p = 0.002), respectively. The secondary outcomes did not significantly differ among the three groups. Without increasing surgical risks, the concurrent AVR significantly improves AV status in moderate AR patients undergoing rheumatic MV surgery throughout follow-up. None or mild AVD was observed in many patients from the NT group during the follow-up, thereby warranting the delay of surgery for AV."
OpenAlex,mitral regurgitation,Outcome of del Nido versus St. Thomas cardioplegia solution in adult mitral valve replacement surgery for rheumatic mitral valve disease,Akash Shah; Anil Jain; Himani Pandya; Ronak Raval,10.1177/02676591261423026,2026-02-03,Perfusion,"Background Effective myocardial protection is essential for successful outcomes in open-heart surgery. Although both del Nido and St. Thomas cardioplegia solutions are widely used, comparative evidence in adult rheumatic mitral valve replacement remains limited. This study aimed to compare their myocardial protective efficacy and clinical outcomes. Methods A prospective comparative study was conducted between May 2022 and October 2024. Total 50 adult patients undergoing mitral valve replacement—20 with severe mitral regurgitation (MR) and 30 with severe mitral stenosis (MS) were included. Patients were divided into two groups based on cardioplegia type (del Nido or St. Thomas). Intraoperative parameters, postoperative left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF), troponin I levels, inotropic and ventilatory support, and ICU/hospital stay were analysed. Results Baseline characteristics were comparable across groups. The mean number of cardioplegia doses was significantly lower in the del Nido group (1.6 ± 0.5 vs 3.2 ± 0.8; p &lt; 0.001). Postoperative LVEF was better preserved with del Nido cardioplegia (MS: 53.3 ± 7.2% vs 45.3 ± 10.6%; p = 0.023). Troponin I levels at 6, 24, and 48 h were lower in the del Nido group, though not statistically significant. Patients receiving del Nido required less inotropic and ventilatory support, with shorter ICU and hospital stays. One in-hospital death occurred in the del Nido group due to sepsis. Conclusion Del Nido cardioplegia offers comparable or superior myocardial protection to St. Thomas solution in adult mitral valve replacement, with fewer interruptions, reduced dosing, and faster postoperative recovery."

The 2019 classification distinguishes TRALI type I [no acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) risk factors] from type II (pre-existing or concurrent ARDS risk factors). We describe a case of TRALI type II after red blood cell (RBC) transfusion in a patient with cancer, sepsis, and suspected endocarditis. A 64-year-old woman with metastatic breast cancer on doxorubicin was hospitalized for fever and acute kidney injury. Echocardiography revealed a mobile mass on the posterior mitral leaflet with severe mitral regurgitation, and she was treated with ceftaroline and daptomycin. On hospital day 20, she received an RBC transfusion for anemia (hemoglobin 6.2 g/dL). Five hours later, she developed sudden hypoxemic respiratory failure with new bilateral infiltrates consistent with pulmonary edema, without fluid overload or cardiac decompensation. Despite non-invasive ventilation, she deteriorated and died. TRALI type II was considered the most likely diagnosis, underscoring the need for vigilance."

Catheter looping and knot formation are rare but potentially hazardous complications. Case summary An 82-year-old woman with permanent atrial fibrillation and severe mitral and tricuspid valve regurgitation presented with complete atrioventricular block and a ventricular escape rhythm at 28 bpm. A temporary transvenous pacing catheter inserted via the right internal jugular vein failed to achieve consistent ventricular capture and became entrapped at 45 cm, forming a knot near the venous introducer. Given the patient's frailty and high surgical risk, a multidisciplinary team opted for a fully percutaneous strategy for removal. After definitive pacemaker implantation, the knotted catheter was successfully retrieved using a stepwise approach: engagement of the loop with a deflectable ablation catheter, externalization through a femoral sheath, and extraction using a 13-F dilator sheath to minimize venous trauma. Discussion This case highlights procedural pitfalls during emergency temporary pacing without fluoroscopy and illustrates a safe, creative percutaneous solution for knot retrieval using tools familiar to electrophysiology and lead extraction operators."
OpenAlex,mitral regurgitation,Left atrial reservoir strain by speckle-tracking echocardiography predicts prognosis in secondary mitral valve insufficiency,Ricardo Micael Mendes Morais Carvalheiro; Miguel Marques Antunes; Vera Vaz Ferreira; Ana Leal; F Gameiro; Isabel Cardoso; J Viegas; T Mano; Pedro Rio; S Aguiar Rosa; Ana Teresa Timóteo; Ana Galrinho; Rui Cruz Ferreira,10.1007/s12471-026-02022-0,2026-02-02,Netherlands Heart Journal,"Abstract Background Functional mitral regurgitation (FMR) contributes significantly to morbidity and mortality and may result from left ventricular (VFMR) or atrial (AFMR) remodelling. Left atrial reservoir strain (LASR) is a sensitive marker of atrial dysfunction and may offer incremental prognostic value. This study evaluated whether LASR predicts all-cause mortality and heart failure (HF) hospitalizations in FMR, its performance in VFMR versus AFMR, and its utility over standard echocardiographic parameters. Methods We retrospectively analyzed 102 patients (mean age 68 ± 14 years, 41.2% female) with at least moderate FMR who underwent transesophageal echocardiography between 2018 and 2023. Patients were categorized into VFMR (LV dysfunction or remodelling) and AFMR (LA enlargement with preserved LV function). LASR was assessed using speckle-tracking echocardiography. Primary and secondary endpoints were all-cause mortality and HF hospitalization, respectively. Cox models evaluated associations with outcomes, including subgroup analysis by LASR quartiles and additional risk stratification combining LASR with peak tricuspid regurgitation (TR) velocity. Results LASR was independently associated with all-cause mortality in multivariate Cox regression (adjusted HR = 0.887, p = 0.039). Higher LASR quartiles were associated with improved survival ( p = 0.013). When combined with peak TR velocity in a composite risk model, patients with LASR ≤ 9.0% or TR velocity &gt; 3.0 m/s had significantly higher risks of mortality (HR = 2.853, p = 0.012) and HF hospitalization (HR = 3.922, p = 0.029). Conclusions LASR, particularly when combined with TR velocity, provides strong prognostic value in FMR, supporting its potential role in refining risk assessment."

OpenAlex,mitral regurgitation,Is left ventricular relative wall thickness a predictor of 5-year mortality in patients with acute decompensated heart failure?,Sefa Tatar; Hasan Kan; Yunus Emre Yavuz; Selçuk Çakmak; Yakup Alsancak; Abdullah İçli; Hakan Akilli,10.1177/20480040261421393,2026-02-01,JRSM Cardiovascular Disease,"Objectives Heart failure (HF) is a significant global health problem that continues to increase in prevalence, morbidity, and mortality, particularly in aging populations. Relative wall thickness (RWT), an echocardiographic parameter reflecting geometric remodeling of the heart, is easily measurable and may possess prognostic value. This study aimed to evaluate the predictive power of RWT for 5-year mortality in patients with HF. Methods In this retrospective observational analysis, a total of 232 individuals diagnosed with acute decompensated heart failure were enrolled. RWT values were calculated using echocardiographic measurements. In this single retrospective cohort, participants were stratified into two subgroups based on their 5-year survival status. Demographic, clinical, laboratory, and echocardiographic parameters were compared between these subgroups Results After 5 years of follow-up, 133 patients had died. Patients in the mortality group were significantly older (p = 0.001). The mortality cohort demonstrated a higher prevalence of chronic renal failure, atrial fibrillation, and mitral regurgitation compared with survivors. Echocardiographically, elevated systolic pulmonary artery pressure (sPAP) was associated with mortality (p = 0.009). However, regression analysis did not find sPAP to be statistically significant [95% confidence interval (CI), hazard ratio: 1.047 (0.818-1.340), p:0.7)]. RWT values ​​did not show a significant difference between the groups (0.39 ± 0.13 compared to 0.37 ± 0.06; p = 0.225). Area under the curve for RWT was 0.50 (95% CI: 0.43–0.57), indicating poor predictive power. Kaplan–Meier analysis showed no significant difference in survival between RWT groups (log-Rank:0.984, p: 0.32). Conclusion RWT has limited ability to predict 5-year mortality among patients with advanced stages of HF. Age emerged as the strongest independent predictor. RWT should be evaluated in conjunction with multiple clinical and laboratory parameters rather than in isolation when managing HF."
