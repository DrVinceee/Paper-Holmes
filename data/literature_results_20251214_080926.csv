This study aimed to characterize the specific causes of LF, their prevalence, and prognostic significance.
In 408 patients with severe LFAS included, the aetiology of LF was identified. The primary endpoint was the composite of all-cause death and hospitalizations for heart failure (HF) up to 36 months. Secondary endpoints included individual components of the primary endpoint and cardiovascular mortality.
The most common LF cause was reduced LVEF (n = 228, 55.9%), while preserved LVEF included five aetiologies: (1)mixed aetiologies (n = 65, 36.1%), (2)small LV cavity (n = 58, 32.2%), (3)significant isolated mitral regurgitation (n = 39, 21.7%), (4)significant isolated tricuspid regurgitation (n = 13, 7.2%), (5)significant isolated mitral stenosis (n = 5, 2.8%). Over a median follow-up of 15 (IQR 6 - 36) months obtained in 302 patients, 159 (52.6%) reached the primary composite endpoint, 108 (35.8%) died and 91 (30.8%) were hospitalized due to HF. LF aetiology was not associated with outcomes. Independent predictors of the primary endpoint were severe MR (adj.HR 1.71, p = 0.04) and TR (adj.HR 1.47, p = 0.04). Aortic valve replacement (adj.HR 0.76, p < 0.001) and mean transvalvular gradient ≥ 40 mmHg (adj.HR 0.39, p < 0.001) were protective.
The main cause of LFAS is reduced LVEF, while in preserved LVEF mixed causes and small LV volume prevailed, without association with the outcome. Severe mitral and tricuspid regurgitation were strongly associated with worse outcomes, while valve replacement and mean transvalvular gradient ≥ 40 mmHg emerged as protective factors."

However, temporal trends in mortality remains poorly understood. This study aimed to compare survival after urgent versus elective TAVR using a reconstructed individual patient data (IPD) meta-analysis.
PubMed, Embase, and Scopus were searched through August 2025. Studies reporting Kaplan-Meier (KM) survival curves for urgent versus elective TAVR were included. Survival data were digitally extracted from published KM curves, and IPD were reconstructed algorithmically using a two-stage approach. Kaplan-Meier curves and Cox frailty models estimated survival and hazard ratios (HRs). Landmark analysis at one-year post-procedure and restricted mean survival time (RMST) were also employed to compare survival.
Eleven studies including 77,108 patients were identified. Kaplan-Meier curves were available for 76,108 patients (urgent: 5,683; elective: 71,425) and used for reconstructed IPD analysis. Urgent TAVR was associated with higher early mortality (HR 1.83, 95% CI: 1.73-1.93; p < 0.001), with convergence beyond one year (HR 1.01, 95% CI: 0.84-1.22; p = 0.83). RMST analysis demonstrated a 6.5-month overall survival advantage in favor of elective TAVR (p = 0.001).
Urgent TAVR is associated with significantly increased early mortality compared with elective TAVR. These findings highlight the prognostic implications of procedural timing and support early referral for elective intervention in patients with severe AS."

As indications expand toward younger, low-risk and asymptomatic patients, the clinical paradigm is shifting from isolated valvular intervention to lifetime valve management. This requires balancing procedural planning to optimize the index procedure with long-term considerations, including prosthesis durability, coronary re-accessibility, need for TAVI-in-TAVI, and risk of patient-prosthesis mismatch and conduction abnormalities. Prosthesis and patient-related challenges remain central. Bicuspid aortic valve and small aortic annulus are anatomical features associated with an increased post-TAVI risk of paravalvular leak, patient-prosthesis mismatch, and conduction disturbances, though outcomes have improved with new-generation devices and meticulous preprocedural planning. Durability concerns are particularly relevant in younger patients, with TAVI-in-TAVI offering a feasible reintervention strategy yet raising issues of coronary re-access and potential patient-prosthesis mismatch. Conduction disturbances and permanent pacemaker implantation remain frequent after TAVI, underscoring the importance of implantation techniques and physiologic pacing strategies. Furthermore, concomitant coronary artery disease requires individualized revascularization strategies, with an increasing role of invasive physiological assessment. Beyond device-related factors, medical therapy may favourably influence clinical outcomes in patients undergoing TAVI, both in pre- and post-procedural setting. In this era of expanding indications, achieving durable, favourable outcomes requires a comprehensive approach that integrates anatomical and clinical considerations, individualized device selection, careful lifetime planning, and optimization of pharmacologic therapy."

Left atrial (LA) dysfunction is an established prognostic marker in various clinical settings. This study aimed to evaluate the correlation between LA function, assessed by strain parameters, and the incidence of permanent pacemaker (PPM) implantation or major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) in patients with SAS undergoing TAVI. A total of 157 patients with SAS treated with TAVI between January 2019 and April 2021 were screened. Patients with pre-existing cardiac implanted devices or permanent atrial fibrillation were excluded. The mean follow-up was 24 ± 13 months. LA function was assessed using transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) by measuring three strain parameters: LA reservoir strain (LASr), LA conduit strain (LASct), and LA contractile strain (LAScd). The study endpoints were the association between these strain parameters and the occurrence of PPM implantation or MACE during follow-up. Ninety-nine patients were included in the analysis. During follow-up, 43 patients experienced MACE. Mean values for LASr, LASct, and LAScd were 29.5 ± 12.7%, -18.7 ± 11.0%, and - 18.5 ± 7.3%, respectively. Patients requiring PPM implantation showed significantly reduced LA strain values compared to those who did not (LASr: 13.1% vs. 33.2%; LASct: -10.1% vs. -21.0%; LAScd: -6.7% vs. -21.6%, p < 0.001). Similarly, patients who developed MACE had reduced strain values compared to those without events (LASr: 21.9% vs. 35.4%; LASct: -14.3% vs. -21.8%; LAScd: -9.9% vs. -25.5%, p < 0.001). Pre-TAVI LA dysfunction, assessed through LA strain, is closely associated with increased risk of PPM implantation and MACE."
PubMed,aortic stenosis,Peri-operative risk of non-cardiac surgery in patients with aortic stenosis: a systematic review and meta-analysis.,Amelia Place; Thalys Sampaio Rodrigues; Phillip S Naimo; Melissa G Y Lee; Riley J Batchelor; Laurence Weinberg; Lachlan F Miles; Jeffrey Lefkovits; Anoop N Koshy,10.1111/anae.70084,2025-12-12,Anaesthesia,"Aortic stenosis is a risk factor for adverse outcomes following non-cardiac surgery; however, existing data regarding peri-operative morbidity and mortality in this patient cohort remain conflicted. This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to quantify the peri-operative risks in patients with aortic stenosis undergoing non-cardiac surgery.
Following the development of our search strategy, we searched databases for relevant studies. The primary endpoint was all-cause in-hospital or 30-day mortality associated with aortic stenosis in patients undergoing non-cardiac surgery. Secondary endpoints included: myocardial infarction; heart failure; stroke; delirium; venous thromboembolism; and acute kidney injury.
Nineteen studies involving 100,486 patients were included. The estimated all-cause mortality was 3.8% (95%CI 3.7-3.9%) for patients with any degree of aortic stenosis and 9.6% (95%CI 7.7-12.1%) for those with severe aortic stenosis. A meta-analysis of 14 comparative studies involving 2,885,254 patients revealed significantly increased mortality in patients with aortic stenosis compared with those without aortic stenosis (relative risk 1.58, 95%CI 1.18-2.12, p < 0.001). Aortic stenosis was also associated with an elevated risk of postoperative myocardial infarction (relative risk 1.79, 95%CI 1.2-2.67, p < 0.001) and heart failure (relative risk 2.06, 95%CI 1.19-3.59, p < 0.001).
Aortic stenosis in patients undergoing non-cardiac surgery is associated with a three-fold relative increase in the risk of mortality. These results highlight the need for further delineation of which surgical procedures are associated with the greatest risk of poor peri-operative outcomes to guide heightened surveillance protocols, optimised peri-operative management and thresholds for pre-operative intervention."
PubMed,aortic stenosis,A ruptured dissecting aneurysm of the anterior radiculomedullary artery caused by hypoplastic vertebral artery angiography: case report.,Wenwen Chen; Xiu Shen; Yindan Yao,10.1186/s12883-025-04517-6,2025-12-12,BMC neurology,"Cerebral digital subtraction angiography (DSA) is increasingly utilized in the diagnosis of cerebrovascular disorders. We report a rare case of a ruptured dissecting aneurysm involving the anterior radiculomedullary artery of the cervical spinal cord, precipitated by angiography of a hypoplastic vertebral artery.
Cerebral computed tomography angiography (CTA) revealed severe stenosis of the M1 segment of the right middle cerebral artery in a 70-year-old woman who presented with paroxysmal weakness affecting the left upper and lower limbs. Dual antiplatelet therapy with aspirin and clopidogrel was initiated. On day 3, cerebral digital subtraction angiography (DSA) was performed. During continuous contrast injection into the right hypoplastic vertebral artery, the anterior radiculomedullary artery-a branch of the vertebral artery at the C6 vertebral level-underwent luminal dilation and subsequently ruptured, resulting in extensive extravasation of contrast medium into the spinal subarachnoid space. Non-contrast head CT confirmed widespread subarachnoid hemorrhage. Following 10 days of conservative medical management, follow-up head CT demonstrated complete resolution of the hemorrhage. The patient was discharged without significant neurological deficits and remained free of recurrent subarachnoid hemorrhage during a 3-year clinical follow-up period.
The occurrence of a ruptured dissecting aneurysm of the anterior radiculomedullary artery induced by vertebral angiography is exceedingly rare. We hypothesize that the sustained high-pressure and high-volume injection of contrast medium was responsible for the arterial dissection and subsequent rupture. During interventional procedures, neurointerventional radiologists should avoid selective angiography of small, hypoplastic vertebral arteries whenever possible to minimize the risk of such complications."

The role of angiographic lesion characteristics in predicting this discordance remains unclear.
To identify angiographic predictors of FFR/iFR discordance and define distinct angiographic phenotypes using unsupervised machine learning.
This prospective, single-center registry evaluated 401 intermediate coronary lesions from 221 patients with severe AS (aortic valve area < 1.0 cm2, mean gradient >40 mmHg) using FFR and iFR. Quantitative coronary angiography measured percent diameter stenosis (%DS), lesion length (LL), and other parameters. The primary outcome was FFR/iFR discordance. Receiver operating characteristic and decision curve analyses evaluated %DS predictive utility. K-means clustering was applied to %DS and LL to identify lesion phenotypes.
FFR/iFR discordance occurred in 30 lesions (7.5 %), exclusively as FFR-negative/iFR-positive pattern. Higher %DS was the only independent angiographic predictor of discordance (adjusted OR 1.35 per 10 % increase; 95 % CI 1.12-1.64; p = 0.002), with modest discriminative ability (AUC = 0.69). Cluster analysis identified three phenotypes: Cluster 0 (High %DS [median 75.0 %]/Intermediate LL [median 15.0 mm], n = 103); Cluster 1 (Low %DS [median 49.0 %]/Short-Intermediate LL [median 13.6 mm], n = 220); and Cluster 2 (Intermediate %DS [median 63.5 %]/Long LL [median 32.4 mm], n = 78). Discordance incidence was highest in Cluster 0 (16.5 %) versus Clusters 1 (2.7 %) and 2 (9.0 %) (p < 0.001).
In severe AS, FFR/iFR discordance manifests solely as FFR-negative/iFR-positive pattern. While %DS modestly predicts this mismatch, unsupervised clustering reveals that ""High %DS / Intermediate Length"" lesions primarily drive physiological discordance, identifying cases where iFR may overestimate severity due to AS-related hemodynamics."

Case reports,"Balloon entrapment during transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) is a rare but serious complication, especially in patients with severe valve calcification.
A 78-year-old woman with symptomatic severe aortic stenosis (peak velocity 7.23 m/s, preserved left ventricular ejection fraction 70%) underwent TAVR. After valve deployment, the balloon became entrapped within the prosthesis. Controlled postdilation was performed to disrupt the valve frame mesh, successfully releasing the balloon. The patient recovered well; at nearly 3 years of follow-up, she remains asymptomatic without rehospitalization for heart failure or neurologic events.
This case highlights the role of controlled postdilation as a safe and effective bailout strategy for balloon entrapment during TAVR. Reviewing the literature, balloon entrapment is rare but potentially life-threatening, and prompt recognition with appropriate technical solutions is critical for favorable outcomes.
Balloon entrapment during TAVR is rare but can be effectively managed with controlled postdilation, particularly in patients with severe calcification. Ensuring correct guidewire position in the left ventricle, confirmed by multiple fluoroscopic views, helps prevent balloon entrapment by avoiding passage through the stent mesh."

Suboptimal valve seating can elevate the transvalvular pressure gradient, while valve orientation and size may produce flow jets that impinge on the ascending aorta, potentially weakening the vessel wall. Such hemodynamic complications can compromise valve performance and patient outcomes. This study presents a computational fluid dynamics framework, derived from medical CT images, for preprocedural hemodynamic assessment of aortic valve replacement. The framework minimizes user input and delivers rapid results, enabling efficient evaluation of valve types, orientations, and their hemodynamic impact. The results demonstrate that non-optimal implantation angles substantially increase pressure drop across the valve, thereby imposing higher workload on the heart. This automated and efficient simulation framework demonstrates strong potential for clinical application, supporting precise planning and execution of valve implantation procedures to improve patient care."

As recommended in Valve Academic Research Consortium-3, the previous composite endpoint combined with the assessment of quality of life at baseline and 1 year with the 12-Item Short Form Health Survey was reported as an extended composite endpoint. The noninferiority hypothesis was prespecified for the assessment of the primary endpoint at 30 days. Considering the specific 1-year composite endpoints of Valve Academic Research Consortium-3 and the event rate of 27.23% derived from recent studies, an a posteriori descriptive and exploratory noninferiority hypothesis was introduced with a noninferiority margin of 10.89%. The analysis was performed in the intention-to-treat population.

Commonly used therapeutics include diuretics for CHF and antithrombotics 2 to reduce the risk of arterial thromboembolism (ATE), which do not directly affect myocardial function. This review summarizes the evidence for the use of pimobendan, a phosphodiesterase III inhibitor and calcium channel sensitizer, in feline cardiomyopathies. Potential benefits of pimobendan in cats include improved left ventricular systolic and diastolic function, reduced platelet aggregation, reduction in left atrial size, and improved left atrial and auricular systolic function.Drug details:Pimobendan is indicated for the treatment of CHF in conditions associated with systolic dysfunction (including dilated cardiomyopathy, restrictive cardiomyopathy, arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy and some cases with non-specific phenotypes) and has been used in the treatment of CHF secondary to hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. A dosage of pimobendan of 0.25 mg/kg PO q12h is generally well tolerated, and an approved oral solution is now available in the UK, EU, USA, Japan and Australia, which may facilitate administration in some cats; it should be noted, however, that pimobendan is not licensed for use in cats and marketing authorizations may vary between countries. Adverse events are uncommon with pimobendan but include gastrointestinal upset (anorexia, vomiting), transient changes in heart rate and possible worsening arrhythmias at higher doses. The use of pimobendan is contraindicated in cats with fixed obstructions of the left or right ventricular outflow tract (ie, congenital heart disease - pulmonic or aortic valvular stenosis).
This article reviews the use of pimobendan in cats for primary care veterinarians and includes practical case examples that reflect the typical use and recommendations for usage of pimobendan by the authors."

This study aims to elucidate the relationship between VAPB and aortic valve calcification at both tissue and cellular molecular levels, exploring potential regulatory mechanisms.
The expression levels of VAPB in calcified valve tissues were assessed using immunohistochemical analysis. Osteogenic differentiation and calcification levels of valve interstitial cells (VICs) were evaluated by alizarin red staining, calcium content quantification, and the detection of the osteogenic markers. Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) was used to identify downstream pathways regulated by VAPB, immunoblotting was used to detect the expression of key molecules of SMAD signaling, and immunoprecipitation was performed to detect interactions between VAPB and SMAD1/5/9.
VAPB expression was significantly upregulated in the aortic valve leaflets of patients with CAVD. VICs with VAPB overexpression exhibited a significant increase in calcium content (p < 0.001) and upregulation of osteogenic markers RUNX2, osteocalcin, and osteopontin (p <0. 01). Conversely, VAPB knockdown reduced osteogenic differentiation in VICs. Furthermore, VAPB overexpression led to the enhanced expression of p-SMAD1/5/9 through activation of the SMAD signaling pathway (p < 0.05), while inhibition of the SMAD pathway abrogated the pro-calcification effects of VAPB. Dual immunofluorescence staining demonstrated colocalization of VAPB with SMAD1/5/9, and immunoprecipitation confirmed an interaction between VAPB and SMAD1/5/9.
The findings indicate that VAPB promotes osteogenic differentiation in aortic valve interstitial cells by activating the SMAD signaling pathway."

In the MAC cohort, 21% of patients had a prior sternotomy. Concomitant aortic valve replacement (AVR) and coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) were performed in 32% and 24% of cases, respectively. Compared with propensity-matched controls, MAC patients did not exhibit significantly prolonged cardiopulmonary bypass times (115 vs. 112 minutes, P=0.485) or aortic cross-clamp durations (86 vs. 81 minutes, P=0.273). The 30-day hospital readmission rate was significantly higher among MAC patients (15.9% vs. 9.9%, P<0.001). Although 30-day mortality was elevated in the MAC group (5.8% vs. 4.2%), the difference was not statistically significant (P=0.171). In a subgroup analysis of matched groups undergoing primary isolated MV surgery, early mortality was 2.7% in patients with MAC and 0.5% in patients without MAC (P=0.111). Long-term, 10-year survival was significantly lower in MAC patients (43.6%) compared to matched controls (49.6%, P<0.001).
In this large single-center series, patients with MAC often had associated aortic valve and coronary artery disease, and 21% of them were undergoing a second procedure. Compared to matched patients without MAC, long-term survival was reduced in patients with MAC. This experience highlights the importance of accurate preoperative assessment and tailored surgical strategy to achieve acceptable outcomes of MV surgery in the presence of MAC."

The framework aims to generate robust, transferable video representations that enhance downstream performance across diverse echocardiogram datasets and clinical scenarios. Leveraging the publicly available MIMIC-IV-ECHO dataset, we employ an advanced masked auto-encoding strategy with 85% mask ratio to pre-train our echo-video encoder without requiring manual annotations. To further improve the learned representations, we introduce Spatial-Temporal Fusion Network (STF-Net), which integrates spatial and temporal correlations from the learned video representations through dual pathways that process joint and disjoint space-time features. Echo-Vision-FM demonstrated outstanding performance in heart function diagnosis, achieving an accuracy of 0.905, an F1 score of 0.941, and an Area Under the Curve (AUC) of 0.931 on EchoNet-Dynamic dataset, while reaching an AUC of 0.849 for aortic stenosis diagnosis on TMED dataset. In cardiac morphological value estimation, Echo-Vision-FM outperformed state-of-the-art models, achieving a mean absolute error of 3.87% and an r² value of 0.825 in left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) prediction on EchoNet-Dynamic dataset. The model also showed substantial improvements in estimating end-systolic and end-diastolic volumes, with r² values of 0.782 and 0.742, respectively. On the CAMUS dataset, our end-to-end approach achieved a Pearson correlation coefficient of 86.49% for LVEF estimation, significantly outperforming traditional segmentation-based methods while eliminating the need for intermediate post-processing steps. Incorporating STF-Net resulted in further performance improvements across all tasks, with consistent gains observed when combined with both randomly initialized and pre-trained encoders. Echo-Vision-FM provides a powerful, scalable approach to echocardiogram analysis, with significant potential for clinical diagnostics and research, demonstrating robust cross-institutional generalizability and data efficiency in low-resource settings."

However, individual patient data (IPD) was not used and the possibility of biases not considered.
A systematic review of randomized clinical trials (RCTs) whose primary outcome was mortality and unplanned cardiac hospitalization. IPD data was reconstructed, permitting calculation of time varying risks. Bayesian analyses, with vague priors, were performed for each trial and combined in a meta-analysis.
Four RCTs were identified. The pooled average long-term primary outcome was hazard ratio (HR) 0.52 (95% credible interval (CrI) 0.25 - 0.93) and the predicted HR for the next study was HR 0.52 (95% CrI 0.13 - 1.87) with increased uncertainty from between study heterogeneity. Only the EARLY_TAVR trial showed improved outcomes in year one (HR 0.33, 95% CrI 0.24 - 0.46), driven by a 142% increase in the crossover rate compared to previous trials. A one-year landmark analysis, that eliminates possible early unblinding bias, showed no long term AVR benefit for any individual study or for the pooled result (RR 0.59, 95% CI 0.20 - 1.40).
One-year landmark analysis showed no definitive longer-term benefit for early AVR compared to CS in asymptomatic AS. The early TAVR benefit is possibly the result of performance bias. Further research is required before early AVR for asymptomatic AS can become the new standard of care."

This may be especially important in left atrial procedures. However, information regarding its impact on percutaneous left atrial appendage closure (LAAC) procedures is scarce.
We utilized the National Inpatient Sample (NIS) database to identify patients who underwent percutaneous LAAC and had an MR diagnosis between the years 2016 and 2021 in the US, using ICD-10 codes. Clinical and sociodemographic data, in-hospital procedures and outcomes were collected. Baseline characteristics and outcomes were compared between patients with and without MR. Multivariable logistic regression models were used to identify predictors of in-hospital complications.
An estimated total of 123,785 patients underwent percutaneous LAAC between 2016 and 2021 in the US. Of them, 7,325 (5.9%) patients had an MR diagnosis. Compared to non-MR patients, MR patients were older and had higher CHA2DS2-VASc and ATRIA bleeding scores. MR patients had a higher rate of total complications (6.1% vs. 5.3%, p = 0.004), driven mainly by acute kidney injury (AKI, 3.3% vs. 2.0%, p < 0.001). Multivariable analysis confirmed MR as an independent predictor for AKI (OR = 1.38, 95% CI:1.02-1.88, p = 0.039), but not for total complications. In-hospital mortality was low, with no significant difference between patients with and without MR.
In patients undergoing percutaneous LAAC, MR was independently associated with an increased risk for AKI, but not for cardiac and vascular complications or in-hospital mortality in a US nationwide, all-comer registry."

Case reports,"Thyrotoxicosis often causes tachyarrhythmias and high-output states but rarely results in structural valvular failure.
A 57-year-old man with new-onset thyrotoxicosis presented with atrial fibrillation and torrential mitral regurgitation from a flail anterior leaflet from chordal rupture. After stabilization with methimazole and β-blockade, he underwent mitral valve replacement with a 33-mm porcine bioprosthesis, as extensive leaflet and chordal damage precluded durable repair. Postoperatively, transient left ventricular dysfunction improved with medical therapy. Sinus rhythm was maintained on downtitrated amiodarone, and anticoagulation with apixaban was selected after shared decision-making for atrial fibrillation management.
This case underscores the structural impact of thyrotoxicosis on valvular tissue, through hyperdynamic stress and matrix remodeling. Preoperative endocrine optimization and intraoperative storm prevention are critical.
Thyrotoxicosis can cause chordal rupture and flail leaflet. Repair is preferred, but replacement is appropriate when repair is not durable. Management requires endocrine-cardiac coordination and individualized antithrombotic therapy. Expect early ejection-fraction decline after surgical correction."

We evaluated the prognostic impact of pre-procedural three-dimensional (3D) right ventricular ejection fraction (RVEF) in patients with FMR. Additionally, we assessed the RV reverse remodelling (RVRR) based on 3D volumes and ejection fraction six months after the procedure.
Data from 74 patients treated with TEER for FMR were prospectively collected. Pre-procedural RVD, defined as 3D RVEF ≤45%, was observed in 47 patients (63.5%). Patients were divided into three groups according to pre-procedural 3D-RVEF: no RVD (No-RVD, RVEF >45%, n = 27), mild-to-moderate RVD (MRVD, RVEF 31-45%, n = 36), and severe RVD (SRVD, RVEF ≤30%, n = 11).
Patients with SRVD demonstrated a significant higher rate of all-cause mortality compared with the other two groups (p = 0.04) and RVEF ≤ 30% was associated with all-cause death, independently of left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) and left atrial volume index (LAVi) (HR: 3.72, 95% CI 1.12-12.30, p = 0.03). At 6-month follow-up, only patients with pre-procedural MRVD showed a significant reduction in 3D RV volumes and an improvement in RVEF compared to baseline (p < 0.05).
RVD was common among patients undergoing mitral TEER for FMR. Those with pre-procedural SRVD had worse mid-term survival compared to patients with MRVD and No-RVD. The group with MRVD was the only one to demonstrate an RVRR six months after the procedure."

Despite its low virulence, A. urinae endocarditis carries high morbidity and mortality due to diagnostic challenges and delayed recognition. We report a case of A. urinae IE involving the native mitral valve, complicated by severe mitral regurgitation and multiple cerebral septic emboli. The patient's course was marked by rapid clinical deterioration despite prompt initiation of guideline-directed antimicrobial therapy and multidisciplinary management involving cardiology, infectious disease (ID), intensive care, and cardiothoracic surgery teams. This case contributes to the growing body of literature recognizing A. urinae as a possible etiologic agent in elderly patients with urinary tract infections and systemic infection. Early echocardiographic assessment, microbial identification, and timely multidisciplinary management are essential to achieving favorable outcomes in such rare cases."

Imaging methods and practice,"Functional mitral regurgitation is strongly associated with dilatation of the mitral annulus. We aimed to investigate how remodelling of the left ventricle and left atrium impacts the mitral annulus size and function in patients with transmural myocardial infarction.
In this prospective observational study, patients with ST-elevation myocardial infarction were examined with 3D echocardiography at admission and at 1-year follow-up (n = 87). Size and function of the left cardiac chambers and the mitral annulus was analysed. The cohort was divided into groups with (n = 16) or without (n = 71) mitral annular remodelling, defined as an area increase of 15% or more, from baseline to follow-up. During follow-up, the group without mitral annular remodelling had stable volumes and improved function for both the left ventricle and the left atrium. Although the group with mitral annular remodelling also exhibited improved left ventricular function, both left ventricular volume and left atrial volume increased, and no improvement was seen in left atrial emptying fraction or left atrial reservoir or contractile strain. In linear regression analysis, increased mitral annular area at follow-up was associated with change in both left atrial [β = 0.025 (0.007, 0.043), P = 0.006] and left ventricular volume [β = 0.014 (0.003, 0.025), P = 0.012].
Mitral annular remodelling after transmural myocardial infarction is associated with increased volumes of the left ventricle and the left atrium, and absence of atrial functional improvement. Both increasing left atrial and left ventricular volume are associated with mitral annular dilatation, but left atrial volume is the strongest factor."
PubMed,mitral regurgitation,Early and mid-term outcomes of mitral annular calcification and transcatheter mitral therapy: a systematic review.,Yosuke Sakurai; Ashton McDonald; Tsuyoshi Kaneko,10.21037/acs-2025-mac-0128,2025-11-30,Annals of cardiothoracic surgery,"Mitral annular calcification (MAC) poses technical and clinical challenges in patients undergoing mitral valve intervention. Patients with severe MAC were excluded from major previous randomized controlled trials evaluating mitral therapies. Consequently, outcomes following mitral transcatheter edge-to-edge repair (M-TEER) in this population remain controversial.
MEDLINE and EMBASE were searched through June 2025 to identify studies reporting outcomes after M-TEER in patients with MAC. This systematic review assessed the difference in MAC grading and M-TEER eligibility across studies. The definition of procedural success was documented to highlight inconsistencies. The primary endpoint was all-cause mortality during follow-up. Secondary endpoints included procedural success, heart failure rehospitalization, mitral valve reintervention, residual mitral regurgitation (MR), and mean mitral gradient.
Six studies met inclusion criteria, including 2,808 patients undergoing M-TEER, of whom 363 (12.9%) had moderate-to-severe MAC. Most studies defined procedural success as MR reduction to grade ≤2, though only one incorporated a mean transmitral gradient <5 mmHg. MR reduction to ≤2 rates were comparable between patients with none-mild MAC and moderate-severe MAC. However, device success (MR reduction ≤2 and mean gradient <5 mmHg) was significantly lower in MAC patients (56.1% versus 81.3%). Post-procedural mitral valve gradient >5 mmHg occurred in 18.5-48.3% of MAC cases. Two studies reported increased all-cause mortality in patients with moderate-severe MAC during follow-up, with a mean follow-up of 20.4 months. Residual MR and reintervention rates were generally similar between groups, though mitral valve gradients tended to be higher in MAC patients.
M-TEER is feasible in well-selected patients with moderate-to-severe MAC; however, elevated post-procedural gradients remain a concern and may impact long-term outcomes. The absence of standardized eligibility criteria for M-TEER and consistent MAC quantification limits optimal patient selection. Comparative studies with surgical repair/replacement and transcatheter mitral valve replacement are critically needed to define optimal therapy."

This study evaluates the early outcomes of ultrasonic emulsification and aspiration using a novel device to facilitate mitral valve repair.
We conducted a prospective, single-centre, single-surgeon series of 27 consecutive patients with moderate-to-severe MAC and degenerative mitral regurgitation (MR) undergoing Sonopet-assisted decalcification between June 2023 and July 2025. Procedures were performed via median sternotomy or endoscopic mini-thoracotomy. Ultrasonic aspiration was used to remove and sculpt MAC, enabling annular remodelling and secure repair. The primary outcome was repair success and residual regurgitation; secondary outcomes included mortality and perioperative complications.
Mitral repair was successfully performed in 26 patients (96.3%), with one conversion to replacement. There were no in-hospital deaths, strokes, atrioventricular (AV) groove disruptions, or reoperations. At discharge, 96.3% had none or mild residual MR; one patient (3.7%) had moderate MR. Mean coaptation length was 10.3±3.2 mm. Postoperative complications included new-onset atrial fibrillation in five patients (18.5%) and permanent pacemaker implantation in two (7.4%). Sternotomy approach was used in 63% and endoscopic mini-thoracotomy in 37%. Mean cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) and cross-clamp times were 159.6±46.8 and 116.9±46.5 min, respectively. Most mitral repairs addressed isolated posterior leaflet prolapse (66.7%) or bileaflet prolapse (22.2%). Primary repair strategies included leaflet resection (51.9%), isolated neochords (25.9%), or resection with neochords (22.2%). MAC decalcification was primarily performed in the posterior annulus.
Ultrasonic emulsification is a safe, effective adjunct for mitral valve repair in moderate-to-severe MAC, enabling precise decalcification and high repair rates with minimal complications. This approach may expand repair candidacy and merits further comparative studies with long-term follow-up."

This patient had large aortic annulus dimensions. Noticing predominant aortic regurgitation and mild valvular calcium, we were aiming at 15% to 20% oversizing of the transcatheter valve, which was achievable by overfilling the largest balloon-expandable valve. Having an incomplete understanding of potential aortomitral interaction based on computed tomography and echocardiography, we inflated a balloon at the aortic valve, which revealed significant interaction, leading us to use a self-expanding valve that had limited oversizing.
Identifying the aortomitral interaction in such cases can potentially avoid transcatheter aortic valve embolization."

While these devices are potentially life-saving, their use is not without risk and might be associated with rare but serious complications, including structural cardiac injury.
We report the case of a 41-year-old male with known polysubstance abuse who experienced an out-of-hospital cardiac arrest due to ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction. Following successful return of spontaneous circulation and emergent percutaneous coronary intervention, a mAFP was implanted for haemodynamic stabilization. Echocardiographic monitoring initially confirmed correct positioning without evidence of valvular dysfunction. However, on Day 4, imaging revealed entrapment of the mAFP within the mitral valve's subvalvular apparatus. Following careful device explantation, the patient showed new-onset severe mitral regurgitation (MR) due to posterior leaflet chordal rupture. Transoesophageal echocardiography confirmed a flail P3 segment. The presence of severe MR hindered adequate recompensation and complicated the weaning process from ventilatory support. The immediately consulted multidisciplinary Heart Team recommended early surgical intervention. The patient subsequently underwent successful mitral valve repair, resulting in clinical stabilization and eventual discharge to a rehabilitation facility in improved condition.
This case highlights a potential rare iatrogenic complication of mAFP support and emphasizes the necessity of meticulous echocardiographic surveillance, timely recognition of complications, and guideline-based multidisciplinary decision-making in the management of critically ill patients."

However, these factors have received little validation in Japanese patients.
We evaluated preoperative echocardiographic data in 322 Japanese patients who underwent MV repair for DMR to identify factors associated with postoperative LV dysfunction. Postoperative LV dysfunction was observed in 31 (10%) patients, who had greater LVESD (39±6 mm vs. 33±5 mm; P<0.001) and lower LVEF (62±5% vs. 67±5%; P<0.001) preoperatively, compared with the non-LV dysfunction group.

Kaplan-Meier analysis showed a significantly lower rate of avoided adverse cardiac events in the LV dysfunction group (P<0.001).
The criteria for LVESD in MV repair in patients with DMR should be lower than the values indicated by the guidelines. Adoption of these revised criteria may improve prognosis after surgery in Japanese patients."

Left atrial volume index and strain parameters were evaluated preoperatively and 1 year postoperatively. Predictors of postoperative left atrial enlargement (left atrial volume index ≥34 mL/m2) were assessed by logistic regression and receiver operating characteristic analyses. Postoperatively, left atrial volume index decreased significantly (from 64.4±23.1 to 36.6±10.5 mL/m2; P<0.01) and there was a significant decline in left atrial strain parameters.

However, recurrence rates were significantly lower in patients who achieved both LAd reduction and MR improvement than in those who did not achieve both changes (P=0.0259). Multivariate analysis revealed that the combination of LAd reduction and MR improvement was the only significant predictor of a decrease in AF recurrence (hazard ratio 0.275; 95% confidence interval 0.091-0.826; P=0.021).

Current therapeutic approaches include pharmacological management, surgical interventions, and emerging transcatheter mitral valve repair (TMVR) techniques. While medical therapy provides symptomatic relief, it lacks disease-modifying effects in advanced cases. Surgical repair or replacement remains the gold standard; however, it is often unsuitable for high-risk or inoperable patients. TMVR has emerged as a transformative, minimally invasive alternative, offering improved outcomes with reduced procedural risks. Devices such as MitraClip, Cardio band, and other novel TMVR technologies have demonstrated encouraging results in clinical trials, improving survival rates and quality of life. Despite its advantages, challenges such as anatomical variability, device durability, and long-term efficacy remain. With continuous technological advancements, optimized patient selection, and collaborative efforts in research and innovation, TMVR is poised to revolutionize the management of MR, bridging the gap between conventional surgery and medical therapy. This editorial explores the current landscape, benefits, limitations, and future directions of TMVR in the treatment of MR."

In contrast, infections related to prosthetic valves (PVE), transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI), aortic vascular grafts and endografts (VGEI), cardiac implantable electronic devices (CIED), and ventricular assist devices (VAD) are increasing. This trend reflects an ageing population with complex devices, multiple comorbidities, and greater frailty, all of which contribute to higher susceptibility to device infection and bacteremia from other sources. In cardiovascular device carriers, bacteremia must be assessed for potential device infection. Key indicators include correlation within isolated microorganism, and type of device, interval between device implantation and bacteremia, peri-procedural complications in early infections, persistence of bacteremia, metastatic infection, absence of alternative focus, and time-to-positivity of blood cultures as a marker of bacterial load. Patient comorbidities, procedural complexity, and device-related factors further define risk. Risk scores validated for Gram-positive bacteremia assist in stratification and guide echocardiography, although none is specific for device carriers. Echocardiography remains central but has limited sensitivity in VGEI, CIED, and VAD infections. Diagnostic accuracy increases substantially when combining echocardiography, PET/CT, and multidetector CT angiography: in PVE, sensitivity improves from 75-83% to nearly 100%; in CIED, increase from 34% to 56%; and in VAD, pooled sensitivity and specificity are 95% and 91%. In daily practice, bacteremia in a device carrier should always trigger systematic risk assessment, multimodal imaging, and multidisciplinary discussion within a Cardiovascular Infection Team, expanding the traditional Endocarditis Team to address the rising burden of cardiovascular device-related bloodstream infections."

PM-AR-T is a semi-rigid annuloplasty ring based on a nickel-titanium alloy which has made progress in animal models, however, studies on PM-AR-T's performance in patients with tricuspid regurgitation (TR) are lacking. This study aimed to compare the efficacy and safety of the PM-AR-T with the Edwards MC3 ring for the TR treatment.
A non-inferiority, randomized controlled trial was conducted in 20 centers across China, enrolling patients with tricuspid valve disease requiring surgical repair. Patients were randomized to receive either PM-AR-T or Edwards MC3 ring. The primary endpoint was the success rate of valve repair at 6 months.
A total of 164 patients underwent valve annuloplasty, 83 and 81 in the PM-AR-T and Edwards MC3 groups. Valve repair success rates were 92.8% and 93.8% in the PM-AR-T and Edwards MC3 groups, demonstrating non-inferiority with a difference of -1.1% (95% confidence interval [CI]: -9.5 to 7.4), which was less than the pre-specified non-inferiority margin of -10%. No significant intergroup differences were found in valve regurgitation, echocardiographic parameters, and New York Heart Association (NYHA) functional classification at any postoperative time point. At 12 months, the proportions of patients without regurgitation were comparable, 30.4% and 27.8% in the PM-AR-T and Edwards MC3 groups (P = 0.705). Improvement to NYHA functional class I status was detected in 46.2% and 45.6% of the two groups by 12 months (P = 0.893). Both rings exhibited comparable safety profiles, with no device-related serious adverse events, cardiovascular deaths, major bleeding events, severe structural damage, infective endocarditis, or thromboembolic events.
The PM-AR-T tricuspid valve semi-rigid ring is effective in improving TR, demonstrating non-inferiority to the Edwards MC3 ring, with a favorable safety profile. Clinical Trial Registration: This study was registered at Chinese Clinical Trial Registry (ChiCTR2100043007)."

This study aimed to evaluate the prevalence, clinical profiles, and outcomes of heart disease (HD) among pregnant women referred to the Joint Clinic of Pregnancy and Heart Disease at Al-Zahra Hospital and assess the utility and limitations of the modified World Health Organization (mWHO) risk classification system.
We analyzed a retrospective cohort of 389 pregnant women with confirmed heart disease managed at the Joint Clinic of Pregnancy and Heart Disease, a tertiary referral center, Al-Zahra Hospital (Isfahan, Iran), between March 2017 and March 2023. Participants were followed until hospital discharge after delivery or pregnancy termination. Patients were stratified into mWHO risk classes and categorized by disease type, including congenital heart disease (CHD), valvular heart disease (VHD), cardiomyopathy, and other conditions. Clinical outcomes, including maternal mortality, abortion and delivery methods were examined.
VHD was the most prevalent condition (35.99%), followed by CHD (20.82%). Severe mitral stenosis and prosthetic heart valves were the most common VHD subtypes. Among CHD cases, atrial septal defect was predominant. Class IV mWHO patients comprised 21.85%, highlighting the high-risk population. Cesarean deliveries were common (53%). Maternal mortality was 1.0%, with four deaths mostly due to pulmonary hypertension.
The observed outcomes in this high-risk cohort compare favorably to those reported in similar LMIC settings, suggesting that structured multidisciplinary care and mWHO-based risk assessment may contribute to improved maternal and fetal management. However, overlapping and unclassified conditions highlight the need to refine current risk stratification frameworks for pregnancy in cardiac patients."

MAC complicates the decision over the appropriate surgical approach to mitral valve disease. Distorted valvular anatomy increases surgical risk and therefore requires careful patient selection. Here, we report our single-center experience performing mitral valve surgery in the setting of MAC over a 10-year period.
This is a 10-year retrospective analysis of 172 patients with MAC. Sixty-seven patients underwent MAC severity scoring using a 10-point system based on computed tomography (CT). The primary outcome was 30-day mortality, readmission, reoperation, stroke, prolonged ventilation, renal failure and deep sternal infection. Secondary analyses stratified MAC by underlying mitral disease type as well as evaluated outcomes by CT severity score. Patients without MAC undergoing mitral valve replacement surgery during the same time period served as controls.
The 30-day mortality was significantly higher in MAC patients compared with non-MAC (9.9% vs. 4.2%, P<0.001), as were rates of stroke (4.7% vs. 1.6%, P=0.036), prolonged ventilation (33.1% vs. 21.1%, P<0.001), and renal failure (8.7% vs. 4.3%, P=0.008). Resource utilization was also greater, with longer intensive care unit (ICU) hours {118 [interquartile range (IQR), 58.2-254] vs. 72.3 (IQR, 41.0-141.5) hours, P<0.001}, postoperative length of stay [10 (IQR, 7-22) vs. 8 (IQR, 6-13) days, P<0.001], and total hospitalization [12 (IQR, 8-28) vs. 10 (IQR, 6-17) days, P=0.001].

It is associated with known cardiovascular risk factors, as well as a variety of chronic inflammatory, infective, or connective tissue diseases. Surgically, patients are at specific operative risk for atrioventricular dehiscence or rupture and/or injury to the circumflex artery. To mitigate these risks, a broad portfolio of surgical options exists to safely anchor annular sutures. This can be performed after the calcium bar has been removed and the posterior annulus reconstructed with a patch, or even when the calcium bar is left in place. Knowledge of these techniques will help surgeons manage MAC and implant a properly sized valve. Even in the presence of severe MAC with additional involvement of the mitral valve leaflets, transatrial transcatheter heart valve (THV) implantation may be a viable option. An individualized decision-making process to determine the applicable technique should be used for patients with MAC, leading to adequate treatment for this high-risk patient group."

To unravel the mechanisms underlying lymphatic dysfunction, we applied single-cell (sc) analyses in murine heart failure (HF) models. Transaortic constriction (TAC) in C57BL/6J and BALB/c mice modeled chronic pressure -overload-induced cardiac hypertrophy and HF, respectively. Cardiac lymphatic (LEC) and blood vascular endothelial cells (BEC) were analyzed by scRNAseq, and targets validated by immunohistochemistry and human LEC cultures. While LEC profiles were comparable between strains in healthy mice, we found expansion of lymphatic capillaries and loss of valves post-TAC only in BALB/c. Differentially expressed gene (DEG) analysis revealed a reduction post-TAC only in BALB/c of lymphatic junctional components. Conversely, LEC expression of immune cell cross-talk mediators was mostly preserved post-TAC. Interestingly, around 35% of DEGs identified in cardiac LECs post-TAC were similarly altered in interleukin (IL)1β-stimulated human LECs. In conclusion, loss of lymphatic valves and dysregulated lymphatic barrier may underlie poor drainage capacity during pressure-overload-induced HF, despite potent lymphangiogenesis and preserved LEC immune attraction. Our work provides tractable targets to restore lymphatic health in CVDs."

Clinical data were reviewed, including symptoms, echocardiography, electrocardiography, genetic testing, and follow-up outcomes. Comparisons were made between patients with primary and secondary hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.ResultsAmong the 41 patients, 27 were men and 14 were women, with a median age at onset of 4 years and 3 months. Genetic testing was performed in 24 cases, identifying 13 cases of primary hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and 11 cases of secondary hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, most commonly associated with Noonan syndrome. The most frequent symptoms were fatigue (28.95%) and dyspnea (23.68%). Common pathogenic genes in primary hypertrophic cardiomyopathy included MYH7 and MYBPC3. Echocardiography revealed asymmetric interventricular septal hypertrophy in 61.0% of cases and left ventricular outflow tract obstruction in 22.0%. No statistically significant differences were observed between primary and secondary hypertrophic cardiomyopathy groups in clinical manifestations or imaging findings. During follow-up, seven patients died. Kaplan-Meier analysis showed a median survival time of 61.4 months, with no significant difference in survival between the two groups.ConclusionPediatric hypertrophic cardiomyopathy demonstrates substantial heterogeneity in clinical presentation and genetic background.

Cardiothoracic imaging,"Purpose To compare the performance of cardiac CT-derived hybrid aortic valve area (AVA) and planimetry, in combination with aortic valve calcium (AVC) or AVC density (AVCd), for assessing low-gradient aortic stenosis (LGAS). Materials and Methods This retrospective analysis included patients with LGAS (mean gradient < 40 mm Hg) who underwent echocardiography and cardiac CT from November 2018 to March 2022. The performance of absolute and indexed hybrid AVA and planimetry, combined with either absolute AVC or AVCd, was compared by time-to-event analysis and outcome classification ability. Results A total of 215 patients (mean age, 79.2 years ± 8.4 [SD]; 118 male patients) were included in the study. Of these, 74.4% (160 of 215) experienced a composite outcome of valve intervention or all-cause mortality during follow-up. Specifically, 11% (23 of 215) underwent surgical aortic valve replacement, 59% (126 of 215) underwent transcatheter aortic valve replacement, and 15% (32 of 215) died. The median follow-up duration was 478 days (IQR, 283-716 days). Indexed AVA measures performed better than absolute AVA. All models showed comparable discrimination, as measured by Harrell C statistic. The highest performing model was indexed AVA calculated using left ventricular outflow tract area derived from minimum CT diameter combined with absolute AVC (hazard ratio, 2.29; 95% CI: 1.66, 3.15; P < .001; C statistic, 0.60). The lowest performing model was absolute AVA planimetry with AVCd (hazard ratio, 1.62; 95% CI: 1.19, 2.22; P = .002; C statistic, 0.55). Conclusion Diagnostic strategies involving hybrid AVA and AVC or AVCd demonstrated comparable performance in LGAS assessment. Indexed hybrid AVA measures performed better alone or in combination with AVC compared with the absolute AVA measures.

Recently, artificial intelligence (AI)-based screening using non-invasive and widely available modalities such as electrocardiography (ECG) and chest x-ray(CXR) has gained increasing attention for valvular heart disease. However, single-modality approaches have inherent limitations, and in clinical practice, multimodality assessment is common. In this study, we developed a multimodal AI model integrating ECG and CXR within a cooperative learning framework to evaluate its utility for earlier detection of AS.
We retrospectively analyzed 23,886 patient records from 7,483 patients who underwent ECG, CXR, and echocardiography. A multimodal model was developed by combining a 1D ResNet50-Transformer architecture for ECG data with an EfficientNet-based architecture for CXR. Cooperative learning was implemented using a loss function that allowed the ECG and CXR models to refine each other's predictions. We split the dataset into training, validation, and test sets, and performed 1,000 bootstrap iterations to assess model stability. AS was defined echocardiographically as peak velocity ≥2.5 m/s, mean pressure gradient ≥20 mmHg, or aortic valve area ≤1.5 cm2.
Among 7,483 patients, 608 (8.1%) were diagnosed with AS. The multimodal model achieved a test AUROC of 0.812 (95% CI: 0.792-0.832), outperforming the ECG model (0.775, 95% CI: 0.753-0.796) and the CXR model (0.755, 95% CI: 0.732-0.777). Visualization techniques (Grad-CAM, Transformer attention) highlighted distinct yet complementary features in AS patients.
The multimodal AI model via cooperative learning outperformed single-modality methods in AS detection and may aid earlier diagnosis and reduce clinical burden."

A 74-year-old woman on dialysis with prior tricuspid and pulmonary bioprosthetic valve replacements presented with abdominal pain, diarrhoea, dyspnoea, and progressive jaundice. Echocardiography revealed severe aortic stenosis (AS) with pulmonary and tricuspid bioprosthetic valve dysfunction. Right heart catheterization confirmed significant pressure gradients and low cardiac index. Due to financial constraints and the high surgical risk, transcatheter valve-in-valve procedures and surgical treatment were not pursued. Instead, balloon valvuloplasty was performed on all three valves, resulting in transient haemodynamic improvement and bilirubin reduction. The patient later died from complications.
This case illustrates the balloon valvuloplasty as a palliative option in pan-valvular heart disease when definitive therapies are inaccessible. Such cases highlight a need for individualized, multidisciplinary care."

Although Indigenous Technical Knowledge (ITK) systems in agriculture are context-specific and resource-based, the evolving climate and soil characteristics necessitate the integration of modern technologies with traditional practices to promote climate resilience and sustainable crop production. Addressing this, the manuscript explores the use of statistical models, Machine Learning (ML), and Deep Learning (DL) for region-specific weather forecasting and crop recommendation. However, predicting future Weather dynamically and offering adaptive crop suggestions remains a significant challenge. This article introduces the Dynamic SG-SKRDX model, a hybrid approach that integrates crop recommendations with futuristic weather forecasts. The model predicts current and future weather conditions in the Cauvery Delta Region using a Support Vector Regressor (SVR)-Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) (SG) model, which has been enhanced through hyperparameter tuning and cross-validation. This SG model forecasts temperature, humidity, and precipitation for the delta regions using ten years of historical meteorological data. For crop recommendation based on these forecasts, the study employs a dynamic ensemble of ML models - Support Vector Machine (SVM), K Nearest Neighbour (KNN), Random Forest (RF), Decision Tree (DT), and eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) - termed Dynamic SKRDX. This dynamic ensemble intelligently selects the best-performing ML models based on changes in the predicted weather variables. Evaluation of the Dynamic SG-SKRDX model reveals strong performance, with the SG weather model achieving 0.65% MSE, 8.07% RMSE, 4.69% MAE, and 65.49% R-Squared. The dynamic SKRDX crop recommendation model attained 93.41% accuracy, 93.72% precision, 93.41% recall, and a 93.33% F1-Score. The proposed Dynamic SG-SKRDX model demonstrates superior capabilities in forecasting future Weather and recommending region-specific crops in the Cauvery Delta Region, offering a pathway towards technology-driven, sustainable agriculture and improved economic stability for the region."

Finding the best deep reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithm to maximize energy distribution, prolong battery life, and boost system efficiency in the face of the variable conditions present in waste heat recovery systems is the goal. The TEG system was modeled using the Markov decision process and implemented in a computer-simulated environment. Three advanced DRL algorithms were used: soft actor-critic (SAC), proximal policy optimization (PPO), and deep Q-networks (DQN); which were trained to act as intelligent controllers. The performance of each algorithm was systematically evaluated and compared using key metrics, including average cumulative reward, battery health, system efficiency, and a novel metric termed the energy fulfillment rate, which measures the ability to meet demand while storing surplus energy. The comparative analysis revealed a critical trade-off between maximizing performance and ensuring hardware longevity. The SAC algorithm demonstrated the best overall performance, achieving the highest average reward (- 7.03) and energy fulfillment rate (22.84%). However, the A2C, DDPG, and PPO algorithms all achieved a perfect average battery health of 100.00%, highlighting their superior capability for preserving system longevity, albeit with slightly lower rewards. The DQN algorithm consistently showed the least effective performance across all metrics, particularly in maintaining battery health (60.73%). The SAC algorithm is the most suitable of the methods tested for dynamically managing TEG systems. Its underlying principle of maximization of entropy enables a better exploration of control strategies, leading to a better balance between immediate energy dispatch and long-term storage goals.

PubMed,deep learning,Multi-phase deep learning framework with Multiscale Adaptive Swin Transformer and embedding attention for precision lung nodule detection and classification.,Dhayalini M; Revathi Alias Ponmozhi B,10.1038/s41598-025-31147-2,2025-12-13,Scientific reports,"Lung cancer remains a leading cause of cancer-related mortality worldwide, emphasizing the need for the accurate and efficient detection and classification of lung nodules. This study introduces an advanced multi-stage framework designed to address the challenges of precision, scalability, and adaptability in clinical diagnostics. This study presents a comprehensive framework for the detection, segmentation, and classification of lung nodules utilizing advanced preprocessing, segmentation, classification, and optimization techniques. The framework employs Sparse Edge-Preserving Enhancement (SEPE) for pre-processing, ensuring that critical nodule-specific features are retained while reducing noise. For segmentation, an enhanced DeepLabv3 + architecture integrates Atrous Spatial Pyramid Pooling (ASPP) and Refined Boundary Decoder (RBD) modules, supported by pretrained backbones, such as EfficientNetV2, DenseNet-201, ResNet-101, and InceptionV3. The classification phase leverages a Multiscale Adaptive Swin Transformer (MA-SwinT) with a Multi-Scale Embedding Attention Mechanism (MEAM) to accurately distinguish between benign and malignant nodules. Optimization using the Fossa Optimization Algorithm (FOA) fine-tunes the hyperparameters to ensure robust performance. The experimental results demonstrate the superiority of the framework on both the LUNA16 and LIDC-IDRI datasets. On the LUNA16 dataset, segmentation achieved a Dice Coefficient of 98.75%, IoU of 97.88%, Jaccard Index of 89.62%, and Hausdorff Distance of 2.025 mm, with an accuracy of 99.15%, precision of 98.50%, recall of 99.00%, F1 score of 98.75%, and specificity of 99.20%. For the LIDC-IDRI dataset, segmentation achieved a Dice Coefficient of 98.92%, IoU of 98.21%, Jaccard Index of 90.15%, and Hausdorff Distance of 2.010 mm, while the classification metrics achieved an accuracy of 99.40%, precision of 99.00%, recall of 99.20%, F1 score of 99.10%, and specificity of 99.55%. These results underline the ability of the framework to achieve high precision, recall, and overall accuracy, making it a reliable tool for lung nodule diagnosis in clinical applications."

To address these challenges, we propose SCOPE-DTI, a unified framework combining a large-scale, balanced semi-inductive human DTI dataset with advanced deep learning modeling. SCOPE-DTI is constructed from 13 public repositories and expands data volume by up to 100-fold compared to common benchmarks such as the Human dataset. The SCOPE model integrates three-dimensional protein and compound representations, graph neural networks, and bilinear attention mechanisms to effectively capture cross domain interaction patterns and outperform state-of-the-art methods across various DTI prediction tasks. Additionally, SCOPE-DTI provides a user-friendly interface and database. We further demonstrate its effectiveness by experimentally identifying anticancer targets of two bioactive natural compounds.

Eighty-eight CBCT scans from patients with nonsyndromic unilateral clefts were divided into training (n = 45), validation (n = 10), and test (n = 33) sets. Two annotators performed manual segmentations, and the intersection of these served as the ground truth for training three-dimensional (3D) U-Net models. The dice similarity coefficient (DSC) was calculated to validate the tool by comparing manual and automated segmentations. Three observers evaluated the resulting deep learning model using 33 CBCT scans and performing subjective assessments in terms of shape and size.
The dice similarity coefficient (DSC) between the two annotators was 0.66, and between the automated and manual segmentations, 0.78. The observers considered the automated segmentations acceptable in 82%-94% of the cases. The deep learning-based tool took approximately second seconds to perform an automated segmentation, while manual segmentation by the annotators required 14 and 6.5 minutes.
The deep learning-based tool that was developed in the present study can accurately perform automated segmentations of unilateral alveolar clefts and estimate the required bone graft volume."

Despite standardized World Health Organization (WHO) classification criteria, diagnostic concordance remains suboptimal, particularly in non-expert settings, where second-opinion reviews lead to diagnostic reclassification in up to 57% of cases. Deep learning may offer a tool to reduce diagnostic variability and improve the consistency of histological classification.
We trained a deep learning-based model using hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) whole-slide images from The Cancer Genome Atlas as a training dataset. The model incorporated a novel hierarchical loss function designed to reflect clinically relevant tumor groupings based on treatment strategies and patient outcomes. We validated the model on 112 consecutive cases from the University of Chicago, with diagnoses confirmed by an expert thoracic pathologist. Model performances were evaluated using both a three-group hierarchical scheme and the six-class WHO classification.
In the clinically relevant hierarchical three-group classification (As: A+AB; Bs: B1+B2+B3; Thymic Carcinoma), the model achieved an accuracy of 91.1% with Cohen's κ= 0.859, indicating almost perfect agreement. In the six-class classification (A, AB, B1, B2, B3, Thymic Carcinoma), the accuracy was 77.7% with κ = 0.716. The model demonstrated 100% sensitivity and 94.6% accuracy for thymic carcinoma detection. Notably, 60% of misclassifications occurred within the same clinical management group, thereby limiting their impact on therapeutic decision-making.
This deep learning model demonstrates strong potential as a diagnostic tool for TETs classification, particularly in settings with limited thoracic pathology expertise. The high sensitivity for thymic carcinoma detection and robust performance across different tissue processing conditions suggest its clinical applicability for improving diagnostic consistency and supporting pathological decision-making in both specialized and non-specialized settings."
PubMed,deep learning,Application value of prostate-specific antigen density combined with multiparametric MRI in early diagnosis of prostate cancer.,Di Wu; Zhaobing Tang,10.1016/j.mri.2025.110593,2025-12-11,Magnetic resonance imaging,"Diagnosis of prostate cancer in the PSA gray zone (4-10 ng/mL) and PI-RADS 3 cases remains challenging. Although multiparametric MRI (mpMRI) is widely used, its diagnostic accuracy is limited by inter-reader variability and the lack of integration with clinical indicators. Prostate-specific antigen density (PSAD) is a valuable risk stratifier, but its optimal combination with mpMRI remains unclear.
We developed a deep-learning model that integrates PSAD with mpMRI-including T2-weighted imaging (T2WI), diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI), and apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) maps derived from DWI. A cross-modal attention-guided (CM-AG) fusion module weights the PSAD and mpMRI feature branches. Performance was assessed in the PSA gray zone and the PI-RADS 3 subgroup. Ablation experiments quantified the incremental contributions of PSAD and CM-AG.
The model achieved AUC = 0.89 in the PSA gray-zone cohort and AUC = 0.83 in PI-RADS 3, outperforming single-modality MRI baselines and PI-RADS-based assessment alone (DeLong p < 0.01). In patients with larger prostate volumes, specificity increased by 10.2 %. Ablation results confirmed that both PSAD and CM-AG contributed materially to performance gains.
Fusing PSAD with mpMRI via cross-modal attention improves diagnostic performance, particularly in challenging subgroups (PSA gray zone, PI-RADS 3). This approach may support more consistent risk stratification and earlier detection."

Pre-treatment patient data and orthodontic treatment plans were retrospectively collected from patients who had completed their orthodontic treatment. A total of 1,200 intraoral photographs and 1,200 digital scans of pre-treatment dental models were obtained, comprising 600 extraction cases and 600 non-extraction cases for each image type. All images were randomly divided into a training set (80%), validation set (10%), and a test set (10%). A deep learning classification model was automatically developed using a codeless platform, which optimized the model through automated hyperparameter tuning without the need for manual coding. Model performance was evaluated by comparing accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 scores between the different image types.
The performance of the deep learning model trained with intraoral photographs achieved an accuracy of 71.5%, a precision of 72.2%, a recall of 71.1%, and an F1 score of 71.6%. The performance of the deep learning model trained with digital scans showed an accuracy of 74.2%, a precision of 74.6%, a recall of 73.3%, and an F1 score of 73.9%.

While artificial intelligence (AI) systems show promise for PVA detection, their cross-domain generalization faces two major limitations: variability in patient-ventilator interactions across different clinical settings, and morphological overlap between PVA types. These challenges necessitate specialized AI solutions rather than conventional re-annotation approaches.
We present the INTELLI-PVA framework for efficient cross-domain PVA detection on eight types. First, a hybrid two-stage PVA classifier was developed. A deep learning model, pre-trained on unannotated data using contrastive learning and fine-tuned using annotated data, identified four morphologically defined compound PVA types, each encompassing a reverse triggering (RT) and a non-RT type. A subsequent rule-based algorithm differentiated the subtypes within each compound type according to their triggering signatures. Then, the model was adapted to the target domain through an iterative active learning cycle, which selected the most informative samples for expert annotation and used them to fine-tune the model.
Established and validated on data from two centers encompassing 1190 patients and 124.975 million respiratory cycles, INTELLI-PVA demonstrates superior detection performance (average F1-score: 0.849) in classifying the eight PVA classes using only 1000 annotated samples per target domain, and achieves respiratory therapist-level recognition ability (average Cohen's κ=0.850) across unseen ventilator configurations and patient demographics.
INTELLI-PVA achieves high-accuracy, cross-domain PVA detection with minimal annotation burden, establishing a practical and efficient pathway for deploying AI-assisted ventilation monitoring in diverse clinical settings."

This study presents a deep-learning (DL) workflow using convolutional neural networks (CNNs) that treats GC-IMS chromatograms as images. Two CNN architectures simplified and complex were evaluated on olive oil and citrus datasets; the simplified model achieved 96.4 % and 98.3 % classification accuracy, respectively. To address limited sample sizes, a GC-IMS-specific data augmentation method that simulates plausible instrumental drift without chemically distorting signals was developed. For interpretability, saliency maps reveal discriminative features, and principal component analysis (PCA) synthesizes these into representative loading images per class, exposing stable collective VOCs signatures rather than single-sample explanations. By combining chemometric interpretability with DL prediction power, this framework provides a robust, explainable approach for GC-IMS data analysis for practical laboratory deployment."

Existing deep models need to be trained from scratch on abundant data, resulting in limited generalization. Inspired by the success of large language models (LLMs) on various cross-modality tasks, recent research introduces LLMs for MTS forecasting. However, due to the inherent modality gap between MTS and text, there remain two challenges in generating MTS representations suitable for LLMs and handling the intricate inter-variable dependencies. To tackle these challenges, we propose a novel two-stage framework utilizing LLMs for MTS forecasting, called the Granger causality enhanced LLM with residual-quantized tokenizer (Granger-TSllm). Specifically, we first design a deep Residual-Quantized Time Series Tokenizer, which generates compact discrete MTS embeddings natural for LLMs via compression and quantization. Next, we selectively fine-tune an LLM to fully leverage its pretrained representation learning capability for complex temporal modeling and forecasting. In particular, we introduce an interpretable Granger Causality Modification Module to enhance the prediction performance of LLM based on inter-variable nonlinear Granger causality correlations. Our comprehensive evaluations demonstrate that Granger-TSllm is a powerful MTS forecaster that outperforms the mainstream state-of-the-art models. Moreover, Granger-TSllm exhibits robust generalization capabilities, excelling in both few-shot and zero-shot forecasting scenarios."

However, traditional statistical and model-based approaches often fall short in addressing anomalies characterized by complex spatio-temporal coupling within WWTP data. Accordingly, this study introduces a novel prior knowledge-enhanced Transformer (PK-T) model. The PK-T model leverages domain-specific knowledge from wastewater treatment within a deep learning architecture, which demonstrates superior performance in the high-precision identification and reconstruction of complex anomalies. The model was evaluated using one year of operational data from two industrial park WWTPs in China. Comparative analysis with conventional methods, including statistical, distance-based, and model-based approaches, reveals that PK-T significantly outperforms these approaches in both anomaly identification accuracy and data reconstruction precision. Remarkably, the model achieves reconstruction accuracies exceeding 90 % for critical water quality parameters. This research provides an innovative solution for robust data management and intelligent operation in industrial wastewater treatment, with considerable practical implications for enhancing the operational efficiency of WWTPs."

Kinovea, as an accessible motion-analysis software, provides both visual and quantitative feedback. However, its application in supporting technique development among beginner athletes remains insufficiently explored. Aim: This study aims to describe the use of Kinovea in biomechanics training and examine its contribution to the awareness of kinematic characteristics and movement techniques among beginner athletes. Methods: A descriptive qualitative design involved 72 beginner athletes aged 18–25 years selected through purposive sampling. Data were collected over 16 weeks through interviews, field observations, and motion video recordings analyzed using Kinovea. Kinematic data focused on joint angles, stride behavior, and movement phases during walking, running, and the flight phase. Qualitative data were analyzed using content analysis with NVivo 12, while kinematic results were interpreted descriptively to identify performance patterns and areas for technical refinement. Result: Kinematic analysis showed coordinated joint-angle patterns across all phases. Walking analysis identified arm swing angles of 50.9°–58.8° and leg separation angles of 64.3°–67.2°, indicating a stable gait rhythm. The running analysis revealed knee angles of 68.8°–69.8° and elbow angles of 87.6°–89.1°, indicating efficient propulsive mechanics. The flight phase demonstrated knee angles of 81.2°–87.8° and elbow angles of 80.4°–88.3°, suggesting effective momentum use and postural stability. These measurements supported stride-efficiency assessment and technique evaluation. Qualitative findings revealed that Kinovea enabled athletes to interpret movement phases and identify technical inefficiencies through slow-motion and frame-by-frame visualization. Conclusion: Kinovea supports basic motion analysis by providing clear kinematic information and helping beginner athletes observe and refine their movement techniques. The findings also offer practical value for coaches by enabling more precise identification of inefficient patterns and guiding targeted corrections during early-stage training."
