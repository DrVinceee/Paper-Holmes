The Japanese journal of thoracic surgery,"A 80-year-old man presented to our hospital complaining exertional dyspnea. He was diagnosed with combined aortic valve regurgitation and stenosis due to quadricuspid aortic valve. The patient had no other cardiovascular anomaly. We performed aortic valve replacement( AVR) using minimally invasive cardiac surgery( MICS) approach. Four cusps were equal in size. Postoperative course was uneventful. AVR using MICS approach for quadricuspid aortic valve is extremely rare. In endoscopic surgery, the anatomical features of quadricuspid aortic valve can be more precisely understood, which may help in avoiding complications such as damage to the coronary ostia or the conduction system."

The Japanese journal of thoracic surgery,"We report a case of a 50-year-old man with anomalous aortic origin of the right coronary artery (AAORCA) and hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy (HOCM), who was treated with modified unroofing and septal myectomy. The patient presented with exertional syncope. Echocardiography revealed systolic anterior motion (SAM)-associated severe mitral regurgitation (MR) and HOCM. Coronary computed tomography (CT) showed AAORCA with an inter-arterial course and occlusion of the left anterior descending artery (LAD). Intraoperative findings confirmed intramural segment of the anomalous coronary artery was near the commissure of the aortic valve. To preserve native aortic valve function, modified unroofing technique was employed to establish a new right coronary ostium. Septal myectomy was performed to relieve left ventricular outflow tract obstruction, and coronary artery bypass grafting using the left internal thoracic artery was conducted to revascularize the LAD. Postoperatively, myocardial ischemia was resolved, and MR disappeared. The patient was discharged on postoperative day 10 without complications and has remained free of syncope during three years of follow-up."

In pursuit of improving accuracy, the transaortic flow rate (FR), defined as the ratio of stroke volume to systolic ejection time, has been introduced. However, its prognostic value in AS patients remains a matter of controversy. This study aims to systematically review the predictive value of FR in AS patients and provide quantitative pooled analysis results where applicable. A systematic search was conducted for observational studies on AS patients published up to July 31, 2025. Studies were included if they assessed the clinical prognostic utility of FR with at least three months of follow-up. Pooled estimates and 95% CI for FR's hazard ratio (HR) in each binary outcome were calculated using a random effects model. Twenty-one studies with 10,895 patients underwent descriptive analysis, and 19 eligible studies were included in the meta-analysis. For predicting all-cause mortality, the pooled HR for low FR measured at rest (cut-off value 200-210 mL/s) was 1.31 (95% CI: 1.03-1.60, I2: 66%, p<0.05). For FR measured during stress echocardiography (cut-off value 250 mL/s), the pooled HR was higher at 1.58 (95% CI: 1.20-1.96, I2: 0%, p<0.05). However, data in stress echocardiography have been drawn from a smaller number of studies compared to rest FR assessment, and validation in larger studies is warranted. Additionally, every 100 mL/s increase in FR, either at rest or stress, significantly reduced all-cause mortality. In Conclusion, FR is a prognostic marker for all-cause mortality and adverse composite outcomes in AS patients, indicating its potential for risk stratification. Incorporating FR into clinical assessments could help personalize follow-up and monitoring strategies. Systematic Review Registration: PROSPERO (registration number: CRD42023404048)."

However, it is unknown what role CH plays in the pathogenesis of AVS. In a meta-analysis of All Of Us, BioVU, and the UK Biobank, patients with CHIP exhibited an increased risk of AVS, with a higher risk among patients with TET2 or ASXL1 mutations. Single-cell RNA-sequencing of immune cells from AVS patients harboring TET2 CH-driver mutations revealed monocytes with heightened pro-inflammatory signatures and increased expression of pro-calcific paracrine signaling factors, most notably Oncostatin M (OSM). Secreted factors from TET2-silenced macrophages increased in vitro calcium deposition by mesenchymal cells, which was ablated by OSM silencing. Atheroprone Ldlr-/- mice receiving CH-mimicking Tet2-/- bone marrow transplants displayed greater calcium deposition in aortic valves. Together, these results demonstrate that monocytes with CH promote aortic valve calcification, and that patients with CH are at increased risk of AVS."

A total of 125 selected subjects underwent echocardiography imaging, 35 patients with AHCM, 45 patients with essential hypertension and 45 healthy controls. The apical morphological and dynamic features included apical-basal wall thickness ratio (ABR, maximal apical wall thickness / posterior basal wall thickness), apical angle (apA), peak blood flow velocity at the apical cavity (Vap) and its ratio to the velocity at left ventricular outflow tract (Vap/ Vlvot), and, relative apical longitudinal strain [RALS, RALS = apical longitudinal strain (LSapical)/ sum of basal and mid LS (LSbasal +LSmiddle)]. Patients with hypertension had lower apA, higher Vap compared to healthy controls (p < 0.001 for all). However, ABR, Vap/ Vlvot, RALS between the 2 groups showed no statistically difference. Compared to healthy controls and hypertensives, AHCM had significantly higher ABR, Vap/ Vlvot, and lower apA, RALS (p < 0.001 for all). The echocardiographic parameters (ABR, apA, Vap/Vlvot, and RALS) demonstrate promising performance in characterizing apical morphology and dynamics between hypertensive patients and those with apical hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, suggesting potential value for future investigations exploring diagnostic applications. Echocardiography is a valuable and promising tool to assess the apical morphology and dynamics."

Compared with valve replacement, aortic valve repair is a better potential strategy to achieve a low rate of valve-related events and an enhanced quality of life. We herein report two cases of aortic valve repair for UAV accompanied by aneurysm of the ascending aorta. By retaining the free margin tissue and forming a neocommissure to the side of the left lateral commissure that is 180 degrees opposite and the same height, we were able to achieve bicuspidization of the UAV. A glutaraldehyde-treated autologous pericardium patch was placed along the cusp connection to the annulus to expand the aortic cusp. During the follow-up period of over 4 years, the patients showed no signs of aortic regurgitation or significant stenosis."

Lipoprotein(a) [Lp(a)] is a genetically determined lipoprotein particle, causally implicated in atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) and calcific aortic valve stenosis (CAVS). Given its genetic basis, studies have shown marked ancestry-related differences in different races and ethnicities. Lp(a) plasma concentrations vary by more than 100-fold among individuals, primarily due to LPA gene polymorphisms and the number of kringle-IV type 2 (KIV2) repeats, which define apolipoprotein(a) [apo(a)] isoform size. Individuals of African descent have the highest median concentrations, followed by South Asians, with Hispanics/Latinos and East Asians having lower levels. Admixed populations display heterogeneity reflecting genetic ancestry. Despite differences in absolute levels, the relative ASCVD risk per unit increase in Lp(a) is consistent across groups, highlighting the universal atherogenicity of elevated Lp(a). Small apo(a) isoforms are associated with higher Lp(a) concentrations and risk, though isoform size is mainly a surrogate for Lp(a) burden. Despite a strong genetic basis and disproportionate burden in some populations, ancestry-specific testing guidelines are limited and testing rates remain low. Therapies targeting LPA transcription are in development, with outcome trials underway. Integrating ancestry-informed perspectives with universal risk principles is essential for equitable prevention and treatment. Routine, one-time Lp(a) testing enables cost-effective early risk stratification as Lp(a)-directed therapies emerge."

Timely valve replacement, either surgical or transcatheter, significantly improves survival. This audit evaluated our transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) pathway to identify delays and implement targeted quality improvements. Methods A retrospective audit of 29 consecutive patients with severe symptomatic AS referred for TAVI at a tertiary cardiac centre was conducted. Data on three key intervals, namely, referral-to-clinic, clinic-to-multidisciplinary team (MDT) decision, and MDT-to-procedure, were extracted from hospital records. Compliance with predefined timing targets (≤6 weeks per interval, ≤18 weeks total) was assessed, along with wait-list and 30-day mortality. Descriptive statistics summarized waiting times and compliance rates. Results The mean age was 76.3±9.8 with a median of 79; 18 (62%) were male, and 25 (86%) presented in New York Heart Association (NYHA) class III/IV heart failure. The mean total referral-to-TAVI time was 155±24 days (median 155), exceeding the 126-day benchmark; only three (10%) received treatment within 18 weeks. Referral-to-clinic targets were largely met in 23 (79%) patients, but major delays occurred between clinic and MDT (mean 56 days) and MDT-to-procedure (mean 64 days). Two (6.9%) patients died while awaiting TAVI, and among the 27 who underwent TAVI, one (3.7%) died within 30 days. Conclusions This audit revealed substantial delays in the TAVI pathway, primarily due to diagnostic and scheduling bottlenecks, resulting in prolonged waiting times and avoidable adverse outcomes. A quality improvement action plan, including a rapid-access valve clinic, one-stop investigations, increased procedural capacity, and active wait-list monitoring, has been implemented. Re-audit will evaluate the impact on reducing waiting times and improving patient outcomes."

Imaging methods and practice,"Ethnic variation in aortic root anatomy may influence transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) planning and outcomes. While Asian patients are reported to have smaller aortic dimensions than their Western counterparts, data for Southeast Asians in the UK are scarce.
We retrospectively analysed all Southeast Asian patients undergoing TAVI at a large UK centre (January 2018-October 2023), matched 2:1 by age and sex to Caucasian patients. Baseline demographics, CT-derived aortic measurements, procedural details, and post-procedural outcomes were compared. Of 1230 patients undergoing TAVI, 44 Southeast Asians were matched to 84 Caucasians. Compared with Caucasians, Southeast Asians had lower BMI (25.8 ± 4.6 vs. 29.4 ± 6.5 kg/m², P = 0.001) and smaller annular areas (390.3 ± 89.5 vs. 469.4 ± 89.3 mm², P < 0.001), perimeters (71 ± 7.8 vs. 78 ± 7.6 mm, P < 0.001), and sinus heights (20.1 ± 3.2 vs. 22.6 ± 3.3 mm, P < 0.001). Indexed annular area did not differ significantly (229 ± 42.7 vs. 242 ± 41.6 mm²/m², P = 0.10). Median valve size was smaller in Southeast Asians (23 vs. 26 mm, P < 0.001). Residual aortic regurgitation (AR) post-implant was more frequent in Southeast Asians, with fewer having no AR (47.7% vs. 78.6%) and a higher proportion with mild (50.0% vs. 19.0%) or moderate AR (2.3% vs. 1.2%). Post-TAVI gradients were similar between groups.
Southeast Asian patients in the UK undergoing TAVI have smaller annular dimensions and receive smaller prostheses compared with Caucasians, partly reflecting differences in body habitus. These findings have implications for prosthesis selection, procedural planning, and lifetime valve management."

The triglyceride-glucose (TyG) index, a composite biomarker of insulin resistance and systemic inflammation, has been associated with cardiovascular diseases. However, its causal association with CAVS remains unclear. This study employs bidirectional Mendelian randomization (MR) to elucidate the potential causal relationship between the TyG index and CAVS.
Genome-wide association study) summary statistics of TyG index and CAVS were obtained from UK-biobank cohort (n = 273 368) and FinnGen database (cases = 12 418 and controls = 487 930). Two-sample MR and multiple MR analyses were conducted to evaluate the association of TyG index with CAVS. The primary method was inverse variance weighted (IVW), complemented by MR-Egger, weighted median, and sensitivity analyses to ensure robustness.
The MR analysis demonstrated a significant causal effect of the higher TyG index (per 1-unit increment of TyG index) on CAVS risk (odds ratio [OR] = 1.50, P = .007, 95% CI: 1.12-2.02). Similar causal relationships were observed for triglyceride and glucose levels with CAVS. Sensitivity analyses confirmed robustness with no evidence of horizontal pleiotropy (P > .05). This association remained statistically significant in multiple MR analyses after adjusting for potential confounders (OR = 1.64, P = .003, 95% CI: 1.18-2.28). No reverse causality from CAVS to the TyG index was detected.
This MR study provides evidence supporting the causal effect of higher TyG index on CAVS."

This study evaluates these outcomes and further examines their association with the annular size in patients.
A total of 2,699 patients who had undergone TAVI with a BE-THV at least 5 years prior to our study were analysed. A small aortic annulus (SAA) was defined as an area ≤430 mm2; any larger annuli were labelled large aortic annuli (LAA). The primary endpoints were the incidence of all-cause mortality and bioprosthetic valve failure (BVF) between the SAA and LAA groups. As a subanalysis, the primary endpoints were examined in relation to postprocedural mean pressure gradient (mPG) ≥20 mmHg, severe prosthesis-patient mismatch (PPM), and sex differences, comparing SAA and LAA each time.
Overall, 66.4% (n=1,793) of patients were categorised into the SAA group. At 7 years after TAVI, the cumulative all-cause mortality showed differences between the SAA and LAA groups (55.2% vs 58.6%), while BVF assessed by Gray's test was similar between the groups (3.3% vs 2.7%). The Cox multivariable analysis revealed no association between SAA and worse prognosis (hazard ratio 1.07, 95% confidence interval: 0.85-1.36; p=0.56). There were no significant differences in mortality or BVF regarding an mPG ≥20 mmHg, severe PPM, or sex between the SAA and LAA groups (allp>0.05).
Annular size differences were not found to influence long-term outcomes or valve durability following TAVI with a BE-THV, suggesting that other factors warrant further investigation."

There are no established data on hypoattenuating leaflet thickening (HALT) following transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) using the S3UR.
Our study aimed to elucidate the clinical features of HALT following S3UR implantation.
As a subset of the OCEAN (Optimized CathEter vAlvular INtervention)-TAVI registry, we prospectively assessed patients who underwent cardiac computed tomography (CT) 30 days after S3UR implantation. HALT and potentially relevant THV geometry were analysed using four-dimensional CT data by an independent core laboratory.
Of the 445 patients studied, HALT was detected in 95 patients (21.3%) 30 days after TAVI. The modification of the commissural attachment specific to the 20 mm and 23 mm S3UR THVs did not affect the incidence of HALT (22.1% for ≤23 mm; 20.2% for ≥26 mm; p=0.636). The hourglass-shaped THV frame (p<0.001) and asymmetricity of THV leaflets (p=0.002) were independently associated with HALT development. A trend toward higher mean aortic gradients at 30 days with greater degrees of HALT (HALT >25% vs HALT ≤25%: 10.3 [interquartile range [IQR] 7.0-13.0] mmHg vs 8.6 [IQR 6.3-11.6] mmHg; p=0.007; HALT >50% vs HALT ≤50%: 11.5 [IQR 7.0-14.3] mmHg vs 8.9 [IQR 6.3-11.9] mmHg; p=0.002) was noted.
The incidence of HALT for the S3UR was comparable with the already reported incidences for the previous-generation SAPIEN 3 THV. Given the haemodynamic impact of HALT severity and multiplicity, strategic planning to avoid deformation of the implanted THV might be required. (Clinical trial registration: UMIN000020423)."

The CANNULATE TAVR EXPANDED study is a multicentre, prospective study which included consecutive patients who underwent transfemoral TAVI with the Evolut FX, CC, and angiography after valve deployment. Post-TAVI CT was performed to assess commissural and coronary alignment. Moderate-to-severe commissural and coronary misalignments based on the ALIGN-TAVR Consortium definition were categorised as the misalignment group. The primary endpoint was the rate of successful CC after Evolut FX implantation.
A total of 126 patients were included. CC was successful in 100% of cases for the left coronary artery (LCA) and 96.7% for the right coronary artery (RCA). Moderate-to-severe commissural misalignment was observed in 13.5%, and moderate-to-severe coronary misalignment was observed in 20.6% (LCA) and 22.2% (RCA). Misaligned LCA and RCA required significantly longer CC times. In multivariable analysis, factors associated with suboptimal LCA cannulation were coronary height (odds ratio [OR] 0.73, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.57-0.90; p=0.006) and coronary misalignment (OR 4.58, 95% CI: 1.45-14.47; p=0.009), whereas right coronary cusp width (OR 0.63, 95% CI: 0.44-0.90; p=0.007) and coronary misalignment (OR 4.64, 95% CI: 1.29-16.74; p=0.019) were identified for the RCA.
High rates of CC, and commissural and coronary alignment post-TAVI with the Evolut FX were observed in this prospective, multicentre study. Coronary misalignment was identified as the strongest predictor of suboptimal CC for both the LCA and the RCA."

Permanent pacemaker implantation (PPI), while often necessary, may negatively impact long-term outcomes and increase healthcare burden. Identifying patients at risk of PPI and optimizing post-TAVI rhythm management is therefore of critical importance.
This Special Report reviews key predictors of conduction disturbances after TAVI, including baseline electrocardiographic features (e.g. right bundle branch block), anatomical parameters (e.g. short membranous septum), and procedural factors (e.g. valve type and implantation depth) identified by literature review. Dynamic post-procedural changes in PR interval and QRS duration are discussed as triggers for further monitoring or electrophysiological testing. The report synthesizes findings from recent multicenter studies, guideline recommendations, and emerging tools such as ECG ambulatory monitoring using artificial intelligence and the MIDAS implantation technique.
Reducing unnecessary PPI requires an individualized, risk-adapted approach that integrates imaging, ECG, and procedural planning. Dynamic post-TAVI monitoring and selective use of electrophysiological studies may help avoid overtreatment. As TAVI expands to younger and lower-risk populations, refining conduction management will be essential to optimize patient outcomes and healthcare resource utilization."
PubMed,aortic stenosis,Longitudinal analyses of healthcare resource utilization and costs among patients with obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.,Nosheen Reza; Michael Butzner; Kirti Batra; Qiana Amos; Ami Buikema; Sanatan Shreay; Anjali Owens,10.1080/13696998.2025.2584888,2025-12,Journal of medical economics,"Obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (oHCM) is associated with substantial disease burden, healthcare resource utilization (HCRU), and healthcare costs. This study assessed HCRU and healthcare costs among patients with oHCM treated in real-world settings over 5 years of follow-up.
This retrospective cohort study used the Optum database (January 2013-December 2021) and included patients aged ≥18 years with ≥2 claims for oHCM and continuous health plan enrollment for ≥6 months pre-initial and post-initial oHCM claim (index date). Patients with ≥5 years of follow-up data were analyzed. All-cause and HCM-related HCRU (ambulatory visits [physician office visits and outpatient visits], emergency room [ER] visits, hospital admissions, length of stay [LOS], and pharmacy use) and healthcare costs were assessed in US dollars.
In total, 5,129 patients with oHCM were identified: 5,056 (98.6%) had an all-cause ambulatory visit and 4,669 (91.0%) had an HCM-related visit. 4,079 (79.5%) had an all-cause ER visit, and 1,499 (29.2%) an HCM-related ER visit. 2,949 (57.5%) reported an all-cause admission, and 2,232 (43.5%) an HCM-related admission. The mean (SD) per-person count of all-cause ambulatory visits was 101.0 (90.7) and 15.3 (18.7) for HCM-related ambulatory visits. Mean (SD) all-cause admissions per patient were 1.8 (3.8), and 0.9 (1.6) were HCM related. Mean (SD) all-cause LOS was 18.0 (54.7) days, and HCM-related LOS was 10.0 (39.6) days. Mean (SD) all-cause healthcare cost per patient was $181,968 (241,608), of which $67,531 (114,705) was HCM related. Hospital admissions were the largest proportion of medical costs: all-cause admissions cost $71,001 (149,533) during follow-up, of which $44,781 (99,431) was HCM-related.
Analyses were unadjusted for covariates or confounding factors.
Patients with oHCM experience substantial HCRU and costs over 5 years of follow-up. These results indicate a need for new treatment options which could decrease HCRU and improve patient outcomes."

DeSimone; Abhishek Deshmukh,10.1111/jce.70192,2025-11-17,Journal of Cardiovascular Electrophysiology,"ABSTRACT Background Transvenous lead removal (TLR) in patients with a history of mediastinal radiation poses unique challenges due to potential radiation‐induced fibrosis, vascular changes, and anatomical distortion, which may increase procedural complexity and complication risk. However, contemporary data on clinical outcomes in this population remain limited. Methods We analyzed the National Readmissions Database (2016–2021) to identify adults (≥ 18 years) undergoing TLR. Patients were stratified by prior mediastinal radiation. Baseline characteristics were compared using standard statistical tests. Multivariable logistic regression was used to evaluate the association between prior mediastinal radiation and in‐hospital outcomes, 30‐day mortality, and 30‐day readmissions after adjustment for demographics and comorbidities. Results A total of 48,985 patients underwent TLR, of whom 735 (1.5%) had a history of mediastinal radiation. Compared with patients without radiation, those with prior radiation were older (70.1 vs. 66.2 years, p &lt; 0.01), were more frequently females (38.2% vs. 31.6%, p &lt; 0.01), and had higher rates of valvular heart disease, atrial fibrillation, and peripheral vascular disease. Adjusted analyses demonstrated no increased risk of in‐hospital mortality (2.3% vs. 3.4%; adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 0.65, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.41–1.18, p = 0.29) or major complications, including cardiac arrest, pericardial complications, vascular injury, pulmonary complications, or embolic events. Similarly, (3.6% vs. 5.3%; aOR 0.76, 95% CI 0.48–1.43, p = 0.35) and 30‐day all‐cause readmissions (8.7% vs. 9.1%; aOR 0.81, 95% CI 0.64–1.28, p = 0.70) were not significantly different between groups. Subgroup analyses by indication for TLR (infection vs. mechanical complication) revealed no differences in outcomes. Conclusion Despite theoretical concerns, prior mediastinal radiation was not associated with excess procedural risk or worse short‐term outcomes after TLR. These findings may inform procedural planning and risk counseling in clinical practice."

Its causes can be divided into two large groups: those of genetic origin and those of nongenetic origin, which include infectious, toxic, and autoimmune disease causes, among others. Its natural course varies significantly based on the different etiologies and its diagnosis can influence the disease's management and prognosis. Clinical case: 29-year-old male, with a history of having suffered from Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia at the age of 4 with complete remission of the disease demonstrated at that time by bone marrow aspirate and immunophenotype, having been treated with anthracyclines. On this occasion, he attended due to the presence of sudden onset dyspnea and hemoptysis, for which in the first instance, due to the previously mentioned history, an attempt was made to rule out pulmonary thromboembolism with chest Angio tomography, which was corroborated by said study and demonstrating the presence of two intracavitary thrombi. Therefore, a transthoracic echocardiogram was performed, highlighting severe dilation of the left ventricle. Management for heart failure was adjusted based on structural alteration demonstrated by echocardiography, with favorable clinical evolution. Conclusions: The natural history of dilated cardiomyopathy is not easy to establish due to the wide heterogeneity of its etiology and the different rates of progression depending on it. In some cases, there may be functional recovery after acute myocardial damage, for example, in cardiomyopathy induced by tachycardia or in that induced by cardiotoxic drugs. In other cases, stabilization of the disease and systolic dysfunction and, in others, sudden death may be observed."

While previous research has shown that optimal patient selection is crucial for treatment outcomes, recent studies have identified a multitude of factors that independently influence mortality. Although these findings can significantly support clinical decision-making, the large number of available studies renders an overview of this topic challenging. In this review, we provide a comprehensive overview of the currently identified factors associated with increased mortality after TEER. We also summarize the current evidence on published risk scores that stratify mortality risk after M-TEER and T-TEER. We aimed to provide clinical decision-making support for optimal patient selection and referral to TEER and to identify remaining gaps in evidence."

Despite the recognized importance of hemodynamic force (HDF) in cardiology, its exploration in MR has been limited. Therefore, using a retrospective observational study design, we aimed to investigate the potential of noninvasively assessed systolic and diastolic HDF derived from 4-dimensional-flow magnetic resonance imaging (4D-flow MRI) as markers for determining MR. Method: The study cohort included 15 controls (19-61 years) and 26 MR patients (20 with primary and 6 cases with secondary MR, 33-75 years) classified into trivial-to-severe MR through cardiac MRI. The 3 T/4D-flow MRI sequence was used to assess left ventricular (LV) HDF (integral of intraventricular pressure gradients over the LV cavity) in 3 directions (lateral-septal, inferior-anterior, and apical-basal) using “Segment,” v2.2 R6410. Results: A negative coefficient for peak-systolic apical-basal HDF corresponded to decreased ejection fraction (β = −8.1, SE = 3.3, t = −2.5, P = .03), and a positive association was found between LV mass index and peak-systolic apical-basal HDF (β = 25.6, SE = 11.1, t = 2.3, P = .04). Peak-systolic apical-basal and E-wave apical-basal (diastolic HDF at E-wave time point) HDF emerged as significant predictors in detecting severe MR (Estimate = 2.2, P = .007; Estimate = 1.8, P = .015, respectively). The peak-systolic apical-basal HDF was also notably correlated with age in moderate-severe MR ( r = 0.88, P = .022). Conclusion: Mitral regurgitation affects early diastolic filling and peak systolic ejection, indicated by peak-systolic and E-wave HDF in the apical-basal direction, offering insights into dynamic flow patterns and LV remodeling. Hemodynamic force analysis could enhance risk stratification and guide therapeutic decisions, complementing traditional diagnostic methods for improved MR management."

Veeken,"Abstract Objectives Autoantibodies represent a serological hallmark of systemic sclerosis (SSc). Heart involvement in SSc patients includes diastolic dysfunction, conduction block, pericardial effusion, altered left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF), valvular pathology, as well as myocardial inflammation and/or fibrosis. To characterize the role of anti-RNA polymerase III (RNAPIII) antibody positivity in the pathophysiology of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)-related cardiac involvement in SSc patients. Method We retrospectively analyzed four SSc patients with anti-RNAPIII antibodies who developed cardiac complications after COVID-19. This study was approved by the University of Osaka Clinical Research Review Board. Results All patients were female and had been diagnosed within the past 3 years. Case 1 presented with elevated myocardial enzymes and severe cardiac injury requiring mechanical circulatory support. The diagnosis of COVID-19-related fulminant myocarditis was made. The other three patients did not have elevated myocardial enzymes but had elevated brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) or N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) and pericardial effusion or decreased LVEF and respiratory distress, suggesting the appearance of COVID-19-induced cardiac dysfunction. Conclusion Patients with anti-RNAPIII-positive SSc may have an increased risk of developing cardiac complications after COVID-19. The pathogenesis may involve angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2)-mediated mechanisms, which may include reducing ACE2 expression, leading to increased angiotensin II activity and induce cytokine storm. These results underline the importance of understanding the interplay between autoimmune diseases and infections in promoting immune-mediated cardiac injury. Further investigation is needed to characterize the role of anti-RNAPIII antibodies in the pathophysiology of COVID-19-related cardiac involvement."

In this population, frailty, comorbidity, and functional variability significantly influence prognosis. This study evaluated short-term (30-day) and long-term (1-year) mortality predictors in elderly patients with AHF treated in the emergency department (HED), considering clinical variables, comorbidities, and precipitating factors (PFs). Materials and Methods: An observational cohort study was conducted based on a secondary analysis of older patients with AHF included in the Epidemiology of Acute Heart Failure in Emergency Departments (EAHFE) registry, treated at Hospital Universitario Marqués de Valdecilla (HUMV) between 2007 and 2022. Clinical, laboratory, and PF-related variables were collected. The primary outcome was all-cause mortality at 30 days and 1 year. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were performed. Results: A total of 548 patients were included (mean age: 80.7 years), of whom 78.6% required hospitalization, mainly in the Internal Medicine department. Mortality was 11.1% at 30 days and 29.9% at 1 year. Age, valvular heart disease, dementia, and elevated creatinine levels were independently associated with higher mortality. Hypoxemia and low-output symptoms were linked to short-term mortality, while NYHA class III and anemia were associated with long-term mortality. Among PFs, acute coronary syndrome (ACS) was related to worse short-term outcomes, whereas rapid atrial fibrillation (AF) was inversely associated with long-term mortality. Conclusions: The prognostic relevance of risk factors differs between short- and long-term outcomes in older patients with AHF. Incorporating clinical characteristics and PFs into risk stratification models may support individualized management and guide follow-up strategies tailored to the geriatric profile. This multidimensional approach is essential to improve clinical decision-making and outcomes in a highly vulnerable population."

Using a prospective multicentre cohort of patients treated for IE, we compared the performance of the 2023 ESC classification to that of 2015 ESC, 2019 European Heart Rhythm Association (EHRA) and 2023 Duke-International Society for Cardiovascular Infectious Diseases (ISCVID) classifications in patients with or without cardiac implantable electronic devices (CIEDs). Methods A total of 1180 patients treated for IE between January 2017 and October 2022 were categorised as having either definite or possible/rejected IE within each classification. The gold standard diagnosis of IE was independently adjudicated by experts as ‘certain’ or not. Definite and ‘certain’ cases of IE were cross-tabulated to calculate sensitivity, specificity and accuracy. Suspicion of lead IE was defined by specific anatomical or metabolic features of cardiac lead infection on imaging; or by pulmonary embolism without valvular vegetation; or by positive culture of a lead extracted during open-heart surgery. Results In the 269 patients with CIEDs, 208 (77.3%) were adjudicated as ‘certain IE’; 2023 Duke-ISCVID and 2023 ESC classifications achieved higher sensitivity (97.1% and 93.8%, respectively) but markedly lower specificity (31.1% and 41.0%, respectively) than 2015 ESC and 2019 EHRA classifications. In the 159 patients with CIEDs and lead IE (78.6% ‘certain IE’), while sensitivity remained high for all classifications, specificity dropped for 2023 Duke-ISCVID and 2023 ESC classifications (11.8% and 32.4%, respectively), but not for 2019 EHRA classification (67.6%). In the 911 patients without CIEDs (81.0% ‘certain IE’), sensitivity was higher than 96% for all classifications and specificity was 55.5%, 52.6% and 48.0% for 2015 ESC, 2023 Duke-ISCVID and 2023 ESC classifications, respectively. Conclusions The 2023 ESC and 2023 Duke-ISCVID classifications had a higher sensitivity but a lower specificity than the 2015 ESC classification in patients with CIEDs, especially among those with lead IE. In patients with CIEDs, the 2019 EHRA classification was the most accurate."

In people younger than 35 yo, when the cause of SD is"" cardiac"" (sudden cardiac death-SCD), it is mainly due to cardiomyopathies and channelopathies. Among the predictors of SCD, obesity (a well-established independent risk factor for cardiovascular diseases) has been found to increase arrhythmic risk (i.e., every 5-unit increment in BMI confers a 16 % higher risk of SCD). We herein describe an autoptic case of an obese 32-year-old woman (BMI of 49.9), who was discovered deceased in her bed at home. Interestingly, at the heart examination, the presence of an abnormality in the tendon apparatus of the anterior mitral valve leaflet was observed. In fact, an accessory tendon chord connecting the apex of the leaflet to the distal third of the antero-lateral papillary muscle was found in addition to an unusual retiform appearance (""web-like"") of the whole mitral valve tendon apparatus. At histological examination of the ventricular myocardium, foci of confluent interstitial and perivascular myocardiosclerosis, along with perivascular fibrosis of coronary intramyocardial were observed. According to the literature, the valvular findings observed could plausibly account for the cause of death. In particular, a fatal arrhythmia due to the above-described tendons apparatus abnormality may developed. Nevertheless, obesity, which is a well-established risk factor for adverse cardiovascular events, may have contributed independently of the accessory chordal tendon. This case underscores the intricate interplay between the existence of left ventricular false tendons (LVFTs) and an elevated risk of ventricular tachycardia. From a speculative point of view, an LVFT may induce mechanical stretch in the interventricular septum, leading to heightened automaticity and triggering premature ventricular beats or arrhythmias. Comprehensive awareness of these structural anomalies and their morphological attributes is crucial for establishing correlations with potentially fatal arrhythmias and for formulating targeted preventive interventions."

Objectives We evaluated clinical outcomes with GLP-1 RA use post-TAVI in patients with T2D. Methods We conducted a retrospective cohort study using the TriNetX network, including 25,184 adults (≥18 years) with T2D who underwent TAVI (2015-2023). Patients were stratified based on GLP1-RA initiation within 14 days post-TAVI. Baseline characteristics, comorbidities, medications, and laboratory data were balanced using 1:1 propensity score matching (PSM). Cox models estimated hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for events from one-month post-TAVI until most recent follow-up. Results PSM yielded 1,101 patients per group, with a mean age of 73 years and 39% female. Mean follow-up duration was 2.2±1.1 and 2.6±1.8 years for GLP1-RA users and non-users, respectively. GLP1-RA use was also associated higher survival probability (HR 0.708 [95% CI, 0.583-0.859]), and lower rates of all-cause hospitalization (HR 0.790 [95% CI, 0.706-0.885]), major cardiovascular events (HR 0.849 [95% CI, 0.749-0.963]), and acute heart failure exacerbation (HR 0.785 [95% CI, 0.677-0.909]), acute kidney injury (HR 0.843 [95% CI, 0.719-0.988]), and major kidney events (HR 0.665 [95% CI, 0.510-0.866]). No differences were observed in acute myocardial infarction, cerebral infarction, or cardiac arrest. Conclusions In patients with T2D undergoing TAVI, GLP1-RA use are associated with significant survival benefits and improved cardiorenal outcomes. However, these findings are limited by the observational design, high comorbidity burden, lack of data on medication compliance and specific cause of death. Prospective trials are warranted to confirm these benefits."

Sarif Hasan; Anupam Kanti Thakur; Sushanta Barua; Goutom Chandra Bhowmik; Biswanath Sarkar; Sudip Barua,10.24018/ejmed.2025.7.6.2302,2025-11-07,European Journal of Medical and Health Sciences,"Background: Mitral stenosis (MS) is the most common valvular heart disease throughout the world. Pulmonary hypertension is an important and grave hemodynamic consequence of mitral stenosis. Persistent pulmonary hypertension leads to increase right heart pressure, Right Ventricular Hypertrophy (RVH) and subsequently right heart failure. There are various electrocardiographic parameters and criteria of Right Ventricular Hypertrophy (RVH) for diagnosis of pulmonary hypertension in various disease. Different ECG parameters and criteria of Right Ventricular Hypertrophy (RVH) have different predictive value for diagnosis of pulmonary hypertension in MS patient. Echocardiography is an important non-invasive investigation for diagnosis, monitoring and selection of treatment and for prediction of mortality in MS patient. Obtaining good quality of 2D echocardiography is problematic in remote areas and they are not feasible for wide spread use due to cost and availability. So, ECG may be a guide for selecting appropriate patient for further testing. Objectives: This study was planned to identify more accurate parameters of ECG for prediction of pulmonary hypertension and Right Ventricular Hypertrophy (RVH) in patients with mitral stenosis. Methodology: This cross-sectional observational study was conducted in the Department of Cardiology, DMCH, from March 2018 to February 2019. A total of 100 patients with mitral stenosis (MS) who met the inclusion and exclusion criteria were enrolled. Detailed clinical history, physical examination, and baseline investigations were recorded for all participants. The study population was divided into two groups: Group I:MS patients without pulmonary hypertension (PASP &lt; 35 mmHg). Group II: MS patients with pulmonary hypertension (PASP ≥ 35 mmHg). A 12-lead ECG and Doppler echocardiogram were performed within 24 hours of the patient’s first contact. Fourteen different ECG parameters and criteria for right ventricular hypertrophy (RVH) were assessed. Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS version 22.0 for Windows. Results: 14 patients were found in group I and 86 patients were found in group II. Among the Group-II patents 18 patients had mild pulmonary hypertension (PASP = 35 ≤ 50 mmHg), 47 patients had moderate pulmonary hypertension (PASP = 50 ≤ 70 mmHg) and 21 patients had severe pulmonary hypertension (PASP ≥ 70 mmHg). Average age of patient in group-I: was 38.71 ± 9.6 years and average age of patients in group-II was 43.8 ± 13.1 years (p = 0.16) Sex distribution was also identical between 2 groups (p = 0.92). This study showed that among the different ECG criteria for detection of RVH in mitral stenosis patients (Which is a surrogate marker for pulmonary hypertension), only a few had good predictive value. In mild pulmonary hypertension, only R in V1 ≥ 7 mm has sensitivity (66.7%), specificity (100%), PPV (100%) and NPV (37.5%). In moderate and severe pulmonary hypertension, R in V1 ≥ 7 mm, R/S in V1 &gt; 1 andR in V1+S in V5 ≥ 10 mm had good sensitivity (60.5% and 63.2%; 65.1% and 68.4%; 53.5% and 63.2% respectively), good specificity (100% and 100%; 100% and 100%; 100% and 100% respectively), good PPV (100% and 100%; 100% and 100%; 100% and 100% respectively) and NPV (19% and 22.2%; 21.1% and 25%; 16.7% and 22.2% respectively). Conclusion: The sensitivity of the ECG parameters was as a whole low to moderate in detection of pulmonary hypertension by assessing presence of RVH. However, certain ECG criteria for RVH detection in mitral stenosis patients have acceptable predictive value only in moderate to severe pulmonary hypertension."

Studies have showed trace element concentrations varied in patients with AF and may be involved in the pathogenesis of AF. However, no data is currently available for those with VHD. Methods Urine samples as well as clinical data were collected from 72 VHD patients with AF (VHDAF) and 72 VHD patients without AF (VHD) and further analyzed for a panel of trace elements: lithium, manganese, cobalt, copper, zinc, arsenic, selenium, strontium, Cadmium, mercury, thallium, lead. Quantile g-computation was adopted to explore the joint effect of the 12 trace elements on AF in this population, and internal validation was performed using 1,000 bootstrap re-samples. Results Compared with the VHD group, Sr levels were reduced, while Mn, Cu and Hg concentrations were increased in the VHDAF group. Quantile g-computation model indicated a significant association between the mixtures of the 12 urinary trace elements and AF in patients with heart valve disease (adjusted OR: 2.051; 95% CI: 1.180–3.565; p = 0.011). Positive partial effect was owing to Cu (weight: 0.43) and Hg (weight: 0.18), while negative partial effect mainly attributed to Sr (weight: 0.43) and Li (weight: 0.23). Conclusion VHDAF patients had higher Cu levels and lower Sr levels, and the two elements have been supposed to exert the largest influence on AF. Further research is needed to establish the causal relationships."

Although the initial insult is driven by autoimmune responses triggered by Group A Streptococcus infection, the sustained progression of valvular fibrosis involves a complex interplay of persistent immune activation, chronic inflammation, and, critically, long‐term mechanical stress. Mechanical forces arising from altered hemodynamics and structural valve deformation perpetuate valvular interstitial cell activation, endothelial‐to‐mesenchymal transition, and extracellular matrix remodeling, thereby driving fibrosis even after acute inflammation resolves. Current therapeutic options to halt or reverse mitral valve fibrosis are limited, with surgical repair or replacement remaining the primary interventions for advanced disease. Advancing mechanistic understanding through physiologically relevant models, coupled with early diagnostic strategies and multitargeted antifibrotic approaches, holds promise for preserving valve function. Integrating molecular insights with scalable public health measures may ultimately mitigate the global burden of rheumatic heart disease and improve outcomes for affected populations."

OpenAlex,deep learning,Zāl and Simorgh as Trickster Figures: A Mythological Reinterpretation of the Shahnameh Narratives,Tohid Teymori; Tohid Teymori,,2025-12-01,DOAJ (DOAJ: Directory of Open Access Journals),"This study examines the trickster archetype within the narrative of Zāl and Simorgh in Ferdowsi’s Shahnameh. The trickster, a mythological figure characterized by ambivalence, shape-shifting, resourcefulness, and divine intervention, occupies a significant role across various cultural traditions. Drawing upon established theoretical frameworks, this research identifies Zāl and Simorgh as a trickster within Iranian mythology. The analysis focuses on key trickster attributes—including shapeshifting, wisdom, and the capacity to disrupt and reconstitute social order. Zāl, marked by his extraordinary birth and upbringing by Simorgh, embodies a liminal identity that facilitates intervention in pivotal events. Simorgh, in turn, functions as a supernatural guide and healer, contributing to the restoration of equilibrium and the revelation of hidden truths. A close reading of the Rostam and Esfandiar episode demonstrates how Zāl and Simorgh employ cunning and esoteric knowledge to challenge oppressive power structures and institute a renewed order. This study underscores the significance of the trickster archetype in Iranian mythic traditions and elucidates the roles of Zāl and Simorgh as agents of transformation and balance within the Persian cultural discourse. Keywords: Trickster, Zāl, Simorgh, Shahnameh, Mythology. IntroductionThe trickster archetype represents one of the most significant and beloved figures in world mythology, characterized by paradoxical qualities where positive attributes typically outweigh negative ones, though this balance varies across different mythological traditions. As liminal beings existing between worlds, tricksters challenge established laws, confront deities, and disrupt social and cultural norms. While often depicted as deceiving ordinary people, tricksters more importantly challenge those in positions of power, undermining the dominion of kings, heroes, and the powerful through cunning and artifice.This study examines the trickster archetype within the narrative framework of Zāl and Simorgh in Ferdowsi’s Shahnameh, positioning these figures within the broader context of Iranian mythology. The research addresses a significant gap in Iranian mythological studies, as the trickster concept, despite its prominence in global mythology, has remained largely unexplored in Persian literary scholarship. By applying established theoretical frameworks from folklore, psychoanalysis, mythology, and anthropology, this investigation seeks to illuminate the transformative roles of Zāl and Simorgh as agents of change and balance within Persian cultural discourse. Materials and MethodsThe methodological approach employs a comprehensive theoretical framework drawing primarily from the foundational works of Paul Radin and Carl Gustav Jung on the trickster archetype. Radin’s conception of the trickster as a “culture-bringer” who facilitates societal transformation from lower to higher levels of civilization provides a crucial analytical lens. Jung’s psychological interpretation, viewing the trickster as a representation of the collective unconscious and undifferentiated human consciousness retaining its animal nature, offers complementary insights into the archetype’s enduring significance.The analysis incorporates perspectives from various scholars, including Claude Lévi-Strauss’s structural approach to mythological dualities, Joseph Campbell’s hero archetype theory, and Mary Douglas’s anthropological insights on social order disruption. The study employs close textual reading of Shahnameh, focusing particularly on key episodes including Zāl’s birth and upbringing by Simorgh, and the pivotal Rostam and Esfandiar confrontation. Comparative analysis with trickster figures from other cultural traditions—including Loki from Norse mythology, Anansi from West African folklore, Coyote from Native American traditions, and Prometheus from Greek mythology—provides cross-cultural context for understanding the unique characteristics of the Iranian trickster manifestation. Research FindingsThe investigation reveals that Zāl and Simorgh collectively embody the essential characteristics of the trickster archetype within Iranian mythology. Key findings of the study include:Extraordinary Birth and Liminal Identity: Zāl’s albinism marks him as fundamentally different from birth, leading to his abandonment and subsequent raising by Simorgh. This unusual upbringing creates a liminal identity existing between human society and the supernatural realm, a defining characteristic of trickster figures.Shape-shifting and Duality: The relationship between Zāl and Simorgh demonstrates the trickster’s capacity for transformation and dual existence. Simorgh functions as both a physical being and Zāl’s spiritual essence, while Zāl himself bridges the animal, human, and divine realms.Wisdom and Problem-solving: Zāl’s renowned wisdom, acquired through Simorgh’s tutelage and his own dedicated study, enables him to serve as advisor and mediator in critical situations. His knowledge encompasses both earthly learning and supernatural wisdom, positioning him as a crucial problem-solver in times of crisis.Shamanic Attributes: Zāl exhibits shamanic characteristics through his ability to summon Simorgh via the ritual burning of the sacred feather, accessing supernatural assistance when confronting seemingly insurmountable challenges. This shamanic connection enables intervention in the natural order when necessary.Divine Intervention and Social Transformation: In the Rostam-Esfandiar episode, Zāl and Simorgh’s intervention challenges corrupt power structures represented by Goshtasp and Esfandiar’s ambitions, ultimately facilitating a restoration of proper governance and social order. Discussion of Results and ConclusionsThe findings demonstrate that Zāl and Simorgh function as a unified trickster entity, challenging oppressive power structures while maintaining cosmic and social balance. Unlike tricksters in other traditions who often act from self-interest, the Zāl-Simorgh complex operates primarily for societal benefit, distinguishing the Iranian trickster tradition. The Rostam-Esfandiar confrontation exemplifies the trickster’s role in exposing corruption and facilitating necessary social transformation. Esfandiar’s invulnerability, granted through Zoroastrian blessing, represents a sacred power corrupted by personal ambition. Zāl and Simorgh’s intervention—revealing the secret of targeting Esfandiar’s eyes with a double-headed arrow from the gaz tree—demonstrates the trickster’s function in challenging even sacred authority when it threatens social harmony. This episode reflects broader tensions between two political paradigms: the pre-Lohrasp tradition of balanced power between royal and heroic houses, and the Lohrasp-Goshtasp model concentrating all authority in the monarchy. The trickster’s intervention supports the restoration of balanced governance, suggesting Ferdowsi’s critique of absolute monarchical power. The comparative analysis reveals both universal and culturally specific aspects of the Iranian trickster. While sharing common features with global trickster figures—liminality, shape-shifting, wisdom, and social disruption—Zāl and Simorgh demonstrate unique characteristics rooted in Persian cultural values, particularly the emphasis on wisdom (kherad) and justice (dād).This study establishes Zāl and Simorgh as a distinctive trickster manifestation within Iranian mythology, contributing significantly to the theoretical understanding of the trickster archetype. The trickster archetype plays a vital but previously unrecognized role in Iranian mythological traditions, with Zāl and Simorgh embodying this function through their combined attributes and interventions. The Iranian trickster tradition emphasizes wisdom, justice, and societal benefit over the self-interested cunning often associated with tricksters in other cultures, reflecting core Persian cultural values. The Zāl-Simorgh complex serves as a mechanism for critiquing and transforming unjust power structures, particularly relevant to Ferdowsi’s historical context and his concerns about tyrannical rule. Recognition of the trickster pattern in Shahnameh opens new avenues for comparative mythological studies and a deeper understanding of Persian literary traditions. The study’s findings have implications beyond literary analysis, offering insights into mechanisms of cultural resistance, identity formation, and social transformation relevant to contemporary Iranian society. This research advances scholarship in Iranian mythology, comparative literature, and archetypal studies while demonstrating the continued relevance of ancient mythological patterns for understanding cultural dynamics and social change. Future research might explore trickster manifestations in other Persian literary works and examine the archetype’s evolution in modern Iranian literature and culture."

OpenAlex,deep learning,A Review on Efficient Trust Computational and Evaluation Based on Machine Learning,Dr Anil Kumar,,2025-11-30,Zenodo (CERN European Organization for Nuclear Research),"&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract:&lt;/strong&gt; These days, machine learning (ML) models are used across many complex fields, including bioinformatics, medicine, and other disciplines. Their black-box nature, however, may make it difficult to understand and trust the outcomes they provide. As a result, there is now a greater need for trustworthy visualisation tools to promote confidence in machine learning models. This topic has gained popularity in the visualisation community over the past few decades. To offer an overview of current research on the subject, as well as the frontiers of that study. The Internet of Things (IoT) enables billions of objects, in both physical and virtual contexts, to intelligently communicate with one another. Smartphones, for example, have evolved into valuable personal assistants and an integral part of people's daily lives and work. Machine learning, such as reinforcement learning and deep learning, is increasingly commonly used in IoT to improve performance and efficiency. Machine learning, on the other hand, has several flaws that could jeopardise the security, trust, and privacy of IoT environments. One of the most serious threats is adversarial learning, in which attackers try to trick the learning algorithm with carefully crafted training examples, leading to incorrect outputs. This Special Issue will feature cutting-edge research from academia and industry, with a focus on debates over the security, trust, and privacy issues in machine learning-based IoT.&lt;/p&gt;"
OpenAlex,deep learning,"Fruit Plant Recognition and Classification from Plant Leaves using Deep Learning, CNN Models",Ajahar Ismailkha Pathan,,2025-11-30,Zenodo (CERN European Organization for Nuclear Research),"&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract: &lt;/strong&gt;Plants are an integral part of human life, and the ability to identify a fruit plant from its leaf image is both fascinating and challenging. Advances in image processing and pattern recognition have enabled plant identification using digital images.

These models are used to classify fruit plants from leaf images, achieving promising performance on leaf image datasets. Among the evaluated CNN models, MobileNet achieved the highest performance with 94.81% training, 99.57% validation, and 99.44% test accuracy, outperforming all others. LeNet, AlexNet, and ResNet also showed strong results above 93%, while DenseNet, GoogLeNet, and VGGNet achieved moderate accuracy. Inception performed the worst, confirming that MobileNet is the most efficient and reliable model for fruit plant leaf classification.&lt;/p&gt;"
OpenAlex,deep learning,A Framework for the Prediction of Eye Diseases using Deep Learning Models,Dr. Jagannibas Paul Choudhury,,2025-11-30,Zenodo (CERN European Organization for Nuclear Research),"&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract:&lt;/strong&gt; Artificial Intelligence (AI) has significantly enhanced various aspects of our lives, providing practical solutions to complex problems and narrowing the gap between real-world challenges and business needs. Within the realm of AI, innovative technologies such as machine learning and deep learning have revolutionised the way we analyse data, make informed decisions, and respond to complex situations, all with the goal of understanding and resolving them efficiently. As data generation and storage continue to expand rapidly, these technologies have become essential in managing data analytics, storage systems, and decision-making frameworks. Through digital transformation, industries are being reshaped, and global services&mdash;especially in fields such as healthcare&mdash;are being enhanced to improve the quality of human life. The eye is considered the most important sensory organ for humans, playing a vital role in their overall ability to interact with the world. Unfortunately, many individuals in both rural and urban areas suffer from eye conditions such as cataracts, glaucoma, ocular hypertension, bulgy vision, etc., that affect their vision. There are various causes, including age, diabetes, and genetic and hereditary factors. Modern lifestyles, which have led to increased use of displays for digital devices, are also a factor affecting vision. This study aims to develop a predictive model for vision-related diseases by leveraging medical data and analyzing the influence of various contributing factors using deep learning methodologies. Early detection of eye conditions is crucial to prevent serious complications, as timely diagnosis plays a vital role in ensuring effective treatment. Conducting thorough assessments to identify potential indicators of eye diseases is highly encouraged. Deep learning and artificial intelligence (AI) significantly enhance the ability to detect these illnesses at an early stage. The purpose of this research is to lay the foundation for discovering a robust and adaptable solution. Specifically, the study focuses on reviewing the classification of eye diseases using advanced deep learning models, such as Custom CNN (Convolutional Neural Network), VGG16, ResNet, InceptionV3, GoogleNet, EfficientNet B2, MobileNet, and DenseNet 121. The proposed classification framework follows a series of steps: initially, it involves gathering widely accessible datasets related to eye diseases and performing data preprocessing to ensure consistent experimental conditions. The primary objective is to train the model to accurately identify symptoms of eye diseases, rather than optimizing for a narrow subset of data. Given the success of deep learning in image classification and object recognition tasks, the research emphasizes these modern techniques over conventional handcrafted approaches.&lt;/p&gt;"
