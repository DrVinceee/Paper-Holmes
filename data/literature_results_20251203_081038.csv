Located in a histoplasmosis-hyperendemic region, our institution aimed to characterize the cardiovascular manifestations and interventional treatments in children diagnosed with histoplasmosis. We conducted a retrospective cohort study of 160 patients under 18 years of age diagnosed with histoplasmosis between January 2009 and March 2023 at a tertiary-care children's hospital. Data reviewed included clinical presentation, imaging, electrocardiograms, echocardiograms, and catheter-based or surgical interventions. Of the 160 patients, 65 (41%) demonstrated cardiovascular involvement from mediastinal manifestations of histoplasmosis (mediastinal lymphadenopathy, mediastinal granuloma, and fibrosing mediastinitis) including all 8 patients with fibrosing mediastinitis. Among these 65 children, pericarditis with pericardial effusion was the most common (58%), 30 patients requiring urgent intervention. Other manifestations from mass effect included pulmonary artery stenosis (34%), superior vena cava (SVC) stenosis (15%), pulmonary vein stenosis (8%), inferior vena cava (IVC) stenosis (3%), and aortic arch obstruction (2%). Fourteen patients underwent catheter-based stenting procedures with a total of 22 stents placed (17 in pulmonary artery branches, 4 in pulmonary veins, and 1 in the SVC), typically not performed during the initial presentation. Five patients underwent mass resection for cardiac indications. Cardiovascular complications from histoplasmosis-related mediastinal lymphadenopathy in children are significant, presenting with pericarditis or compression of central vascular structures. Fibrosing mediastinitis was consistently associated with cardiac involvement, frequently necessitating intervention. Surgical repair is challenging due to extensive fibrosis. However, percutaneous vascular interventions are feasible and effective in managing vascular obstructions. Early recognition and timely intervention are critical to prevent irreversible vascular atresia."

We provide an overview of the evolution of exercise training from ""bed rest"" to current guidelines and highlight emerging approaches.
Exercise training appears to be safe and provide benefits for patients with heart failure. Emerging evidence also suggests potential benefit in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy as well as angina with non-obstructive coronary arteries, though more data are needed for widespread implementation. Given appropriate precautions and clinical assessments, exercise is a unifying therapy across most heart failure conditions regardless of ejection fraction. Exercise training appears to be safe, and beneficial in terms of improvements in functional capacity and health-related quality of life. Larger controlled trials are needed to better examine the impact of exercise on hard clinical endpoints such as HF hospitalizations (likely beneficial) and cardiovascular mortality."

The consequences for the peripheral vascular network, organ perfusion and postoperative organ dysfunction remain unclear. This study assessed hemodynamic and microcirculatory changes after TAVI, and their association with postoperative organ dysfunction.
This prospective, single-center physiological study included 20 patients with severe aortic stenosis undergoing transfemoral TAVI at Geneva University Hospitals (January-June 2024). Hemodynamic and microcirculatory assessment included arterial stiffness (tonometry), temperature gradients (T grad), reactive hyperemia (near-infrared spectroscopy and photoplethysmography) and plasma vascular endothelium growth factor (VEGF) concentrations before and after TAVI. The primary outcome was perioperative changes in macro- and microcirculatory parameters; secondary outcomes were organ dysfunction within 7 days.
TAVI immediately increased aortic pressures and amplified pressure waves. By day 1, central-peripheral T grad decreased, perfusion index rose (from 2.5 [0.9-4.2] to 3.9 [1.9-5.5]; p < 0.05), and tissue oxygen re-saturation slope increased (from 2.6 [1.5-3.4] to 3.9 [2.8-4.7] %/s; p < 0.05), independent of macrocirculatory parameters. Large artery stiffness decreased, despite a reduction in the total arterial compliance, without changes in small-vessel resistance. Cardiac index changes showed wide interindividual variability and correlated with vascular and VEGF dynamics. Patients with postoperative organ dysfunction had higher baseline VEGF (52.9 vs. 28.7 pg/mL, p = 0.033) and greater postoperative increases.
TAVI induces rapid macro- and microcirculatory changes, with early tissue perfusion improvement despite transient microcirculatory reserve impairment. VEGF dynamics were associated with postoperative complications, suggesting endothelial activation as a marker of vulnerability and linking baseline endothelial status to vascular adaptation and outcomes."

Outcomes of TAVR versus surgical AVR (SAVR) in women of childbearing age have not been evaluated. We aimed to evaluate the contemporary use and outcomes of TAVR versus SAVR in women of childbearing age in the United States.
Women aged 18-50 years hospitalized for isolated AVR were identified in the Nationwide Readmissions Database (2016-2022). In-hospital outcomes of TAVR versus SAVR were compared using propensity-score matching. Readmissions were compared using the Cox proportional hazards regression model.
Of 6926 weighted hospitalizations for isolated AVR in women aged 18-50 years, 897 (13.0%) included TAVR, and 6029 (87.0%) included SAVR. From 2016-2022, the proportion of AVR performed using TAVR increased from 7.4% to 16.3% in women aged 18-50 years (ptrend<0.001). Compared with SAVR, TAVR was associated with lower in-hospital mortality (<1.4 vs. 3.5%, p = 0.03), acute kidney injury (9.0 vs. 16.8%, p = 0.002), and need for blood transfusion (7.1 vs. 19.1%, p ​< ​0.001), but higher heart block (23.5 vs. 9.7%, p ​< ​0.001) and vascular complications (5.0 vs. 2.1%, p = 0.03). Length of stay was shorter (2 vs. 7 days, p ​< ​0.001) and nonhome discharges were lower (16.2 vs. 56.7%, p ​< ​0.001) with TAVR compared with SAVR. Ninety-day all-cause readmissions were similar between TAVR and SAVR (12.6 vs. 13.3%, p = 0.78).
This nationwide observational analysis found that TAVR is increasingly performed among women aged 18-50 years with lower in-hospital mortality and resource utilization and similar readmissions compared with SAVR."

The co-occurrence of methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus septicemia and penetrating aortic ulcer in this population is rare, posing notable therapeutic challenges.
A case of a 73-year-old male end-stage renal disease hemodialysis patient was analyzed. The patient presented with left flank pain, nausea, and anorexia. Diagnoses and treatment adjustments were based on laboratory tests, computed tomography angiography, and serial monitoring of biomarkers and imaging.
Laboratory tests showed severe inflammation (white blood cell: 23.95 × 10⁹/L; C-reactive protein: 196.06 mg/L; procalcitonin: 21.15 ng/mL) and methicillin-sensitive S. aureus bacteremia. computed tomography angiography revealed abdominal aortic ulcer with bilateral renal artery stenosis. Initial meropenem/linezolid was switched to vancomycin post-culture; further adjustment to piperacillin-tazobactam/moxifloxacin followed ulcer progression. The patient refused surgery, received conservative treatment, and had Candida albicans superinfection on hospital day 20 (treated with fluconazole). He was discharged with reduced inflammatory markers and resolved symptoms, but follow-up showed ulcer expansion with hematoma (high rupture risk).
Aortic infections in dialysis patients are therapeutically challenging. Serial biomarker monitoring and imaging are crucial for detecting disease progression, even with improved clinical symptoms."

PubMed,aortic stenosis,Transcatheter Aortic Valve Implantation with Anomalous Left Main Origin From Right Coronary Cusp: A Case Report.,Raghad Mohammed Altayyar; Faisal Omar Al-Nasser; Mohamed Ajaz Ghani,10.12659/AJCR.948995,2025-12-01,The American journal of case reports,"BACKGROUND Transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) is a less invasive option for severe aortic stenosis in patients unfit for surgery. Its use has substantially expanded due to its safety profile and clinical efficacy in appropriately selected patients. This report highlights the procedural challenges of managing aortic stenosis in the presence of a rare coronary anomaly. The anomalous origin of the left main coronary artery from the right coronary cusp is uncommon but clinically important because of the potential for adverse outcomes during intervention. This anomaly may increase the risk of coronary obstruction or compromise during valve deployment. Accurate identification and risk mitigation strategies are essential to prevent complications in such cases. CASE REPORT A 70-year-old woman with aortic stenosis was evaluated for progressive exertional dyspnea. Diagnostic echocardiography confirmed severe aortic stenosis. Further assessment with cardiac computed tomography and cardiac catheterization revealed an anomalous origin of the left main coronary artery from the right coronary cusp; no obstructive lesions were identified. The patient successfully underwent TAVI, guided by detailed imaging that informed valve selection and procedural planning to address challenges posed by her unique coronary anatomy. Postprocedural recovery was uneventful, and the patient demonstrated substantial symptomatic improvement at follow-up. CONCLUSIONS This case demonstrates the feasibility and safety of performing TAVI in patients with coronary anomalies. It underscores the importance of precise imaging, coronary protection strategies, and individualized procedural planning to achieve optimal clinical outcomes. Further studies are warranted to develop standardized approaches for managing anatomically complex cases."

To reduce the annular size to allow implantation of the Perceval XL valve, an annular plication technique was employed, involving three horizontal mattress sutures placed at the interleaflet triangles. A totally endoscopic approach via right mini-thoracotomy was utilized. Postoperative echocardiography confirmed excellent valve positioning and no paravalvular leak. The patient recovered uneventfully and remained asymptomatic with good prosthesis function at the 3-year follow-up. This case demonstrated that annular plication enables the safe use of the Perceval valve in patients with a mildly oversized annulus and may expand its applicability in minimally invasive settings."

Transesophageal echocardiography (TOE) allows direct aortic valve area (AVA) planimetry (AVATOE), while computed tomography angiography (CTA) offers a non-invasive alternative (AVACTA). This study aimed to evaluate the correlation between AVA measurements across modalities and to determine a diagnostic AVACTA threshold for severe AS.
This retrospective study included a single-center derivation cohort of 176 patients (mean age 80.0 ± 7.7 years, 52.8% male) with moderate to severe AS who underwent full-cycle CTA, TTE, and TOE. AVACTA was measured by two independent raters. Correlation with AVATOE and other parameters was assessed. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis was used to define an optimal AVACTA threshold for severe AS, which was validated in a multi-center cohort of 407 patients (mean age 80.9 ± 6.7 years, 52.8% male) with comparable characteristics.
Mean AVACTA was 0.96 ± 0.28 cm² with a high interrater reliability (IRR = 0.84), compared to a mean AVATOE of 0.88 ± 0.26 cm² (Pearson's r = 0.73). ROC analysis identified 0.96 cm² as the optimal AVACTA threshold for diagnosing severe AS (AUC = 0.846; sensitivity = 71.7%; specificity = 89.8%) compared to TOE grading. This threshold yielded good diagnostic performance in the validation cohort (AUC = 0.817; sensitivity = 78.2%; specificity = 72.6%).
AVACTA demonstrated high reliability, showing a strong correlation with AVATOE. The 0.96 cm² threshold, defined in the derivation cohort, performed well in the validation cohort for assessing aortic stenosis severity."

The valve-to-annulus area ratio (VTAAR) may improve AS severity assessment. This study evaluates AVA CT ≤ 1.2 cm² and VTAAR thresholds in severe AS patients. We retrospectively analyzed consecutive patients who underwent transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) for severe symptomatic AS at a tertiary center. AVA CT was measured via mid-systolic planimetry, and VTAAR was calculated as AVA CT divided by annular area. Severe AS was determined by Structural Heart Team consensus based on transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) and supplementary imaging. Among 343 patients (mean age 79.7 ± 8.4 years, 55.4% male), AVA CT was ≤ 1.2 cm² in 241 (70.3%) and > 1.2 cm² in 102 (29.7%). Applying a VTAAR cutoff of ≤ 0.3 improved CT sensitivity, identifying severe AS in 307 patients (89.5%) meeting either AVA CT ≤ 1.2 cm² or VTAAR ≤ 0.3. This approach reclassified 62 of 102 patients (61%) with AVA CT > 1.2 cm², with greater sensitivity in those with left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) < 50%, mean aortic valve pressure gradient < 40 mmHg, and patients with body surface area (BSA) > 1.95 m2. AVA CT ≤ 1.2 cm² alone is not a sensitive marker for severe AS. Adding VTAAR ≤ 0.3 enhances CT's sensitivity, particularly in low gradient AS and large BSA patients. If validated prospectively, these CT metrics could aid AS severity assessment when TTE is inconclusive."

It explores the efficacy, safety, and practical considerations of mavacamten use, while highlighting evolving indications and future directions.
Randomized trials have shown that mavacamten significantly reduces left ventricular outflow tract gradients, improves symptoms and exercise capacity, and induces structural reverse remodeling with a favorable safety profile. Real-world data confirm these benefits in broader patient populations. Pharmacogenetic variability, titration protocols, and cost-effectiveness analyses have further refined its clinical use. Mavacamten represents a paradigm shift in oHCM treatment by targeting disease at its sarcomeric origin. Its integration into routine care is expanding, supported by real-world evidence. Ongoing studies will clarify its role in non-obstructive HCM, heart failure with preserved ejection fraction, pediatric populations, and early-stage disease."

Heart & vasculature,"Although prior studies have linked frailty and accelerated biological aging to aortic stenosis, comprehensive evidence across the spectrum of degenerative valvular diseases (VHD) and related clinical events remains unclear in middle-aged adults.
We analyzed 408,783 UK Biobank participants free of baseline valvular disease. Biological age accelerations (BAA) measures were derived from clinical traits using Phenotypic Age (PhenoAge) algorithm and the Klemera-Doubal method Biological Age (KDM-BA). Outcomes included incident aortic stenosis (AS), aortic regurgitation (AR), mitral regurgitation (MR), and related interventions or mortality.
Over a median follow-up of 13.9 years, 10,364 incident degenerative VHD events (2.5 %) were documented, comprising 4602 AS, 1678 AS-related events, 1639 AR, and 4903 MR cases. Elevated BAA was significantly associated with higher AS risk. For PhenoAge, adjusted AS incidence rates (per 10,000 person-years; 95 % confidence interval) across quartiles (Q1-Q4) were 3.73 (3.37-4.12), 4.44 (4.05-4.88), 5.11 (4.67-5.59), and 7.79 (7.18-8.46), yielding an adjusted hazard ratio (HR) of 2.15 (1.96-2.35) for Q4. Comparable trends were observed for KDM-BA, with an adjusted HR of 1.98 (1.83-2.15) for Q4 vs Q1. AS-related events followed a similar pattern, with HRs of 1.80 (1.55-2.09) for PhenoAge Q4 and 2.22 (1.94-2.54) for KDM-BA Q4. Significant associations were also found for AR, AR-related events, and MR, but not for MR-related events.
Among middle-aged adults, both BAA metrics were associated with increased risks of degenerative VHD and related adverse events, except for MR-related events. These findings highlight BAA as a potential tool for early risk stratification and targeted prevention."

However, their reliability is hindered by the lack of patient-specific boundary conditions, particularly measured flow rates. This study addresses this knowledge gap by introducing a method for estimating flow division in aortic branches. The geometry of the lesional aorta was first repaired to obtain a near-healthy reference geometry. An iterative CFD simulation was then employed to estimate the flow division in the branches of the diseased aorta. Specifically, empirical boundary conditions from healthy individuals were used to predict the outlet pressures of reference geometry, which were subsequently converted into resistance models. These resistance models were then assigned to the outlets of the diseased aorta to predict the inlet pressure. The discrepancy between the predicted and target inlet pressures was iteratively minimized by adjusting the inlet pressure of the reference model until convergence was achieved. The final flow division in the branches of the diseased aorta was then obtained. The performance of the proposed method was investigated in three patients with aortic dissection or aneurysm. The proposed method predicted lower flow rates in branches with severe stenosis, which was more consistent with physiological expectations. Furthermore, the predicted blood pressure differed significantly from that obtained using the traditional method and was closer to the target values. The proposed method provides a practical solution for specifying boundary conditions in hemodynamic studies when clinically measured flow rates are unavailable."

However, a detailed methodological description that includes the surgical approach and imaging planes is lacking. The aim of this study was to standardize SE performed via a subxiphoid surgical approach and to provide reference values for future research.
SE was performed in 19 female German Landrace pigs under general anesthesia using a defined imaging protocol. After the induction of general anesthesia, a small subxiphoid incision was made to optimize the image quality for SE. The echocardiographic imaging protocol was adapted from human 2D-transthoracic echocardiography and included apical 2-, 3-, and 5-chamber views and Doppler measurements of blood flow and tissue velocities. Furthermore, speckle tracking was used to assess left ventricular (LV) and right ventricular (RV) myocardial deformation.
During SE, the animals were under stable anesthesia with a heart rate of 65 ± 12 beats per minute, and a mean arterial pressure of 88 ± 12 mmHg. Blood gas values were within physiological ranges. High-quality images of both ventricles were consistently achieved using the established imaging protocol. One animal showed a severe aortic stenosis and was excluded from the analysis. The biplane LV stroke volume was 45 ± 13 ml and the LV ejection fraction was 67% ± 11%. LV-global longitudinal strain (GLS) was -22.4% ± 3.3%, and RV free wall longitudinal strain was -23.7% ± 5%. The Vmax of the aortic valve was 1.6 ± 0.3 m/s.
SE offers a standardized and reproducible imaging technique for the assessment of high-quality apical views in swine models. This study provides procedural guidance and reference values for translational research applications."

Accurate valve positioning is critical for successful TAVI, and highly accurate real-time visualization-with minimal use of contrast-is especially important for patients with chronic kidney disease. Under fluoroscopic conditions, which often suffer from low contrast, high noise and artifacts, automatic segmentation of anatomical structures using convolutional neural networks (CNNs) can significantly improve the accuracy of valve positioning. This paper presents a comparative analysis of various CNN architectures for automatic aortic root segmentation on angiographic images, with the aim of optimizing the TAVI process. The experimental evaluation included models such as FPN, U-Net++, DeepLabV3+, LinkNet, MA-Net, and PSPNet, all trained and tested with optimally tuned hyperparameters. During training dynamics, DeepLabV3+ and U-Net++ showed stable convergence with median Dice scores around 0.88. However, when evaluated at the patient level, MA-Net and PSPNet outperformed all other models, achieving Dice coefficients of 0.942 and 0.936, and an average symmetric surface distance of 4.1 mm. The findings underscore the potential of incorporating automatic segmentation methods into decision-support systems for cardiac surgery-reducing contrast agent use, minimizing surgical risks, and improving valve positioning accuracy. Future work will focus on expanding the dataset, exploring additional architectures, and adapting the models for real-time application."

""edgeR"" was used to calculate differentially expressed genes (DEGs) for bulk-RNAseq. GO, KEGG, and GSEA analyses were performed on the DEGs. Aortic valves from 8 AS patients and 8 non-AS patients were collected for proteomic sequencing. After DEG analysis, five algorithms were used to identify hub genes. ROC curves were constructed for the hub genes. Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNAseq) was applied to systematically elaborate the mechanism in AS pathogenesis.
Transcriptome data showed that AS was accompanied by high expression of genes such as MMP9, CXCL8, and SPP1, with significant activation of hypoxia, inflammatory response, and fibrosis. Proteomic sequencing of calcified AS revealed significantly enhanced hypoxic response, TNF-α signaling, and extracellular matrix (ECM) formation. Sixteen hub genes, including ITGB3, ITGAV, and MMP9, were identified by five algorithms, all with high diagnostic efficacy (AUC > 0.75). PCR experiments confirmed that MMP9 and PLAU were highly expressed in calcified aortic valves (P < 0.05). scRNAseq revealed that in highly calcified regions, MMP9 and PLAU were mainly distributed in endothelial cells, monocytes, and macrophages, participating in the differentiation of monocytes and macrophages and relating to lipid metabolism and proinflammatory responses.
The 16 hub genes can assist in the diagnosis of aortic stenosis, and MMP9 and PLAU may participate in AS development by regulating the proinflammatory effects of monocytes and macrophages."

This anatomical configuration posed a high risk of prosthetic valve displacement during conventional transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR). Therefore, we employed a novel TAVR system (Taurus Trio) equipped with a locator, which effectively prevented downward migration of the prosthetic valve after implantation.
This case indicates the potential advantages and efficacy of the Taurus Trio valve in TAVR for AR Post-LVAD. We plan to conduct long-term follow-up to further explore and optimize the treatment protocol."

However, complications like unexpected bleeding may require conversion to median sternotomy, necessitating careful intraoperative manipulation. We report a rare case of left atrial roof injury during robotic mitral valvuloplasty in a 61-year-old woman with severe mitral regurgitation. Cardiopulmonary bypass was established via femoral and jugular vein cannulation. Upon initiation, bleeding was identified from a wire perforation at the left atrial roof. Hemostasis was successfully achieved using a 3-0 Prolene mattress suture. Mitral valve repair and patent foramen ovale closure were completed uneventfully, and the patient was discharged on postoperative day 8. This case highlights the critical importance of meticulous wire handling and comprehensive imaging guidance in minimally invasive cardiac surgery. While the robotic system's visualization aided in repair, the primary lesson underscores the need for robust preventive strategies to avoid such complications."

A 30-year-old man presented with dyspnea, weight loss, and an outpatient transthoracic echocardiogram concerning for infective endocarditis. Transesophageal echocardiography revealed a chordlike structure extending from the limbus of the interatrial septum to the anterior MV leaflet, continuing through the left ventricular outflow tract, across the aortic valve, and into the ascending aorta. These findings were associated with moderate mitral regurgitation and severe aortic regurgitation. Surgical resection confirmed the diagnosis of accessory MV tissue with a left atrial MV accessory chord.
Patients may present with heart failure or malperfusion symptoms due to valvopathy or left ventricular outflow tract obstruction. Multimodal imaging and surgical resection with valve repair are key to diagnosis and management.
Chordal anomalies can mimic endocarditis and cause dual-valve disease. Early transesophageal echocardiography and surgical intervention are critical to avoid misdiagnosis."

This study aimed to evaluate the range of leaflet lesions treatable with one clip during TEER in DMR patients.
We retrospectively analyzed intraoperative echocardiograms from 106 DMR patients undergoing TEER. Logistic regression was used to identify anatomical factors affecting satisfactory results after the first clip. Optimal cut-off values were determined using Receiver-operator characteristics (ROC) curve analysis and subsequently validated with follow-up data.
Forty-three patients achieved satisfactory result after the first clip. Multivariate analysis identified prolapse width (p < 0.001) and prolapse gap (p = 0.039) as independent predictors for satisfactory result after the first clip. ROC analysis showed superior predictive value for prolapse width (AUC = 0.877 vs. 0.734). The optimal prolapse width cut-off value was 14 mm when the Youden index reached maximum value of 0.699 (sensitivity 0.746, specificity 0.953). Patients with width > 14 mm had significantly higher adverse event rates (Log-rank, Breslow, Tarone-Ware p = 0.007, 0.007, 0.006). Consistent results were also obtained in the subgroup of patients finished TEER with 1 clip (Log-rank, Breslow, Tarone-Ware p = 0.065, 0.030, 0.038).
Prolapse width is a key independent predictor of outcomes after the first clip implantation in TEER procedure. The incidence of postoperative severe adverse events is higher in patients with a prolapse width exceeding 14 mm, regardless of the number of clips implanted."

Performance of current risk prediction models based on organ morbidity is only moderate.
The frailty domains exhaustion, slowness, inactivity, weakness, and unintentional weight loss were prospectively assessed in patients undergoing PMVR. The association with mortality and heart failure hospitalization (HFH) during a median follow-up of 506 days was examined and relevant domains were assessed for additive predictive performance over the MitraScore.
Five hundred twenty-four patients were included in the study (mean age [SD]: 77 (9) years, 54.6% male). The risk of mortality and mortality/HFH were significantly increased in patients with exhaustion (hazard ratio: 2.24 [95% CI: 1.63-3.08]/1.83 [1.21-2.77]), slowness (2.74 [1.75-4.30]/1.92 [1.34-2.75]), inactivity (1.96 [1.26-3.05]/1.61 [1.12-2.31]) and weakness (1.83 [1.12-2.96]/1.34 [0.92-1.95]), but not in patients with weight loss (1.24 [0.80-1.92]/1.12 [0.78-1.61]). A simplified frailty (S-frailty) measure derived from the domains exhaustion and slowness was associated with mortality (4.45 [2.42-8.19]) and mortality/HFH (2.60 [1.64-4.13]) independently of clinical risk factors and the MitraScore, respectively. Prediction of mortality by the MitraScore was significantly improved when adding S-frailty (Harrell's C 0.645 vs. 0.700, p = 0.002). Classification of 1-year mortality risk by the MitraScore improved when adding S-frailty (net reclassification index 0.21, p = 0.012 and integrated discrimination index 0.07, p < 0.001).
A simplified frailty measure comprising self-reported exhaustion and gait speed significantly improved risk prediction in patients undergoing PMVR. Assessment of frailty measures should be part of the decision-making process and multiparametric risk scores in patients with severe mitral regurgitation."

The aim of the study was to assess the prevalence of MR and tricuspid regurgitation (TR), valvular thickening, and prolapse in a group of apparently healthy Chihuahua dogs.
Ninety-seven privately owned Chihuahua dogs, recruited via the Swedish Chihuahua Club, were included in the study. A prospective observational study was conducted where clinical examinations, electrocardiograms, and echocardiographic and Doppler examinations were performed in all dogs.
Mitral regurgitation was found in 37 (38%) dogs and was considered mild in 31 dogs, moderate in four dogs, and severe in two dogs. A systolic murmur over the mitral valve area was heard in 21 (22%) dogs. Mitral valve thickening was observed in 36 (37%) and mitral valve prolapse in 12 (12%) dogs. Tricuspid valve regurgitation was present in 14 (14%) of all dogs and in 30% of dogs with MR. Dogs with MR were significantly older (median: 7.6 years) than dogs without MR (median: 3 years); P < 0.0001.
Whether or not the presence of MR reflects early stages of myxomatous mitral valve disease cannot be ascertained without the use of histological examination of the mitral valves.
Mitral regurgitation was common in this group of apparently healthy Chihuahua dogs, and at the age of 6.4 years, there is a 50% chance that a dog has developed MR. In the age group 9-10 years, MR was found in 80% of the dogs."

Examination revealed tachycardia and a loud murmur with thrills over the pulmonary area, along with features of pulmonary oedema. Nasopharyngeal polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test confirmed COVID-19 infection. Transthoracic echocardiography demonstrated turbulent left-to-right shunting at the great artery level, mild functional mitral and tricuspid regurgitation, and elevated pulmonary artery systolic pressure. Computed tomography pulmonary angiography identified a ruptured SoVa with a fistulous connection to the pulmonary artery, associated right upper lobe pulmonary embolism, and pulmonary congestion. Initial management included corticosteroids and antivirals for COVID-19, broad-spectrum antibiotics for suspected infective endocarditis, and diuretics. Progressive cardiac dysfunction necessitated percutaneous closure of the fistula using an 8-mm occluder device, achieving prompt haemodynamic stabilisation. Subsequently, the patient developed severe aortic regurgitation, aortic root dilatation, and right ventricular dysfunction, requiring urgent aortic root replacement with a tissue prosthesis and right ventricular repair. Persistent postoperative pyrexia and elevated inflammatory markers despite sterile blood cultures prompted histopathological evaluation, which revealed necrotising granulomatous inflammation with multinucleated giant cells, which couldn't rule out giant-cell aortitis. A rheumatological review uncovered recurrent oral and genital ulceration, confirming Behçet's disease as the underlying aetiology. Immunosuppressive therapy with corticosteroids, infliximab, and azathioprine, together with treatment for latent tuberculosis (TB), resulted in full clinical remission. At one-year follow-up, ventricular function and prosthetic valve performance remained preserved with no evidence of recurrent aneurysmal change or inflammatory activity. This case highlights the complex interplay between structural cardiac pathology, infection, and systemic vasculitis, underscoring the importance of multidisciplinary evaluation and targeted immunosuppressive therapy."

Although most MR involves central A2P2 jets, a subset present with noncentral jets, which may introduce procedural complexity and influence outcomes. The objective of the study was to evaluate the impact of main MR jet location (central [A2P2] versus noncentral [A1/P1 or A3/P3]) on procedural success and clinical outcomes following M-TEER.
This analysis used the EXPANDed data set, which included patients undergoing M-TEER with MitraClip G3/G4 systems and echocardiographic core laboratory-assessed main MR jet location. One-year clinical, echocardiographic, and functional outcomes were assessed.
A total of 1785 patients had main jets at A2P2 and 81 at A1P1 or A3P3 (non-A2P2). Non-A2P2 patients more frequently had degenerative MR, prior mitral valve procedures, and better left ventricular function. Procedural success was high and comparable (A2P2: 95.9%, non-A2P2: 92.5%; p = 0.15), with low 30-day major adverse event rates in both (A2P2: 4.2%, non-A2P2: 7.4%; p = 0.16). MR ≤ 1+ was achieved in both groups at 1 year (A2P2: 91%, non-A2P2: 84%, p = 0.11). New York Heart Association class ≤ II improved through 1 year in both groups (A2P2: 81%, non-A2P2: 88%). Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire overall summary improved significantly with no difference between groups at 1 year (A2P2: Δ13 points, non-A2P2: Δ20 points). One-year all-cause mortality was similar (10.7 vs. 13.7%; p = 0.47).
In this largest analysis to date of patients with severe MR, main MR jet location did not affect the safety or effectiveness of the MitraClip system. These findings support the use of M-TEER across a range of anatomical presentations, including non-A2P2 MR jets."

Infections with Haemophilus, Aggregatibacter, Cardiobacterium, Eikenella, Kingella (HACEK) organisms are a well-known but rare cause of infective endocarditis (IE), which may be difficult to detect. Bacterial infections are more common in patients with cirrhosis, which may complicate the interpretation of clinical findings.
The patient is a 44-year-old male with alcoholic cirrhosis who presented with hematuria, proteinuria, and acute kidney injury (AKI), with negative blood cultures. Kidney biopsy revealed ICM-MPGN, with no underlying etiology identified. His clinical course was complicated by recurrent fluid overload with AKI requiring dialysis. Following corticosteroid therapy for ICM-MPGN, he developed Aggregatibacter bacteremia associated with worsening mitral regurgitation but without vegetations. After antibiotic therapy, the mitral valve was replaced and showed healed endocarditis. Following prolonged antibiotic therapy and successful surgical intervention, his kidney function improved and he remains dialysis independent.
This case highlights the role of HACEK organisms causing subclinical and difficult to diagnose IE, the increased risk of infection in patients with cirrhosis, and the need for a thorough evaluation for infectious etiologies in patients with ICM-MPGN prior to immunosuppressive therapy."

We retrospectively reviewed 24 patients who underwent MVR with mechanical prostheses before the age of 3 years between 1996 and 2019. Underlying diagnoses included isolated congenital mitral regurgitation (n=4), congenital mitral stenosis (n=4), and various congenital heart defects (n=16). The median follow-up duration was 9.8 years (interquartile range [IQR], 7.3-13.2 years).
The median age and weight at MVR were 16.6 months (IQR, 5.3-24.7 months) and 7.6 kg (IRQ, 4.9-9.5 kg), respectively. The median prosthesis size was 19 mm (range, 16-29 mm). Supra-annular implantation was performed in 12 patients (50%), who were significantly younger and smaller at the time of surgery and received smaller prostheses than those receiving annular implants. Early mortality occurred in 2 patients (8.3%), and 2 late deaths were recorded. The overall survival rate was 83.3% at 15 years. Redo MVR was performed in 9 patients during follow-up. The median increase in valve size was 4 mm. The interval from initial to redo MVR was positively correlated with the increase in valve size (Spearman ρ=0.64, p=0.07). Freedom from redo MVR was 86.3% at 5 years and 75.8% at 10 years.
MVR with mechanical prostheses in children under 3 years of age can yield acceptable long-term survival, although redo MVR is often required. Mechanical MVR remains a viable salvage option in small children when valve repair is not feasible."

We investigated whether the disproportion between LV size and prosthetic annulus dimension predicts long-term MR recurrence and adverse LV remodelling after restrictive annuloplasty.
This retrospective study included 445 patients with asDMR (stages C2-D) who underwent MV repair with either the Medtronic CG Future or Edwards Physio II annuloplasty prosthesis between 2005 and 2019. The ratio of LV end-systolic diameter (LVESD) to prosthetic orifice area (POA) quantified LV-annulus mismatch. Recurrent MR (≥grade 2) was the primary endpoint, with death treated as a competing risk. The optimal LVESD/POA threshold was derived using maximally selected rank statistics. Propensity-score matching (1:1) adjusted for baseline differences and longitudinal LV changes was analysed by generalised least-squares modelling.
During a median follow-up of 6.0 years, 15.5% of patients developed recurrent MR and 10.6% died. LVESD/POA was independently associated with recurrence (adjusted subdistribution HR 1.95, 95% CI 1.65 to 2.30; p<0.001). A threshold of 12.25 mm/cm² identified a 'mismatch' cohort with higher 5-year cumulative MR recurrence (30% vs 14%, p=0.02) and faster postoperative LV re-enlargement compared with the non-mismatch group. These findings were consistent after propensity matching. Mortality did not differ between groups.
In patients with asDMR, a larger LVESD-to-POA ratio identifies those at elevated risk of recurrent regurgitation and progressive LV remodelling after repair. Preoperative echocardiographic assessment of LV-annulus proportionality may help optimise prosthesis sizing and improve long-term durability of MV repair. Prospective multicentre validation is warranted.

Its invasive nature, however, limits its wide use. Hence the need for non-invasive methods in patients with hepar venostaticum due to right ventricular [RV] failure: one of them is the FIB4 index. Another method, Fibroscan, is based on an ultrasound technique from elastography.
to assess the correlation and determination indices between the FIB4 index and the assessment of liver stiffness by Fibroscan (E) on one hand and echocardiographic parameters describing RV function on the other hand. The study group: 33 patients (74 ± 13 years) with heart failure due to pulmonary hypertension, arterial hypertension, valvular diseases, myocardial infarction or cardiomyopathy.
echocardiography - RV dimension 38 ± 8 mm, systolic pressure in pulmonary artery (SPAP) 53 ± 24 mmHg, tricuspid annular plane systolic excursion (TAPSE) 17 ± 4mm, acceleration time of flow through the pulmonary valve (ACT) 79 ± 23 ms, the degree of tricuspid valve regurgitation 2 ± 1; the FIB4 result in this group - 2.54 ± 1.19, and the stiffness index E: 13.79 ± 12.55 kPa. Only RV dimension and the degree of tricuspid valve regurgitation showed moderately strong positive correlation with the stiffness index E: the correlation index - 0.327 and 0.382, respectively, with the determination index 27.9% and 43.4%, respectively.
The results emphasize the relationship between the morphological remodeling of the RV and the degree of secondary tricuspid regurgitation and the advancement of fibrotic changes in the liver and encourage the continuation of studies on larger groups of patients with a homogeneous etiology of RV failure, using a wider spectrum of echocardiographic parameters."

Aortic regurgitation (AR) is the predominant valvular lesion. When AR precedes characteristic mucocutaneous symptoms, misdiagnosis and treatment delays often occur.
We, herein, report the case of a 37-year-old male presenting with isolated aortic regurgitation (AR) as the initial manifestation of Behçet's disease (BD). Initial echocardiography revealed severe eccentric AR with left coronary cusp prolapse and a vegetation-like lesion, raising suspicion of infective endocarditis; however, relapsed oral ulcers developed postoperatively, ultimately confirming BD diagnosis. Despite successful aortic valve replacement, delayed diagnosis due to absent early mucocutaneous symptoms contributed to catastrophic prosthetic valve dehiscence with severe paravalvular leak. The patient underwent an emergency Bentall procedure with venoarterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (VAECMO) support but succumbed to cardiogenic shock and multiorgan failure. Pathological analysis demonstrated tissue necrosis with minimal inflammation.
Isolated AR may be BD's initial manifestation, preceding classic symptoms by months. Echocardiographic features, including valve prolapse and perivalvular lesions, despite their non-specificity, should prompt screening for BD. Inherent tissue fragility in BD significantly elevates postoperative risks of paravalvular leak and prosthetic valve dehiscence. Early identification, optimal surgical procedure, and timely immunosuppressive therapy are essential to improve the prognosis of cardiac BD."

Hepatic rupture due to infective endocarditis is even less common.
We report a pregnant woman at 32 weeks gestation without hypertension and underlying hepatobiliary disease who underwent mechanical mitral valve replacement for infective endocarditis. Low molecular weight heparin 0.4 ml q12h was used, and it was changed to warfarin on the third postoperative day (POD). On POD5, the patient developed liver rupture and intrauterine fetal death. After accepting blood transfusion, the hemoglobin level still decreased. On POD6, we performed an exploratory laparotomy and found a rupture in the right lobe of the liver, followed by liver rupture repair packing and cesarean section. But the patient still had obviours abdominal drainage. At night, the interventional radiologist performed an emergency liver arteriography, which revealed bleeding from the right hepatic artery branch, and interventional embolization was performed. Finally, the hemodynamics became stable. The patient was discharged 2 weeks later. Three months after surgery, an enhanced CT scan indicated that the liver had basically returned to normal.
Infection can lead to liver rupture in pregnancy without high blood pressure. Appropriate targeted antibiotic therapy is essential and should be accompanied by prompt surgical or endovascular treatment to improve maternal and fetal outcomes."

This study aims to assess the ability of DD against NT-proBNP and frailty to predict all-cause mortality, cardiovascular mortality, and a first unplanned hospitalization in older adults.
Secondary analysis of the observational population-based BELFRAIL cohort of patients aged ≥ 80 years with cardiac echography at inclusion. Patients were included if LVEF ≥ 50% and without severe valvular disease. DD was defined if 50% of the criteria of the American Society of Echocardiography were fulfilled (average E/e'>14, septal e' velocity < 7 cm/s or lateral < 10 cm/s, tricuspid velocity > 2.8 m/s, left atrial volume index > 34ml/m2), elevated NT-proBNP as a level ≥ 400ng/mL, and frailty as Fried Frailty Index ≥ 3. Multivariable Cox regression was used to adjust the hazard of mortality (all-cause and cardiovascular) and unplanned hospitalizations. A hierarchical decision tree was computed using classification and regression trees (CART).
Of the 393 patients (mean age 85 years [SD 3,6], 257 (65%) women), 185 (47%) had DD, 76 (19%) an elevated NT-proBNP, and 50 (13%) were frail. During 5.1 ± 0.2 years, 143 (36%) patients died, of whom 55 (14%) from CV causes. Crude mortality was worse (log-rank p < 0.05) for patients with DD (HR 1.48 [1.07-2.06]), elevated NT-proBNP (2.07 [HR 1.44-2.97]) or frailty (HR 3.02 [2.05-4.47]). After adjustment, DD predicted only CV mortality (HR 1.84 [1.03-3.31]). NT-proBNP predicted both all-cause (HR 1.52 [1.03-2.24]) and CV mortality (HR 2.16 [1.20-3.87]). Frailty predicted all-cause mortality (HR 2.10 [1.38-3.21]) and the first unplanned hospitalization (HR 1.62 [1.08 - 2.42]). Regarding CART, frailty was the root node for both predicting the risk of all-cause mortality and a first unplanned hospitalization. NT-proBNP was the root node in the CV mortality tree, followed by frailty.
Compared to NT-proBNP and frailty, DD offers limited added value in risk stratification for older people with preserved ejection fraction and no valvular disease. Frailty emerged as the strongest and most consistent predictor of mortality and hospitalization, and was central in the all-cause mortality and hospitalization decision-tree models."

Aging disrupts mitochondrial function through impaired oxidative phosphorylation, excessive reactive oxygen species generation, mitochondrial DNA mutations, endoplasmic reticulum stress, mitochondrial enzyme dysregulation, and impaired calcium homeostasis. These alterations drive endothelial dysfunction, arterial stiffening, cardiac remodeling, and ultimately exacerbate age-related cardiovascular decline. Despite extensive research, the precise mechanisms by which mitochondrial aging impairs the function of endothelial cells, vascular smooth muscle cells, and cardiomyocytes remain poorly understood. Therefore, this review synthesizes current evidence on how aging-associated mitochondrial dysfunction contributes to endothelial dysfunction, arterial stiffening and remodeling, and cardiac dysfunction. It also outlines emerging pathophysiological mechanisms linking mitochondrial dysfunction to age-related CVDs, offering insights into potential therapeutic targets to promote cardiovascular health in aging populations. This review highlights key biomarkers of declining mitochondrial function to facilitate early diagnosis of CVD-related mitochondrial dysfunction. We show that aging disrupts key regulators of mitochondrial dynamics and quality control in the vasculature and heart across human studies and preclinical models of aging. Recent evidence indicates that impaired mitochondrial function in aging cardiomyocytes results in valvular degeneration, left ventricular hypertrophy, diastolic dysfunction, atrial fibrillation, and diminished exercise capacity. Therefore, understanding the pathophysiological mechanisms linking mitochondrial dysfunction to cardiovascular aging may guide the development of new therapeutic strategies for mitigating age-related cardiovascular decline in older adults."

We recently extended the indications for HMPs to preoperative patients with tetralogy of Fallot (ToF). Thus, our purpose was to evaluate the current practice of home monitoring for preoperative patients with ToF, emphasizing the early detection of hypoxic spell events and the prevention of preoperative attrition. Furthermore, we sought to identify the risk factors for unplanned urgent operations during the home monitoring period and to evaluate the effects of these unplanned operations on long-term outcomes after repair.
Among 126 consecutive patients born with ToF between January 2020 and December 2021, 100 (59 boys) were enrolled in the preoperative HMP group. The risk factors for unplanned urgent operations during HMP were assessed using Cox regression.
The parents of 1 patient chose to undergo surgery at another hospital. Elective operations were performed in 79 patients (group 1, repair n = 74, systemic-to-pulmonary shunt n = 5) at a median age of 4 months (interquartile range [IQR], 3.5-4.9 months). In contrast, unplanned urgent operations were performed on 20 patients (group 2, repair n = 10, systemic-to-pulmonary shunt n = 10) at a median age of 1.2 months (IQR, 1.1-2.0 months). Risk factors for decreased time to unplanned urgent operations included a smaller pulmonary valve annulus (PVA) Z-score on follow-up echocardiography before surgery (P = .013; hazard ratio, 1.90 per 1 decrease) and lower daily minimum peripheral oxygen saturation (SpO2) (P < .001; hazard ratio, 1.16 per 1% decrease). There were no deaths. Complete repair was eventually performed on all patients (n = 99) at a median age of 4.1 months (IQR, 3.4-5.4 months), with PVA preservation in 95 patients (96%). Freedom from significant pulmonary stenosis or regurgitation at 24 months postrepair was similar between the 2 groups (P = .93).
Patients with preoperative ToF frequently require urgent unplanned operations, especially those with lower daily minimum SpO2 and insufficient postnatal PVA growth."

Although these findings can significantly support clinical decision-making, the large number of available studies renders an overview of this topic challenging. In this review, we provide a comprehensive overview of the currently identified factors associated with increased mortality after TEER. We also summarize the current evidence on published risk scores that stratify mortality risk after M-TEER and T-TEER. We aimed to provide clinical decision-making support for optimal patient selection and referral to TEER and to identify remaining gaps in evidence."

Cardiovascular complications, including arterial wall stiffness, and valvular dysfunction, are major causes of morbidity and mortality. Conventional cardiovascular risk tools are unreliable in MPS, and the role of vascular imaging remains underdefined.
This systematic review evaluated vascular complications in paediatric and adult MPS patients, focusing on carotid intimal-media thickness (CIMT) and functional vascular parameters (e.g. carotid cross-sectional compliance (cCSC), carotid incremental elastic modulus (cIEM), carotid cross-sectional distensibility (cCSD)), to assess their utility for cardiovascular risk stratification.
A systematic search of MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Cochrane Library was conducted (inception-July 2025). Eligible studies reported vascular outcomes in MPS types I, II, III, IV, VI, or VII using imaging or functional measures. Risk of bias was assessed using ROBINS-I for observational studies and RoB 2.0 for the single randomised trial.
Eight studies comprising 224 patients were included. CIMT was consistently increased across subtypes, with adult values frequently observed in childhood, indicating accelerated vascular pathology. Patients demonstrated reduced arterial compliance, increased arterial stiffness, and a high prevalence of mitral and aortic valvular disease. Enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) and haematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) showed partial attenuation of vascular pathology.
CIMT and vascular stiffness are sensitive markers of subclinical vasculopathy in MPS where conventional cardiovascular risk tools may remain unreliable. Standardised vascular imaging and biomarker development are needed to improve risk stratification and long-term outcomes (particularly in adults)."

Six codes were generated from the analysis of 234 active participant accounts analysis and synthesized into three themes: participant affect; participant cognition and participant confidence.
The peer observer role can experience simulation as an immersive and emotive encounter that may indicate active and deep learning is occurring. Simulation learning design should prioritize the identification of empathy experienced by observers for the participants and explicitly include it in cognitive processing undertaken during simulation debrief. Linking the experience of empathy with nursing theory in simulation is a powerful learning tool."

This study investigates the limitations of ""off-the-shelf"" models in the context of skin lesion classification using the DermaMNIST dataset. Through a systematic evaluation of 35 architectural configurations across varying image resolutions and depths, the analysis reveals that mid-depth architectures (3-4 layers) and intermediate resolutions ( 128 × 128  ) achieve the best balance between accuracy and generalization. The top-performing RevNet-layer3 model (accuracy = 0.766) significantly outperforms deeper ResNet baselines (p < 0.05), demonstrating that increased depth or resolution does not guarantee improved medical domain performance. Beyond accuracy metrics, this study introduces a cross-architectural interpretability framework that compares Grad-CAM heatmaps between ""Win"" and ""Lose"" models, supported by quantitative perceptual metrics such as fractal dimension, entropy, and symmetry. The results show that fractal dimension consistently discriminates between effective and ineffective attention patterns, offering a more objective measure of model interpretability. These findings challenge the assumption of a universal top-performing model and highlight the need for domain-specific architectural probing and interpretability-driven evaluation.

This study systematically compares centralized learning (CL) and federated learning (FL) approaches for the semantic segmentation of these regions using multi-institutional DISE video data. A convolutional neural network (CNN)-based segmentation model was trained and evaluated for both learning paradigms. The results consistently showed that the CL approach achieved statistically significantly higher segmentation performance across all metrics-precision, recall, accuracy, and Dice similarity coefficient (DSC)-for both the velum and OTE regions compared with FL. For the velum region, CL achieved a DSC of 85.91 ± 1.01%, compared with FL's 81.78 ± 0.58%. Similarly, for the OTE region, CL achieved an average DSC of 87.04 ± 0.41%, whereas FL achieved 85.20 ± 0.25%. Further analysis revealed that while both models struggled with ambiguous boundaries and anatomical variability-particularly for the tongue base-the epiglottis and oropharynx lateral wall were segmented with higher accuracy. These findings underscore the need for advanced techniques in FL, such as improved optimization algorithms and methods to address data heterogeneity, to narrow the performance gap with CL. This study provides foundational insights for developing more robust and clinically applicable deep learning models for upper airway analysis, emphasizing the importance of future research into advanced FL strategies and real-world validation."

A DDoS attack is a mischievous try to interrupt the usual traffic of a target server, network, or service by overcoming the aim or its nearby framework with an overflow of Internet traffic. Then, numerous classification methods are applied in many research and are targeted to identify and resolve the attack of DDoS. DDoS attacks are implemented simply by utilizing the network's flaws and by making desires for software services. The real-time detection of attacks is challenging to identify and alleviate. However, this solution is valuable as these attacks may lead to significant problems. Several deep learning (DL) methods are advanced to locate and analyze DDoS attacks. This study proposes a novel Intelligent Framework for Attack Detection Using Salp Swarm-Based Feature Selection and Deep Learning Architecture (IFAD-SSFSDLA) model. This paper aims to deliver a real-time DDoS attack detection system utilizing advanced optimization algorithms. As a primary step, the IFAD-SSFSDLA technique utilizes min-max normalization for the data pre-processing to transform, clean, and organize raw data into the structured pattern. In addition, the Salp swarm algorithm (SSA) is employed in the feature selection process to detect and maintain the most significant features to improve the model performance. The IFAD-SSFSDLA model implements the temporal convolutional network (TCN) method for the attack classification.

Despite their clinical significance, current methods to assess these biomarkers rely on invasive postoperative immunohistochemistry (IHC), delaying critical treatment decisions and limiting preoperative planning. While deep learning have revolutionized biomarker prediction in brain tumors, their application to spinal ependymomas remains underexplored due to the rarity of these tumors, insufficient datasets, and the technical challenges of analyzing spinal cord MRI. We used a deep learning model to predict molecular markers for spinal ependymomas using preoperative magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans and clinical information to predict biomarkers for spinal ependymoma.
This study enrolled 352 patients with preoperative MRI, confirmed histological diagnoses of spinal ependymomas, and Ki-67 and p53 status assessed via IHC. Cross-validation and external testing strategies ensured the generalizability of the results. We harnessed multimodal information by integrating the sagittal and transverse MRI phases with clinical data. MRI scans were automatically segmented to extract high-quality features. These features were used to train an ensemble neural network model, Light Gradient Boosting Machine Net (LGBMNet), which predicted the expression of Ki-67 and p53 biomarkers. To validate model architecture and input choice, we conducted ablation and comparison experiments across multiple classifiers and feature subsets.
High-precision automatic image segmentation was achieved using the SegFormer model. LGBMNet showed superior predictive power in cross-validation for Ki-67 and p53, with area under the receiver operating characteristic curves (AUCs) of 0.8904 and 0.8948, and externally validated with AUCs of 0.8348 and 0.8521, respectively. The full multimodal LGBMNet model consistently outperformed reduced and classical variants, highlighting the added value of neural-enhanced fusion.
This study developed a deep learning framework for non-invasive prediction of Ki-67 and p53 in spinal ependymomas, integrating multimodal MRI and clinical data. The SegFormer model achieved high-precision segmentation, ensuring robust feature extraction. LGBMNet, combining Multilayer Perceptron and Light Gradient Boosting Machine, demonstrated strong predictive performance.

Furthermore, the spatial compactness of impervious surfaces declined, with urban expansion patterns shifting from leapfrog and edge expansion to infilling after 2016. These findings emphasise the need for strategic urban planning to enhance land-use efficiency and promote sustainable development, offering valuable insights for urban expansion mapping in other cities."

However, the systematic exploration remains impeded by the astronomic dimensionality of sequence space. Here, we present a platform that synergizes deep experimental screening with deep learning to decode interaction plasticity. By developing a ribosome display stripped of all known ribosome termination and rescue functions, we produce a comprehensive dataset comprising 47.8 million unique peptides spanning a broad spectrum of Streptactin-binding activity. A deep learning architecture, systematically trained on sequence context, enrichment dynamics, and subsequence abundance, achieves high accuracy (Pearson's r = 0.902) on predicting Streptactin-binding activity. Through sequence dimensionality reduction, exhaustive subsequence elucidation, and enriched motif elicitation, we identify 799 strong-binding sequences containing a canonical motif and 219 sequences harboring novel motifs with divergent docking conformations. These findings reveal an unanticipated depth and breadth in protein-binding plasticity. We propose that this integrated experimental-AI framework will facilitate the systematic exploration of protein interactions and enable the data-driven design of synthetic peptides."
PubMed,deep learning,A novel liver image classification network for accurate diagnosis of liver diseases.,Xiaolei He; Xilong Wang; Yan Wang; Hui Li; Shuo Liu; Jun Wang; Yan Feng; Qi Wang; Jie Chen,10.1038/s41598-025-17581-2,2025-12-02,Scientific reports,"In medical imaging diagnosis, the identification of normal liver, fatty liver, and cirrhosis is often challenging due to subtle morphological and density differences. Previous studies have used CNNs, MLPs or transformers to extract lesion features. However, CNN's global representation is limited, while MLPs and transformers have insufficient local modeling, resulting in insufficient lesion information mining. Therefore, this article proposes a hybrid network CMT-Net, which unifies the local perception of CNNs, high-dimensional mapping of MLPs, and global dependencies of Transformers into a single architecture, significantly improving the accuracy of CT liver three classification. The core components of CMT-Net include an efficient transformer (ET) module, which focuses on extracting local feature details while progressively integrating global information, significantly enhancing the model feature representation and generalization capabilities. Additionally, this paper introduces a Hybrid MLP (HM) module that combines Token-Mixing MLP and Channel-Mixing MLP to achieve deep fusion of spatial and channel information, further improving feature extraction. To validate the proposed algorithm, extensive experiments were conducted on a dataset of three liver diseases collected from the Imaging Department of Urumqi People's Hospital. The results demonstrate that CMT-Net achieves outstanding performance in classifying normal liver, fatty liver, and cirrhosis. These findings not only provide an effective tool for precise liver disease diagnosis but also offer new directions for deep learning model design in medical image classification tasks."
PubMed,deep learning,Prediction of recurrence after resection in hepatocellular carcinoma via whole liver deep learning on preoperative contrast-enhanced CT.,Chao Huang; Yu Tian; Qi Zhang; Yiwei Gao; Peijun Hu; Yangyang Wang; Yingying Xu; Jing Liu; Weibin Wang; Tianshu Zhou; Mu Zhou; Jingsong Li,10.1038/s41598-025-26933-x,2025-12-02,Scientific reports,"This study aimed to develop a fully automated survival prediction (FASP) system that analyzes whole-liver regions from preoperative contrast-enhanced CT scans for predicting recurrence-free survival (RFS) after curative resection in Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). FASP comprised three consecutive components: automatic liver and tumor segmentation models, and a RFS prediction model, LiverSurv, all based on deep convolutional neural networks. FASP was compared against a clinical model leveraging clinical factors and three tumor-based methods using semantic, radiomic, or deep learning features. A total of 827 patients were included across the development, internal test, and external test sets. In the internal and external test sets, FASP achieved concordance indices (C-indices) of 0.646 (95% CI: 0.566, 0.725) and 0.786 (95% CI: 0.726, 0.846), respectively, outperforming the clinical model (both adjusted P<.05). Integrating clinical factors improved C-indices to 0.664 (95% CI: 0.591, 0.736) internally and 0.800 (95% CI: 0.750, 0.849) externally. FASP also surpassed the tumor-based models, which yielded C-indices ranging from 0.623 to 0.632 internally and 0.523 to 0.775 externally. Visualization analysis demonstrated that FASP captured prognostic information from both tumor and background liver regions. These findings suggest whole-liver-based deep learning provides a promising non-invasive approach to predict recurrence risk for HCC patients before surgery."

In this study, we developed a deep-learning pipeline based on a multilayer perceptron (MLP) trained on 15,804 curated compounds representing four major pharmacological target classes: G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), kinases, nuclear receptors, and transporters. Using extended connectivity fingerprints (ECFP4) as molecular descriptors, the model achieved 96% accuracy in internal cross-validation and 87% accuracy on an external test set, demonstrating performance comparable to ensemble classifiers such as Random Forest, XGBoost, and LightGBM. Class-specific F1 scores confirmed robust and balanced predictions across GPCR, kinase, nuclear receptor, and transporter categories. Model interpretability was addressed using SHAP values, which highlighted pharmacophore-like substructures consistent with known ligand-target interactions. Application to reference drugs further validated predictive utility, with correct assignment of most compounds to their canonical protein target class. The final MLP model was deployed as a user-friendly web application to facilitate accessible protein class prediction for novel compounds. Overall, this work presents a reliable and interpretable computational framework to support target-class-based drug discovery and repositioning."

After injury, cells change their transcriptional state to adapt to stress and initiate repair. Here we investigate how injury-induced transcriptional programs are encoded within enhancers in the mammalian CNS. Leveraging single-nucleus transcriptomics and chromatin accessibility profiling, we identify thousands of injury-induced, cell-type-specific enhancers in the mouse spinal cord after a contusion injury. These are abundant in glial cells and retain cell-type specificity, even when regulating shared wound response genes. By modeling glial injury-responsive enhancers using deep learning, we reveal that their architecture encodes cell-type specificity by integrating generic stimulus response elements with cell identity programs. Finally, through in vivo enhancer screening, we demonstrate that injury-responsive enhancers can selectively target reactive astrocytes across the CNS using therapeutically relevant gene delivery vectors. Our decoding of the principles of injury-responsive enhancers enables the design of sequences that can be programmed to target disease-associated cell states."

Continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) can effectively guide lifestyle interventions in non-diabetic. However, predefined CGM metrics fail to fully capture the dysglycemic information contained in the high-dimensional time-series CGM data. This study employed deep learning to learn dysglycemia features from CGM data associated with diabetes and derived a digital biomarker of dysglycemia, validated against traditional dysglycemic biomarkers and diabetes polygenic risk score (PRS). Output of the deep learning model, called the deep learning-score, was significantly associated with multiple existing dysglycemic biomarkers and PRS of diabetes (P = 0.007). Moreover, existing CGM metrics were not associated with prevalent diabetes after adjusting for the deep learning-score, while the deep learning-score remained significantly associated with prevalent diabetes (P < 0.001) in a regression analysis. This digital biomarker demonstrated potential for providing dynamic feedback on dysglycemia and improving long-term intervention adherence."

However, many disease-causing variants act through gain-of-function or other mechanisms that do not strictly disrupt the protein. Interpreting rare and novel variants remains a major challenge in clinical genomics, highlighting the need for computational tools informed by large, well-curated clinical datasets to reliably distinguish truly deleterious mutations from neutral variation. We developed MutAnt, a mutation meta‑annotator based on machine‑learning. It is trained on a large, clinically relevant dataset of variants using multiple variant properties, including synchronised predictions from other algorithms. MutAnt models demonstrate high F1 and ROC‑AUC scores (0.88-0.99) on hold‑out datasets and provide well‑calibrated probability scores that correlate with functional assays. MutAnt's deleteriousness predictions exhibited correlations with functional scores obtained from deep mutational scanning assays for tumor suppressor proteins BRCA1, PTEN, and p53 (ρ = 0.28-0.61), and with protein stability measurements from computational models. Moreover, MutAnt prediction scores of deleteriousness improved somatic variant calling from RNA sequencing data compared to standard approaches. MutAnt's high performance in distinguishing neutral and protein-disrupting mutations highlights its potential clinical utility in variant classification."

We developed a deep learning radiomics (DLR) model integrating automatic segmentation, feature extraction, selection, and DLR score computation, trained on the training cohort and validated on the remaining cohorts (total n = 1089 from three medical centers). Using nnUnet and a fine-tuned Swin Transformer, 13 key features were identified to construct the model. The DLR score demonstrated strong correlation with Knosp and Hardy-Wilson invasion classifications, while outperforming them in predicting recurrence and indicating aggressive pathological markers (Ki-67, p53, macrophages) and revealing biological pathways (MAPK, TGF-β). The model was further implemented into an online platform, enabling clinical deployment. This noninvasive preoperative approach provides a robust imaging biomarker for identifying and evaluating PitNET aggressiveness and may support individualized treatment strategies."

Kinovea, as an accessible motion-analysis software, provides both visual and quantitative feedback. However, its application in supporting technique development among beginner athletes remains insufficiently explored. Aim: This study aims to describe the use of Kinovea in biomechanics training and examine its contribution to the awareness of kinematic characteristics and movement techniques among beginner athletes. Methods: A descriptive qualitative design involved 72 beginner athletes aged 18–25 years selected through purposive sampling. Data were collected over 16 weeks through interviews, field observations, and motion video recordings analyzed using Kinovea. Kinematic data focused on joint angles, stride behavior, and movement phases during walking, running, and the flight phase. Qualitative data were analyzed using content analysis with NVivo 12, while kinematic results were interpreted descriptively to identify performance patterns and areas for technical refinement. Result: Kinematic analysis showed coordinated joint-angle patterns across all phases. Walking analysis identified arm swing angles of 50.9°–58.8° and leg separation angles of 64.3°–67.2°, indicating a stable gait rhythm. The running analysis revealed knee angles of 68.8°–69.8° and elbow angles of 87.6°–89.1°, indicating efficient propulsive mechanics. The flight phase demonstrated knee angles of 81.2°–87.8° and elbow angles of 80.4°–88.3°, suggesting effective momentum use and postural stability. These measurements supported stride-efficiency assessment and technique evaluation. Qualitative findings revealed that Kinovea enabled athletes to interpret movement phases and identify technical inefficiencies through slow-motion and frame-by-frame visualization. Conclusion: Kinovea supports basic motion analysis by providing clear kinematic information and helping beginner athletes observe and refine their movement techniques. The findings also offer practical value for coaches by enabling more precise identification of inefficient patterns and guiding targeted corrections during early-stage training."

Manikpurage; Philippe Pîbarot,10.1101/2025.11.27.25339923,2025-11-30,bioRxiv (Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory),"Introduction: Aortic valve stenosis (AS) is a progressive disease characterized by the calcification and narrowing of the aortic valve, leading to significant morbidity and mortality. Early detection and risk stratification remain a major clinical challenge. Identifying specific biomarkers could significantly improve risk prediction and disease management. Objective: This study aims to (1) identify novel plasma protein biomarkers for incident AS, (2) establish causal relationships using genetic approaches, and (3) prioritize biomarkers specific to the aortic valve tissue. Methods: We assessed the association between 2,923 unique plasma proteins measured using the Olink Explore assay and AS incidence in 52,632 UK Biobank participants with 487 incident AS cases over a median follow-up of 13 years. Multivariable Cox proportional hazards models were used to evaluate associations adjusted for cardiovascular risk factors. A stratified analysis was performed to investigate the association in men and women separately. For causal inference, we used protein quantitative trait loci (pQTL) Mendelian Randomization (MR). We then verified the aortic valve specificity of the proteins using our transcriptomic dataset of 500 human aortic valves. Using expression QTL (eQTL)-based MR, we evaluated the causal role of gene expression in AS and performed colocalization analyses. Results: Our fully adjusted model identified 55 proteins significantly associated with AS incidence, with GDF15 showing the strongest association (HR=1.93 per SD, 95% CI: 1.67-2.23, P value = 3.3E-19). In sex-stratified analyses, 10 proteins showed a significant association with AS incidence in women, including 5 more strongly associated in women (CD38, CD80, IGFBPL1, NFASC, SERPINA9, P interaction &lt;0.05), whereas 16 proteins were identified in men including 1 protein (REG1A) with a significantly stronger association in men. pQTL-MR suggested a potential causal role for 4 proteins (PCSK9, CHI3L1, NFASC, PRSS8). Transcriptomic integration confirmed high aortic valve expression for 11 candidates, with three genes demonstrating significant associations in aortic valve eQTL MR analyses, including LTBP2, for which the pQTL and eQTL colocalized. Conclusion: The integration of proteomics and genomics allowed the identification of potential biomarkers and drug targets for AS, showing evidence of causality and tissue-specific expression."

Haager; Joannis Chronis; Martin Schmiady,10.1002/clc.70225,2025-11-29,Clinical Cardiology,"ABSTRACT Background Loop diuretic therapy (LDT) is associated with increased mortality in heart failure. Severe aortic stenosis (AS) patients are at risk for heart failure and frequently on LDT. We assessed cardiac structure and function, organ congestion, filling pressures, and long‐term outcomes of severe AS patients on LDT undergoing aortic valve replacement (AVR). Methods Consecutive patients with severe AS with [ n = 157; median (interquartile range) daily torasemide dose: 10 (5–15) mg] or without ( n = 346) LDT undergoing a detailed assessment of congestion (B‐type natriuretic peptide, liver enzymes, systematic chest X‐ray analysis) and cardiac catheterization before AVR with a post‐AVR follow‐up of several years were studied. Results Despite similar AS severity (indexed aortic valve area 0.41 ± 0.12 vs. 0.43 ± 0.12 cm 2 /m 2 ) patients with LDT had more advanced biventricular remodeling and dysfunction, higher B‐type natriuretic peptide [446 (245–991) vs. 150 (62–317) ng/L; p &lt; 0.001], higher liver enzymes, higher chest x‐ray congestion score [2 (1–4.5) vs. 1 (0–2) score points; p &lt; 0.001], and higher mean right atrial pressure (8 ± 4 vs . 6 ± 3 mmHg) and mean pulmonary artery wedge pressure (21 ± 8 vs. 14 ± 6 mmHg; p &lt; 0.001 for both) than those without. After a median post‐AVR follow‐up of 15 months functional capacity was worse, and estimated systolic pulmonary pressure was higher (37 ± 11 vs . 32 ± 8 mmHg; p &lt; 0.001), and after a median follow‐up of 44 months mortality was higher [hazard ratio 2.01 (95% confidence interval 1.17–3.77); p = 0.01] in LDT compared to non‐LDT patients. Conclusions LDT identifies AS patients with more advanced cardiac remodeling, more severe congestion, unfavorable hemodynamics, impaired post‐AVR status, and increased post‐AVR long‐term mortality."

CASE SUMMARY We describe a case of an 80-year-old female patient with a history of severe aortic stenosis and hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy that underwent aortic valve replacement and myectomy. The patient presented with acute pulmonary edema and low blood pressure due to LVOTO and SAM post cardiac surgery in the intensive care unit. She was paced with an epicardial dual-chamber pacing system due to complete atrioventricular block and treated initially with norepinephrine, furosemide, and esmolol infusion and continuous positive pressure ventilation. The patient remained hypoxemic and kept deteriorating hemodynamically despite titrating up norepinephrine. The addition of vasopressin infusion and tapering of norepinephrine finally stabilized the patient with significant reduction of LVOTO, confirmed by transthoracic echocardiography assessment, improved oxygenation and increased urine output. CONCLUSION Vasopressin seems to be the preferred vasopressor for managing LVOTO and SAM post-cardiac surgery, because of its absence of inotropic effects. Echocardiography is crucial for early diagnosis and therapeutic management."

The postoperative recovery was smooth, and the patient remained clinically well with normal cardiac function during the 1-year follow-up period. This case underscores the critical role of echocardiography in early diagnosis and surgical planning for complex congenital heart disease."
OpenAlex,aortic stenosis,Non‐Invasive Monitoring of Transcatheter Heart Valve Using Photoplethysmography and Machine Learning,Silvia Puleo; Lorenzo Nioi; Salvatore Pasta,10.1111/aor.70069,2025-11-27,Artificial Organs,"ABSTRACT Transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) has become the preferred treatment for aortic stenosis in the elderly. However, the durability of transcatheter heart valves (THV) and the risk of leaflet thrombosis preclude the extension of TAVI in young people. This study sought to formulate a proof‐of‐concept solution for non‐invasive, continuous monitoring of THV function using photoplethysmography (PPG) sensors and machine learning models. An in vitro mock circulatory loop was developed using a compliant aortic phantom and an implanted self‐expanding Evolut FX device. Two PPG sensors were attached to the phantom surface to record flow signals during various hemodynamic scenarios generated by Latin Hypercube Sampling. Endoscopic imaging measurements of the geometric orifice area (GOA) were used to assess valve performance. PPG‐derived metrics and flow variables were used to train regression and classification models that predicted healthy versus decreased leaflet motion. The regression model showed an R 2 of 0.83, RMSE of 7.18 mm 2 , and MAE of 5.58 mm 2 . The classifier correctly identified reduced leaflet motion (95% accuracy, 0.89 precision, and 0.91 recall). This study demonstrates the efficacy of PPG sensors and machine learning for non‐invasive THV monitoring. The approach offers a promising tool for early detection of leaflet dysfunction, thereby improving the management of TAVI patients."

OpenAlex,aortic stenosis,PO:37:256 | Spontaneous renal artery dissection: a subtle presentation of a “vasculitis-mimicker”,,10.4081/reumatismo.2025.2218,2025-11-26,Reumatismo,"Background. Medium- and large-vessel vasculitides represent a diagnostic challenge. The case described here highlights the importance of an accurate differential diagnosis, as non-inflammatory vascular diseases can mimic vasculitic patterns, with significant therapeutic implications. Materials and Methods. A 42-year-old man presented to the emergency department with subacute onset of temporal headache, low-grade fever, left flank pain, and hypertension (BP 170/100 mmHg). Rheumatologic history was unremarkable and physical examination was normal. Abdominal CT, performed for suspected ureterolithiasis, showed a hypodense area in the mid and upper third of the left kidney compatible with parenchymal ischemia, and a sleeve-like thickening with filiform stenosis of the ipsilateral renal artery, initially suggestive of vasculitis (renal arteritis). The patient was admitted to the Rheumatology Unit. Laboratory tests revealed inflammatory activity (CRP 3.7 mg/dL, ESR 51 mm/h). Intravenous methylprednisolone pulses (250 mg for 3 days) were started, followed by oral prednisone (1 mg/kg) and antihypertensive therapy. Given the suspicion of vasculitis, PET imaging was performed, showing no evidence of vascular inflammation, as well as duplex ultrasound of the four limbs and supra-aortic trunks, which revealed no stenotic or occlusive lesions. Considering the abrupt onset of symptoms, negative autoimmunity, negative PET findings, and absence of additional clinical or instrumental abnormalities, a renal arteriography was performed. It revealed a dissection of the left renal artery with thrombosis of the false lumen and parenchymal ischemia, allowing a final diagnosis of spontaneous left renal artery dissection complicated by renal infarction and renovascular hypertension. Results. The case was discussed with the Radiologist and Vascular Surgeon. Given the complete thrombosis of the false lumen, endovascular revascularization was excluded, and a conservative approach was adopted with antihypertensive and antiplatelet therapy, along with progressive steroid tapering, with no clinical relapse. A follow-up contrast-enhanced CT after 15 days confirmed stability of the renal ischemic lesion and improved parenchymal perfusion (Figure 1). Conclusions. Spontaneous renal artery dissection is a rare clinical entity with elusive etiology, accounting for only 1–2% of all arterial dissections. To date, approximately 200 cases have been reported in the medical literature. Our case emphasizes the importance of considering non-inflammatory vascular conditions, such as spontaneous dissection, in all instances where first-line imaging raises a generic suspicion of medium- or large-vessel vasculitis, particularly in cases of isolated vascular involvement and absence of systemic symptoms. A high index of suspicion is required in clinical practice, especially in atypical or subtle presentations, to promptly achieve the correct diagnosis."
