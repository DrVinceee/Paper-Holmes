PubMed,aortic stenosis,Neocuspidization versus bioprosthesis in surgical replacement of the aortic valve: a propensity-matched comparative analysis of immediate and mid-term outcomes.,Igor Mokryk; Illia Nechai; Ihor Stetsiuk; Alexandros Mourtarakos; Mykhailo Todurov; Vitaly Demyanchuk; Borys Todurov,10.1007/s11748-025-02243-x,2026-01-13,General thoracic and cardiovascular surgery,"This study aims to compare the immediate and mid-term outcomes of Aortic Valve Neocuspidization (AVNeo) with surgical aortic valve replacement using a bioprosthesis (BioSAVR) to determine if neocuspidization can overcome limitations of current techniques.
From December 2016 to December 2023, 155 patients received AVNeo at the Heart Institute, while 301 underwent BioSAVR. Baseline characteristics were balanced using 1:1 propensity matching.
132 identical patient pairs were included in the analysis. Neocuspidization had longer ischemic times (98.67 ± 28.47 min vs. 66.76 ± 25.04 min, ρ < 0.001). Permanent pacemaker implantation (ρ = 0.072) and paravalvular leaks (ρ = 0.041) were more common in the BioSAVR group. Follow-up averaged 43.8 ± 27.30 months. Severe post-procedural aortic stenosis (PPAS) was more frequent after BioSAVR (3 (2.8%) vs. 1 (0.9%), ρ = 0.006), but AVNeo experienced more recurrent severe aortic regurgitation (AR) (3 (2.8%) vs. 0, ρ = 0.035). Reoperation rates were similar (AVNeo 3.1%, BioSAVR 1.5%, ρ = 0.680). Prosthetic valve endocarditis (PVE) was responsible for half (2 cases) of the AVNeo reoperations. Survival rate during follow-up was comparable: 92.8% (AVNeo) and 94.4% (BioSAVR), ρ = 0.672.
Immediate and mid-term AVNeo quality outcomes were comparable to those of BioSAVR. Transvalvular hemodynamics were better, and the incidence of PPAS was lower after AVNeo, supporting the recommendation of this procedure for patients at high risk of patient-prosthesis mismatch. During follow-up, AVNeo patients require close monitoring for recurrent AR and aggressive PVE prophylaxis. A multicenter long-term study is needed to confirm the stability of hemodynamic performance, the rate of Structural Valve Deterioration, and the incidence of PVE in AVNeo patients over the long term."

However, data on post-TAVI extremity function are limited. This sub-study of the TAVI XS trial aimed to assess extremity function after transfemoral TAVI, evaluate functional decline, compare outcomes between upper-and lower-extremity secondary access approaches and identify predictors of functional decline after TAVI.
The TAVI XS was a randomized clinical trial comparing upper- and lower-extremity secondary access during TAVI. Patients were assessed for extremity function at baseline and at 30 days using the Lower Extremity Function Scale (higher score indicating better function) and the Quick Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder, and Hand questionnaire (higher score indicating worse function).
Lower-extremity (45.0 [IQR 35.0-57.0] to 52.0 [39.0-63.0]; p < 0.001), and upper-extremity function (11.4 [2.3-25.0] to 6.8 [0-22.7]; p = 0.003) improved after TAVI. Relevant decline in lower-extremity function occurred in 20 (8.4%) patients, and in upper-extremity function in 19 (8.0%) patients. No differences in post-TAVI function were observed between upper- or lower-extremity secondary access (lower-extremity: 10.1% vs. 6.7%; p = 0.35, upper-extremity: 7.6% vs. 8.4%; p = 0.81). Predictors (OR [95% CI]) of clinically relevant decline were baseline use of dual antiplatelet therapy/oral anticoagulants (4.17 [1.39-12.49]; p = 0.01) for lower-extremity function and multiple punctures (4.05 [1.46-11.24]; p = 0.007) for upper-extremity function. Age inversely affected lower- (0.92 [0.85-0.99/year]; p = 0.02) and upper-extremity function (0.93 [0.86-0.99/year]; p = 0.04).
The incidence of clinically relevant decline in extremity function after TAVI is low. No differences in reported extremity function were observed between the upper- and lower-extremity secondary access approach. Predictors of decline were antithrombotic therapy and multiple punctures.

A 39-year-old male with Kawasaki disease at the age of 2 months underwent coronary artery bypass grafting to the right coronary artery and left anterior descending artery because of coronary artery stenoses. In the screening by thoracic-abdominal CT before the operation, calcification of the distal abdominal aorta was detected, and an abdominal aortic aneurysm with stenosis was diagnosed. He had been asymptomatic, and there were no differences in his extremities' blood pressure. Although a slight dilatation of the distal abdominal aorta had existed in his aortogram at 2 years 9 months old, the abnormal finding had been unnoticed. A 26-year-old female with coronary artery bypass grafting at the age of 23 months had hypertension. A stenosis of the orifice at the right renal artery was detected by two-dimensional echocardiography and a magnetic resonance angiogram. Her hypertension in adulthood was suspected to result from her renal artery stenosis, which acute Kawasaki vasculitis underlies. Although coronary artery lesions in both patients were diagnosed in their childhood, systemic artery lesions were not realised until adulthood. Because abdominal aortic aneurysms and renal artery stenosis are extremely rare, they were not recognised as systemic artery lesions caused by Kawasaki disease. Their lesions can occur in patients with severe acute vasculitis at a significantly younger age, less than 6 months. Systemic artery lesions in such adult patients must be carefully evaluated."

It is identified when there is impaired global longitudinal strain (GLS) with paradoxically advanced time to peak strain (TPS) in a hypertrophied apex with relative sparing of the basal segments. On a standard polar map, GLS will have a pale center while TPS will depict a more robust blue center.
While the ""Blueberry-on-Top"" pattern has been observed in a few prior reports, its true prevalence in patients with ApHCM is currently unknown. We sought to examine the prevalence of this strain pattern among patients with ApHCM.
A series of patients diagnosed with ApHCM by cardiac MRI were included and compared to a series of normal controls. All patients underwent a standard transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE). For uniform reporting, all echocardiogram studies were post-processed using Tomtec, which is a vendor-independent speckle tracking analysis software.
From a cohort of 340 patients with HCM, a total of 15 patients with ApHCM were identified and subsequently compared to 15 normal controls. The ""Blueberry-on-Top"" pattern was observed in 93% (n = 14) of patients with ApHCM, while none of the normal controls had a ""Blueberry-on-Top"" pattern. We identified a GLS ratio threshold of 1.26 and a normalized time to peak strain (NTPS) ratio threshold of 0.09. When both thresholds are met, the ""Blueberry-on-Top"" phenomenon has nearly 100% sensitivity and 93% specificity for the diagnosis of ApHCM. We suggest using these parameters as an adjunctive tool for making the clinical diagnosis of ApHCM and integrating them into a more comprehensive approach.
The newly recognized ""Blueberry-on-Top"" strain pattern is unique and can be used as a supportive diagnostic feature in ApHCM."

Consecutive, single-center retrospective cohort conducted at a tertiary hospital in Mexico (December 2023-May 2025). POD was defined as a positive Confusion Assessment Method (CAM) documented in the electronic health record, without formal blinding. Descriptive analyses, nonparametric tests, and univariable logistic regression were performed; given the low event frequency, an exploratory parsimonious multivariable model was fitted. Limitations: retrospective design, low number of events-particularly in TAVI-and lack of formal blinding for CAM assessment.
Seventy patients were included (58 SAVR and 12 TAVI). Overall POD incidence was 17.1% (95% CI: 10.1-27.6); SAVR 15.5% (9/58; 95% CI: 8.4-26.9) and TAVI 25.0% (3/12; 95% CI: 8.9-53.2) (p = 0.42). In the penalized (Firth) adjusted model, atrial fibrillation (OR: 11.17; 95% CI: 1.58-79.66; p = 0.038) and infections (OR: 5.03; 95% CI: 1.06-23.11; p = 0.042) were associated with POD. Hyponatremia occurred only among patients with POD.
POD was frequent after SAVR and TAVI. In exploratory penalized analyses, atrial fibrillation and infections were associated with POD, while hyponatremia was observed only among POD cases. These findings support focusing on feasible in-hospital preventive measures."

However, the prognostic impact of LA dysfunction in the surgical intervention for AS remains unclear.
Among the 812 patients who underwent isolated surgical aortic valve replacement (SAVR) for AS at eight institutions between 2016 and 2021, 366 with available preoperative left atrial volume index (LAVI) were included. Based on the optimal value of 40 mL/m2-derived from receiver operating characteristic curve analyses-patients were stratified into a LA enlargement group (n = 219) and a non-enlargement group (n = 147), and 5-year outcomes were investigated.
Age (76.0 vs 76.0 years, P = 0.489) and sex (male 44.3% vs 50.3%,P = 0.256) were comparable, while the LA enlargement group showed lower eGFR (52.3 vs 59.2 mL/min/1.73 m2, P = 0.002), serum albumin (3.9 vs 4.0 g/dL, P = 0.003), and ejection fraction (65.0% vs 70.0%,P < 0.001), as well as a higher tendency for atrial fibrillation (20.1% vs 12.2%,P = 0.066), and higher STS-PROM (3.10% vs 2.91%,P = 0.029). The 5-year incidence of cardiac mortality was higher in the LA enlargement group (13.4% vs 2.6%,P = 0.001). Multivariable analysis identified preoperative LA enlargement (LAVI ≥ 40 mL/m2) as an independent predictor of cardiac mortality (adjusted HR, 2.08; 95% CI, 1.01-4.82; P = 0.041). LA enlargement was also associated with higher all-cause mortality and heart failure readmission (17.4% vs 7.6%,P = 0.002; and 11.0% vs 2.8%,P = 0.013, respectively).
In patients with severe AS undergoing isolated SAVR, a preoperative LAVI ≥ 40 mL/m2 was associated with midterm mortality and heart failure, suggesting that SAVR before significant LA enlargement may improve prognosis."

This single-center, retrospective cohort study included fetuses diagnosed with DAA using fetal echocardiography and managed perinatally at Kanagawa Children's Medical Center from January 2013-December 2024. Clinical data, fetal echocardiography, postnatal contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) findings, surgical intervention, and outcomes were reviewed. Narrowest tracheal diameter (NTD) Z score in late gestation and narrowest-to-reference tracheal area (NTA/RTA) ratio on postnatal CT were measured. Primary and secondary outcomes included respiratory symptoms shortly after birth and elective surgery, respectively. Groups were compared using t-tests, and the optimal cutoff values were determined using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis. Reproducibility was assessed using intraclass correlation coefficient. Twenty-two patients were included: 5 symptomatic and 17 asymptomatic (12, prophylactic surgery; 5, observation). Symptomatic patients had significantly lower NTD Z scores (median - 1.8 vs. -1.2, P = 0.012) and NTA/RTA ratios (median 0.39 vs. 0.67, P < 0.001). NTD Z score ≤ - 1.7 (area under the ROC curve [AUC] 0.87; sensitivity 80%, specificity 88%) and NTA/RTA ratio ≤ 0.5 (AUC 0.94; sensitivity 100%, specificity 82%) were optimal thresholds for predicting early symptoms. In the asymptomatic group, NTA/RTA ratio ≥ 0.56 identified candidates for observation without surgery. The ICC values for both parameters exceeded 0.85, indicating excellent reproducibility. The prenatal NTD Z score and postnatal NTA/RTA ratio accurately predict postnatal respiratory symptoms in fetuses with DAA. These quantitative parameters may guide individualized perinatal management and surgical decision-making."

In contrast, left atrial reservoir strain (LASr), measured by speckle-tracking echocardiography, offers a sensitive and dynamic assessment of atrial mechanics, integrating atrial compliance with left ventricular diastolic interaction. Moreover, impaired LASr reflects atrial stiffness and fibrosis, and correlates with elevated filling pressures, making the LASr parameter a comprehensive biomarker of left-sided cardiac function. Indeed, LASr has demonstrated diagnostic and prognostic value across a wide spectrum of conditions. In heart failure with preserved ejection fraction, LASr refines the assessment of diastolic dysfunction and predicts hospitalization and mortality. In atrial fibrillation, reduced strain correlates with atrial fibrosis and left atrial appendage dysfunction, identifying patients at increased risk of arrhythmia recurrence and thromboembolism. In valvular disease, LASr uncovers subclinical remodeling and stratifies risk even in patients with apparently moderate aortic stenosis. Meanwhile, in addition to cardiovascular disease, LASr can detect early atrial impairment in systemic disorders such as hypertension, diabetes, obesity, and amyloidosis, often before structural enlargement becomes evident. Our group has shown that LASr predicts persistent hypertension after gestational hypertensive disorders, reveals subclinical diastolic dysfunction in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, non-invasively predicts left atrial appendage thrombus in atrial fibrillation, stratifies outcomes in moderate aortic stenosis, and provides prognostic information in acute ischemic stroke. This narrative review outlines the physiological basis, technical considerations, and clinical applications of LASr, discusses its limitations and future perspectives-including multimodality imaging and artificial intelligence-and underscores its transition from a research metric to a dynamic biomarker ready for clinical practice."

A total of 137 patients were enrolled who were treated with a self-expandable Venus A valve at our center, who underwent TAVR from January 1, 2019, to June 30, 2022. We retrospectively included patients with BAV and TAV who underwent echocardiographic follow-ups at baseline and at least 6 months after the procedure.
Patients with a BAV were younger than those with a TAV. The BAV patients had a larger aortic root diameter (ARD), although the size of valve implantation was comparable between the two groups. Patients with a BAV might experience less reverse LV remodeling post-TAVR than patients with a TAV during the one-month follow-up (140.09 ± 36.94 g/m2 vs. 126.36 ± 26.96 g/m2; p = 0.044). There were no significant differences in the LV mass index (LVMi) between the two groups throughout the 24 hours or the six-month follow-up post-TAVR. Patients with a higher mean pressure gradient (MPG) (95% confidence interval (CI): 0.112-0.581; p = 0.004) and a larger ARD (95% CI: 0.519-5.573; p = 0.019) before TAVR had favorable mid-term LV reverse remodeling (ΔLVMi within 6 months) post-TAVR. Patients with much more severe aortic stenosis (AS) had favorable mid-term LV reverse remodeling post-TAVR.
Patients with BAV might experience less reverse LV remodeling post-TAVR than patients with TAV during a short-term follow-up, but similar remodeling during mid-term follow-ups."

This study evaluated the prognostic value of the Kihon Checklist (KCL), which covers physical, cognitive, and social domains, for patients receiving TAVI.
We retrospectively analyzed data from 986 patients who underwent elective TAVI between May 2017 and September 2022. Frailty was classified according to the KCL as non-frail (for scores of 0-3), pre-frail (4-7), or frail (≥8). The primary outcome measure was all-cause mortality following discharge. Kaplan-Meier, Cox regression, and classification and regression tree (CART) analyses were used. Of the overall patient cohort, 47.4% were classified as frail. Over a mean follow-up period of 968±578 days, 18.1% died. Frailty was significantly associated with higher mortality (adjusted hazard ratio 1.771; 95% confidence interval 1.096-2.862; P<0.02). Impaired socialization and physical function were also found to represent independent predictors of mortality. CART identified socialization as the primary node in the risk stratification.
Preoperative frailty, as defined by the KCL, was found to be independently associated with mortality after TAVI. Social and physical domains were also found to have strong prognostic relevance in this context."

This is a case of a 12-year-old male with a history of bicuspid aortic valve and mild asymptomatic aortic stenosis who presented with flu-like symptoms, right-sided hemiplegia, and aphasia. Although he initially presented with symptoms of arterial ischemic stroke, he was found to have infective endocarditis (IE) secondary to Bartonella henselae, confirmed by echocardiogram and plasma microbial cell-free DNA (mcf-DNA) testing. Initial antimicrobial treatment per standard guidelines was unsuccessful. Hence, second-line antimicrobials were commenced, to which he responded appropriately. His clinical course markedly improved, with recovery of neurological function within three weeks. He continued treatment of endocarditis and bartonellosis in an outpatient setting with significant clinical response until eventual cardiac surgery for valve replacement. Although the diagnosis and management of blood culture-negative IE can be very challenging and associated with morbidity, mcf-DNA testing has been shown to be helpful in establishing an accurate diagnosis and promoting appropriate antimicrobial management."

Case reports,"The management of coronary artery disease in patients with severe aortic stenosis is controversial, with no consensus on optimal revascularization strategies. The validity of using fractional flow reserve to assess ischaemia in this population is debated. Conflicting results have arisen regarding the impact of transcatheter aortic valve implantation on fractional flow reserve values. We present the case of a patient with severe aortic stenosis and intermediate left anterior descending artery stenosis, in whom the fractional flow reserve and the index of microcirculatory resistance suggested the presence of coronary microvascular dysfunction prior to transcatheter aortic valve implantation. However, after valve replacement, the fractional flow reserve and the index of microcirculatory resistance indicated physiologically significant ischaemia, prompting intervention.
An 82-year-old woman presented with paradoxical low-flow, low-gradient severe aortic stenosis and intermediate left anterior descending artery stenosis. The fractional flow reserve was borderline, and the index of microcirculatory resistance was elevated before transcatheter aortic valve implantation, indicating the presence of coronary microvascular dysfunction. Six months after valve replacement, the fractional flow reserve declined to 0.64 with an improved index of microcirculatory resistance, prompting a successful percutaneous coronary intervention. Subsequent cardiac magnetic resonance imaging revealed reverse remodelling with a reduced left ventricular mass.
This case illustrates that transcatheter aortic valve implantation may unmask coronary ischaemia by restoring microvascular vasodilatory capacity in patients with coronary microvascular dysfunction. It also highlights the importance of reassessing coronary physiology in selected patients following transcatheter aortic valve implantation."

The objective of this study was to investigate these age-related geometric changes from the aortic arch to the proximal internal carotid artery (ICA) using computed tomography angiography (CTA), and to assess their association with vascular aging.
This retrospective cross-sectional study included 485 patients who underwent CTA between January 2020 and December 2022. The participants were divided into two age groups: young (<60 years) and old (>70 years). Patients with carotid plaques or stenosis were excluded. Using semi-automated segmentation techniques, we analyzed geometric parameters, including vascular tortuosity, maximal diameter, cross-sectional area, and bifurcation angles from the aortic arch to the proximal ICA.
Out of the 485 participants, 257 (53%) were included in the old age group (mean age: 78.77±0.36 years). Vascular tortuosity from the common carotid artery (CCA) to the carotid artery bifurcation (CAB) was significantly higher in the old age group on both sides (right: 0.15±0.01 vs. 0.07±0.00; left: 0.14±0.01 vs. 0.06±0.00; P<0.001). The maximal diameters and cross-sectional areas of the common and internal carotid arteries also increased significantly with age CCA diameter (right: 7.49±1.05 vs. 7.25±1.05 mm; ICA cross-sectional area, right: 25.55±5.15 vs. 20.06±4.51 mm2; P<0.001). Furthermore, the CAB angle was markedly elevated bilaterally in older individuals (right: 33.52°±16.04° vs. 26.3°±15.86°; left: 35.94°±16.14° vs. 29.36°±13.97°; P<0.001).
Geometric changes in extracranial carotid arteries, including increased tortuosity, diameter, cross-sectional area, and bifurcation angle, are strongly associated with aging. These findings highlight the potential of CTA-based vascular geometry as a non-invasive imaging biomarker for assessing vascular aging and early structural remodeling."

A 58-year-old man with chronic hepatitis B and cirrhosis, previously treated for rectosigmoid adenocarcinoma, presented with progressive abdominal fullness and markedly elevated AFP (315 KIU/L). Imaging showed multiple arterially enhancing hepatic lesions with washout, highly suggestive of HCC in a cirrhotic liver. Given the patient's history and risk factors, the initial diagnostic impression favored HCC. However, core biopsy of a liver lesion revealed poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma consistent with colorectal origin (CK20 positive, CK7 patchy positive, CDX2 negative). Surgical resection was contraindicated due to severe aortic stenosis and prior chemotherapy toxicity. The patient received palliative systemic therapy but developed hepatic decompensation and died of progressive disease. A literature review identified only a few reports of AFP-producing colorectal cancers, most presenting with advanced disease and poor outcomes, with cirrhotic background being exceptionally rare.
AFP-producing colorectal adenocarcinoma with liver metastases can masquerade as HCC, particularly in patients with underlying liver disease. This case underscores the need for histological confirmation of atypical hepatic lesions to avoid misdiagnosis. Awareness of this rare entity and careful clinical reasoning are crucial to guide appropriate management and highlight pitfalls in diagnostic practice."

However, its impact on periprocedural and procedural outcomes remains unclear.
The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of BSH on periprocedural and postprocedural outcomes in patients undergoing TAVR.
This study included patients with severe aortic stenosis (AS) who underwent TAVR using either balloon-expandable (BEVs) or self-expanding valves (SEVs). The primary endpoint was to compare periprocedural interventions and procedural outcomes. Secondary endpoints included subgroup analyses by device generation (new vs. old), valve type (BEVs vs. SEVs), severity of septal hypertrophy, and across study periods.
A total of 3261 TAVR patients were included: 1050 had a BSH ≥ 15 mm (HS+ group) and 2211 had a septal thickness < 15 mm (HS- group). Patients in the HS+ group had higher rates of post-dilatation (25% vs. 21%, p = 0.008), moderate or greater paravalvular leak (PVL) on angiography (2.4% vs. 0.8%, p < 0.001) and echocardiography (5% vs. 3.4%, p = 0.033), and permanent pacemaker (PPM) implantation (18% vs. 14%, p = 0.008). Conversely, HS- patients more often required valve repositioning and a second valve. In subgroup analyses stratified by device generation, the influence of BSH appeared broadly consistent across platforms. Additional Subgroup analysis showed particularly higher rates of post-dilatation, moderate or greater PVL, and PPM implantation in the SEV HS+ group, whereas mild septal thickening (12-15 mm) had no significant impact compared with marked hypertrophy (≥ 15 mm).
In this large cohort of TAVR patients, BSH (≥ 15 mm) was associated with higher rates of post-dilatation, PVL, and PPM implantation, particularly among those receiving SEVs, while mild septal thickening had no significant impact."

If treated with transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR), patients with the combined phenotype (AS-CA) have a similar survival at 1 year compared to those with lone AS. This study aims to evaluate the long-term outcomes of AS-CA compared to lone AS.
Using a prospective, multicenter, observational, case-control design, we studied patients with severe AS referred for TAVR. All underwent bone scintigraphy to differentiate between AS-CA and lone AS. Outcomes were compared between the two cohorts. Mortality (all-cause and cardiovascular [CV]) and hospitalization for heart failure (HHF) were captured as clinical endpoints for long-term outcome.
406 patients [84(80-88) years, 50 % female, EuroSCORE-II 4.2 (3.7-5.0)] were recruited, of which 47 (11.6 %) had AS-CA (all transthyretin). Over a follow-up of 5.4 (4.9-5.8) years, 244 (60.1 %) patients died. AS-CA was associated with higher all-cause mortality (crude HR 1.75, 95 % CI 1.24-2.46; log-rank, p = 0.001), which remained significant after multivariate adjustment for clinical confounders (EuroSCORE-II, valve replacement; adjusted HR 1.72, 95 % CI 1.22-2.42; p = 0.002). AS-CA was not associated with CV mortality (log-rank, p = 0.18) or time to first HHF (log-rank, p = 0.43), but the rate of HHF was significantly higher in AS-CA compared to lone AS (129 versus 65 per 1000 patient years, p = 0.022).
AS-CA is associated with an increased long-term risk of all-cause mortality and rate of hospitalization for heart failure compared to patients with AS. Further studies evaluating the role of CA-specific therapies are warranted in this population."

Cardiovascular interventions,"A novel intra-annular, self-expanding transcatheter heart valve was introduced in the U.S. market in 2023 for treating native aortic stenosis in high- or extreme-risk patients.
The authors sought to report early real-world experience with the Navitor valve (Abbott Structural Heart) from the STS/ACC TVT Registry (Society of Thoracic Surgeons/American College of Cardiology Transcatheter Valve Therapy Registry).
Baseline, procedural, and follow-up data were prospectively collected and retrospectively analyzed. The primary outcome was a composite of all-cause mortality or stroke at 30 days. Additional safety and effectiveness outcomes were reported per registry definitions.
A total of 2,958 aortic stenosis patients were treated between January 2023 and December 2024. Mean age was 81.4 ± 7.6 years; 62.4% were female. Mean STS score was 6.6% ± 5.4%. Technical success rate was 97.9%, with in-hospital mortality rate at 1.3%. Thirty-day all-cause mortality or stroke rate was 5.2% (2.8% mortality, 2.7% stroke). Major vascular complications and new permanent pacemaker implantation (PPI) occurred in 1.8% and 17.8%, respectively. At 30 days, mean transvalvular gradient was 7.3 ± 3.8 mm Hg; aortic valve area was 1.98 ± 0.64 cm2; moderate or greater PVL occurred in 1.8%. Analysis of case volume showed reduced PPI rate with site experience beyond 20 cases for Navitor Classic (19.4% vs 13.5%; P = 0.0039) and Vision (19.1% vs 10.6%; P = 0.047). Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire Overall Summary score improved by 23.8 points from 52.1 ± 24.8 at baseline to 75.9 ± 22.6 at 30 days (P < 0.0001).
Early U.S. experience with the Navitor valve demonstrates favorable early clinical and hemodynamic outcomes, with improved PPI rate associated with procedural experience."

With a focus on the prevalent psychological complications following the onset of this condition, this study aimed to explore the correlation between antenatal depression and Corona disease anxiety, personality traits, and postpartum depression during the COVID-19 pandemic.                                                           Materials and Methods:                     This cross-sectional descriptive-analytical study investigated women receiving care at health centers affiliated with Kerman University of Medical Sciences during the last month of their pregnancy and the postpartum period in 2022. Following the acquisition of informed consent, participants were assessed using various measures, including demographic and obstetric information, the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale, the Corona Disease Anxiety Scale (CDAS), and the NEO Personality Inventory-Revised during their third trimester of pregnancy. The same group of participants completed the Edinburgh Depression Scale and the Corona Disease Anxiety Scale (CDAS) 4-6 weeks after childbirth.                                                           Results and Discussion:                     There was a significant correlation between family income, unwanted pregnancy as perceived by both the mother and father, and antenatal depression. Additionally, marital satisfaction played a significant role in postpartum depression. Furthermore, antenatal depression was significantly associated with neuroticism, agreeableness, and physical symptoms related to Corona disease anxiety. Personality traits, with the exception of extroversion and conscientiousness, and various domains of Corona disease anxiety, excluding psychological symptoms, were also significantly associated with postpartum depression.                                                           Conclusion:                     During pandemics or epidemics, such as the COVID-19 outbreak, experiencing mental distress during pregnancy can contribute to mental health issues during the postpartum period. This risk is particularly true in individuals with unique personality traits, emphasizing the need for increased focus on mental health within prenatal care during these crises."

Method:                     This cross-sectional study was conducted in Kerman, Iran. Data were collected from patients who visited Afzalipour Hospital in Kerman more than twice during the COVID-19 epidemic from the end of February 2020 to March 21, 2021. We conducted two key analyses: 1. Mixed effect logistic regression was used to check the relationship between the variables and COVID-19 severity. 2. Mixed effect linear regression was used to check the relationship between the variables and the length of stay in the hospital.                                                           Results:                     The findings indicated that the most important risk factors for the severity of COVID-19 were heart diseases (OR=1.67,95%CI:1.20-2.30), increasing age (OR=2.23 for age&gt;54, 95%CI:1.70- 2.90), male gender (OR=1.47,95%CI:1.10-1.96), respiratory diseases other than asthma, and frequency of admission (OR=1.60,95%CI:1.20-2.15). All patients who underwent readmission experienced a shorter duration of hospitalization during their subsequent admission (OR=0.94,95%CI:0.91,0.96) and had a higher mortality rate (30% within 14 days, 26.6% between 14-90 days). Patients readmitted at intervals of 14-90 days and greater than 90 days exhibited lower disease severity compared to those readmitted within the 0-14 day period.                                                           Conclusion:                     Examining readmissions, the severity of COVID-19, and the length of hospital stay in affected patients are important factors for planning and allocating resources for COVID-19 management and treatment. These factors can help policymakers develop effective clinical guidelines for hospitalization or outpatient treatment of COVID-19 patients and contribute to reducing the burden of disease in the community."

Kinovea, as an accessible motion-analysis software, provides both visual and quantitative feedback. However, its application in supporting technique development among beginner athletes remains insufficiently explored. Aim: This study aims to describe the use of Kinovea in biomechanics training and examine its contribution to the awareness of kinematic characteristics and movement techniques among beginner athletes. Methods: A descriptive qualitative design involved 72 beginner athletes aged 18–25 years selected through purposive sampling. Data were collected over 16 weeks through interviews, field observations, and motion video recordings analyzed using Kinovea. Kinematic data focused on joint angles, stride behavior, and movement phases during walking, running, and the flight phase. Qualitative data were analyzed using content analysis with NVivo 12, while kinematic results were interpreted descriptively to identify performance patterns and areas for technical refinement. Result: Kinematic analysis showed coordinated joint-angle patterns across all phases. Walking analysis identified arm swing angles of 50.9°–58.8° and leg separation angles of 64.3°–67.2°, indicating a stable gait rhythm. The running analysis revealed knee angles of 68.8°–69.8° and elbow angles of 87.6°–89.1°, indicating efficient propulsive mechanics. The flight phase demonstrated knee angles of 81.2°–87.8° and elbow angles of 80.4°–88.3°, suggesting effective momentum use and postural stability. These measurements supported stride-efficiency assessment and technique evaluation. Qualitative findings revealed that Kinovea enabled athletes to interpret movement phases and identify technical inefficiencies through slow-motion and frame-by-frame visualization. Conclusion: Kinovea supports basic motion analysis by providing clear kinematic information and helping beginner athletes observe and refine their movement techniques. The findings also offer practical value for coaches by enabling more precise identification of inefficient patterns and guiding targeted corrections during early-stage training."

OpenAlex,mitral regurgitation,Case Report: Emergency mitral valve plasty in an unstable dog with left atrial rupture secondary to myxomatous mitral valve disease,Tomoki Wada; Ryosuke TAKEMURA; Hideki Yotsuida; M Ohashi; Naoki Miyashita; On Uezawa; Takuya Mori,10.3389/fvets.2025.1653646,2026-01-12,Frontiers in Veterinary Science,"Objective To describe the medical and surgical management of recurrent left atrial rupture (LAR) in a dog with severe mitral regurgitation (MR). This report focuses on challenges encountered with pericardiocentesis, the role of hemodynamic support, and the importance of invasive blood pressure monitoring. Case summary An 11-year-old, weighing 2.9 kg, male Chihuahua was scheduled for mitral valve plasty due to severe MR. The dog developed acute collapse and dyspnea and was diagnosed with LAR and pulmonary edema; pericardiocentesis was withheld due to relatively stable hemodynamics. Despite inotropic support and diuretics administration, a second LAR occurred the following day during transport for echocardiographic examination, with a large intrapericardial clot preventing pericardiocentesis and causing shock. Although fluid therapy and ephedrine administration improved blood pressure, invasive blood pressure monitoring and strict rest were subsequently employed to maintain a lower systolic pressure, enabling safe anesthetic induction. Under cardiopulmonary bypass, clot removal was performed. Intraoperatively, due to inadequate venous return, the heart enlarged and a third LAR occurred, necessitating repair of the rupture site with a pericardial patch under cardioplegic arrest alongside chordae tendineae reconstruction. Postoperatively, the dog developed dyspnea potentially related to lung injury, transfusion effects, or residual pulmonary edema, which resolved with medical management. Marked thrombocytopenia emerged soon after switching antibiotics but improved rapidly following corticosteroid administration and discontinuation of the suspected antibiotic. The dog was discharged in good condition and remained clinically stable 1 year later. Conclusion This case provides a detailed account for the stepwise medical and anesthetic management of recurrent LAR secondary to severe MR. During conservative treatment, pericardiocentesis was not always effective, particularly in the presence of intrapericardial clots, which might have interfered with drainage. In the setting of cardiac tamponade, increasing pre- and after-load along with positive inotropic support appeared to contribute to temporary hemodynamic stabilization. Invasive arterial pressure monitoring allowed for stable hemodynamic control and safe anesthetic induction, underscoring its importance for preoperative management. Furthermore, the third intraoperative rupture was successfully repaired using a pericardial patch, which achieved effective hemostasis and demonstrated its potential value as a surgical option for LAR repair."

Adult presentations are uncommon and often underdiagnosed. Case Description: A 35-year-old male presented with exertional dyspnea. ETT demonstrated severe mitral stenosis, reduced ejection fraction, bicuspid aortic valve, and pulmonary hypertension. Intraoperative findings confirmed true PMV. Due to anatomical complexity, a 27-mm mechanical prosthesis replacement was performed successfully, with rapid postoperative recovery. Conclusion: Adult PMV requires high clinical suspicion and often surgical confirmation. Valve replacement is effective in complex cases, emphasizing the importance of early diagnosis and intervention."

Artificial intelligence (AI) may enable rapid, point-of-care cardiac assessment using simplified imaging protocols. Objectives To evaluate whether a deep learning model can accurately detect significant valvular and ventricular dysfunction using only a single two-dimensional apical four-chamber echocardiographic view, including images acquired by non-cardiologists with handheld ultrasound devices. Methods We retrospectively analyzed 120,127 echocardiographic studies from a tertiary medical center to train and validate a deep learning model for identifying moderate-or-greater mitral or tricuspid regurgitation, right ventricular dysfunction, and reduced left ventricular ejection fraction (≤40%). A prospective cohort of 209 patients underwent handheld point-of-care cardiac ultrasound performed by non-cardiologist physicians, with same-hospitalization comprehensive echocardiography as the reference standard. Results In retrospective testing, model areas under the curve (AUCs) were 0.883 for mitral regurgitation, 0.913 for tricuspid regurgitation, 0.940 for right ventricular dysfunction, and 0.982 for reduced ejection fraction. In the prospective cohort, AUCs were 0.72, 0.87, 0.95, and 0.97 for the same respective targets. Conclusions A single-view deep learning model demonstrated strong diagnostic accuracy for detecting significant valvular and ventricular dysfunction across both standard and handheld ultrasound acquisitions. This approach may facilitate rapid, scalable cardiac function screening by non-cardiologists in diverse clinical environments. Clinical Trial Registration identifier NCT05455541."
OpenAlex,mitral regurgitation,Changes in echocardiographic parameters and strain and outcomes following mitral valve repair: insight from new mitral regurgitation classifications,Roslan Aslannif; Si Ling Soh; Yee Sin Tey; Am Haris Norhaliza; Teo Jassie; Lynne Murray Rowina; Kee Soon Chong; Kian Boon Wong; Dillon Jeswant; Mazeni Alwi; Mohd Ghazi Azmee,10.3389/fcvm.2025.1666071,2026-01-12,Frontiers in Cardiovascular Medicine,"Introduction Mitral valve repair is a cornerstone treatment for mitral regurgitation (MR), but outcomes across various etiologies remain incompletely understood. Therefore, this study aimed to comprehensively assess the outcomes of mitral valve repair across different MR etiologies, including primary MR, left ventricle functional MR (LVFMR), ischemic MR, left atrial functional MR (LAFMR), and rheumatic MR, by examining in-hospital, short-term, and medium-term outcomes, as well as the change in cardiac function through echocardiographic parameters and strain analysis. Methods This retrospective study included 911 patients who underwent mitral valve repair at a single center from 2015 to 2021. Echocardiographic and strain analyses were performed preoperatively and at 6 months post-surgery. Mortality outcomes were assessed at in-hospital and at 6, 12, and 51 months postoperatively. Results There were significant differences in outcomes across MR etiologies. The primary and rheumatic groups demonstrated the lowest mortality rates, whereas the LVFMR, LAFMR, and ischemic groups exhibited markedly higher mortality, both in the early postoperative period and during long-term follow-up. Echocardiographic analysis showed improvements in cardiac dimensions and volumes, but concurrent declines in myocardial function, particularly in ejection fraction, global longitudinal strain, and left atrial reservoir strain. Discussion This study highlights the importance of etiology-specific risk stratification. While mitral valve repair effectively reduces MR, myocardial recovery may be delayed or insufficient in certain subgroups, especially those with pre-existing myocardial dysfunction. Tailored therapeutic strategies that address the multifactorial nature of functional and ischemic MR are warranted to improve long-term outcomes."

OpenAlex,mitral regurgitation,Successful use of immunoadsorption therapy in advanced dilated cardiomyopathy: A case report,Rendan Zhang; Lvwen Ning; Y. M. Liu; Zhixiong Tan; Lu Kong; Xiaoqing Quan; Xiehui Chen,10.1097/md.0000000000047080,2026-01-09,Medicine,"Rationale: Dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) is a major cause of chronic heart failure, and some patients continue to deteriorate despite guideline-directed medical therapy. Immunoadsorption (IA), which removes pathogenic autoantibodies, has been proposed as a potential adjunctive therapy, but its clinical use remains limited. This case illustrates the potential benefits of IA in advanced, treatment-refractory DCM. Patient concerns: A 53-year-old woman with a 9-year history of DCM presented with recurrent chest tightness and dyspnea. Despite long-term guideline-directed medical therapy, her symptoms progressively worsened. Diagnoses: The patient had chronic DCM initially diagnosed in the peripartum period, with a left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) of 11% at onset. Before IA, echocardiography demonstrated severe systolic dysfunction (LVEF 22%–24%) with significant mitral regurgitation, and laboratory evaluation showed markedly elevated pro-BNP (4454 pg/mL). Interventions: The patient underwent two sessions of immunoadsorption in September 2024, followed by high-dose intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) as per standard protocols. Outcomes: Following treatment, her symptoms improved, pro-BNP decreased to 2109 pg/mL, and repeat echocardiography showed an increase in LVEF to 29.2%. Lessons: This case suggests that immunoadsorption may offer clinical benefit in patients with advanced, refractory DCM. While promising, IA remains experimental and requires further investigation in larger, controlled studies."
OpenAlex,mitral regurgitation,Novel characterization of MRAS mutation-associated Noonan syndrome: Mild adult-onset hypertrophic cardiomyopathy combined with infective endocarditis: A case report,Xiaoli Mou; Yong Liu; Y Z Zhang; Xinhe Cheng; Junshuai Feng,10.1097/md.0000000000046340,2026-01-09,Medicine,"Rationale: Noonan syndrome (NS) is a RASopathy most frequently associated with mutations in HRAS, NRAS, KRAS, and RRAS2. The contribution of MRAS variants to NS pathogenesis remains poorly characterized, and infective endocarditis (IE) is extremely rare in patients with NS. Patient concerns: A 22-year-old woman presented with typical dysmorphic features of NS, including short stature, broad forehead, hypertelorism, low-set posteriorly rotated ears, and a broad neck. She developed fever and progressive exertional dyspnea. Diagnoses: Echocardiography demonstrated obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy with vegetation located in the left ventricular outflow tract. Blood cultures grew Streptococcus mutans. Whole-exome sequencing identified a heterozygous MRAS c.203C&gt;T (p.Thr68Ile) mutation affecting a highly conserved residue among RASopathy-associated GTPases, supporting the diagnosis of MRAS-associated Noonan syndrome complicated by infective endocarditis. Interventions: Antibiotic therapy was escalated to intravenous gentamicin (60 mg daily) combined with ceftriaxone in accordance with the 2023 European Society of Cardiology guidelines for infective endocarditis. Outcomes: After one month of intravenous gentamicin and ceftriaxone therapy, fever resolved, and follow-up echocardiography showed disappearance of the vegetation. Residual cardiac abnormalities persisted, including marked left ventricular hypertrophy with left ventricular outflow tract obstruction, left atrial enlargement, moderate mitral regurgitation, patent foramen ovale with minor shunting, and impaired diastolic function. Exertional dyspnea remained despite resolution of the infection. Lessons: This case expands the genotypic spectrum of Noonan syndrome by supporting MRAS mutations as pathogenic drivers. It also identifies infective endocarditis as a previously unreported complication in MRAS-associated NS with outflow tract obstruction, highlighting the importance of careful cardiac surveillance in patients with RASopathies."
OpenAlex,mitral regurgitation,Effects of Levosimendan in Patients with Severe Mitral Insufficiency and Left Ventricular Dysfunction Undergoing Transcatheter Edge-to-Edge Repair: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis,Stephanie Gladys Kühne; Deborah Penet; Simon Wölbert; Eva Harmel; Damyan Penev; Sebastien Elvinger; Mauro Chiarito; Philip W. J. Raake; Dario Bongiovanni,10.3390/jcdd13010040,2026-01-09,Journal of Cardiovascular Development and Disease,"Severe mitral regurgitation (MR) is one of the most common valvular heart diseases and is frequently associated with advanced left ventricular (LV) systolic dysfunction. Transcatheter edge-to-edge repair (TEER) offers effective symptom relief but may induce abrupt hemodynamic changes leading to afterload mismatch and acute LV failure. Levosimendan may help mitigate this complication by improving contractility, yet evidence supporting its use in this setting is scarce. Therefore, the aim of this study was to systematically evaluate the evidence on the effects of Levosimendan in patients with severe MR and LV dysfunction undergoing TEER. We performed a comprehensive search of PubMed, Embase, Scopus, and Google Scholar. Primary outcomes were postprocedural LV ejection fraction (LVEF) and systolic pulmonary artery pressure (sPAP). Secondary outcomes included procedural success, procedure duration, and in-hospital complications. Five studies comprising 315 patients (n = 141 Levosimendan, n = 174 controls) met the inclusion criteria. Pooled analysis showed no significant difference in postprocedural LVEF between Levosimendan-treated patients and controls (mean difference 0.45%, 95% CI [−1.46–2.35] p = 0.65) and no significant change from baseline. Similarly, postprocedural sPAP did not differ significantly. Procedural success was higher with Levosimendan, and procedure duration was shorter. These hypothesis-generating findings highlight the need for larger, prospective randomized trials to clarify the role of Levosimendan in this setting."

Traditional management strategies follow a step-by-step approach, prioritizing guideline-directed medical therapy (GDMT) and reserving interventional (surgical or percutaneous) options only in case of persistent symptoms or worsening HF after GDMT. However, greater experience with the use of percutaneous procedures, even in high-risk patients, could support a more integrated approach, which exploits the synergistic effects of medical and interventional therapies to increase the tolerability of one vs the other, thereby improving quality of life and outcomes through their synergic effects. This expert opinion paper summarizes current data and evolving practices in the management of VHD in patients with HF, including secondary mitral regurgitation, aortic stenosis, aortic regurgitation, and tricuspid regurgitation."

Less is known about the operator volumes–outcomes association in the contemporary era. Objective To determine whether an operator-level volume-outcomes association exists for TAVR and MTEER in the contemporary era. Design, Setting, and Participants This cohort study examined data from patients undergoing TAVR or MTEER between January 2020 and December 2023 included in the Society of Thoracic Surgeons (STS)/American College of Cardiology (ACC) Transcatheter Valve Therapies (TVT) Registry, a national all-comers real-world registry. Consecutive patients undergoing TAVR for aortic stenosis or MTEER for mitral regurgitation were included. Data analysis was performed from October 2024 to December 2025. Exposure TAVR or MTEER. Main Outcomes and Measures The primary outcome measures were (1) 30-day all-cause mortality, (2) a 30-day composite outcome, and (3) in-hospital procedural complications following TAVR or MTEER. Data from the STS/ACC TVT Registry were analyzed for patients undergoing TAVR or MTEER between 2020 and 2023. The primary analysis assessed the association between operator volume and 30-day outcomes using a 2-level random-effects logistic regression model. The interaction between operator and hospital volumes and the association between TAVR and MTEER outcomes were also evaluated. Results A total of 358 943 patients underwent TAVR at 827 hospitals (7524 operators; median [IQR] annual volume, 24 [11-47]), and 51 407 patients underwent MTEER at 493 hospitals (2483 operators; median [IQR] annual volume, 12 [7-19]). For TAVR, median (IQR) patient age was 79.0 (73.0-85.0) years, and 152 186 patients (42.4%) were female; for MTEER, median (IQR) patient age was 79.0 (71.0-84.0) years, and 23 402 patients (45.5%) were female. Low-volume operators demonstrated inferior process of care measures compared with high-volume operators. In adjusted analyses, a higher risk of 30-day mortality (odds ratio [OR], 1.13; 95% CI, 1.02-1.26; P = .02) and in-hospital complications (OR, 1.09; 95% CI, 1.03-1.16; P = .005) was observed for low-volume TAVR operators (&amp;amp;lt;15/y) compared with high-volume operators (&amp;amp;gt;37/y). For MTEER, in-hospital complications (OR, 1.31; 95% CI, 1.11-1.56; P = .002) were higher for low-volume operators (&amp;amp;lt;8/y) compared with high-volume operators (&amp;amp;gt;16/y), while 30-day mortality was not different (OR, 1.16; 95% CI, 0.96-1.41; P = .12). Associations were consistent across hospital volume strata. Operator-level outcomes for TAVR and MTEER were not correlated. Conclusions and Relevance In this cohort study, results from a large, contemporary US registry demonstrate a persistent inverse association between operator volume and patient outcomes for both TAVR and MTEER. These findings may help inform future policies aimed at ensuring optimal outcomes."
OpenAlex,mitral regurgitation,Renal resistive index for risk stratification and functional evaluation after transcatheter mitral valve repair: the ReRISE study,Hannah Billig; Sophie Hofmann; Marc Ulrich Becher; Marc Adrian Rogmann; Johanna Vogelhuber; Sebastian Zimmer; Georg Nickenig; Can Öztürk,10.1007/s00392-025-02841-y,2026-01-08,Clinical Research in Cardiology,"Abstract Background The renal resistive index (RRI) is increasingly used as a non-invasive marker of cardiorenal interaction. We aimed to determine (i) whether baseline RRI predicts survival after mitral transcatheter edge-to-edge repair (M-TEER) and (ii) whether RRI changes in response to the procedure. Methods In this prospective, single-center cohort we enrolled consecutive patients with severe mitral regurgitation who underwent M-TEER between October 2020 and December 2021 (trial registration number 412/20, date of registration 02.09.2020). Baseline demographics, estimated laboratory parameters, comprehensive echocardiography, and Doppler-derived RRI were collected before and 3 months after intervention. The primary endpoint was all-cause mortality. Associations were analyzed with multivariable Cox regression. Renal endpoints were not systematically collected and were therefore not included as clinical outcome measures. Results Among 109 patients (53.2% women), the median baseline RRI was 0.71 (IQR 0.67–0.75) and showed no correlation with eGFR, left-ventricular ejection fraction, or echocardiographic measurements of mitral regurgitation at baseline. Higher RRI was associated with all-cause mortality, and in exploratory post hoc analyses an RRI cutoff &gt; 0.70 remained predictive independent of baseline renal function (HR 5.37, p 0.07). RRI improved significantly 3 months after M-TEER (0.67; IQR 0.63–0.70; p &lt; 0.001), particularly in patients with a post-procedural MR reduction of at least 1 grade. However, the change in RRI showed no correlation with mortality or changes in renal function. Conclusions A baseline RRI above 0.70 was independently associated with mortality following M–TEER, underscoring its potential prognostic relevance. The marked post-procedural decline in RRI, especially in patients with relevant MR improvement, suggests that RRI reflects hemodynamic rather than renal filtration changes. Given the limited sample size and number of events, these findings should be considered exploratory and hypothesis-generating, requiring validation in larger multicenter cohorts. Graphical Abstract"

The underlying cause was severe dynamic mitral regurgitation (MR) and secondary tricuspid regurgitation (TR). After successful extubation and weaning, the patient’s MR nearly resolved. Discharged in improved condition with guideline-directed medical therapy, the patient was soon readmitted for heart failure with pulmonary edema. The transthoracic echocardiogram confirmed recurrent, worsening MR.​ Transcatheter edge-to-edge repair was successfully performed, reducing the patient’s severe MR to trivial and resolving TR completely. At 1-year follow-up, the patient remained stable with improved cardiac function and no readmissions for cardiac causes."

We report a case of mitral valve replacement in a 76-year-old woman with a large caseous cavity, coronary artery disease, severe mitral valve stenosis and atrial fibrillation. Preoperative computed tomography showed a large caseous cavity (3 x 3.5 cm) in the posterior annulus extending into the atrioventricular groove. After unroofing and evacuation, the cavity was excluded with a pericardial patch. The lower edge of the patch was sutured to the ventricular side of the cavity; valve sutures passed through the residual posterior leaflet, the upper edge of the patch and the atrial edge of the cavity. The mitral prosthesis was then secured. The patient was weaned from cardiopulmonary bypass without complications. Intraoperative echocardiography demonstrated a well-seated mitral prosthesis with no valvular or paravalvular leaks. Postoperative imaging confirmed successful exclusion of the cavity in the atrioventricular groove. The postoperative echocardiogram revealed a mean gradient of 4 mmHg across the mitral prosthesis and no mitral regurgitation. Patch exclusion of the caseous cavity is a safe and feasible approach to support implanting a mitral prosthesis and obliterating a cavity."

Objectives: We aimed to study with an automatic three-dimensional transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) dedicated software patients with moderate and severe mitral regurgitation when compared to patients with no structural cardiac chamber alterations (patients with patent foramen ovale (PFO) who underwent TEE) . Methods: We employed a TEE software dedicated to automatic analysis of 34 parameters of the mitral valve apparatus comparing MVP patients with moderate and severe mitral regurgitation and patients with PFO without cardiac chamber structural alterations. Mitral valve effective regurgitant orifice (ERO) and regurgitant volume were correlated to automatic MVP parameters. Results: 59 MVP patients and 43 PFO patients were analysed. All MVP patients presented P2 mitral valve prolapse, 15 (25.4 % ) with both posterior and anterior prolapse. Twenty-seven automatic parameters (79%) were different concerning MVP and PFO patients (p&amp;lt; 0.05): diameters, area, perimeter, height, angle, coaptation width, lenght, closure line lenght, annulus. ERO was 0.43 + 0.11 cm2 , and regurgitant volume: 62.2 + 14.9 ml/beat. Automatic analysis correlated to 75 percentile ERO MVP patients (ERO&amp;gt; 0.48 cm2): Posterior Leafltet Area (r:0.74, p:0.031); Posterior Leafltet Lenght (r:0.73, p:0.032); Tenting area (r:0,41, p:0.048). Conclusions: Automatic mitral valve parameters analysis were different concerning MVP and no structural cardiac chamber (PFO) patients. 75 percentile ERO MVP patients (ERO&amp;gt; 0.48 cm2) correlated to posterior leaflet parameters.This anatomic information could be useful to planning and surgical treatment of mitral valve prolapse patients."

Yaffee,10.1093/ejcts/ezag016,2026-01-06,European Journal of Cardio-Thoracic Surgery,"Abstract OBJECTIVES Severe mitral annular calcification (MAC) carries an increased risk of perioperative complications in patients undergoing mitral valve surgery and may be considered a prohibitive surgical risk. Cavitron ultrasonic surgical aspiration (CUSA) has been reported as a method for controlled debridement of severe MAC during mitral valve surgery, however experience in the literature is limited. METHODS We assessed 30-day and intermediate-term outcomes in 67 consecutive patients (mean age: 72 (SD 9) years; female sex: 65.7% (44/67)) with severe MAC who underwent mitral valve repair or replacement for mitral stenosis and/or regurgitation using CUSA between 3/2021 and 12/2024. Operations included isolated mitral valve replacement (41.8% (28/67)), isolated mitral valve repair (4.5% (3/67)), mitral and aortic valve replacement (37.3% (25/67), mitral valve replacement with coronary bypass (6.0% (4/67)), and mitral and aortic valve replacement with coronary bypass (10.4% (7/67)). Intermediate survival was estimated using the Kaplan–Meier method. RESULTS Mortality rate was 6.0% (4/67), stroke was 3.0% (2/67), and new postoperative atrial fibrillation was 29.0% (20/67). There were no atrioventricular groove ruptures. At a median echocardiographic follow-up time of 361 days (IQR 112, 671) moderate paravalvular leak occurred in 3.0% (1/67). Mid-term all-cause mortality was 9.0% at a mean follow-up time of 42.5 (95% CI 39.0, 46.0) months. CONCLUSIONS The use of CUSA to debride severe mitral annular calcification in patients undergoing mitral valve surgery is associated with acceptable short-term morbidity and mortality and durable intermediate-term results. This technique allows surgical intervention in patients who may otherwise be deemed prohibitive surgical risk."

However, denoising strategies are crucial for the generation of reliable and high-quality InSAR products. In this framework, we propose a complete and generalized theoretical and statistical model to physically describe and simulate a noise-free interferogram, together with its corresponding noisy version, starting from the knowledge of the InSAR acquisition geometry and of the underlying topography. A deep-learning-based model is then trained in a fully-supervised manner to estimate high-resolution InSAR parameters, i.e. coherence and interferometric phase, leveraging the proposed statistical model. In particular, an accurate assessment of the network’s estimation performance is conducted by comparing it to state-of-the-art denoising filters, such as Boxcar and Phi-Net and showing the added value of the proposed theoretical modifications to the state-of-the-art literature."
OpenAlex,deep learning,Assessing knowledge in policing,Tom Cockcroft; Jennifer Norman; Clare Rawdin,,2026-05-05,CLOK (University of Central Lancashire),"Assessment is one important component of effective learning design. The process of assessment can be explained as starting with an understanding of what a learner needs to know or be able to do by the end of the learning experience, what they have to do to achieve this and what method is best applied to ascertain if the learner has reached the required level (Cockcroft, 2023). Without assessment, educators and trainers would have limited awareness of the extent to which (if at all) they are cultivating learners’ knowledge, attitudes and skills, both as the learning proceeds (formative assessment) and at the end of learning (summative assessment). Traditionally, much police learning and associated assessment has been in-house / work-based. It has been delivered within local Learning and Development units, typically by former police officers (Stanko & Hohl, 2018) with portfolios predominantly used as the mode of assessment for practitioners. The embedding of a professionalisation agenda over the last decade, however, has led to a renewed focus on assessment for officers who have joined through the graduate entry routes (formally known as the Policing Education Qualifications Framework, PEQF; see Wood, 2018), and continue to join through the Police Constable Entry Pathways (PCEP). Framed by recent trends within police learning and specifically developments in the field of rape investigation, the aim of this chapter is twofold. Firstly, there is a focus on what the Soteria ‘deep dives’ revealed about the process of assessment. In this chapter the focus is focused on the the role of assessment within the portfolio-based Serious Sexual Assault Investigator’s Development Programme (SSAIDP). Secondly, an examination of what ‘best practice assessment’ might look like in the Rape and Serious Sexual Offending (RASSO) context"

OpenAlex,deep learning,A Deep Learning Based Code Loop Discriminator for GPS Spoofing Mitigation,S. Tohidi; M. R. Mosavi,,2026-03-01,DOAJ (DOAJ: Directory of Open Access Journals),"A vital part of people's daily life is the position, navigation, and time service provided by the Global Positioning System (GPS), which is always accessible globally. Consequently, the security of the GPS receivers is crucial. Occasionally, intentional and unintentional interferences cause GPS location issues. Spoofing attack is the most severe interference to the GPS receivers, which results in positional mistakes. This paper's goal is to defend against the carry-off spoofing attacks. In a carry-off spoofing attempt, the spoofer transmits signals whose code phase and carrier frequency parameters are strikingly close to the actual signal in order to change the correlation values generated in the tracking stage. Discriminator output values alter as correlation values change. As a result, the Pseudo Random Noise (PRN) code generator unit creates a local replica, which forces the tracking loop to follow the fake signal instead of the real one. It is proposed in this paper that when spoofing attacks occur, discriminator output values be generated independently of correlation values. Specifically, when a spoofing signal is detected, the conventional discriminator is replaced by a Non-linear Autoregressive Exogenous Neural Network (NARX NN)-based predictor. This strategy protects the tracking loop from the effects of the spoofing signal. The efficiency of the provided strategy was evaluated using three spoofing data sets. The results of the suggested mitigation method, based on NARAX NN, show that it mitigates spoofing attacks by an average of 95.82%."

This study explores the emotional anatomy of fake news by re-annotating the widely used LIAR dataset, creating the Emotion-Labelled Fake News Dataset (ELFND). By leveraging advanced NLP methods, with a focus on VADER sentiment analysis, the dataset categorizes news articles according to emotions tone conveyed. Ensemble machine learning models, Random Forest and Gradient Boosting are employed to detect fake news by analyzing its emotional content. Furthermore, AI explainability methods, including LIME and SHAP, are utilized to offer a deeper understanding of how the model generates predictions, shedding light on how specific emotions contribute to the classification of news as fake. The findings reveal that emotions are crucial in the structure of fake news, and the use of XAI enhances transparency in misinformation detection, offering a clearer understanding of the emotional drivers behind fake news."

However, stable multi-particle levitation remains challenging due to complex acoustic dynamics and limitations of existing models. We introduce AcoustoReinforce, a reinforcement learning-based path planner that autonomously controls the motion of multiple levitated particles. Leveraging a decentralized architecture, it learns local neural policies that generate particle trajectories independently, enabling scalable, communication-free control even in densely populated acoustic fields. To ensure physical feasibility, acoustic trapping strength is incorporated as a constraint during both training and inference, producing trajectories that are collision-free, acoustically stable, and physically realizable within real-world system constraints. Experiments on a realworld levitation platform show that AcoustoReinforce outperforms state-of-the-art planners, improving task success rates by up to 130% across diverse configurations. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of learning-based decentralized control for complex multi-object acoustophoresis in real environments."

This thesis advances qualify as-you-build manufacturing by developing high-fidelity, data-driven surrogate models that transform in-process monitoring data into real-time predictions of sub-surface pores and surface dimensional errors. A co-axial optical monitoring system comprising a photodiode and an NIR camera captured the laser-powder interaction, with X-ray computed tomography providing ground-truth labels. For binary pore detection, a hybrid CNN-LSTM model that incorporated inter-hatch and inter-layer remelting effects achieved an area under the Receiver Operating Characteristic curve (AUROC) of 0.91 for pores exceeding 8000 µm3. To predict keyhole pore, physics-informed melt pool features integrated into a Random Forest model (AUROC = 0.95) outperformed deep learning benchmarks, delivering superior accuracy at substantially lower computational cost. In lack-of-fusion porosity regression, the CNN-LSTM surrogate model achieved high accuracy in within-scenario predictions (RMSE = 2.1 %). Domain adversarial transfer learning enhanced cross-scenario performance by up to 35 %, highlighting the potential of the surrogate model to generalize across part positions and process parameters. The hyperparameter associated with inter-layer remelting was further validated against the ratio of melt pool depth to layer thickness, ensuring alignment with process physics. Surface geometric deviation prediction was advanced through a CNN-Transformer architecture that correlates melt pool signatures with CAD referenced 3D voxel volumes, achieving RMSE values of 6.1 µm (up-skin) and 27.4 µm (down-skin). Model interpretability was provided through Grad-CAM visualizations and Transformer attention maps, highlighting critical spatial regions and temporal dependencies governing defect formation. Collectively, these contributions support the vision of first-time-right manufacturing in PBF-LB/M. By strengthening defect localization, improving predictive fidelity, and enhancing generalization, this thesis lays the foundation for digital product passports, feedback-loop control, and broader industrial adoption of in-situ quality assurance."
