PubMed,aortic stenosis,Survival with aortic valve replacement in asymptomatic individuals with severe aortic stenosis and a left ventricular ejection fraction of 50% to 54.,Muhammad Etiwy; Adam N Berman; Michael H Picard; Chiara Fraccaro; Nicole Karam; Meagan M Wasfy; Yunong Zhao; Magdi Zordok; John Hsu; Jason H Wasfy,10.25270/jic/25.00332,2026-01-15,The Journal of invasive cardiology,"Severe aortic stenosis (AS) with a left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) of 50% to 54% is associated with worse outcomes than an LVEF greater than or equal to 55%. European guidelines consider aortic valve replacement (AVR) a Class IIa indication for asymptomatic patients with an LVEF of less than 55%, whereas American guidelines recommend AVR when the LVEF is less than 50%. The authors assessed outcomes of AVR vs conservative management in this range where guidelines differ.
A registry was created for individuals with severe high-gradient AS (AVA ≤ 1 cm²), an LVEF of 50% to 54%, and a mean gradient greater than or equal to 40 mm Hg from 2000 to 2022 using queries of transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) reports. Only asymptomatic cases were included; time-zero was defined as the time of the index TTE, and both AVR (considered as a time-dependent covariate) and mortality could occur at any point after. Proportional hazard modeling assessed the AVR-mortality association, with subset analyses for individuals with AVAs of less than 0.9 cm² and less than or equal to 0.75 cm².
Among 693 included individuals, 83 were asymptomatic at their index TTE. Of these, 38 (45.8%) underwent AVR within 2 years. After adjusting for immortal time, individuals with AVR had a trend toward decreased mortality (HR, 0.56; 95% CI, 0.31-1.01; P = .054). Among individuals with AVAs of less than 0.9 cm² and less than or equal to 0.75 cm², AVR was associated with improved survival (HR, 0.42; 95% CI, 0.21-0.84; P less tan .01 and HR, 0.33; 95% CI, 0.15-0.75; P less than .008, respectively).
AVR within 2 years was associated with improved survival among asymptomatic individuals with high-grade severe AS and an LVEF of 50% to 54%."

However, the three-dimensional organization of cardiac tissue underlying left ventricular hypertrophy remains poorly understood. We developed CaMVIA-3D, a deep-learning volumetric imaging and analysis pipeline to characterize cardiac microarchitecture. Analysis of tissues from HCM hearts revealed genotype-specific differences in cardiomyocyte volume, morphology, and extracellular volume, with pathogenic variants exhibiting greater concentric cellular hypertrophy and disarray and variant-negative cases showing predominant fibrosis. Longitudinal profiling of a pig HCM model revealed early-onset fibrosis preceding cardiomyocyte hypertrophy. Integrating transcriptomic and morphologic changes, we identified genes associated with cellular and extracellular remodeling. These findings define genotype-specific microstructural differences in HCM, offering insights to improve diagnostics and targeted therapies."

Cardiovascular interventions,"There are limited data concerning the impact of heart failure (HF) guideline-directed medical therapy (GDMT) in patients with HF with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) who undergo transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR).
The aims of this study were to determine whether TAVR patients with HFrEF receive optimal HF-GDMT and to investigate the prognostic significance of HF-GDMT in this setting.
In a prospective registry, consecutive TAVR patients with HFrEF were stratified into 4 groups (quadruple, triple, double, or single or no therapy) according to prescription of HF-GDMT at discharge post-TAVR and after a 3-month GDMT optimization period. Major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) were defined as a composite of cardiovascular mortality or hospitalization for heart failure. The median follow-up time was 699 days (Q1-Q3: 510-961 days).
Among 336 TAVR patients with HFrEF, the rates of quadruple, triple, double, and single or no HF-GDMT were 15%, 19%, 28%, and 38% at discharge and 27%, 21%, 21%, and 27% at 3 months postprocedure, respectively. Among 280 patients (83.3%) eligible for quadruple HF-GDMT, only 27% (n = 76) received this combination at 3 months post-TAVR. Following a 3-month HF-GDMT optimization period, 2-year MACE rates were lower in patients taking quadruple (15.0%; 95% CI: 5.2%-24.8%) compared with triple (22.6%; 95% CI: 10.4%-34.8%), double (24.2%; 95% CI: 13.8%-34.6%), and single or no therapy (43.6%; 95% CI: 31.8%-55.4%; log-rank P < 0.001).
HF-GDMT is underused in patients with HFrEF who undergo TAVR, and suboptimal HF-GDMT is associated with increased MACE in this setting. Strategies to improve the initiation and up-titration of HF-GDMT in TAVR patients with HFrEF are needed."

While computed tomography (CT) is the gold-standard for annular sizing in TAVR, its routine use in SAVR planning is limited by resource constraints.
To develop and validate the Patient Referral Evaluation to Determine Indication for CT (PREDICT) model - a predictive tool utilizing anthropometric and transthoracic echocardiography (TTE)-derived data to identify SAS at the point of referral.
This retrospective, multicentre study included 1708 patients with severe aortic stenosis undergoing CT for annular assessment. A development cohort (n = 912) was used to construct the PREDICT multivariate regression model incorporating left ventricular outflow tract diameter (LVOTd), height, and sex. PREDICT performance was evaluated in a separate validation cohort (n = 796) using R2, Bland-Altman analysis, and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves. Diagnostic accuracy was assessed for small annulus (≤430mm2), very small annulus (VSAS≤400mm2), and extremely small annulus (ESAS≤370mm2).
In the validation cohort, PREDICT demonstrated good-to-excellent predictive accuracy, with AUCs of 0.838, 0.849, and 0.858 for SAS, VSAS, and ESAS, respectively; outperforming height and LVOTd alone (p < 0.001). Negative predictive values were consistently high, exceeding 88% across all annulus size thresholds, confirming PREDICT's excellent rule-out capability. Bland-Altman analysis showed good agreement with CT (mean bias -7 mm2). Diagnostic performance was unaffected by age or sex (p > 0.40).
PREDICT is a simple, accurate, non-invasive tool for identifying SAS at referral-optimizing CT use and enabling earlier planning to reduce PPM in severe aortic stenosis patients."
PubMed,aortic stenosis,Intravascular Lithotripsy of Negatively Remodeled Calcified Abdominal Aorta to Facilitate Transfemoral Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement.,Takeshi Nishi; Jagadeesh K Kalavakunta; Abhinav Sood; Jerry W Pratt; Frank Saltiel; Vishal Gupta,10.1016/j.jaccas.2025.106527,2025-12-18,JACC. Case reports,"Transfemoral access is the preferred route for transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR), but severe calcification and luminal narrowing of the iliofemoral artery or abdominal aorta may preclude safe large-bore sheath passage. Intravascular lithotripsy (IVL) has been increasingly used for iliofemoral vessel preparation, yet its application in the abdominal aorta has been rarely reported.
An 84-year-old woman with symptomatic severe aortic stenosis was deemed high risk for transfemoral TAVR owing to severe narrowing with circumferential calcification of infrarenal aorta with luminal diameter <5 mm. To preserve transfemoral access, IVL with a 7.0-mm Shockwave balloon was performed using stepwise low-pressure inflations (1-6 atm, 300 pulses), achieving adequate luminal expansion for an 18-F sheath. A 23-mm self-expanding valve was successfully implanted without complications, and the patient was discharged the next day.
This case demonstrates that IVL can safely modify a small-caliber, circumferentially calcified iliofemoral and abdominal aorta to facilitate transfemoral TAVR.
Stepwise low-pressure inflations and meticulous procedural planning may expand the feasibility of transfemoral access in patients otherwise considered for higher-risk alternative routes."

While transthoracic echocardiography remains the diagnostic standard, deep learning-based approaches offer the potential for improved disease tracking. This study examined the longitudinal changes in a previously developed deep learning-derived index for AS continuum (DLi-ASc) and assessed its prognostic association with progression to severe AS.
We retrospectively analyzed 2373 patients (7371 transthoracic echocardiographies) from 2 tertiary hospitals. DLi-ASc (scaled 0-100), derived from parasternal long-axis and short-axis views, was tracked longitudinally. The median follow-up duration was 42.8 (interquartile range, 22.2-75.7) months.
DLi-ASc increased in parallel with worsening AS stages (P for trend<0.001) and showed strong correlations with aortic valve maximal velocity (Pearson correlation coefficient, 0.69; P<0.001) and mean pressure gradient (Pearson correlation coefficient, 0.66; P<0.001). Higher baseline DLi-ASc was associated with a faster AS progression rate (P for trend<0.001). Additionally, the annualized change in DLi-ASc, estimated using linear mixed-effect models, correlated strongly with the annualized progression of aortic valve maximal velocity (Pearson correlation coefficient, 0.71, P<0.001) and mean pressure gradient (Pearson correlation coefficient, =0.68; P<0.001). In Fine-Gray competing risk models, baseline DLi-ASc was independently associated with progression to severe AS, even after adjustment for aortic valve maximal velocity or mean pressure gradient (hazard ratios per 10-point increase, 2.38 and 2.80, respectively).
DLi-ASc increased in parallel with AS progression and was independently associated with severe AS progression. These findings support its role as a noninvasive imaging-based digital marker for longitudinal AS monitoring and risk stratification."

ARIC (Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities) study participants with protocol echocardiography at Visit 5 (V5; 2011-2013) and free of aortic valve (AV) replacement or cardiovascular disease were classified by ACC/AHA AS stages at V5 and Visit 7 (V7; 2018-2019). AS stage progression was defined as AV replacement or hospitalization, or a higher stage at V7. Associations of AS stage at V5 and AS stage progression from V5 to V7 with cardiac structure and function were assessed using multivariable linear regression. Associations of extra-AV cardiac abnormality categories with AS stage progression were assessed by multivariable logistic regression.
Of 5206 V5 participants (age 75±5 years, 40% men), AS stages A and B at V5 were associated with greater left ventricular wall thickness, mass, and filling pressure measures at both V5 and V7 compared with Stage 0. Among 1562 participants with assessable AS stage at V7, AS stage progression occurred in 370 and was associated with greater worsening of these measures (all P<0.02). The presence of both left ventricular and left atrial extra-AV abnormalities was associated with greater likelihood of AS stage progression (odds ratio 1.7 [95% CI, 1.2-2.6], P=0.009).
Early AS stages are associated with greater left ventricular mass and diastolic dysfunction, and AS stage progression is associated with worsening of these measures. The presence of both left ventricular and left atrial extra-AV abnormalities is associated with a greater likelihood of early AS stage progression."

To better comprehend the causal link between circulating cytokines and CAVS, we performed a bidirectional Mendelian randomization (MR) study. Genetic variants associated with 41 cytokines were obtained from public genome-wide association study (GWAS), and summary statistics for GWAS of CAVS were obtained from the FinnGen consortium. Forward MR analysis was conducted to determine the impacts of 41 cytokines on CAVS risk and reverse MR analysis was used to determine whether genetic susceptibility to CAVS altered the levels of these cytokines. Inverse-variance weighting (IVW) was implemented as the primary method, and several different sensitivity analyses were used to verify the reliability of the findings. Our results found no significant association between 41 cytokines and CAVS risk. However, increased levels of interleukin-18 (IL-18) (odds ratio [OR] = 1.080, 95% CI: 1.024-1.139) and interferon-gamma (IFN-γ) (OR = 1.157, 95% CI: 1.028-1.302) had suggestive connections with an elevated risk of CAVS, and increased levels of IL-13 (OR = 0.942, 95% CI: 0.890-0.997) and IL-5 (OR = 0.892, 95% CI: 0.804-0.990) had suggestive associations with a reduced risk of CAVS. A reverse MR analysis found that CAVS had a suggestive relationship with a reduced level of platelet-derived growth factor BB (PDGF-BB) (OR = 0.920, 95% CI: 0.853-0.993) and IL-4 (OR = 0.925, 95% CI: 0.856-1.000). Our findings suggest the causal effects of IL-18, IFN-γ, IL-13, and IL-5 on CAVS risk, and genetic predisposition of CAVS may reduce the levels of PDGF-BB and IL-4."

Brachial-ankle pulse wave velocity (baPWV) is an established marker of arterial stiffness and a predictor of cardiovascular events. This study investigated the association between FLI and baPWV in a general Japanese population.
This cross-sectional study included participants aged ≥18 years, excluding those with atrial fibrillation, lower extremity artery disease, severe aortic stenosis, or missing data. The primary outcome was an elevated baPWV (≥1,800 cm/s). Multivariable logistic regression analysis was performed to assess the association between FLI and elevated baPWV, considering FLI both as a categorical variable (low risk: FLI <30; moderate risk: FLI ≥30 and <60; high risk: FLI ≥60) and as a continuous variable (per 10-unit increase). The analysis included 10,122 individuals (mean age 54.3 years; 55% male). In multivariable-adjusted models, the odds of elevated baPWV were significantly higher in the moderate-risk (odds ratio [OR] 1.47; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.20-1.79) and high-risk (OR 1.78; 95% CI 1.33-2.38) groups, using the low-risk group as the reference category. Each 10-unit increase in FLI was associated with significantly higher odds of the outcome (OR 1.16; 95% CI 1.10-1.22).
FLI showed a significant association with arterial stiffness in the general Japanese population."

Factors contributing to frailty include sarcopenia (characterized by reduced muscle mass), osteopenia (characterized by decreased bone mineral density), and the newly termed osteosarcopenia, which is characterized by a simultaneous decline in muscle mass and bone mineral density. In this study, we aimed to investigate the impacts of sarcopenia, osteopenia, and osteosarcopenia on the clinical outcomes of TAVI.
We retrospectively analyzed 490 patients who underwent TAVI for aortic stenosis at Yamaguchi University Hospital between April 2014 and March 2025. Osteopenia, sarcopenia, and osteosarcopenia were diagnosed by preprocedural computed tomography. Patients were classified into normal (N), sarcopenia alone (S), osteopenia alone (O), and osteosarcopenia (OS) groups. Early clinical outcomes and 1-year survival rates exhibited no significant differences among the groups. However, the 5-year survival rates were 94.1%, 77.6%, 60.4%, and 46.5% in the N, S, O, and OS groups, respectively (P<0.05). The Cox proportional hazards model revealed osteosarcopenia as a significant risk factor for late death (hazard ratio, 2.09; P=0.0002).

Clinical presentation varies depending on the location and extent of the lesion. Treatment options include open surgery and endovascular approaches. Intravascular lithotripsy (IVL) is a novel endovascular technique that delivers acoustic shockwaves to modify calcified lesions, allowing luminal expansion. We report the case of a 76-year-old female with severe stenosis of the suprarenal aorta, right renal artery, superior and inferior mesenteric artery, and occluded left renal artery. Due to the anatomical complexity and lack of suitable landing zones, the suprarenal aorta was treated with IVL alone without stent or stent-graft placement. To preserve mesenteric perfusion, a balloon-expandable stent was deployed in the inferior mesenteric artery, which served as the dominant supply due to severe superior mesenteric artery stenosis. Following IVL, the patient reported immediate symptom resolution with no periprocedural complications. This case highlights the potential role of IVL as a safe, effective standalone treatment for complex CRA cases."

Sixty patients meeting inclusion and exclusion criteria with at least one criterion of a high risk for AV conduction disorder were enrolled in the study. All included patients were randomized 1:1 into two groups. In Group 1, TAVI was performed using a 3D navigation-guided technique, while in Group 2, the classical TAVI technique was used. The primary endpoint was the composite incidence of permanent pacemaker (PP) implantation and new-onset complete left bundle branch block (LBBB) at 6 months.Results  In the early postoperative period, the 3D navigation-guided TAVI group had a lower incidence of new-onset LBBB (10.3% vs. 33.3%; p=0.03), better parameters of intraventricular conduction according to electrophysiology study (EPS) (H-V interval 79.1±13.5 ms vs. 96.0±39.9 ms; p=0.03) and electrocardiography (QRS complex duration 108.0±16.3 ms vs. 119.0±22.6 ms; p=0.04). The incidence of PP implantation during the hospital stage, A-H interval duration, and Wenckebach point in the AV junction according to EPS did not differ significantly between the groups. The incidence of the primary endpoint (PP implantation + new-onset LBBB) during the 6-month follow-up period was 43.3% in the classical technique group and 16.7% in the 3D navigation-guided TAVI group (p=0.02). There were no statistically significant differences between the groups in the incidence of procedural complications or major adverse cardiovascular and cerebrovascular outcomes.Conclusion         This study demonstrated the efficacy and safety of a new 3D navigation-guided TAVI technique in reducing the composite rate of implantation PP and LBBB at 6 months post-procedure, with comparable rates of procedural complications and major adverse cardiac and cerebrovascular events (MACCE) during long-term follow-up. Implementation of these findings into clinical practice will enable personalization and optimization of transcatheter treatment outcomes in patients with severe AS."

From December 2016 to December 2023, 155 patients received AVNeo at the Heart Institute, while 301 underwent BioSAVR. Baseline characteristics were balanced using 1:1 propensity matching.
132 identical patient pairs were included in the analysis. Neocuspidization had longer ischemic times (98.67 ± 28.47 min vs. 66.76 ± 25.04 min, ρ < 0.001). Permanent pacemaker implantation (ρ = 0.072) and paravalvular leaks (ρ = 0.041) were more common in the BioSAVR group. Follow-up averaged 43.8 ± 27.30 months. Severe post-procedural aortic stenosis (PPAS) was more frequent after BioSAVR (3 (2.8%) vs. 1 (0.9%), ρ = 0.006), but AVNeo experienced more recurrent severe aortic regurgitation (AR) (3 (2.8%) vs. 0, ρ = 0.035). Reoperation rates were similar (AVNeo 3.1%, BioSAVR 1.5%, ρ = 0.680). Prosthetic valve endocarditis (PVE) was responsible for half (2 cases) of the AVNeo reoperations. Survival rate during follow-up was comparable: 92.8% (AVNeo) and 94.4% (BioSAVR), ρ = 0.672.
Immediate and mid-term AVNeo quality outcomes were comparable to those of BioSAVR. Transvalvular hemodynamics were better, and the incidence of PPAS was lower after AVNeo, supporting the recommendation of this procedure for patients at high risk of patient-prosthesis mismatch. During follow-up, AVNeo patients require close monitoring for recurrent AR and aggressive PVE prophylaxis. A multicenter long-term study is needed to confirm the stability of hemodynamic performance, the rate of Structural Valve Deterioration, and the incidence of PVE in AVNeo patients over the long term."

However, data on post-TAVI extremity function are limited. This sub-study of the TAVI XS trial aimed to assess extremity function after transfemoral TAVI, evaluate functional decline, compare outcomes between upper-and lower-extremity secondary access approaches and identify predictors of functional decline after TAVI.
The TAVI XS was a randomized clinical trial comparing upper- and lower-extremity secondary access during TAVI. Patients were assessed for extremity function at baseline and at 30 days using the Lower Extremity Function Scale (higher score indicating better function) and the Quick Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder, and Hand questionnaire (higher score indicating worse function).
Lower-extremity (45.0 [IQR 35.0-57.0] to 52.0 [39.0-63.0]; p < 0.001), and upper-extremity function (11.4 [2.3-25.0] to 6.8 [0-22.7]; p = 0.003) improved after TAVI. Relevant decline in lower-extremity function occurred in 20 (8.4%) patients, and in upper-extremity function in 19 (8.0%) patients. No differences in post-TAVI function were observed between upper- or lower-extremity secondary access (lower-extremity: 10.1% vs. 6.7%; p = 0.35, upper-extremity: 7.6% vs. 8.4%; p = 0.81). Predictors (OR [95% CI]) of clinically relevant decline were baseline use of dual antiplatelet therapy/oral anticoagulants (4.17 [1.39-12.49]; p = 0.01) for lower-extremity function and multiple punctures (4.05 [1.46-11.24]; p = 0.007) for upper-extremity function. Age inversely affected lower- (0.92 [0.85-0.99/year]; p = 0.02) and upper-extremity function (0.93 [0.86-0.99/year]; p = 0.04).
The incidence of clinically relevant decline in extremity function after TAVI is low. No differences in reported extremity function were observed between the upper- and lower-extremity secondary access approach. Predictors of decline were antithrombotic therapy and multiple punctures.

A 39-year-old male with Kawasaki disease at the age of 2 months underwent coronary artery bypass grafting to the right coronary artery and left anterior descending artery because of coronary artery stenoses. In the screening by thoracic-abdominal CT before the operation, calcification of the distal abdominal aorta was detected, and an abdominal aortic aneurysm with stenosis was diagnosed. He had been asymptomatic, and there were no differences in his extremities' blood pressure. Although a slight dilatation of the distal abdominal aorta had existed in his aortogram at 2 years 9 months old, the abnormal finding had been unnoticed. A 26-year-old female with coronary artery bypass grafting at the age of 23 months had hypertension. A stenosis of the orifice at the right renal artery was detected by two-dimensional echocardiography and a magnetic resonance angiogram. Her hypertension in adulthood was suspected to result from her renal artery stenosis, which acute Kawasaki vasculitis underlies. Although coronary artery lesions in both patients were diagnosed in their childhood, systemic artery lesions were not realised until adulthood. Because abdominal aortic aneurysms and renal artery stenosis are extremely rare, they were not recognised as systemic artery lesions caused by Kawasaki disease. Their lesions can occur in patients with severe acute vasculitis at a significantly younger age, less than 6 months. Systemic artery lesions in such adult patients must be carefully evaluated."

It is identified when there is impaired global longitudinal strain (GLS) with paradoxically advanced time to peak strain (TPS) in a hypertrophied apex with relative sparing of the basal segments. On a standard polar map, GLS will have a pale center while TPS will depict a more robust blue center.
While the ""Blueberry-on-Top"" pattern has been observed in a few prior reports, its true prevalence in patients with ApHCM is currently unknown. We sought to examine the prevalence of this strain pattern among patients with ApHCM.
A series of patients diagnosed with ApHCM by cardiac MRI were included and compared to a series of normal controls. All patients underwent a standard transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE). For uniform reporting, all echocardiogram studies were post-processed using Tomtec, which is a vendor-independent speckle tracking analysis software.
From a cohort of 340 patients with HCM, a total of 15 patients with ApHCM were identified and subsequently compared to 15 normal controls. The ""Blueberry-on-Top"" pattern was observed in 93% (n = 14) of patients with ApHCM, while none of the normal controls had a ""Blueberry-on-Top"" pattern. We identified a GLS ratio threshold of 1.26 and a normalized time to peak strain (NTPS) ratio threshold of 0.09. When both thresholds are met, the ""Blueberry-on-Top"" phenomenon has nearly 100% sensitivity and 93% specificity for the diagnosis of ApHCM. We suggest using these parameters as an adjunctive tool for making the clinical diagnosis of ApHCM and integrating them into a more comprehensive approach.
The newly recognized ""Blueberry-on-Top"" strain pattern is unique and can be used as a supportive diagnostic feature in ApHCM."

Clinical data, fetal echocardiography, postnatal contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) findings, surgical intervention, and outcomes were reviewed. Narrowest tracheal diameter (NTD) Z score in late gestation and narrowest-to-reference tracheal area (NTA/RTA) ratio on postnatal CT were measured. Primary and secondary outcomes included respiratory symptoms shortly after birth and elective surgery, respectively. Groups were compared using t-tests, and the optimal cutoff values were determined using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis. Reproducibility was assessed using intraclass correlation coefficient. Twenty-two patients were included: 5 symptomatic and 17 asymptomatic (12, prophylactic surgery; 5, observation). Symptomatic patients had significantly lower NTD Z scores (median - 1.8 vs. -1.2, P = 0.012) and NTA/RTA ratios (median 0.39 vs. 0.67, P < 0.001). NTD Z score ≤ - 1.7 (area under the ROC curve [AUC] 0.87; sensitivity 80%, specificity 88%) and NTA/RTA ratio ≤ 0.5 (AUC 0.94; sensitivity 100%, specificity 82%) were optimal thresholds for predicting early symptoms. In the asymptomatic group, NTA/RTA ratio ≥ 0.56 identified candidates for observation without surgery. The ICC values for both parameters exceeded 0.85, indicating excellent reproducibility. The prenatal NTD Z score and postnatal NTA/RTA ratio accurately predict postnatal respiratory symptoms in fetuses with DAA. These quantitative parameters may guide individualized perinatal management and surgical decision-making."

This retrospective single-centre study aims to provide additional insight into clinical outcomes and its determinants following TMVI.
Data of all TMVI procedures (n = 88) performed between February 2014 and June 2024 were retrospectively analyzed. The primary endpoints were 1-year mortality and the Mitral Valve Academic Research Consortium (MVARC) composite endpoints. Secondary outcomes included complications and echocardiographic outcomes.
Overall, in-hospital, 30-day, and 1-year mortality rates were 6.8%, 5.8%, and 16.5%, respectively. No significant differences were observed between transseptal and transapical approach (20.0 vs 13.2%, p = 0.439) or between valve-in-valve and valve-in-ring procedure (16.3 vs 18.2%, p = 0.828). At 1-year follow-up, only one patient presented with mitral regurgitation ≥ grade 2. However, a post-procedural mean pressure gradient (MPG) ≥5 mmHg was observed in 51 patients (58%). In multivariate analysis, higher post-procedural MPG was associated with increased mortality risk (p = 0.047, HR = 1.23, 95% CI: 1.00-1.51), whereas technical success was associated with reduced mortality risk (p = 0.014, HR = 0.12, 95% CI: 0.02-0.65).
TMVI provided acceptable mid-term mortality irrespective of procedure type and access route, with excellent technical success. Furthermore, mid-term follow-up showed near-complete elimination of mitral regurgitation. However, a high rate of post-procedural relevant mitral stenosis was observed, which may have an impact on mortality. In the light of the anticipated increase in TMVI procedures, we advocate for larger prospective studies to investigate the long-term determinants of mortality."

The procedure was initially performed using systems designed for mitral valve repair, which were replaced by tricuspid-dedicated devices. This retrospective study compared outcomes of tricuspid-dedicated devices (TriClip or PASCAL) with a non-dedicated device (MitraClip) used for TR treatment. MATERIAL AND METHODS We analyzed data from 44 consecutive patients (mean age 74.7±7.5 years) who underwent T-TEER (2018-2024): 22 with non-dedicated (MitraClip) and 22 with dedicated systems (TriClip or PASCAL). The primary endpoint was technical success. Secondary endpoints included post-procedural TR≤ moderate, ≥2-grade TR reduction, peri-procedural complications, and 6-month mortality. RESULTS Baseline characteristics were largely balanced, although the non-dedicated group showed greater left-ventricular dysfunction. Technical success was significantly higher with dedicated systems (100% vs 77.3%, risk ratio 1.29; 95% CI 1.03-1.63; P=0.048) Post-procedural moderate or less TR and a reduction of ≥2 grades was achieved in 68.2% of patients with dedicated devices vs 31.8% with non-dedicated devices (risk ratio 2.14, 95% CI 1.09-4.21; P=0.02). Mortality during a 6-month follow-up was comparable between both cohorts (0.0% vs 9.1%; risk ratio 1.10; 95% CI 0.96-1.26; P=0.23). CONCLUSIONS Tricuspid-dedicated systems (TriClip or PASCAL) were associated with higher procedural success rates and greater TR reduction. They improved early outcomes and enabled the application of T‑TEER in a broader population of patients with less-advanced heart failure. Given the limited sample size and retrospective design, these findings should be interpreted with caution and regarded as exploratory and hypothesis-generating."

PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science were searched for studies evaluating the prognostic impact of RVPA coupling in patients undergoing MTEER, using tricuspid annular plane systolic excursion (TAPSE)/pulmonary artery systolic pressure (PASP) or related markers. Risk of bias was assessed with the ROBINS-I tool, and meta-analyses were used to evaluate associations with clinical outcomes, including all-cause mortality, major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE), and residual mitral regurgitation (MR).
Nine studies involving 3281 patients were included. Baseline RVPA uncoupling was significantly associated with an increased incidence of MACE (risk ratio [RR] 1.75, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.40-2.19) and higher all-cause mortality (RR 1.82, 95% CI: 1.53-2.18). No significant association was observed with post-operative MR (RR 1.17, 95% CI: 0.83-1.63). Sensitivity analyses did not alter the direction of the findings.
RVPA uncoupling is associated with adverse outcomes after MTEER. Routine assessment may improve pre-procedural risk stratification. Further studies should refine diagnostic thresholds and evaluate potential therapeutic strategies in the setting of impaired RVPA coupling prior to MTEER."

The distinct features and prognosis of HNDC compared to classical dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) are partially unexplored. We investigated the differences between HNDC and DCM cohorts from the multicentric Italian IN-HF registry.
All patients with a diagnosis of DCM enrolled in the registry between 2008 and 2023 were considered. HNDC was defined by a left ventricular end-diastolic diameter of less than 34 mm/m2 in men and less than 31 mm/m2 in women, or a left ventricular end-diastolic volume of 70 ml/m2 or less in men and less than 60 ml/m2 in women. The primary outcome was a composite of all-cause death and heart failure hospitalizations (HFHs).
Of 1748 patients, 568 (32.5%) met the criteria for HNDC. HNDC patients were more likely to be male, with a higher prevalence of obesity and atrial fibrillation. HNDC also showed less advanced disease (less advanced New York Association class, higher left ventricular ejection fraction, lower prevalence of moderate-severe mitral regurgitation, and less atrial dilatation). After a median follow-up of 13 months, the primary outcome occurred less frequently in HNDC compared with DCM [12.5 vs. 17.1%; hazard ratio 0.762, 95% confidence interval (95% CI) 0.581-0.999; P = 0.049]. However, the adjusted prognosis was similar between groups (hazard ratio 1.031, 95% CI 0.771-1.380; P = 0.834). Beta-blockers emerged as the most protective drug for HNDC (hazard ratio 0.462, 95% CI 0.258-0.826; P = 0.009).
HNDC appears as a distinct form of DCM with milder clinical presentation. However, the absence of LV dilation did not independently influence prognosis. Beta-blockers may offer the most consistent benefit in HNDC."

Previous studies have largely focused on central mitral regurgitation with favorable valve anatomy or a general broad spectrum of complex mitral regurgitation. However, no established approach is currently available for M-TEER in commissural degenerative mitral regurgitation (DMR).
Therefore, this study aimed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of a novel morphology classification-guided M-TEER strategy for treating commissural DMR using the MitraClip system. This prospective, multicenter, single-arm, objective performance criteria study involved 12 experienced centers in Asia, primarily located in China. Patients with symptomatic moderate-to-severe (3+) and severe (4+) native DMR and commissural involvement were stratified into three morphological categories based on an echocardiographic core laboratory analysis, and tailored M-TEER strategies were proposed. The primary endpoint is the proportion of patients achieving a mitral regurgitation (MR) grade of ≤1+ without repeat mitral intervention at one-year follow-up. Clinical, echocardiographic, functional, and quality-of-life outcomes were assessed over one year.
Based on statistical power calculations, a total of 148 patients are required to achieve adequate power to test the primary efficacy hypothesis, accounting for an estimated 10% attrition rate at 12 months.
The morphology classification system enhances M-TEER for commissural DMR by addressing the unique challenges of this approach, enabling tailored interventions that optimize procedural success and patient outcomes.

Additionally, anatomical and pathophysiological heterogeneity significantly influences procedural complexity, durability of repair, and clinical outcomes within both primary and secondary MR. Furthermore, recent trials suggest that the timing of the intervention is as critical as patient anatomy; delaying treatment until advanced ventricular remodeling has occurred may limit the benefits of MR reduction. Moreover, long-term data on durability and device-failure management remain limited, particularly in secondary MR, where the progression of the underlying cardiomyopathy largely determines the outcomes. Thus, this review underscores how integrating MR subtyping with intervention strategies may influence patient selection and highlights the need for future research to adopt a more individualized, mechanism-driven approach."

On the other hand, atrial fibrillation (Af) is one of the primary causes of AFMR, and increasing in the elderly population residing in industrialized countries. In addition, in recent years, flow energy loss (EL) assessed by four-dimensional (4D) flow magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is expected to be a novel parameter of cardiac workload. This study aimed to evaluate the pathophysiology of AFMR by comparing parameters between AFMR with Af and structural MR (StMR) with prolapse from a viewpoint of hemodynamic.
This study was a prospective study. Preoperative 4D flow MRI studies were performed in 10 AFMR for Af and 10 StMR for prolapse surgical candidates. Study results were segmented to visualize flow patterns, quantify hemodynamics, and energy dynamics [EL and cardiac output (CO), among other parameters], using iTFlow2 (Cardio Flow Design Inc., Tokyo, Japan). Statistical analysis the Mann-Whitney U test was used to compare the differences between the two groups, and Spearman's correlation coefficient by the Mann-Whitney U test, and Spearman's correlation coefficient was performed.
In AFMR, CO and cardiac index (CI) were significantly lower [CO: 5.01 (4.53-6.13) vs. 8.54 (7.51-11.11) L/min, P<0.001; CI: 3.54 (3.17-3.98) vs. 5.47 (4.37-6.09) L/min/m2; P=0.007], with lower systemic (left side) EL (ltEL) [3.34 (1.96-6.46) vs. 7.13 (4.75-9.72) mW, P=0.08] and higher pulmonary (right side) EL (rtEL) [2.43 (1.87-4.03) vs. 1.70 (1.18-2.13) mW, P=0.17]. TR fraction was higher [56.1% (39.5-69.2%) vs. 29.0% (20.9-37.9%), P=0.01], while the left ventricular end-diastolic volume (LVEDV) was significantly lower [134.6 (114.1-177.3) vs. 209.0 (190.1-255.6) mL, P=0.01]. EL densities [defined as EL/each chamber volume (mW/mL)] and CO ratios [defined as EL/CO (mW·min·m2/L)] were significantly reduced compared to those of StMR (all P<0.05). In the AFMR group, a positive relationship was observed between ltEL and both ventricular volumes, rtEL, and right ventricular volume (P<0.05). Af duration showed a non-significant but positive correlation with rtEL/CO (P=0.056).
4D flow MRI revealed that AFMR is associated with lower CO, higher pulmonary load and right ventricular enlargement, compressing the left ventricle, and increasing systemic EL. Longer Af duration correlates with higher EL in smaller left ventricles."

Although there is broad alignment in principles of intervention, prosthesis choice, and the role of Heart Teams, the European document incorporates substantial new trial evidence. Key areas of divergence include thresholds for earlier intervention in aortic stenosis and regurgitation, expanded recommendations for transcatheter edge-to-edge repair and mitral replacement, formal integration of tricuspid repair and transcatheter therapies, evolving strategies for coronary assessment in transcatheter aortic valve implantation, and sex-specific considerations. This review highlights consistencies, discrepancies, and priorities for future research."

However, data on outcomes of severe MR caused by MAC are limited. This study evaluated outcomes of severe MR due to MAC and the prognostic significance of frailty and comorbidities in guiding management.
In this single-center, retrospective cohort study, we reviewed our echocardiographic database to identify patients with isolated severe MR due to severe MAC. The primary endpoint was all-cause mortality. The Society of Thoracic Surgeons (STS) risk score, Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI), and a 3-point frailty index (hemoglobin, albumin, inactivity) were calculated. Echocardiographic parameters were recorded.
Between January 2010 and August 2023, out of 10,061 patients with severe MAC on echocardiography, 128 patients with severe MR due to severe MAC were identified, and followed for a median of 134 days (IQR: 33-1812). Median age was 81 years; 72.7% were female. Forty-five patients (35.2%) underwent mitral valve (MV) intervention, and 83 (64.8%) received conservative management. During follow-up, 63 patients (49.2%) died. MV intervention improved survival, even after propensity score matching (p < 0.001). Higher frailty scores predicted poorer outcomes in the entire cohort (p = 0.004) and the conservative subgroup (p = 0.014) but not the surgical group (p = 0.406). CCI did not influence mortality when stratified by treatment.
Patients with severe MR due to MAC were frail with multiple comorbidities and often managed conservatively. Frailty is associated with all-cause mortality, and MV intervention improves survival regardless of frailty status."

Cardiovascular interventions,"The interplay between atrial fibrillation (AF) and tricuspid regurgitation (TR) has been recognized. However, it is not simple and has not been fully investigated.
The aim of this study was to examine the association among AF, TR, and outcomes in patients undergoing mitral valve transcatheter edge-to-edge repair (M-TEER).
Patients were divided into 4 groups according to the presence of AF and postprocedural significant TR (moderate or greater): no AF and no TR, no AF with significant TR, AF and no TR, and AF with significant TR. The primary outcome was cardiovascular death or heart failure (HF) hospitalization. Right heart structure and function were also evaluated according to AF and TR status.
The numbers of patients in each group were 1,184 (no AF and no TR), 229 (no AF with significant TR), 1,423 (AF and no TR), and 830 (AF with significant TR). AF was associated with a higher prevalence of significant TR at baseline and more frequent TR progression and less common improvement during follow-up. Both AF and TR appeared to be independently associated with right-ventricular remodeling and dysfunction, with distinct patterns observed according to MR and TR pathologies. TR grade moderate or greater after M-TEER was associated with a higher adjusted risk for cardiovascular death or HF hospitalization, especially in patients with AF (Pinteraction = 0.02).
Patients with AF, compared with those without AF, experienced greater incidence and progression and less common improvement of TR after M-TEER. In addition, both AF and TR appeared to be independently associated with worse right ventricular status and an increased risk for HF outcomes."

Immunoadsorption (IA), which removes pathogenic autoantibodies, has been proposed as a potential adjunctive therapy, but its clinical use remains limited. This case illustrates the potential benefits of IA in advanced, treatment-refractory DCM.
A 53-year-old woman with a 9-year history of DCM presented with recurrent chest tightness and dyspnea. Despite long-term guideline-directed medical therapy, her symptoms progressively worsened.
The patient had chronic DCM initially diagnosed in the peripartum period, with a left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) of 11% at onset. Before IA, echocardiography demonstrated severe systolic dysfunction (LVEF 22%-24%) with significant mitral regurgitation, and laboratory evaluation showed markedly elevated pro-BNP (4454 pg/mL).
The patient underwent two sessions of immunoadsorption in September 2024, followed by high-dose intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) as per standard protocols.
Following treatment, her symptoms improved, pro-BNP decreased to 2109 pg/mL, and repeat echocardiography showed an increase in LVEF to 29.2%.
This case suggests that immunoadsorption may offer clinical benefit in patients with advanced, refractory DCM. While promising, IA remains experimental and requires further investigation in larger, controlled studies."

The contribution of MRAS variants to NS pathogenesis remains poorly characterized, and infective endocarditis (IE) is extremely rare in patients with NS.
A 22-year-old woman presented with typical dysmorphic features of NS, including short stature, broad forehead, hypertelorism, low-set posteriorly rotated ears, and a broad neck. She developed fever and progressive exertional dyspnea.
Echocardiography demonstrated obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy with vegetation located in the left ventricular outflow tract. Blood cultures grew Streptococcus mutans. Whole-exome sequencing identified a heterozygous MRAS c.203C>T (p.Thr68Ile) mutation affecting a highly conserved residue among RASopathy-associated GTPases, supporting the diagnosis of MRAS-associated Noonan syndrome complicated by infective endocarditis.
Antibiotic therapy was escalated to intravenous gentamicin (60 mg daily) combined with ceftriaxone in accordance with the 2023 European Society of Cardiology guidelines for infective endocarditis.
After one month of intravenous gentamicin and ceftriaxone therapy, fever resolved, and follow-up echocardiography showed disappearance of the vegetation. Residual cardiac abnormalities persisted, including marked left ventricular hypertrophy with left ventricular outflow tract obstruction, left atrial enlargement, moderate mitral regurgitation, patent foramen ovale with minor shunting, and impaired diastolic function. Exertional dyspnea remained despite resolution of the infection.
This case expands the genotypic spectrum of Noonan syndrome by supporting MRAS mutations as pathogenic drivers. It also identifies infective endocarditis as a previously unreported complication in MRAS-associated NS with outflow tract obstruction, highlighting the importance of careful cardiac surveillance in patients with RASopathies."

Notably, to the best of our knowledge and following a systematic literature search conducted by our research team, no cases of NF1 complicated by severe cardiac structural abnormalities that ultimately lead to cerebral infarction have been reported to date. Thus, it is of paramount importance to avoid missed diagnosis by performing comprehensive cardiac-related examinations in patients with NF1. Case Presentation: A 20-year-old male patient diagnosed with NF1 presented with right-sided limb weakness and was initially identified with cerebral infarction. To clarify the underlying etiology, a comprehensive clinical evaluation was performed, including cardiac imaging assessments (to characterize cardiac structural changes) and whole-exome sequencing (to identify the presence of procoagulant gene mutations). Comprehensive evaluation revealed a spectrum of cardiac structural abnormalities in the patient: aortic valve prolapse with severe regurgitation, non-infective vegetations on the aortic valve leaflets, mild-to-moderate mitral regurgitation, left ventricular hypertrophy and dilation, and left atrial dilation. Whole-exome sequencing detected exclusively a pathogenic variant in the NF1 gene, with no other pathogenic/likely pathogenic variants or thrombophilia-associated polymorphisms being found. Laboratory investigations ruled out infectious etiologies, supporting the notion that NF1-mediated cardiac structural and developmental anomalies are the primary driver of cardiac vegetation formation, given the absence of other identified contributing factors; embolization of one such vegetation ultimately led to both splenic and cerebral infarction. Conclusions: This case emphasizes the necessity of implementing early and proactive cardiac evaluations in patients with NF1. Additionally, for NF1 individuals-particularly those presenting with suggestive vascular or cardiac symptoms-a comprehensive multifactorial assessment of thrombotic risk is critical. Collectively, maintaining clinical vigilance for cardiac abnormalities in NF1 patients and avoiding diagnostic oversight is essential to reduce life-threatening risks."

The physical examination skills of clinicians are insufficient for accurate diagnosis, making complementary tests generally necessary. Despite being commonly requested, electrocardiography and chest radiography present low positive and negative likelihood ratios. Incipient studies involving artificial intelligence have shown promising opportunities to support the diagnosis. In addition, solid current evidence demonstrates that point-of-care ultrasound enhances bedside diagnosis of several cardiovascular conditions. Echocardiographic skills can be acquired after only a few hours of training, which encourages routine bedside use with handling equipment. Despite the routine use of sonography in emergencies, large-scale simplified screening protocols for valvular disease remain lacking. Therefore, improving the accuracy of valvular heart disease diagnosis by integrating all bedside modalities needs to be better understood. We propose a simple, reproducible five-step point-of-care ultrasound protocol for diagnosing valvular heart disease (the ValvUS approach), applicable to all patients. The proposed visual assessment involves evaluating valvular movement, thickness, regurgitant flow, aliasing, and chamber dimensions. This evaluation should be interpreted in the context of traditional clinical probability to ensure the most accurate bedside diagnosis. Typical findings of severe valvular disease on electrocardiography and chest radiography, and particularly on point-of-care ultrasound, may improve the accuracy of bedside diagnosis after clinical assessment in the near future."

Therefore, this research aimed to study the connection of LDL-C levels with the incidence of adverse clinical outcomes in patients undergoing CVS.
1,304 patients undergoing first-time CVS were identified from the MIMIC-IV database. Participants were split into two groups based on admission LDL-C levels: a low LDL-C group (< 1.4 mmol/L, n = 215) as well as a high LDL-C one (≥ 1.4 mmol/L, n = 1,089). The main endpoint was 30-day all-cause mortality (ACM), with secondary endpoints including in-hospital, 90-, 180- and 365-day ACM rates. The connection between preoperative LDL-C levels and clinical outcomes was evaluated via survival analysis, mediation analysis, and subgroup analyses.
Multivariable Cox regression analysis demonstrated preoperative LDL-C level served as an independent protective factor against 30-day ACM following cardiac valve surgery (adjusted HR: 0.594; 95% CI: 0.368-0.960). In stratified analysis, patients in the higher LDL-C tertile exhibited a remarkably lower mortality risk (HR: 0.285; 95% CI: 0.134-0.604). Consistent subgroup analyses validated these findings' robustness across all clinically relevant subgroups. Notably, mediation analysis provided mechanistic evidence that the mortality-increasing effect of lower LDL-C levels may be partially mediated through activation of systemic inflammation.
Lower preoperative LDL-C levels are independently related with higher 30-day mortality following cardiac valve surgery, potentially mediated by the activation of inflammatory pathways."

Cardiovascular interventions,"Small multicenter studies have shown that transcatheter pulmonary valve replacement (TPVR) can be performed with good procedural and early hemodynamic results in patients weighing <30 kg; little is known about longer term outcomes.
The aim of this study was to characterize long-term outcomes after Melody valve placement in patients weighing ≤30 kg.
Selected centers participating in prior registry studies provided updated outcome data.
Between April 2009 and April 2019, 199 patients weighing ≤30kg underwent successful Melody valve placement across 10 centers. During a median follow-up period of nearly 8 years, 78 patients underwent initial reintervention with balloon dilation (n = 20), transcatheter valve-in-valve (n = 30), or explantation (n = 28). Among patients who had not undergone reintervention, 81% of those with available echocardiograms had good valve function. Thirty-two patients developed endocarditis, 20 with predisposing factors; 9 were managed medically. Estimated freedom from pulmonary valve reintervention at 10 years was 46% (95% CI: 36%-55%). On age- and weight-adjusted multivariable Cox regression, right ventricular systolic pressure immediately after implantation (HR: 1.03; 95% CI: 1.00-1.05; P = 0.026) was associated with freedom from reintervention. Freedom from Melody valve explantation at 10 years was 78% (95% CI: 69%-85%), and freedom from endocarditis was 79% (95% CI: 71%-86%). These outcomes did not vary significantly according to weight, delivery system, or era of implantation.
In this large multicenter study, longer term survival and freedom from reintervention or explantation after TPVR were similar to previously reported data for small patients with a surgical pulmonary conduit or bioprosthetic valve. These findings support the utility of TPVR with a Melody valve for delaying surgical valve replacement in small patients."

Case reports,"The incidence of patients with cirrhosis and concurrent valvular heart disease is increasing. Moderate to severe tricuspid regurgitation (TR) is associated with increased mortality after liver transplantation (LT). Open cardiac surgery is recommended for patients with symptomatic severe TR, however LT candidates often face prohibitive surgical risk.
A 45-year-old woman with advanced cirrhosis awaiting LT was diagnosed with severe functional TR due to anatomical tricuspid valve incompetence (TVI). The tricuspid valve anatomy was unsuitable for transcatheter tricuspid edge-to-edge repair, a technique previously described in cirrhotic patients before LT. The patient underwent a transcatheter tricuspid valve replacement (TTVR) followed by LT.
LT recipients with TR secondary to anatomical TVI have significantly lower 1-year survival. Minimally invasive valve interventions are promising alternatives for patients who are not cardiac surgical candidates, such as LT recipients with advanced cirrhosis.
Transcatheter tricuspid valve replacement may facilitate LT in high-risk candidates with severe TR due to TVI."

Epicardial cysts attached to the cardiac surface with intimate coronary artery involvement are even rarer and pose significant diagnostic and surgical challenges. This case highlights a giant pericardial cyst with intimate right coronary artery involvement in a 10-month-old infant, where subtotal resection was necessary to preserve coronary integrity. A 10-month-old male infant with a pericardial cyst initially detected at 27 weeks of gestation presented with progressive compression of right heart chambers. Imaging revealed a large multiloculated cystic mass (5.3 × 3.5 × 3.9 cm) compressing the right atrium and right ventricle, with associated pulmonary valve stenosis. Intraoperatively, the cyst was found on the epicardial surface with intimate involvement of the right coronary artery. Complete excision was not feasible due to the risk of coronary injury. The main cystic mass was excised with cavity obliteration, while the portion adjacent to the right coronary artery was intentionally preserved. Concurrent pulmonary valve commissurotomy and pulmonary artery augmentation were performed. Histopathology confirmed a mesothelial-lined pericardial cyst. The patient recovered uneventfully and was discharged. This case underscores the importance of comprehensive preoperative coronary artery assessment in pericardial cysts with atypical locations. When complete excision risks vital structure injury, subtotal resection with cavity obliteration represents a safe alternative strategy."

While epidemiologically established, the underlying mechanisms remain unclear, precluding identification of therapeutic targets.
Two-month-old Yucatan pigs (males and females) underwent aortic banding to induce LV pressure overload or no operation. After 4 months, animals received a low-risk cumulative dose of doxorubicin (5 weekly 1 mg/kg intravenous injections) or vehicle, generating four groups: (i) healthy controls (no LV overload, no doxorubicin), (ii) Dox (doxorubicin, no LV overload), (iii) Banding (B: LV overload, no doxorubicin), and (iv) B + Dox (LV overload plus doxorubicin). Cardiac function, structure, and metabolism were assessed over 8 months by cardiac magnetic resonance, magnetic resonance spectroscopy, and hybrid positron emission tomography/computed tomography. At study end, proteomics and mitochondrial structure and function were analysed. Complementary in vivo and ex vivo studies examined the mechanistic role of energetic imbalance.
LV overload increased LV mass (P < .0001) and ejection fraction (P = .0081), with compensatory metabolic changes (drop in phosphocreatine (P = .022)). Low-risk Dox alone altered myocardial metabolism (increased glucose uptake, P = .014) but preserved cardiac function. In pigs with pre-existing LV pressure overload, doxorubicin increased mortality (P < .0001 vs all other groups), reduced left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) (P < .0001), increased fibrosis, and impaired mitochondrial respiration (P = .032). In HL-1 cardiomyocytes, reducing energy demand with mavacamten rescued cell viability under combined doxorubicin and hypertrophic stress.
LV pressure overload increases myocardial susceptibility to anthracycline cardiotoxicity by inducing a high-energy-demand state. Anthracycline treatment, even at a low-risk dose, disrupts compensatory mechanisms in the pressure-overloaded heart, rapidly leading to cardiac dysfunction and heart failure. Preventive strategies targeting this metabolic vulnerability are urgently needed for patients with extant LV pressure overload (e.g. hypertension or valvular heart disease) who are undergoing anthracycline therapy."

Eighty patients diagnosed with CTEPH between October 2022 and October 2024 were included in this study. These patients were divided into three groups based on the quantitative grading method for TR: mild TR (29 cases), moderate TR (30 cases), and severe TR (21 cases). Meanwhile, 24 healthy individuals who underwent physical examinations and were matched with the case group in terms of age and gender were selected as the control group. Clinical data, echocardiographic parameters, and other relevant information of all study subjects were collected. The above data were subjected to statistical analysis to explore the effects of various factors, including TR, on the reservoir function, conduit function, and booster pump function of the right atrium.
Univariate linear regression analysis showed that the related variables, including heart rate, WHO functional class, main pulmonary artery diameter, pulmonary artery systolic pressure (PASP), right ventricular basal diameter, right ventricular anterior wall thickness, right ventricular global function (RVGF), tricuspid annular diameter (TAD), tricuspid valve coaptation length (TVCL), and TR, exhibited a linear relationship with right atrial total ejection fraction (TotEF) and passive ejection fraction (PassEF), but no linear relationship with right atrial active ejection fraction (ActEF). Multivariate stepwise linear regression analysis revealed that PASP, RVGF, and TR severity were the main factors affecting right atrial TotEF and PassEF. Specifically, right atrial TotEF and PassEF gradually decreased with the increase in PASP, the decline in RVGF, and the aggravation of TR severity.
In patients with CTEPH, the reservoir function and conduit function of the right atrium gradually decrease with the aggravation of TR, the impairment of RVGF, and the elevation of PASP."

One numerical model of the AAo with BAV (specifically, a left/right cusp fusion type) and a giant aneurysm was constructed using MRI medical images. The aneurysm had a diameter of 10.5 cm. Subsequently, hemodynamics in this model were simulated numerically, and flow patterns and loading distributions were investigated. To understand these characteristics, we applied the CFD method to simulate the hemodynamics and estimate the risk associated with the fully dilated aorta.
The presence of a giant aneurysm significantly influenced and altered hemodynamics within the AAo in this BAV patient case. In our model of a 10.5 cm aneurysm, the BAV-induced eccentric jet impinged on the aortic wall, generating complex, recirculating flow patterns and elevated turbulent kinetic energy within the aneurysmal sac. Hemodynamic parameters were asymmetrically distributed at the aneurysm, and the wall shear stress (WSS) in this aneurysm was pathologically low. These conditions suggest the risk of asymmetric dilation and aortic dissection, and thereafter, the risk of aneurysm rupture was further heightened, especially when the aneurysm reached 10.5 cm in size.
The CFD-based analysis method helped elucidate the biomechanical mechanisms that a BAV may contribute to the development of a giant aneurysm in the AAo, offering valuable insights for treatment strategies in patients with giant aneurysms."

Standard echocardiographic parameters, including EF, FS, chamber dimensions, and valvular assessment, did not reveal abnormalities in the PASC group. The deep learning model achieved an accuracy of 96.6%, sensitivity of 96.7%, specificity of 96.2%, and balanced accuracy of 96.4%. AI-assisted echocardiographic analysis demonstrated high performance in distinguishing cardiac function between PASC and controls. Deep learning models enhance the detection of subtle cardiac changes in children with PASC. Although the deep learning model demonstrated high performance in distinguishing PASC from controls, the clinical significance of these subtle image-based differences remains uncertain and requires further evaluation in large-scale studies with long-term follow-up."

However, the high resolution of remotely sensed images, the complexity of the background, the uneven distribution of objects, and the uneven number of objects among them lead to unsatisfactory detection results of existing detectors. Facing these challenges, we propose YOFOR (You Only Focus on Object Regions), an adaptive local sensing enhancement network. It contains three components: adaptive local sensing module, fuzzy enhancement module and class balance module. Among them, adaptive local sensing module can adaptively localize dense object regions and dynamically crop dense object regions on view, which effectively solves problem of uneven distribution of objects. Fuzzy enhancement module further enhances object region by weakening the background interference, thus improving detection performance. Class balancing module, which analyzes dataset to obtain distribution of long-tailed classes, takes into account direction of tailed classes and distance around object, and operates on tailed classes within a certain range to alleviate long-tailed class problem and further improve detection performance. All three components are unsupervised and can be easily inserted into existing networks. Extensive experiments on the VisDrone, DOTA, and AI-TOD datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and adaptability of the method."

However, this usually requires extracting the phase shift from intensity measurement at a single propagation distance through phase retrieval-an underdetermined nonlinear inverse problem. Conventional single-distance phase retrieval methods usually rely on multiple approximation conditions. Deep learning (DL)-based phase retrieval methods often rely on high-quality data for training or lengthy physics model iterative computations to optimize network parameters. In order to surmount the aforementioned limitations, this study proposes a physics-inspired phase retrieval network for propagation-based X-ray phase-contrast imaging (PIPN) and an acceleration strategy for the PIPN. It can achieve phase retrieval based solely on a single approximation condition and a physics imaging model, without the need for any training data. Experiments demonstrate that the PIPN can quickly reconstruct high-quality retrieved phase projections by using the acceleration strategy, and remain stable under different propagation distances."

Metalenses, composed of flat, subwavelength nanostructures, are well suited to this demand due to their ultra-thin profile and design flexibility. However, miniaturized metalenses typically require larger numerical apertures (NA), which lead to strong chromatic dispersion and resolution degradation. To address this limitation, we propose a Metalens Depth-of-Field Generative Adversarial Network tailored for restoring full-color images captured by a high-NA (0.447) millimeter-scale metalens. It achieves a 35% increase in peak signal-to-noise ratio and a 57.7% reduction in perceptual loss, while maintaining reconstruction quality across over 17.5 cm depth of field without additional training. This network provides a practical and scalable solution for enhancing image quality in miniaturized imaging systems."

The average relative prediction error is <9% for each gas and largely remains below or near 10%."
PubMed,deep learning,Mild Cognitive Impairment Detection System Based on Unstructured Spontaneous Speech: Longitudinal Dual-Modal Framework.,Yu-Shan Liao; Thiri Wai; Ting-Yun Liao; Ho-Ling Chang; Yu-Ling Chang; Li-Chen Fu,10.2196/80883,2026-01-15,JMIR medical informatics,"In recent years, the incidence of cognitive diseases has also risen with the significant increase in population aging. Among these diseases, Alzheimer disease constitutes a substantial proportion, placing a high-cost burden on health care systems. To give early treatment and slow the progression of patient deterioration, it is crucial to diagnose mild cognitive impairment (MCI), a transitional stage.
In this study, we use autobiographical memory (AM) test speech data to establish a dual-modal longitudinal cognitive detection system for MCI. The AM test is a psychological assessment method that evaluates the cognitive status of subjects as they freely narrate important life experiences.
Identifying hidden disease-related information in unstructured, spontaneous speech is more difficult than in structured speech. To improve this process, we use both speech and text data, which provide more clues about a person's cognitive state. In addition, to track how cognition changes over time in spontaneous speech, we introduce an aging trajectory module. This module uses local and global alignment loss functions to better learn time-related features by aligning cognitive changes across different time points.
In our experiments on the Chinese dataset, the longitudinal model incorporating the aging trajectory module achieved area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.85 and 0.89 on 2 datasets, respectively, showing significant improvement over cross-sectional, single time point models. We also conducted ablation studies to verify the necessity of the proposed aging trajectory module. To confirm that the model not only applies to AM test data, we used part of the model to evaluate the performance on the ADReSSo dataset, a single time point semistructured data for validation, with results showing an accuracy exceeding 0.88.
This study presents a noninvasive and scalable approach for early MCI detection by leveraging AM speech data across multiple time points. Through dual-modal analysis and the introduction of an aging trajectory module, our system effectively captures cognitive decline trends over time. Experimental results demonstrate the method's robustness and generalizability, highlighting its potential for real-world, long-term cognitive monitoring."

DPM achieves superior alignment and prediction accuracy, outperforming conventional feature similarity-based methods such as those using Euclidean or kernel-based metrics both with and without spatial distance weighting. We further demonstrated that the DPM framework can effectively enhance MSI resolution, providing a powerful tool for cost-effective and high-precision spatial metabolomics research. This approach also shows promising potential for extension to spatial transcriptomics.

Seventy-five anonymized periapical radiographs of anterior teeth from the maxilla and mandible were analyzed, evenly distributed between cases with and without lesions. A calibrated endodontic specialist provided the reference diagnosis. Each image was independently assessed five times by both LLMs using the prompt: ""Does this image show a periapical lesion? Answer 'Yes' or 'No'. If 'Yes', which tooth?"". Balanced accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and F1-score were calculated with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) obtained via bootstrap resampling. Performance was also stratified by diagnostic difficulty, and the models were compared using the exact McNemar test (α = 0.05). ChatGPT 5.0 showed higher overall performance than Gemini Flash 2.0, with sensitivity of 0.97 (95% CI: 0.95-0.99), specificity of 0.11 (95% CI: 0.07-0.16), and balanced accuracy of 0.54 (95% CI: 0.52-0.57).

We explored a simple and feasible approach: a dorsal approach combined with a dorsoventral method for liver segment S7 resection.
The key innovations we propose through the dorsal approach combined with a dorsoventral method include: 1) systematic dissection of the S7 hepatic pedicle through Rouviere sulcus; 2) parenchymal transection guided by the dorsal ischemic demarcation line of segment S7; 3) advance along the right hepatic vein toward the ventral aspect of segment S7. By decomposing complex maneuvers into three standardized steps (Step 1-3), this protocol significantly reduces technical barriers. The procedural details are meticulously demonstrated in this report to enhance reproducibility.
All patients underwent surgery smoothly, with no conversion to open surgery and no deaths, and all patients achieved R0 resection. The operation time was 190.0 (178.0 - 210.0) min, and intraoperative blood loss was 200.0 (150.0 - 280.0) mL.

While these models perform well in the trained source domain, they struggle in unseen domains with a domain gap. In this paper, we propose a representation learning approach for domain generalization in LiDAR semantic segmentation, termed DGLSS++, which is designed to ensure robust performance in both the source domain and unseen domains despite training exclusively on the source domain. Our approach focuses on generalizing from a single source domain, addressing the domain shift caused by variations in LiDAR sensor configurations and scene distributions. To tackle both sparse-to-dense and dense-to-sparse generalization scenarios, we simulate unseen domains by generating sparsely and densely augmented domains. With the augmented domain, we introduce two constraints for generalizable representation learning: generalized masked sparsity invariant feature consistency (GMSIFC) and localized semantic correlation consistency (LSCC). GMSIFC aligns the internal sparse features of the source domain with those of the augmented domain at different sparsity, introducing a novel masking strategy to exclude voxel features associated with multiple inconsistent classes. For LSCC, class prototypes from spatially local regions are constrained to maintain similar correlations across all local regions, regardless of the scene or domain. In addition, we establish standardized training and evaluation protocols utilizing four real-world datasets and implement several baseline methods. Extensive experiments demonstrate our approach outperforms both UDA and DG baselines. The code is available at https://github.com/gzgzys9887/DGLSS."

In complex scenarios, traditional methods degrade and deep learning methods lack flexibility and generalization. Here, we propose a physics-informed deep neural network (PIDNN) framework that effectively addresses both aspects, adapting to complex and variable sensing environments by embedding imaging physics into the deep neural network for unsupervised learning. Within this framework, by tailoring the number of U-Net skip connections, we impose multi-scale spatiotemporal priors that improve photon-utilization efficiency, laying the foundation for addressing the inherent low-signal-to-background ratio (SBR) problem in subsequent complex scenarios. Additionally, we introduce volume rendering into the PIDNN framework and design a dual-branch structure, further extending its applicability to multiple-depth and fog occlusion. We validated the performance of this method in various complex environments through numerical simulations and real-world experiments. The results of photon-efficient imaging with multiple returns show robust performance under low SBR and large fields of view. The method attains lower root mean-squared error than traditional methods and exhibits stronger generalization than supervised approaches. Further multiple depths and fog interference experiments confirm that its reconstruction quality surpasses existing techniques, demonstrating its flexibility and scalability. Both simulation and experimental results validate its exceptional reconstruction performance and flexibility."

The genetic diversity of the genus Synechococcus has been extensively explored based on the 16S-23S rRNA internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region. However, accurate identification of Synechococcus ITS from large sequencing datasets is challenging owing to the absence of a standardized taxonomy and to ambiguous clade boundaries. To address these limitations, we developed Syn_Tool, a deep-learning-based framework integrating a curated Synechococcus ITS database for sequence identification, classification and novel clade discovery. Analysing 1 087 323 ITS sequences from the coastal water of China-the largest Synechococcus dataset to date-Syn_Tool classified them into 42 clades, including 28 known and 14 newly defined clades. Biogeographical analyses revealed a latitudinal diversity gradient driven by temperature, with 12 newly defined clades (clades CSII-IV, CSVI-XIV) primarily found in estuarine regions where rapid diversification may promote the emergence of novel genotypes. This study demonstrates the application of deep learning in classifying Synechococcus and understanding their ecological roles in dynamic marine ecosystems."

Over the past three decades, significant volumes of CNA data have been generated through molecular-cytogenetic and genome sequencing-based techniques. These data have been pivotal in identifying cancer-related genes and advancing research on the relationship between CNAs and histopathologically defined cancer types. However, comprehensive studies of CNA landscapes and disease parameters are challenging due to the vast diagnostic and genomic heterogeneity encountered in ""pan-cancer"" approaches. In this study, we introduce CNAttention, an attention-based deep multiple instance learning method designed to comprehensively analyze CNAs across different cancers and uncover specific CNA patterns within integrated gene-level CNA profiles of 30 cancer types. CNAttention effectively learns CNA features unique to each cancer type and generates CNA signatures for 30 cancer types using attention mechanisms, highlighting the distinctiveness of their CNA landscapes. CNAttention demonstrates high accuracy and exhibits stable performance even with the incorporation of external datasets or parameter adjustments, underscoring its effectiveness in tumor identification. Expanding these signatures to cancer classification trees reveals common patterns not only among physiologically related cancer types but also among clinico-pathologically distant types, such as different cancers originating from neural crest derived cells. Additionally, detected signatures also uncover genomic heterogeneity in individual cancer types, for instance in brain lower grade glioma. Additional experiments with classification models underscore the efficacy of these signatures in representing various cancer types and their potential utility in clinical diagnosis."

With a focus on the prevalent psychological complications following the onset of this condition, this study aimed to explore the correlation between antenatal depression and Corona disease anxiety, personality traits, and postpartum depression during the COVID-19 pandemic.                                                           Materials and Methods:                     This cross-sectional descriptive-analytical study investigated women receiving care at health centers affiliated with Kerman University of Medical Sciences during the last month of their pregnancy and the postpartum period in 2022. Following the acquisition of informed consent, participants were assessed using various measures, including demographic and obstetric information, the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale, the Corona Disease Anxiety Scale (CDAS), and the NEO Personality Inventory-Revised during their third trimester of pregnancy. The same group of participants completed the Edinburgh Depression Scale and the Corona Disease Anxiety Scale (CDAS) 4-6 weeks after childbirth.                                                           Results and Discussion:                     There was a significant correlation between family income, unwanted pregnancy as perceived by both the mother and father, and antenatal depression. Additionally, marital satisfaction played a significant role in postpartum depression. Furthermore, antenatal depression was significantly associated with neuroticism, agreeableness, and physical symptoms related to Corona disease anxiety. Personality traits, with the exception of extroversion and conscientiousness, and various domains of Corona disease anxiety, excluding psychological symptoms, were also significantly associated with postpartum depression.                                                           Conclusion:                     During pandemics or epidemics, such as the COVID-19 outbreak, experiencing mental distress during pregnancy can contribute to mental health issues during the postpartum period. This risk is particularly true in individuals with unique personality traits, emphasizing the need for increased focus on mental health within prenatal care during these crises."

Method:                     This cross-sectional study was conducted in Kerman, Iran. Data were collected from patients who visited Afzalipour Hospital in Kerman more than twice during the COVID-19 epidemic from the end of February 2020 to March 21, 2021. We conducted two key analyses: 1. Mixed effect logistic regression was used to check the relationship between the variables and COVID-19 severity. 2. Mixed effect linear regression was used to check the relationship between the variables and the length of stay in the hospital.                                                           Results:                     The findings indicated that the most important risk factors for the severity of COVID-19 were heart diseases (OR=1.67,95%CI:1.20-2.30), increasing age (OR=2.23 for age&gt;54, 95%CI:1.70- 2.90), male gender (OR=1.47,95%CI:1.10-1.96), respiratory diseases other than asthma, and frequency of admission (OR=1.60,95%CI:1.20-2.15). All patients who underwent readmission experienced a shorter duration of hospitalization during their subsequent admission (OR=0.94,95%CI:0.91,0.96) and had a higher mortality rate (30% within 14 days, 26.6% between 14-90 days). Patients readmitted at intervals of 14-90 days and greater than 90 days exhibited lower disease severity compared to those readmitted within the 0-14 day period.                                                           Conclusion:                     Examining readmissions, the severity of COVID-19, and the length of hospital stay in affected patients are important factors for planning and allocating resources for COVID-19 management and treatment. These factors can help policymakers develop effective clinical guidelines for hospitalization or outpatient treatment of COVID-19 patients and contribute to reducing the burden of disease in the community."

Kinovea, as an accessible motion-analysis software, provides both visual and quantitative feedback. However, its application in supporting technique development among beginner athletes remains insufficiently explored. Aim: This study aims to describe the use of Kinovea in biomechanics training and examine its contribution to the awareness of kinematic characteristics and movement techniques among beginner athletes. Methods: A descriptive qualitative design involved 72 beginner athletes aged 18–25 years selected through purposive sampling. Data were collected over 16 weeks through interviews, field observations, and motion video recordings analyzed using Kinovea. Kinematic data focused on joint angles, stride behavior, and movement phases during walking, running, and the flight phase. Qualitative data were analyzed using content analysis with NVivo 12, while kinematic results were interpreted descriptively to identify performance patterns and areas for technical refinement. Result: Kinematic analysis showed coordinated joint-angle patterns across all phases. Walking analysis identified arm swing angles of 50.9°–58.8° and leg separation angles of 64.3°–67.2°, indicating a stable gait rhythm. The running analysis revealed knee angles of 68.8°–69.8° and elbow angles of 87.6°–89.1°, indicating efficient propulsive mechanics. The flight phase demonstrated knee angles of 81.2°–87.8° and elbow angles of 80.4°–88.3°, suggesting effective momentum use and postural stability. These measurements supported stride-efficiency assessment and technique evaluation. Qualitative findings revealed that Kinovea enabled athletes to interpret movement phases and identify technical inefficiencies through slow-motion and frame-by-frame visualization. Conclusion: Kinovea supports basic motion analysis by providing clear kinematic information and helping beginner athletes observe and refine their movement techniques. The findings also offer practical value for coaches by enabling more precise identification of inefficient patterns and guiding targeted corrections during early-stage training."

OpenAlex,mitral regurgitation,Hypertension and Valvular Heart Disease: An Overview of a Complex and Clinically Meaningful Relationship,Roxana Darabont; Diana Mihalcea; Dragos Vinereanu,10.3390/life16010125,2026-01-14,Life,"The overlooked relationship between hypertension (HTN) and valvular heart disease (VHD) has been brought to wider attention by large-scale population studies and the latest guidelines. Approximately 45% of patients with VHD have been diagnosed with HTN. This association increases with age, but cannot be explained solely by the rising prevalence of both conditions. HTN promotes the onset or worsening of VHD by mechanically stressing the valves and by modified blood flow dynamics through increased filling pressures and afterload. It has been shown that a 20 mmHg rise in BP triples the risk of aortic valvular disease and mitral regurgitation. This review will address the impact of HTN on the occurrence and progression of valvular lesions, its effect on the prognosis of patients with VHD, and the available data on blood pressure management. As long as relatively well-documented data on aortic valve disease are available, studies are still needed to clarify target blood pressure values under therapy and the most appropriate drug classes for mitral regurgitation, especially in its primary forms."
OpenAlex,mitral regurgitation,Silent cardiac burden: Echocardiographic abnormalities and their predictors in kidney transplant candidates and their impact on graft function,Nihal Mohammed Sadagah; Muhammad Abdul Mabood Khalil; Hinda Hassan Khideer Mahmood; Ibtisam Ali Alghamdi; Ghada Abdulrahman Buridi; Salem H Al-Qurashi,10.5500/wjt.v16.i1.110628,2026-01-14,World Journal of Transplantation,"BACKGROUND An echocardiogram is an essential tool in the evaluation of potential kidney transplant recipients (KTRs). Despite cardiac clearance, potential KTRs still have structural and functional abnormalities. Identifying the prevalence of these abnormalities and understanding their predictors is vital for optimizing pre-transplant risk stratification and improving post-transplant outcomes. AIM To determine the prevalence of left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH), left ventricular systolic dysfunction (LVSD), diastolic dysfunction (DD), pulmonary hypertension (PH), and their predictors, and to assess their impact on graft function in pre-transplant candidates. METHODS The study included all successful transplant candidates older than 14 who had a baseline echocardiogram. Binary logistic regression models were constructed to identify factors associated with LVH, LVSD, DD, and PH. RESULTS Out of 259 patients, LVH was present in 64% (166), 12% (31) had LVSD, 27.5% (71) had DD, and 66 (25.5%) had PH. Independent predictors of LVH included male gender [odds ratio (OR): 2.51; 95%CI: 1.17–5.41 P = 0.02], PH (OR = 2.07; 95%CI: 1.11–3.86; P = 0.02), DD (OR: 2.47; 95%CI: 1.29–4.73; P = 0.006), and dyslipidemia (OR = 1.94; 95%CI: 1.07–3.53; P = 0.03). Predictors for LVSD included patients with DD (OR = 3.3, 95% CI: 1.41–7.81; P = 0.006) and a family history of coronary artery disease (OR = 4.50, 95%CI: 1.33–15.20; P = 0.015). Peritoneal dialysis was an independent predictor for DD (OR = 10.03; 95%CI: 1.71-58.94, P = 0.011). The presence of LVH (OR = 3.32, 95%CI: 1.05–10.55, P = 0.04) and mild to moderate or moderate to severe mitral regurgitation (OR = 4.63, 95%CI: 1.45–14.78, P = 0.01) were significant factors associated with PH. These abnormalities had no significant impact on estimated glomerular filtration at discharge, 6 months, 1 year, or 2 years post-transplant. CONCLUSION Significant echocardiographic abnormalities persist in a potential transplant candidate despite cardiac clearance, although they don’t affect future graft function. Understanding the risk factors associated with these abnormalities may help clinicians address these factors pre- and post-transplant to achieve better outcomes."
OpenAlex,mitral regurgitation,Leaflet Lengths and Commissural Dimensions as the Primary Determinants of Orifice Area in Mitral Regurgitation: A Sobol Sensitivity Analysis,Ashkan Bagherzadeh; Vahid Keshavarzzadeh; Patrick Hoang; Steve Kreuzer; Jiang Yao; Lik Chuan Lee; Ghassan S. Kassab; Julius Guccione,10.3390/bioengineering13010097,2026-01-14,Bioengineering,"Mitral valve orifice area is a key functional metric that depends on complex geometric features, motivating a systematic assessment of the relative influence of these parameters. In this study, the mitral valve geometry is parameterized using twelve geometric variables, and a global sensitivity analysis based on Sobol indices is performed to quantify their relative importance. Because global sensitivity analysis requires many simulations, a Gaussian Process regressor is developed to efficiently predict the orifice area from the geometric inputs. Structural simulations of the mitral valve are carried out in Abaqus, focusing exclusively on the valve mechanics. The predicted distribution of orifice areas obtained from the Gaussian Process shows strong agreement with the ground-truth simulation results, and similar agreement is observed when only the most influential geometric parameters are varied. The analysis identifies a subset of geometric parameters that dominantly govern the mitral valve orifice area and can be reliably extracted from medical imaging modalities such as echocardiography. These findings establish a direct link between echocardiographic measurements and physics-based simulations and provide a framework for patient-specific assessment of mitral valve mechanics, with potential applications in guiding interventional strategies such as MitraClip placement."

This report focuses on challenges encountered with pericardiocentesis, the role of hemodynamic support, and the importance of invasive blood pressure monitoring. Case summary An 11-year-old, weighing 2.9 kg, male Chihuahua was scheduled for mitral valve plasty due to severe MR. The dog developed acute collapse and dyspnea and was diagnosed with LAR and pulmonary edema; pericardiocentesis was withheld due to relatively stable hemodynamics. Despite inotropic support and diuretics administration, a second LAR occurred the following day during transport for echocardiographic examination, with a large intrapericardial clot preventing pericardiocentesis and causing shock. Although fluid therapy and ephedrine administration improved blood pressure, invasive blood pressure monitoring and strict rest were subsequently employed to maintain a lower systolic pressure, enabling safe anesthetic induction. Under cardiopulmonary bypass, clot removal was performed. Intraoperatively, due to inadequate venous return, the heart enlarged and a third LAR occurred, necessitating repair of the rupture site with a pericardial patch under cardioplegic arrest alongside chordae tendineae reconstruction. Postoperatively, the dog developed dyspnea potentially related to lung injury, transfusion effects, or residual pulmonary edema, which resolved with medical management. Marked thrombocytopenia emerged soon after switching antibiotics but improved rapidly following corticosteroid administration and discontinuation of the suspected antibiotic. The dog was discharged in good condition and remained clinically stable 1 year later. Conclusion This case provides a detailed account for the stepwise medical and anesthetic management of recurrent LAR secondary to severe MR. During conservative treatment, pericardiocentesis was not always effective, particularly in the presence of intrapericardial clots, which might have interfered with drainage. In the setting of cardiac tamponade, increasing pre- and after-load along with positive inotropic support appeared to contribute to temporary hemodynamic stabilization. Invasive arterial pressure monitoring allowed for stable hemodynamic control and safe anesthetic induction, underscoring its importance for preoperative management. Furthermore, the third intraoperative rupture was successfully repaired using a pericardial patch, which achieved effective hemostasis and demonstrated its potential value as a surgical option for LAR repair."

Adult presentations are uncommon and often underdiagnosed. Case Description: A 35-year-old male presented with exertional dyspnea. ETT demonstrated severe mitral stenosis, reduced ejection fraction, bicuspid aortic valve, and pulmonary hypertension. Intraoperative findings confirmed true PMV. Due to anatomical complexity, a 27-mm mechanical prosthesis replacement was performed successfully, with rapid postoperative recovery. Conclusion: Adult PMV requires high clinical suspicion and often surgical confirmation. Valve replacement is effective in complex cases, emphasizing the importance of early diagnosis and intervention."

Artificial intelligence (AI) may enable rapid, point-of-care cardiac assessment using simplified imaging protocols. Objectives To evaluate whether a deep learning model can accurately detect significant valvular and ventricular dysfunction using only a single two-dimensional apical four-chamber echocardiographic view, including images acquired by non-cardiologists with handheld ultrasound devices. Methods We retrospectively analyzed 120,127 echocardiographic studies from a tertiary medical center to train and validate a deep learning model for identifying moderate-or-greater mitral or tricuspid regurgitation, right ventricular dysfunction, and reduced left ventricular ejection fraction (≤40%). A prospective cohort of 209 patients underwent handheld point-of-care cardiac ultrasound performed by non-cardiologist physicians, with same-hospitalization comprehensive echocardiography as the reference standard. Results In retrospective testing, model areas under the curve (AUCs) were 0.883 for mitral regurgitation, 0.913 for tricuspid regurgitation, 0.940 for right ventricular dysfunction, and 0.982 for reduced ejection fraction. In the prospective cohort, AUCs were 0.72, 0.87, 0.95, and 0.97 for the same respective targets. Conclusions A single-view deep learning model demonstrated strong diagnostic accuracy for detecting significant valvular and ventricular dysfunction across both standard and handheld ultrasound acquisitions. This approach may facilitate rapid, scalable cardiac function screening by non-cardiologists in diverse clinical environments. Clinical Trial Registration identifier NCT05455541."
OpenAlex,mitral regurgitation,Changes in echocardiographic parameters and strain and outcomes following mitral valve repair: insight from new mitral regurgitation classifications,Roslan Aslannif; Si Ling Soh; Yee Sin Tey; Am Haris Norhaliza; Teo Jassie; Lynne Murray Rowina; Kee Soon Chong; Kian Boon Wong; Dillon Jeswant; Mazeni Alwi; Mohd Ghazi Azmee,10.3389/fcvm.2025.1666071,2026-01-12,Frontiers in Cardiovascular Medicine,"Introduction Mitral valve repair is a cornerstone treatment for mitral regurgitation (MR), but outcomes across various etiologies remain incompletely understood. Therefore, this study aimed to comprehensively assess the outcomes of mitral valve repair across different MR etiologies, including primary MR, left ventricle functional MR (LVFMR), ischemic MR, left atrial functional MR (LAFMR), and rheumatic MR, by examining in-hospital, short-term, and medium-term outcomes, as well as the change in cardiac function through echocardiographic parameters and strain analysis. Methods This retrospective study included 911 patients who underwent mitral valve repair at a single center from 2015 to 2021. Echocardiographic and strain analyses were performed preoperatively and at 6 months post-surgery. Mortality outcomes were assessed at in-hospital and at 6, 12, and 51 months postoperatively. Results There were significant differences in outcomes across MR etiologies. The primary and rheumatic groups demonstrated the lowest mortality rates, whereas the LVFMR, LAFMR, and ischemic groups exhibited markedly higher mortality, both in the early postoperative period and during long-term follow-up. Echocardiographic analysis showed improvements in cardiac dimensions and volumes, but concurrent declines in myocardial function, particularly in ejection fraction, global longitudinal strain, and left atrial reservoir strain. Discussion This study highlights the importance of etiology-specific risk stratification. While mitral valve repair effectively reduces MR, myocardial recovery may be delayed or insufficient in certain subgroups, especially those with pre-existing myocardial dysfunction. Tailored therapeutic strategies that address the multifactorial nature of functional and ischemic MR are warranted to improve long-term outcomes."

However, the long-term clinical impact of MR persistence or progression has not been well stratified. We aimed to evaluate the proportion, clinical benefits, and prognostic value of maintaining mild MR one year after M-TEER. Methods and Results This multicenter registry-based analysis included 1,865 patients who achieved mild MR at discharge following M-TEER. At one year, patients were classified as having stable MR (≤ mild) or worsening MR (≥ moderate). The frequency of left atrial (LA) and left ventricular (LV) reverse remodeling and tricuspid regurgitation (TR) improvement were assessed from baseline to one year. Clinical endpoints—including all-cause mortality and heart failure hospitalization—were evaluated beyond one year after M-TEER up to two years. Worsening MR occurred in 28.4% of patients. Compared with the worsening MR group, the stable MR group demonstrated significantly more frequent LA and LV reverse remodeling (38.4% vs. 28.1%, and 44.7% vs. 31.1%, respectively; both p&amp;lt;0.001). Improvement in TR (≥ grade 1) was also more prevalent in the stable MR group (32.4% vs. 20.6%, p&amp;lt;0.001). Worsening MR was independently associated with increased risk of adverse clinical outcomes (hazard ratio: 2.02; 95% confidence interval: 1.26–3.23; p=0.003). Conclusions Maintaining MR within mild at one-year post-M-TEER is associated with favorable cardiac reverse remodeling and improved clinical prognosis. These findings underscore the importance of long-term MR surveillance and its implications for outcome optimization following M-TEER."

Methods and results The randomized GALACTIC-HF trial compared the efficacy and safety of omecamtiv mecarbil (OM) to placebo in 8,232 patients with HFrEF, with a primary composite outcome of a first HF event or cardiovascular death. Of 7998 patients (97.2%) with baseline data on MR, 5782 (72.3%) had no MR, 970 (12.1%) had mild MR, and 1221 (15.3%) had moderate MR (only 25 had severe MR). Patients with moderate MR had a higher risk of the primary outcome than those without MR (adjusted HR 1.11; 95% CI 1.01–1.23); risk was not higher in patients with mild MR. The association between moderate MR and the primary outcome was most prominent in patients with less severe HF (milder NYHA class, higher LVEF, and lower NT-proBNP) compared to more severe HF. In adjusted analyses, MR was not associated with mortality, and the results of all analyses remained consistent after including patients with severe MR. The beneficial treatment effect of OM versus placebo on clinical outcomes was not modified by MR. Over 80% of patients with moderate/severe MR fulfilled the broad inclusion criteria for COAPT and RESHAPE-HF2. Conclusions In GALACTIC-HF, almost 15% of HFrEF patients had moderate MR, which was associated with a higher risk of the primary outcome.

J. Raake; Dario Bongiovanni,10.3390/jcdd13010040,2026-01-09,Journal of Cardiovascular Development and Disease,"Severe mitral regurgitation (MR) is one of the most common valvular heart diseases and is frequently associated with advanced left ventricular (LV) systolic dysfunction. Transcatheter edge-to-edge repair (TEER) offers effective symptom relief but may induce abrupt hemodynamic changes leading to afterload mismatch and acute LV failure. Levosimendan may help mitigate this complication by improving contractility, yet evidence supporting its use in this setting is scarce. Therefore, the aim of this study was to systematically evaluate the evidence on the effects of Levosimendan in patients with severe MR and LV dysfunction undergoing TEER. We performed a comprehensive search of PubMed, Embase, Scopus, and Google Scholar. Primary outcomes were postprocedural LV ejection fraction (LVEF) and systolic pulmonary artery pressure (sPAP). Secondary outcomes included procedural success, procedure duration, and in-hospital complications. Five studies comprising 315 patients (n = 141 Levosimendan, n = 174 controls) met the inclusion criteria. Pooled analysis showed no significant difference in postprocedural LVEF between Levosimendan-treated patients and controls (mean difference 0.45%, 95% CI [−1.46–2.35] p = 0.65) and no significant change from baseline. Similarly, postprocedural sPAP did not differ significantly. Procedural success was higher with Levosimendan, and procedure duration was shorter. These hypothesis-generating findings highlight the need for larger, prospective randomized trials to clarify the role of Levosimendan in this setting."

Traditional management strategies follow a step-by-step approach, prioritizing guideline-directed medical therapy (GDMT) and reserving interventional (surgical or percutaneous) options only in case of persistent symptoms or worsening HF after GDMT. However, greater experience with the use of percutaneous procedures, even in high-risk patients, could support a more integrated approach, which exploits the synergistic effects of medical and interventional therapies to increase the tolerability of one vs the other, thereby improving quality of life and outcomes through their synergic effects. This expert opinion paper summarizes current data and evolving practices in the management of VHD in patients with HF, including secondary mitral regurgitation, aortic stenosis, aortic regurgitation, and tricuspid regurgitation."

Less is known about the operator volumes–outcomes association in the contemporary era. Objective To determine whether an operator-level volume-outcomes association exists for TAVR and MTEER in the contemporary era. Design, Setting, and Participants This cohort study examined data from patients undergoing TAVR or MTEER between January 2020 and December 2023 included in the Society of Thoracic Surgeons (STS)/American College of Cardiology (ACC) Transcatheter Valve Therapies (TVT) Registry, a national all-comers real-world registry. Consecutive patients undergoing TAVR for aortic stenosis or MTEER for mitral regurgitation were included. Data analysis was performed from October 2024 to December 2025. Exposure TAVR or MTEER. Main Outcomes and Measures The primary outcome measures were (1) 30-day all-cause mortality, (2) a 30-day composite outcome, and (3) in-hospital procedural complications following TAVR or MTEER. Data from the STS/ACC TVT Registry were analyzed for patients undergoing TAVR or MTEER between 2020 and 2023. The primary analysis assessed the association between operator volume and 30-day outcomes using a 2-level random-effects logistic regression model. The interaction between operator and hospital volumes and the association between TAVR and MTEER outcomes were also evaluated. Results A total of 358 943 patients underwent TAVR at 827 hospitals (7524 operators; median [IQR] annual volume, 24 [11-47]), and 51 407 patients underwent MTEER at 493 hospitals (2483 operators; median [IQR] annual volume, 12 [7-19]). For TAVR, median (IQR) patient age was 79.0 (73.0-85.0) years, and 152 186 patients (42.4%) were female; for MTEER, median (IQR) patient age was 79.0 (71.0-84.0) years, and 23 402 patients (45.5%) were female. Low-volume operators demonstrated inferior process of care measures compared with high-volume operators. In adjusted analyses, a higher risk of 30-day mortality (odds ratio [OR], 1.13; 95% CI, 1.02-1.26; P = .02) and in-hospital complications (OR, 1.09; 95% CI, 1.03-1.16; P = .005) was observed for low-volume TAVR operators (&amp;amp;lt;15/y) compared with high-volume operators (&amp;amp;gt;37/y). For MTEER, in-hospital complications (OR, 1.31; 95% CI, 1.11-1.56; P = .002) were higher for low-volume operators (&amp;amp;lt;8/y) compared with high-volume operators (&amp;amp;gt;16/y), while 30-day mortality was not different (OR, 1.16; 95% CI, 0.96-1.41; P = .12). Associations were consistent across hospital volume strata. Operator-level outcomes for TAVR and MTEER were not correlated. Conclusions and Relevance In this cohort study, results from a large, contemporary US registry demonstrate a persistent inverse association between operator volume and patient outcomes for both TAVR and MTEER. These findings may help inform future policies aimed at ensuring optimal outcomes."

We aimed to determine (i) whether baseline RRI predicts survival after mitral transcatheter edge-to-edge repair (M-TEER) and (ii) whether RRI changes in response to the procedure. Methods In this prospective, single-center cohort we enrolled consecutive patients with severe mitral regurgitation who underwent M-TEER between October 2020 and December 2021 (trial registration number 412/20, date of registration 02.09.2020). Baseline demographics, estimated laboratory parameters, comprehensive echocardiography, and Doppler-derived RRI were collected before and 3 months after intervention. The primary endpoint was all-cause mortality. Associations were analyzed with multivariable Cox regression. Renal endpoints were not systematically collected and were therefore not included as clinical outcome measures. Results Among 109 patients (53.2% women), the median baseline RRI was 0.71 (IQR 0.67–0.75) and showed no correlation with eGFR, left-ventricular ejection fraction, or echocardiographic measurements of mitral regurgitation at baseline. Higher RRI was associated with all-cause mortality, and in exploratory post hoc analyses an RRI cutoff &gt; 0.70 remained predictive independent of baseline renal function (HR 5.37, p 0.07). RRI improved significantly 3 months after M-TEER (0.67; IQR 0.63–0.70; p &lt; 0.001), particularly in patients with a post-procedural MR reduction of at least 1 grade. However, the change in RRI showed no correlation with mortality or changes in renal function. Conclusions A baseline RRI above 0.70 was independently associated with mortality following M–TEER, underscoring its potential prognostic relevance. The marked post-procedural decline in RRI, especially in patients with relevant MR improvement, suggests that RRI reflects hemodynamic rather than renal filtration changes. Given the limited sample size and number of events, these findings should be considered exploratory and hypothesis-generating, requiring validation in larger multicenter cohorts.
