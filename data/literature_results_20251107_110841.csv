PubMed,aortic stenosis,Astragalus Polysaccharide Improves Myocardial Fibrosis in Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy Through the TGF-β1/Smad3 Signal Pathway.,Nana Qin; Wenjun Wu; Baoyin Li,10.31083/FBL45595,2025-10-29,Frontiers in bioscience (Landmark edition),"Myocardial fibrosis is a key pathological driver of Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy (HCM), contributing to adverse remodeling and poor prognosis. The transforming growth factor-β1/Smad3 (TGF-β1/Smad3) signaling cascade plays a central role in fibrogenesis; however, effective antifibrotic therapies remain limited. Astragalus polysaccharide (APS), a bioactive constituent of Astragalus membranaceus, has demonstrated cardioprotective potential. Nevertheless, the mechanisms underlying its effects in HCM-associated fibrosis remain unknown.
Pressure overload induced HCM was established in C57BL/6J mice using transverse aortic constriction (TAC), and animals were randomized to control, TAC, low-dose APS (50 mg/kg/day), or high-dose APS (100 mg/kg/day) groups. Cardiac function was evaluated by echocardiography, while myocardial hypertrophy and fibrosis were assessed by morphometry, Masson's staining, and collagen I (Col-I) expression analysis. Parallel in vitro studies employed angiotensin II stimulated (Ang II-stimulated) H9C2 cardiomyocytes, with or without the TGF-β1/Smad3 agonist SRI-011381, to explore mechanistic pathways.
TAC induced marked cardiac dysfunction, ventricular dilation, and extensive fibrosis, accompanied by upregulation of TGF-β1, phosphorylated Smad3, and Col-I expression (all p < 0.05). APS treatment dose-dependently preserved systolic function, attenuated collagen deposition, and suppressed activation of the TGF-β1/Smad3 axis, with the strongest effects observed in the high-dose group. In vitro, APS significantly inhibited Ang II induced hypertrophy and fibrotic protein expression; these effects were abrogated by SRI-011381, confirming pathway specificity.
APS exerts cardioprotective and antifibrotic effects in HCM by inhibiting the TGF-β1/Smad3 signaling pathway. These findings highlight APS as a promising therapeutic candidate for targeting myocardial fibrosis and improving outcomes in HCM."

Contemporary real-world evidence on the risk factors of early stroke after TAVI is scarce. We aimed to evaluate the incidence, temporal trends and predictors of in-hospital stroke after TAVI and to assess its association with mortality.
We conducted a retrospective, observational cohort study using data from the Netherlands Heart Registration of all TAVI procedures performed in the Netherlands between 2013 and 2023. The primary endpoint was the incidence of in-hospital stroke. The secondary endpoints were trends, mortality and risk factors associated with in-hospital stroke and early mortality as identified by logistic regression.
Among 23 593 TAVI procedures, the overall incidence of in-hospital stroke was 2.0% and remained stable after an initial decline. Independent covariates associated with in-hospital stroke included female gender (OR 1.29; 95% CI 1.07 to 1.56), peripheral arterial disease (OR 1.55; 95% CI 1.24 to 1.93), non-transfemoral access (OR 1.54; 95% CI 1.21 to 1.93) and postdilation (OR 1.40; 95% CI 1.10 to 1.76). In-hospital stroke was strongly associated with an increased risk of mortality at 30 days (OR 8.54; 95% CI 6.56 to 11.02), and 1 year (OR 4.38; 95% CI 3.55 to 5.40).
In-hospital stroke remains an important complication after TAVI with a strong impact on mortality. Identification of high-risk patients and procedural optimisation is essential in optimisation of outcome."

Diagnosis was confirmed by elevated urinary HGA. Over 7 years, he underwent bilateral total shoulder, hip and knee arthroplasties, and long-segment cervicosacral fusion with pedicle subtraction osteotomy. Histopathology confirmed ochronotic cartilage changes. Surgical challenges included non-union, fascial dehiscence and tissue fragility. Cardiovascular evaluation revealed aortic valve stenosis and mitral insufficiency, reflecting systemic disease burden.The patient's spinal interventions preceded regulatory approval of nitisinone for AKU in the European Union, a disease-modifying therapy with potential to modify disease progression. This case underscores the importance of distinguishing AKU from inflammatory spondyloarthropathy and highlights the need for early diagnosis and interdisciplinary care."

Syphilitic cardiovascular disease is a rare but serious manifestation of tertiary syphilis, formerly a major cause of aortitis and thoracic aortic aneurysms before the antibiotic era. This review provides an updated overview of syphilitic cardiac and vascular disease for the cardiology specialist. We will discuss the historical and epidemiological context of cardiovascular syphilis, including longitudinal preantibiotic era studies and contemporary case series. We outline the pathophysiology of syphilitic aortitis, highlighting mechanisms whereby Treponema pallidum infection causes obliterative endarteritis of the vasa vasorum, ischemic injury to the aortic wall, and resulting aneurysm formation with aortic valve and coronary ostia involvement. The clinical manifestations are presented, with emphasis on the triad of classic tertiary cardiovascular syphilis, which includes syphilitic thoracic aortic aneurysm, aortic regurgitation, and coronary ostial stenosis. The diagnostic strategies are covered, including modern imaging findings (CT, MRI, echocardiography), serologic test algorithms for syphilis, and histopathologic features. Differential diagnosis is covered in depth, contrasting syphilitic aortitis with other causes of aortitis such as Takayasu arteritis, giant cell arteritis, and other infectious or idiopathic aortitides. Management principles are laid out, with antibiotic therapy and surgery as indicated for late disease. We also cover reported case outcomes and registry reports-including modern surgical series and a recent population-based study implicating syphilis in increased cardiovascular risk-and highlight prognosis with modern therapies. Syphilitic cardiac and vascular disease remains a relevant clinical entity-the ""great imitator"" of cardiovascular medicine-despite decreased incidence in the antibiotic. Early recognition of this treatable cause of aortitis is critical. Outcomes may be favorable with appropriate antibiotic treatment and early surgical repair of complications, but delayed diagnosis is perilous. Ongoing vigilance, research into optimal management, and public health measures to restrict syphilis are required to further reduce the impact of this disease."

The study included consecutive patients treated with FEVAR exclusively performed with BeFlared as the bridging stent at 11 high volume centres between November 2024 and April 2025. Patient demographics, target vessel (TV) anatomy, and post-operative patient and stent outcomes were prospectively collected in an electronic database. Computed tomography angiography (CTA) imaging was performed within the first post-operative month. The composite primary endpoint was the freedom from target vessel instability (TVI) rate of stented target vessels.
Eighty-four patients were included (75 males, 73.2 ± 7.3 years). TV catheterisation failed in two of 312 (0.6%) TV. BeFlared stenting was successful in all cases after TV catheterisation (n = 310). During the procedure, 13 BeFlared stents (4.2%) required secondary inflation and additional stents were implanted in six TVs (1.9%). The mean procedural time was 162 ± 60 minutes. On completion angiogram, all stents were patent and one renal stent type IC endoleak was noted (0.3%). Post-operative CTA confirmed the intra-operative type IC endoleak (0.3%), which is pending re-intervention, and additionally revealed one renal stent stenosis (0.3%). There were no stent occlusions, kinking, fracture, or stent related secondary procedures, resulting in a freedom from TVI of stented TV at 1 month of 99.3%.
In this first multicentric, prospective clinical report involving 84 patients treated across 11 expert centres, the BeFlared bridging stent demonstrated favourable early safety and effectiveness."

However, mid-term results are still contentious. We performed this meta-analysis to compare the safety and efficacy of transcatheter vs. surgical aortic valve replacement in the mid-term in patients with aortic stenosis at low to moderate surgical risk.
We searched Embase, PubMed®, and Cochrane databases for randomized clinical trials that compared transcatheter with surgical aortic valve replacement in patients with symptomatic severe aortic stenosis with a follow-up of at least four years. Outcomes of interest were all-cause mortality and disabling stroke.
We included six randomized clinical trials encompassing 6,444 patients with severe aortic stenosis, of whom 3,282 (50.9%) underwent transcatheter aortic valve replacement. There was no difference in all-cause mortality (risk ratio [RR] 1.08; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.94 - 1.25; P = 0.30) and disabling stroke (RR 0.95; 95% CI 0.75 - 1.21; P = 0.67) between groups. In the subgroup analysis, five-year mortality (RR 1.28; 95% CI 1.10 - 1.49) was higher in the transcatheter group. The new pacemaker implantation (RR 2.22; 95% CI 1.42 - 3.45) rate was higher in the transcatheter group. However, the new atrial fibrillation (RR 0.40; 95% CI 0.31 - 0.52) rate was higher in the surgical group.
Mid-term mortality and disabling stroke rates in patients with severe aortic stenosis treated with either transcatheter or surgical aortic valve replacement were similar."

Some patients have prolonged RVD after transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI). We aimed to identify the prevalence of RVD before and after TAVI and factors associated with preexisting and prolonged RVD in patients with severe AS.
This retrospective single-center study included 198 patients with severe AS (86.0 ± 4.8 years; 72.7% female). RVD was defined as two of the three parameters being worse than the reference value: fractional area change, right ventricular free wall strain, and tricuspid annular plane systolic excursion.
Sixty-eight patients (34.3%) were diagnosed with preexisting RVD. Factors associated with preexisting RVD were left ventricular (LV) ejection fraction, LV stroke volume index, and ratio of early diastolic velocity to early diastolic annular velocity (E/e') on the septal side in a multivariable analysis combining baseline clinical and echocardiographic parameters (all p < 0.05). One year after TAVI, 16 of 47 patients (34.0%) were classified as having prolonged RVD. Patients with prolonged RVD had lower LV stroke volume index, greater relative wall thickness, and lower aortic valve mean pressure gradient before TAVI than patients without prolonged RVD (all p < 0.05).
RVD in patients with severe AS is associated with lower LV ejection fraction, lower LV stroke volume index, and higher septal E/e' at baseline. Smaller LV stroke volume, lower aortic valve mean pressure gradient, and greater relative wall thickness might be predictors of prolonged RVD 1 year after TAVI."

Iliofemoral calcium modification by intravascular lithotripsy (IVL) may enable transfemoral access in PAD patients.
Between June 2022 and February 2024, all consecutive TAVR patients at our institution were prospectively screened for use of IVL according to the predefined TREATABLE classification, involving parameters such as calcification, vessel kinking and stenosis. Endpoints comprised successful TAVR, safety, and three-month outcomes (DRKS00034681). In an independent retrospective approach, all TAVR patients treated between February 2020 and June 2022 were evaluated with the TREATABLE classification towards complication rates without use of IVL (DRKS00029242).
Two hundred twenty-nine prospective patients were included and after application of the TREATABLE classification, 26 patients (11.4%) received IVL-supported transfemoral TAVR. According to the TREATABLE classification, there was a similar extent of kinking (p = 0.468), but a significantly higher severity of calcification in the IVL-treated group (p < 0.001). In the retrospective analysis of the additional 1000 patients, 966 (96.6%) received transfemoral and 34 alternative access TAVR. 154 transfemoral and all alternative access TAVR were identified as high-risk according to the TREATABLE classification. Comparing the retrospective and prospective TREATABEL cohorts, transfemoral high-risk patients in the retrospective cohort without IVL showed a higher rate of post-interventional stenosis or occlusion (12.3% vs. 0%, p = 0.049).
This observational study shows a favourable success and safety level of IVL-supported transfemoral TAVR despite severe PAD, based on the TREATABLE classification. Therefore, the newly developed classification provides a suitable tool for identifying patients who would benefit from facilitating transfemoral TAVR by IVL."

In this study, we aim to define the normal ranges for the sinus of Valsalva (SoV), the sinotubular junction (STJ), and the ascending aorta (AA) diameters using the Imam Khomeini Hospital Complex (IKHC) data registry of Iranian adults.
This study was conducted on 2269 adult participants with left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) of more than 50%. Echocardiographic measurements were taken at the SoV, STJ, and AA levels. Subjects with any valvular stenosis and more than moderate insufficiency were excluded.
The normal range of SoV was found to be 24.5-38.9 mm in males and 21.7-34.9 mm in females. Additionally, the STJ diameters ranged from 19.7 to 32.5 mm and 18.0 to 29.6 mm in males and females, respectively. The AA measurements showed significant differences between sexes, ranging from 23.74 to 38.02 mm in males and 21.45 to 36.53 mm in females. Results also indicated that for every 10-year increase in age, the diameters of SoV, STJ, and AA increased by approximately 1.0, 0.8, and 1.6 mm, respectively.
This study provided detailed echocardiographic reference values for aortic dimensions in the Iranian population and compared them across various age groups, genders, and body mass index (BMI) categories. Also, the findings emphasize the impact of aging on aortic values. The limited external validity of our single-center, hospital-based study suggests that future multicenter research is necessary to confirm our findings and improve their generalizability."

Despite Class I guideline indications, many patients-especially older, frail individuals with multimorbidity-remain untreated. Advancements in high-fidelity multimodality imaging - including cardiac magnetic resonance, four-dimensional flow, and speckle-tracking echocardiography - have enabled earlier detection of remodeling and more accurate quantification of regurgitant burden. These techniques are redefining thresholds for treatment and may enable biomarker-imaging composite staging of disease. Surgery remains the gold standard of therapy for native AR. Contemporary surgical management is tailored to age, anatomy, and root pathology. While surgical aortic valve replacement remains the predominant therapy for most candidates, valve-sparing root procedures, the Ross operation, and aortic valve neocuspidization are increasingly offered at experienced centers for carefully selected lower-risk patients. Transcatheter aortic valve replacement is expanding rapidly as a viable option that helps bridge the treatment gap for those at prohibitive or high risk for surgery. Yet, devices optimized for calcific aortic stenosis encounter technical obstacles in native AR - including large, non-calcified annuli, elliptical root geometry, and high stroke volumes - leading to suboptimal anchoring, residual paravalvular regurgitation, and device embolization. Purpose-built AR systems with leaflet-engaging anchoring and enhanced sealing have shown encouraging outcomes in feasibility and pivotal studies, and have obtained commercial approval in Europe, and U.S. authorization is anticipated. This state-of-the-art review synthesizes current insights into AR pathophysiology, diagnostic advances, and therapeutic innovations in surgical and transcatheter techniques, highlighting knowledge gaps and proposing research priorities to accelerate access to care for this historically undertreated population."

Catheterization and anticoagulation therapy can result in cholesterol emboli, potentially leading to systemic organ infarction. Contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) and transesophageal echocardiography are commonly used to diagnose shaggy aorta. A patient in his ninth decade of life had a history of right occipital lobe ischemic stroke, bilateral internal carotid artery stenosis, and shaggy aorta syndrome related to transfemoral cerebral angiography. Dysarthria occurred immediately after the procedure. Brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) confirmed cerebral infarction, and anticoagulant therapy was administered. Four days later, after observing numbness of the left 5th finger and purplish discoloration of the tips of the 2nd and 5th fingers, we performed contrast-enhanced CT and diagnosed shaggy aorta. There was no renal impairment or eosinophilia and the patient was discharged 16 days after the examination. Aortic MRI performed 1 month later revealed an unstable plaque in the vessel wall. Although we report our experience with a single patient, we recommend that patients scheduled for cerebral angiography, especially those with severe arteriosclerosis, undergo preprocedural aortic fast spoiled gradient echo MRI screening to avoid shaggy aorta syndrome."

Twenty-four GBMPs were selected as experimental subjects. Under general anesthesia, DSA was undertaken via the femoral artery. Based on DSA results, the branching patterns and distribution characteristics of the supra-aortic arteries were analyzed. A DSA post-processing workstation was used to calibrate and measure the luminal diameters of vascular structures. Subsequently, neurointerventional models-- including aneurysm, stenosis, and thromboembolism of the common carotid artery (CCA)--were established in GBMPs.
In GBMPs, the aortic arch gives rise to the brachiocephalic trunk and left subclavian artery. The brachiocephalic trunk bifurcates into the right subclavian artery and CCA trunk, which divides further into left and right branches. At their terminal ends, the CCAs give rise to the larger external carotid artery and smaller ascending pharyngeal artery. The vertebral arteries, originating from the subclavian arteries, communicate extensively with carotid and vertebrobasilar systems. Four models of sidewall aneurysms, four models of fusiform aneurysms, eight models of stenoses, and eight thromboembolism models of CCAs were established. One GBMP died from a hematoma at the site of femoral-artery puncture 2 h postoperatively, but the remaining 23 GBMPs survived. Three weeks postoperatively, DSA confirmed establishment of models.
GBMPs are suitable for providing anatomical models of the supra-aortic arteries, as successfully evaluated by DSA, and that these models are appropriate for simulating neurointerventional conditions such as stenosis, aneurysms, and thrombosis."

This study determined cancer incidence and overall survival rates among six CVD subtypes to inform integrated care pathways.
Longitudinally linked research data were obtained from BARMER, the second largest health insurance fund in Germany. The incidence of cancer and mortality was determined over a 5 year period following an index hospitalisation for CVD across matched cohorts, comprising patients with either lower extremity peripheral arterial disease (PAD), aortic aneurysm or dissection, carotid stenosis, coronary heart disease, atrial fibrillation, or heart failure. Propensity score matching was used to adjust for age, sex, and Elixhauser comorbidities. Patients with a previous cancer diagnosis or those who died within 30 days after discharge were excluded.
Among the 46 798 propensity score matched patients with CVD, the 5 year incidence of cancer ranged from 10% in heart failure to 17% in carotid stenosis, while higher incidences were observed in men. Overall mortality rates after 5 years varied widely, with the highest mortality observed in men with PAD (29.2%, 95% confidence interval [CI] 28.0 - 30.4%) and women with PAD (26.2%, 95% CI 24.4 - 28.1), highlighting the particularly high mortality burden in PAD compared with other CVD subgroups.

This study aimed to determine if LLMs can make guideline-concordant treatment decisions based on patient data as typically present in clinical practice (lengthy, unstructured medical text).
We conducted a retrospective study of 80 patients with severe aortic stenosis who were scheduled for either surgical (SAVR; n=24) or transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR; n=56) by our institutional heart team in 2022. Various LLMs (BioGPT, GPT-3.5, GPT-4, GPT-4 Turbo, GPT-4o, LLaMA-2, Mistral, PaLM 2, and DeepSeek-R1) were queried using either anonymized original medical reports or manually generated case summaries to determine the most guideline-concordant treatment. We measured agreement with the heart team using Cohen κ coefficients, reliability using intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs), and fairness using the frequency bias index (FBI; FBI >1 indicated bias toward TAVR).
When presented with original medical reports, LLMs showed poor performance (Cohen κ coefficient: -0.47 to 0.22; ICC: 0.0-1.0; FBI: 0.95-1.51). The LLMs' performance improved substantially when case summaries were used as input and additional guideline knowledge was added to the prompt (Cohen κ coefficient: -0.02 to 0.63; ICC: 0.01-1.0; FBI: 0.46-1.23). Qualitative analysis revealed instances of hallucinations in all LLMs tested.
Even advanced LLMs require extensively curated input for informed treatment decisions. Unreliable responses, bias, and hallucinations pose significant health risks and highlight the need for caution in applying LLMs to real-world clinical decision-making."

Patients treated with BEV had a significantly higher 30-day mean transprosthetic gradient (TPG) (10.8 (95% CI 10.4-11.2) vs 6.8 mmHg (95% CI 6.3-7.4), p < 0.0001), but fewer more-than-mild aortic regurgitation as compared with SEV. Moderate/severe BVD were observed in 29 and 8 patients respectively, corresponding with a 6-year cumulative incidence of 7.3% (95% CI 5.0-10.1%). BVD was significantly associated with all-cause mortality for moderate (HR 2.2, 95% CI 1.3-4.0, p = 0.0051) and severe BVD (HR 4.5, 95% CI 1.4-14.1, p = 0.0105). Both a mean post-implantation TPG > 9 mmHg (HR 2.2; 95% CI 1.0-5.0, p = 0.0456) and implantation of the 20 mm SAPIEN BEV (n = 4) (HR 6.8; 95% CI 1.5-30.3, p = 0.0114) were associated with an increased incidence of BVD.
BVD is a rare complication in elderly intermediate-to-high risk patients undergoing TAVI. However, BVD is associated with increased mortality."
PubMed,aortic stenosis,Study on the Correlation Between Ventricular Function Evaluated by Z-Score of Atrioventricular Annular Plane Systolic Excursion and Pulmonary Artery Abnormality and Retrograde Ductus Arteriosus Flow in Fetuses With Ebstein Anomaly.,Xianfeng Guo; Bowen Zhao; Yilin Li; Xinyu Zhou,10.1002/jcu.70122,2025-11-04,Journal of clinical ultrasound : JCU,"Ebstein anomaly (EA) is a congenital heart disease that can cause intrauterine fetal death. Pulmonary valve stenosis or atresia (PS/PA) and retrograde ductus arteriosus flow (RDAF) are important factors leading to a poor prognosis, but the causes of its formation are still unclear. This study aimed to assess the correlation between left and right ventricular function and PS/PA and RDAF in fetuses with EA using MAPSE and TAPSE Z-score values measured by free angle M-mode (FAM) echocardiography.
This retrospective cohort study of 34 EA and 68 normal fetuses was enrolled. Differences in Z-score values were compared between the control, EA with and without PS/PA groups, and between EA-PS/PA with and without RDAF group. Correlation analysis was performed between Z-score values with the ratio of inner diameter of the pulmonary to the aortic valve annulus (PA/AO) and RDAF.
The differences in Z-score values were significant (p < 0.001) between three groups. Z-score values were lower in EA-PS/PA with RDAF compared to the without RDAF group (p < 0.05). Z-scores were all positively correlated with PA/AO in the EA group (p < 0.05), and negatively correlated with RDAF in the EA-PS/PA group (p < 0.05).
Decreased ventricular function of EA fetus is related to the formation of PS/PA. After the formation of PS/PA, the degree of damage to ventricular function is not related to the diameter of the pulmonary artery; it is related to the formation of RDAF."

We present a case of cerebral infarction caused by thrombus detachment from the right coronary artery (RCA) ostium following CAG. This case underscores the importance of accurate identification and management of coronary ostial thrombus during CAG.
A 72-year-old woman was admitted to the hospital with chest pain lasting for 2 hours.
Based on the electrocardiogram findings, the patient was diagnosed with an acute inferior ST-Segment Elevation Myocardial infarction accompanied by third-degree atrioventricular block in accordance with established guidelines.
The patient was promptly scheduled for CAG. During RCA angiography, the angiography catheter was inserted into the base of the aortic sinus, and a small volume of contrast agent was injected. The ostium of the RCA was observed to become opacified. However, after the catheter was engaged in the RCA ostium, no further opacification was observed upon contrast injection, and no stenosis was detected in the proximal, middle, or distal segments. We suspected that the thrombus had dislodged.
The patient's chest symptoms resolved immediately. Moreover, her mental status improved significantly, with normal motor strength and muscle tone in all 4 extremities. However, subsequent computed tomography angiography of the head and neck, cranial magnetic resonance imaging, and magnetic resonance angiography examinations revealed the presence of carotid artery thrombus and acute cerebral infarction.
This case underscores the critical importance of accurate identification and management of coronary ostial thrombus during CAG. Notably, when coronary ostial thrombosis is encountered, prompt postprocedural evaluation, including computed tomography angiography of the head and neck to assess for systemic embolization, is warranted."

While extensively studied in adults, its evolution from childhood remains underexplored. This study aimed to evaluate morphological changes in MVP from paediatric to adult age and their association with MR progression using transthoracic echocardiography (TTE).
This retrospective single-centre study included 53 patients with confirmed MVP diagnosed in childhood and followed up into adulthood (mean follow-up 9 ± 5 years). Each patient had at least two TTEs, and echocardiographic parameters were assessed and indexed for body surface area and height. The presence and progression of mitral annulus disjunction (MAD) were also analysed.
At baseline, the mean age was 8.13 ± 3.25 years; at final follow-up, 18.45 ± 6 years. MAD was present in 60% of patients at both TTEs, while 13% developed MAD over time. Indexed MVP morphological parameters, including leaflet length, annular diameter, and MAD distance, remained stable from childhood to adulthood. However, the severity of MR increased over time and was associated with changes in multiple mitral valve parameters, rather than a single feature. No significant arrhythmic events or implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) implantations were recorded.
MVP-related structural changes remain morphometrically stable when indexed for growth, yet MR severity can worsen due to a combination of morphological alterations. MAD can be identified in paediatric patients and may develop over time. These findings support the view that MVP may encompass different phenotypes and potentially represent a form of cardiomyopathy."

To examine the association of MR grade and the risk of ischemic stroke (IS) in AF patients with heart failure (HF).
We investigated 2748 patients with known AF who were hospitalized due to acute decompensated HF. All patients underwent echocardiography during hospitalization. Patients were divided into groups based on the degree of MR (high-grade MR [3-4] vs. no/low-grade MR [0-2]). The primary endpoint was IS during long term follow-up.
Mean age was 79 ± 11 years, 48% were women. After 2 years of follow-up, the cumulative incidence of IS among patients with high-grade MR was significantly lower compared to patients with no/low-grade MR (6% vs. 12%, respectively; P-value = 0.0064). Multivariate Fine and Gray analysis, adjusting for CHA₂DS₂-VASc, and accounting for the competing risk of death and valve intervention, showed the presence of high-grade MR was associated with a significant 50% (P = 0.013) reduction in the risk of IS compared with no/low-grade MR. When added to the CHA₂DS₂-VASc score, MR grade allowed more accurate prediction of IS with an overall improvement of 12% (95% confidence interval 5-17%) using net reclassification index analysis.
Our findings suggest an inverse correlation between MR grade and the risk of stroke among AF patients with HF. These findings may be used for improved risk assessment in this population."

Associations between these cardiac abnormalities and the ADPKD genotype or disease severity remain poorly defined. We investigated the prevalence and associations of valvulopathies and LVH with renal function, renal size, systemic features and genotype in ADPKD.
This retrospective, single-centre study analysed 154 adult ADPKD patients. Data included echocardiography (LVH, valvulopathies), abdominal ultrasound (renal diameter), cranial magnetic resonance imaging, estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) and genetic testing (PKD1/PKD2 mutations) in 87 patients. Associations were assessed using appropriate statistical tests including logistic regression for multivariable analysis.
Aortic regurgitation was associated with larger mean renal diameter (P = .027) and lower eGFR (P < .001). However, when adjusted for gender and age the associations are no longer significant. Interventricular septal thickness correlated positively with renal diameter (r = +0.32, P < .001) and negatively with eGFR (r = -0.39, P < .001). Left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH, prevalence 30%) was significantly associated with PKD1 mutations (PKD1 non-truncating versus PKD2 adjusted P-value = .011; PKD1 truncating versus PKD2 adjusted P-value = .011), independent of hypertension, age, sex and anaemia (adjusted OR 8.5, P = .008).

No associations were found with hepatic, pancreatic or intracranial cysts/aneurysms.
This study demonstrates an independent association between LVH and PKD1 mutations and links aortic regurgitation with renal disease severity in ADPKD. These findings highlight genotype-phenotype correlations that may help stratify cardiovascular risk and inform personalized management in ADPKD."

To evaluate the safety and effectiveness of the Tendyne Transcatheter Mitral Valve System in symptomatic patients with mitral disease due to severe MAC.
The SUMMIT-MAC study is the first prospective clinical trial designed to assess the use of the Tendyne system for severe MAC. All patients had severe MAC with significant mitral valve dysfunction and were at high surgical risk. An echocardiography core laboratory performed independent assessments of mitral disease. Adverse events were adjudicated by an independent clinical events committee. The primary endpoint was freedom from all-cause mortality and heart failure hospitalization (HFH) at 12 months post-index procedure.
Overall, 103 patients (78.0±6.5 years; 55% women) with severe MAC and mitral regurgitation (MR) or stenosis underwent treatment with Tendyne. MR was present in nearly all patients at baseline (i.e., 97% of patients with grade >2+). Technical success was achieved in 94.2%, with a 30-day mortality of 6.8%. The primary endpoint was met - freedom from all-cause mortality and HFH was 60.4% at 12 months (performance goal: 43%; p=0.0002) Heart failure symptoms improved significantly (NYHA Class I/II, 30.6% vs. 87.5%, paired baseline vs 12 months; p<0.0001) and quality-of-life improved significantly (mean paired increase in the Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire overall summary, 18.7±24.4 points; p<0.0001).
In this first report of the primary outcomes of the SUMMIT-MAC clinical trial, transcatheter mitral valve replacement with Tendyne led to successful treatment of mitral valve disease due to MAC and significant improvements in heart failure symptoms and quality-of-life."

This study aimed to evaluate the clinical significance of MR reduction and TMPG elevation in patients with functional mitral regurgitation (FMR) after M-TEER.
A total of 2,360 FMR patients were evaluated using postdischarge echocardiography after M-TEER. The relationship between TMPG and outcomes was assessed using spline analysis and group-based comparisons. Based on residual MR severity and TMPG, patients were categorized into 5 groups to assess the prognostic impact of postprocedural hemodynamics: MR ≤ mild and TMPG <5 mm Hg (n = 1,702), MR ≤ mild and TMPG ≥5 to <10 mm Hg (n = 164), moderate MR and TMPG <5 mm Hg (n = 361), moderate MR and TMPG ≥5 to <10 mm Hg (n = 71), and MR > moderate or TMPG 10 mm Hg (n = 62). The primary endpoint was all-cause death or heart failure hospitalization.
The 2-year primary endpoint event rates increased progressively with higher TMPG, from 25.0% at 1 mm Hg to 47.0% at 6 mm Hg. In multivariable analysis, TMPG per 1 mm Hg increment was independently associated with the primary endpoint (HR: 1.10; 95% CI: 1.02-1.17; P = 0.008). Using MR ≤ mild as the reference, moderate MR was not linked to higher risk, whereas MR > moderate remained a significant predictor of primary endpoint. The patients with MR ≤ mild and TMPG <5 mm Hg had the lowest incidence of the primary endpoint among the 5 groups (28.4%, 39.0%, 33.0%, 43.7%, 48.4%; P < 0.001). However, event risk was not significantly different between patients with moderate MR and TMPG <5 mm Hg and those with MR ≤ mild and TMPG <5 mm Hg (HR: 1.13; 95% CI: 0.92-1.41; P = 0.24). Failure to achieve MR ≤ mild and TMPG <5 mm Hg was associated with larger left atrial volume index, greater effective regurgitation orifice area, elevated baseline TMPG, and old-generation G2 device use.
In patients with FMR, elevated TMPG was consistently associated with higher risks of the primary endpoint. Mild or moderate residual MR with low TMPG was associated with more favorable prognosis, suggesting that balancing MR reduction and TMPG may help refine risk stratification after M-TEER.

However, these studies were limited by small numbers with low generalizability.
Danish nationwide registries were used to identify patients with first-time E. faecalis BSI from 2010 -2021 without previous colorectal neoplasia (CRN). Age-, sex- and calendar-matched comparators from the general population was identified (1:5). We estimated the six-month cumulative incidence of CRC and CRN and a multivariable adjusted Cox analysis was used for relative comparison between groups.
We identified 4,664 patients with E. faecalis BSI (median age: 74.9 years, 73.4% males) and 23,320 comparators from the general population. For patients with E. faecalis BSI the six-month incidence of CRC was 0.45% (95% CI: 0.28-0.72%) and of CRN 2.34% (95% CI: 1.88-2.88). For matched comparators the incidence of CRC was 0.12% (95% CI: 0.08-0.17) and of CRN 0.48% (95% CI: 0.39-0.57).

The six-month mortality was 36.3% in patients with E. faecalis BSI while this was 1.7% among comparators.
In patients with first-time E. faecalis BSI the six months incidence of CRC was around 0.5% and 2.3% for the diagnosis of CRN, which were 3-4 times higher than in a matched cohort from the general population. Nevertheless, the absolute risks do not justify systematic screening for CRC or CRN in patients with E. faecalis BSI."

In normal humans, contrast (microbubbles) commonly appears in the left heart following agitated saline contrast injection into a systemic vein via intrapulmonary (IP) shunting. The aim of this study was to determine whether this phenomenon also occurs in dogs.
Forty-eight dogs with either a normal echocardiogram or trivial to mild mitral regurgitation were studied. A standard ASCE protocol was used, with each dog lying in right lateral recumbency.
Left heart contrast was identified in 37 dogs (77%).
Agitated saline contrast echocardiography was performed only once per dog and under a single condition, and intra-operator and interoperator variability was not assessed. Echocardiography alone cannot completely exclude patent foramen ovale, and stress in the hospital environment may have influenced shunting.
Left heart contrast following ASCE is common in dogs without a right-to-left shunting intracardiac defect. This presumably occurs via intrapulmonary arteriovenous anastomoses."

In contrast, pulmonary stenosis (PS) is a common congenital heart disease that often results in pulmonary regurgitation (PR) after intervention and may sometimes require reintervention. In cases of PAA following repair of PS, the caliber mismatch between the dilated pulmonary artery (PA) and the small valve annulus complicates surgery. A composite graft is well-suited to address this issue. A patient underwent surgical valvotomy for PS at age 16. She remained asymptomatic until pregnancy at age 32, when routine cardiac screening was normal; she was then lost to follow-up. At age 72, dyspnea and leg edema led to the diagnosis of combined valvular disease and a 68-mm PAA. Imaging revealed severe PR and right ventricular dysfunction. PA and right ventricular outflow tract reconstruction were performed with a composite graft in a Rastelli-type procedure, along with mitral valve replacement for atrial functional mitral regurgitation and tricuspid annuloplasty for secondary tricuspid regurgitation, in the setting of combined valvular disease complicated by heart failure (HF). The postoperative course was uneventful, and at two years of follow-up, no HF or PA enlargement was observed. This case demonstrates that successful one-stage surgery can be performed in an elderly patient with a PAA and combined valvular disease. A Rastelli-type reconstruction effectively addressed the mismatch between the pulmonary valve and the aneurysmal artery, optimizing hemodynamics and preserving pulmonary flow. Long-term follow-up remains essential to monitor residual tissue and potential late complications."

The molecular mechanism of pimobendan (PIMO) that contributes to the delay in congestive heart failure (CHF) in MR associated with apoptosis and fibrosis is still unclear. Our aim was to examine the impact of PIMO on ER stress, apoptosis, and fibrosis in a chronic MR rat model.
MR was surgically induced in 10 Sprague-Dawley rats, with 5 serving as sham operation controls. At 8 weeks postsurgery, the MR animals were randomly allocated into two groups: MR and MR + PIMO groups. PIMO was administered twice daily through oral gavage for 4 weeks, whereas the sham and MR groups were administered similar quantities of drinking water. Echocardiography was conducted before the delivery of PIMO as a baseline measure and at the end of the study. At the end of the investigation, hearts were procured for histopathological and ER stress evaluations.
PIMO significantly maintained heart function and structural remodeling in the MR animals. PIMO significantly reduced MR-induced myocyte apoptosis (p = 0.044) and fibrosis (p = 0.002) by reducing the messenger RNA expression of genes associated with ER stress (GRP78 [glucose-regulated protein 78], ATF4 [activating transcription factor 4], and CHOP [C/ERP homologous protein]) compared to the MR group (p < 0.05, p < 0.01, and p < 0.001, respectively).

In contrast, the less invasive transapical beating-heart septal myectomy (TABSM) has recently gained attention as a potential alternative, although comparative evidence regarding their clinical outcomes remains limited.
To compare the efficacy and safety of surgical myectomy and TABSM in patients with HOCM.
A systematic search of PubMed, Web of Science, Cochrane Library, and ScienceDirect (January 2014-May 2025) identified 24 observational studies including 3,732 patients (2,824 surgical myectomy; 908 TABSM). The primary outcome was the change in left ventricular outflow tract pressure gradient (LVOTPG). Secondary outcomes included improvement in NYHA class, prevalence of moderate-to-severe mitral regurgitation (MR ≥ 2), short-term (30-day) and long-term mortality, and the rate of postoperative permanent pacemaker implantation. Random-effects meta-analysis and meta-regression were performed.
Both procedures achieved substantial and comparable reductions in LVOTG, with no significant between-group difference (p = 0.75). Functional status improved in both cohorts; younger age and higher study quality were independently associated with greater improvement in NYHA class (p < 0.05). Residual MR ≥ grade 2 decreased in both groups. 30-day mortality was low and similar between surgical myectomy and TABSM. Long-term mortality appeared lower after TABSM (≈2%) compared with surgical myectomy (≈6%); however, this finding should be interpreted cautiously due to substantial heterogeneity and shorter follow-up in TABSM studies. Pacemaker implantation occurred less frequently after TABSM than after surgical myectomy (≈2% vs. ≈6%; p = 0.03).
Both surgical myectomy and TABSM are effective and safe approaches for septal reduction in HOCM. While surgical myectomy remains the reference standard, TABSM represents a promising minimally invasive option, particularly in anatomically complex or reoperative cases. Prospective studies with standardized endpoints are required to guide individualized procedural selection and confirm long-term outcomes.

Right ventricular-pulmonary arterial coupling, assessed with tricuspid annular plane systolic excursion (TAPSE) and systolic pulmonary artery pressure (sPAP) ratio, reflects right ventricular adaptability to afterload. This international multicenter cohort study aimed to evaluate the prognostic value of rest TAPSE/sPAP and exercise TAPSE (exTAPSE)/sPAP in primary mitral regurgitation.
Between January of 2019 and December of 2023, 211 patients assigned to a derivation cohort (64±12 years of age, 40% women) and 146 patients assigned to a validation cohort (66±13 years of age, 39% women), all of whom had moderate or severe primary mitral regurgitation, no or discordant symptoms, and no left ventricular systolic dysfunction or atrial fibrillation, underwent semisupine cycle-ergometry cardiopulmonary exercise testing combined with exercise echocardiography. TAPSE/sPAP was measured at rest and at intermediate (defined as the first ventilatory threshold) and peak exercise. The primary end point was a composite of cardiovascular death, unplanned cardiovascular hospitalizations, and new atrial fibrillation.
In the derivation cohort, 48 patients reached the composite outcome (median follow-up, 24 months [interquartile range, 12-51]). Intermediate and peak exTAPSE/sPAP were strongly correlated (r=0.84; P<0.001), with intermediate exTAPSE/sPAP offering superior feasibility (98% versus 92%) with comparable prognostic accuracy to peak exTAPSE/sPAP (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve, 0.794 [0.730-0.849] versus 0.765 [0.698-0.823]) and therefore was used as the exercise TAPSE/sPAP measure. Patients with a reduced rest TAPSE/sPAP (cutoff 0.8 mm/mm Hg) and intermediate exTAPSE/sPAP (cutoff 0.6 mm/mm Hg) had a lower event-free survival (log-rank P<0.0001). Intermediate exTAPSE/sPAP and percent-predicted peak VO2 were independently associated with the primary end point (hazard ratio, 0.64 [0.51-0.80] per 0.1 mm/mm Hg increase [P<0.001] and hazard ratio, 2.03 [1.05-3.93] if <80% [P=0.04], respectively) and had incremental prognostic value beyond age, left atrial volume index, mitral regurgitation severity, rest TAPSE/sPAP, and mitral valve intervention (time-dependent covariable). Similar results were found when rest and intermediate exTAPSE/sPAP were included in the multivariable model as categorical measures. Validation in an independent cohort confirmed the consistent and robust performance of both multivariable models, irrespective of whether TAPSE/sPAP was modeled as a continuous or categorical variable.
Exercise right ventricular-pulmonary arterial coupling, particularly intermediate exTAPSE/sPAP, is a robust and feasible measure independently associated with adverse outcomes, and provides prognostic information beyond resting variables and cardiorespiratory fitness, potentially refining risk stratification and guiding management in patients with primary mitral regurgitation."

RV dilation impairs left ventricular (LV) compliance through diastolic constraint, elevating pulmonary pressures and triggering a self-perpetuating cycle of cardiopulmonary compromise. This hemodynamic cascade generates echocardiographic signs indistinguishable from pulmonary embolism (PE). CASE REPORT A 75-year-old woman with hypertension and diabetes developed acute hypoxia, tachycardia (110/min), and tachypnea (35/min) during ureteroscopic lithotripsy, accompanied by a positive fluid balance of 2430 mL from irrigation absorption. Bedside echocardiography revealed RV dilation, McConnell's sign, D-shaped LV, severe tricuspid regurgitation, elevated systolic pulmonary artery pressure (58 mmHg), 60/60 sign, and fused mitral E/A waves - findings highly suggestive of PE. Laboratory tests showed metabolic acidosis (pH 7.32), hypoxemia (PaO₂/FiO₂ 132 mmHg), and markedly elevated NT-proBNP (3892 pg/mL). Pulmonary CT angiography excluded thromboembolism but confirmed bilateral pulmonary edema. The diagnosis of fluid absorption-induced cardiogenic pulmonary edema was established. Aggressive diuresis and respiratory support led to symptom resolution, with normalized RV/LV ratio (34 mm → 23 mm) and NT-proBNP (136 pg/mL) on follow-up. CONCLUSIONS Acute volume overload from intraoperative fluid absorption exacerbates RV failure through ventricular interdependence, producing PE-mimicking echocardiographic signs. This case demonstrates that RV dilation, septal flattening, and pulmonary hypertension - classically associated with PE - can originate from non-thromboembolic etiologies. Clinicians must utilize multimodal imaging (echocardiography + CTPA) to discriminate fluid overload syndrome from PE. Preventive strategies, including real-time intraoperative fluid balance monitoring and renal pelvic pressure control, are critical to mitigate hemodynamic decompensation during endoscopic procedures, thereby avoiding misdiagnosis and optimizing critical care outcomes."

A total of 1410 patients undergoing robotic mitral surgery between 2005 and 2023 performed by 4 surgeons (from early to late in their careers) were identified from an institutional registry. Learning curves for the primary outcome of Society of Thoracic Surgeons (STS) risk-adjusted morbidity (stroke, renal failure, cardiac reoperation, reintubation, or prolonged ventilation) and mortality were constructed using cumulative sum analysis.
The median patient age was 63 years (interquartile range [IQR], 54-70 years), 65.3% of the patients were male, and the patients' median STS predicted risk of morbidity and mortality was 5.9% (IQR, 4.3%-8.5%). Etiology was degenerative in 1237 patients (88%), of whom 869 (70%) had isolated P2 prolapse. Overall operative mortality was 0.3% (n = 4), with 3 deaths occurring in the first 1000 cases. Composite morbidity and mortality was 4.4% (n = 62). The degenerative repair rate was 99.5% (n = 1234/1237), with a 95% freedom from moderate or worse mitral regurgitation at 5 years. The program learning curve peaked at case 94, after which risk-adjusted morbidity and mortality was consistently better than predicted. Subsequent surgeons learned robotic mitral surgery with better-than-predicted outcomes from the outset-that is, no learning curve, with progressive improvement in risk-adjusted complications and cardiopulmonary bypass times.
Surgeons in an experienced program can learn robotic mitral surgery without a learning curve defined by worse-than-predicted clinical outcomes, achieving degenerative mitral repair rates >99% and good durability."

Little is known about the interplay between MMR and left ventricular diastolic function (LVDF) status and their joint association with clinical outcome.
We included 4150 participants without HF at Visit 5 (2011-2013) of the ARIC (Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities) study. The association of MMR and LVDF with risk of HF and all-cause death were assessed by Cox proportional hazards model.
No significant association between MMR and unfavorable prognosis was observed neither in full cohort nor in normal LVDF subset. Only in the subset of those with impaired LVDF, MMR was significantly associated with increased risk of HF (HR = 2.50; 95 %CI: 1.30-4.86; P = 0.006) and composite outcome of HF and death (HR = 1.70; 95 %CI: 1.11-2.60; P = 0.014). Significant interactions were found between MMR and LVDF status on risk of HF and composite outcome (P for interaction = 0.031 and 0.012, respectively). MMR coexisting with impaired LVDF confers a significantly increased risk of HF (HR = 3.47; 95 %CI: 2.31-5.20, P < 0.001) and composite outcome of HF and death (HR = 1.95; 95 %CI: 1.50-2.55, P < 0.001).
MMR is associated with an increased risk of unfavorable prognosis only when coexisting with impaired LVDF. Serving as a clinical risk stratification tool, impaired LVDF defines a high-risk MMR subgroup. This subgroup requires intensified monitoring and targeted management to improve outcomes."

Although prior studies reported improvement in AFMR severity after catheter ablation (CA), the long-term cardiovascular benefit remains uncertain.
To evaluate the association between CA and cardiovascular outcomes in AF patients with moderate or severe AFMR.
AF patients with moderate or greater AFMR were consecutively recruited from the China-AF registry and assigned to CA or medical therapy (MT) based on baseline treatment, following the intention-to-treat principle. This study explicitly emulated a parallel-group, randomized target trial, with follow-up aligned to treatment initiation. Baseline covariates were balanced using stabilized inverse probability of treatment weighting.
Among 873 patients (484 CA, 389 MT) with median follow-up of 1,509 days, 22 primary outcome events occurred in CA and 42 in MT (incidence per 100 person-years: 1.76 vs 3.30; absolute risk difference -1.54%; weighted HR 0.55 [95% CI 0.32-0.94]). CA was associated with lower weighted hazards for AF recurrence (HR 0.31; 95% CI, 0.25-0.37), cardiovascular death (HR 0.48; 95% CI, 0.24-0.96), and all-cause death (HR 0.49; 95% CI, 0.27-0.89). No significant differences were observed for ischemic stroke/systemic embolism, major bleeding, or cardiovascular hospitalization. Sensitivity analyses and exploratory subgroups showed consistent directional trends.

We aim to evaluate reproducibility of guideline-recommended echocardiographic parameters in real-world practice and to assess cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) as a complementary modality.
We retrospectively analyzed 99 patients referred to us for transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) for AR evaluation. A subset of 22 patients also underwent CMR. AR severity was independently graded according to ESC and ASE guidelines by two expert cardiologists and two trainees using semi-quantitative and quantitative parameters: pressure half-time (PHT), vena contracta width (VCW), and PISA-derived parameters, such as regurgitant orifice area (EROA). Interobserver agreement was analyzed using Cohen's Kappa, Bland-Altman analysis, and intraclass correlation coefficients.
VCW showed the highest reproducibility (overall κ = 0.77), strong agreement across groups (EXACT team κ = 0.7, TRAIN team κ = 0.86), and high feasibility (68.7%). PHT demonstrated poor interobserver consistency (overall κ = 0.36), wide intra-team variability (EXACT team κ = 0.30 vs. TRAIN team κ = 0.39), and high feasibility (77.8%). EROA showed moderate agreement (overall κ = 0.55, EXACT team κ = 0.64, TRAIN team κ = 0.74) and low feasibility (30.3%). CMR-derived parameters (forward flow, backflow, and regurgitant fraction) displayed excellent reproducibility even between novice and expert readers.
VCW is the most reliable echocardiographic parameter for AR assessment, while PHT and EROA are limited by variability and feasibility, respectively. Given its reproducibility and independence from operator expertise, CMR should be considered early when TTE findings are inconclusive. A simplified TTE-first approach, followed by timely CMR, may optimize staging and management of chronic AR."

Although the initial insult is driven by autoimmune responses triggered by Group A Streptococcus infection, the sustained progression of valvular fibrosis involves a complex interplay of persistent immune activation, chronic inflammation, and, critically, long-term mechanical stress. Mechanical forces arising from altered hemodynamics and structural valve deformation perpetuate valvular interstitial cell activation, endothelial-to-mesenchymal transition, and extracellular matrix remodeling, thereby driving fibrosis even after acute inflammation resolves. Current therapeutic options to halt or reverse mitral valve fibrosis are limited, with surgical repair or replacement remaining the primary interventions for advanced disease. Advancing mechanistic understanding through physiologically relevant models, coupled with early diagnostic strategies and multitargeted antifibrotic approaches, holds promise for preserving valve function. Integrating molecular insights with scalable public health measures may ultimately mitigate the global burden of rheumatic heart disease and improve outcomes for affected populations."

The role of multi-modality imaging in the diagnosis of patients with native or prosthetic valve IE is beyond the scope of this review. A literature search of the PubMed database was performed between 1 June 2024, and 30 June 2025. Relevant articles on the subjects of 'infective endocarditis,' 'multi-modality imaging,' and 'implanted cardiac devices' were used in our review.
The growth in using cardiac implanted electronic devices (CIED) demands improvement in the detection of CIED-related infections.

Specifically, we compared aspirin monotherapy versus aspirin plus Enoxaparin, bare metal versus drug-eluting stents, and jailed versus non-jailed PAs.
A retrospective chart review was conducted on neonates who underwent PDA stenting between 2014 and 2024. Patients were categorized by stent type, anticoagulation regimen, and PA jailing status. Unplanned reintervention rates were assessed using chi-square analysis and logistic regression. PA growth was evaluated using catheterization, MRI, and CT imaging. Statistical analyses of PA growth included t-tests and regression models.
Among 116 neonates analyzed, aspirin monotherapy was associated with a significantly lower unplanned reintervention rate compared to combination therapy with Enoxaparin (p = 0.0447). Stent type did not significantly impact reintervention rates. Additionally, intrapatient jailed PAs exhibited significantly reduced distal growth compared to non-jailed PAs (p = 0.0070).
For neonatal PDA stenting, aspirin monotherapy may be as effective as aspirin plus Enoxaparin for post-stenting anticoagulation, and drug eluting stents may not have a significant benefit over bare metal stents. Furthermore, PA jailing may negatively impact distal vessel growth, highlighting the need for refined stent placement techniques, although further prospective studies are needed to optimize procedural strategies and long-term outcomes in this high-risk neonatal population."

Unexpectedly, the tomato fish showed cardiac dilation and symptoms resembling those of chronic heart failure. Therefore, we investigate the pathogenesis and causes of these cardiac abnormalities. Crossbreeding suggests a link between DsRed expression and heart enlargement. Histological analysis confirms atrial dilation and thickening of the atrioventricular valve. RNA sequencing and immunohistological imaging reveal that valve thickness is due to the upregulated inflammation, cell proliferation, and epithelial-mesenchymal transition. Importantly, immunohistological staining elucidates DsRed accumulation in the atrioventricular valve, and removal of DsRed via Cre-mRNA injection rescues these heart defects. This study establishes a potential model of heart failure caused by protein aggregation in the cardiac valve. These findings highlight the potential of this transgenic zebrafish for investigating valvular heart diseases and chronic heart failure and developing new therapies."

The initial evaluation excluded common precipitants of delirium, including infection, metabolic derangements, polypharmacy, and structural central nervous system pathology. Investigations revealed evidence of acute decompensated heart failure, including volume overload, elevated N-terminal pro B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP), and a severely stenotic aortic valve on transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE). Conservative treatment with intravenous diuretics led to the rapid resolution of delirium within 72 hours. This case highlights an atypical presentation of severe aortic stenosis and underscores the importance of considering cardiac causes in elderly patients presenting with delirium in the absence of other identifiable factors."

As network traffic becomes more complex, accurately identifying malicious activities while minimizing false positives is essential for real-time monitoring systems. This study aims to enhance malware detection using deep learning (DL) techniques, focusing on improving accuracy, reducing false positives, and enabling real-time detection in dynamic network environments. Several advanced DL techniques are introduced to address these challenges. Entropy-Based Traffic Filtering (ETF) measures the randomness in network traffic to identify anomalies and malicious patterns, reducing noise and improving feature extraction. Self-Supervised Learning for Anomaly Detection (SSLAD) detects malware without labeled data by learning normal traffic patterns and identifying anomalies, thus improving the detection of unknown threats. Graph Neural Networks for Malware Traffic Classification (GNN-MTC) model network traffic as graphs, where devices are nodes, and communications are edges, capturing relational dependencies and anomalies to detect complex attack patterns like botnets and command-and-control (C2) communications. Context-Aware Graph Attention Networks (CA-GAT) further enhance detection by analyzing traffic as graphs while incorporating contextual factors like time and behavior, focusing on relevant interactions to improve attack detection. The proposed DL model achieves 98% accuracy, surpassing DeepMAL (95%) and an entropy-based method by Huang et al. (97.3%). Its strong precision and recall demonstrate superior performance in detecting known and novel malware, making it well-suited for real-time network security applications. The model was implemented using Python. Future research could focus on integrating real-time adaptive learning models, exploring hybrid DL architectures, and enhancing cross-platform malware detection, ensuring scalability and robustness in evolving network security environments."

Traditional approaches relying on special features or shallow learning models often fail to capture the complex, multi-scale patterns embedded in PET/CT imaging data. Recent advances in deep learning provide an opportunity to build more robust, data-driven systems for predictive modeling in oncology.
We propose a novel deep learning model that integrates convolutional and transformer-based components based on PET/CT data to support treatment decisions for esophageal cancer. The architecture introduces a Convolutional Feature Extractor with split-based residual blocks for efficient local feature capture, a Multi-scale Pooling module for spatial context aggregation, and an Multilayer Perceptron block for predicting. The model was evaluated using several performance metrics such as AUCROC, F1 score, Balanced Accuracy and benchmarked against state-of-the-art convolutional and transformer backbones such as ConvNeXt and Vision Transformer.
The proposed model achieved superior performance across all evaluation metrics, including an AUCROC of 0.9935 and a Balanced Accuracy of 0.9630, outperforming existing models. These results validate the effectiveness of combining local-global representation learning through custom-designed modules. In addition, we conducted ablation studies to further demonstrate the individual contributions and effectiveness of each component within the proposed architecture. By systematically removing or replacing specific modules such as the Convolutional Feature Extractor and Multi-scale Pooling, we observed consistent performance degradation, which highlights the necessity and complementary roles of these components in achieving optimal predictive accuracy.
This study presents a novel hybrid deep learning architecture that enhances treatment decision support for esophageal cancer by leveraging multi-scale spatial encoding.

Rapid automatic DR grading is a crucial approach for prevention. Although deep learning has shown promising results in automated DR grading, its deployment in clinical settings remains challenging due to variations in imaging devices, lighting conditions and other conditions in different hospitals. This study explores the problem of decreased generalization performance in DR grading, stemming from variations in the distributions of the source and target domains, namely addressing the domain generalization (DG) problem in DR grading. To tackle this challenge, we propose a novel Fourier-based domain generalization framework for fundus images, which consists of three key innovation elements: (1) Fourier spectrum enhancement: a Fourier-based image enhancement technique preserves critical high-frequency features by leveraging phase information, significantly improving cross-domain robustness; (2) Collaborative teacher-student knowledge distillation: a dual-network learning mechanism enhances generalization by distilling high-level semantic features from a teacher model to a student model; (3) Feature fusion: a feature fusion module effectively differentiates intra-class and inter-class features, thereby further enhancing classification performance. Extensive evaluation of our framework on six clinically realistic DR datasets demonstrates superior generalization performance compared to existing methods. Furthermore, this study reveals the critical role of Fourier phase information and high-level semantic features in improving generalization, bridging an important research gap in DR grading."

Overall, U-GRKAN strikes a more balanced compromise between accuracy, complexity, and interpretability, and shows good generalization potential across various modalities."

Firstly, we adopted two splitting strategies-WSI-level and patch-level-to stimulate sampling on multiple modal data distribution (i.e., renal WSIs collected from multi-centers). Then, we trained multiple CNN- and Transformer-based models on each splitting scheme respectively. We compared cross-splitting performance and analyzed the effective factors of results. For further validation, all models were tested on an independent external dataset for sensitivity analysis on the degree of fibrosis and inflammation. In conclusion, at both the patch- and WSI-level, M2F-Swin-B substantially outperformed UNet-ResNet18 with an average Intersection over Union (A-IoU) and per-class IoU.

Fetal movement is a basic index of fetal well being. IoT based fetal health classification leverages IoT technology to remotely assess and monitor fetal well being in real time. Continuous data streams including uterine contractions, fetal heart rate (FHR), and movement patterns can be gathered and analyzed by incorporating sensors with cloud machine learning (ML) and computing algorithms. This allows prompt diagnosis of distress indicators or abnormalities, simplifying quick measures to optimize prenatal care outcomes. Furthermore, IoT based systems provide an opportunity for personalized monitoring of individual pregnancies, enhancing fetal and maternal health monitoring through gestation. On the other hand, the present technology in medical applications could not offer an easily accessible, long term, and effective way for fetal movement monitoring. Lately, ML and deep learning (DL) approaches have been considered appropriate for the automatic classification of fetal health. This study presents an IoT assisted Fetal Health Detection and Classification using the Mother Optimization Algorithm with Deep Learning (AFHDC MOADL) method. The goal of the AFHDC MOADL technique is to accurately classify fetal health into three different classes such as normal, suspect, and pathological. In the AFHDC MOADL technique, a multi faceted process is involved. Primarily, the AFHDC MOADL technique involves IoT devices for the data acquisition process which collects fetal health related data. Besides, the AFHDC MOADL technique undergoes data pre processing in two ways such as K nearest neighbor (KNN) based data imputation and standard scaler. The AFHDC MOADL technique designs a mother optimization algorithm (MOA) to decrease the high dimensionality problem, which selects an optimal subset of features. A graph convolutional neural network (GCN) model is exploited for the fetal health classification. Finally, the root mean square propagation (RMSProp) optimizer can be utilized for optimum hyper parameter selection of the GCN technique.

We present a novel two-stage system for open set audio classification that integrates deep learning techniques with Schafer's soundscape theory. The two-stage architecture consists of: (1) a variational autoencoder (VAE) that first learns compressed representations of acoustic features and identifies distinctive sounds through reconstruction error analysis, and (2) a convolutional neural network (CNN) that then classifies these sounds into Schafer's theoretical categories (keynotes, sound signals, and soundmarks) using the learned features. This sequential approach allows the system to first understand what makes sounds unique before categorizing their role in the soundscape. The VAE effectively learns the latent representation of acoustic features from mel-spectrograms, while the CNN leverages these representations for classification. We evaluated the system on standard datasets including UrbanSound8K, ESC-50, URBAN-SED, and TUT urban acoustic scenes, achieving an average accuracy of 80.7% across all datasets. Additionally, we tested our approach on a dataset composed of binaural recordings collected in the university neighborhood of Pescara, Italy. Our research provides empirical validation of Schafer's theoretical framework through quantitative metrics, demonstrating strong alignment between computational classifications and theoretical descriptions. The proposed methodology advances soundscape analysis by objectively quantifying previously qualitative categories, enabling automated classification while maintaining theoretical fidelity, and creating a foundation for soundscape preservation policies that protect acoustic identity as a form of intangible cultural heritage."

Traditional deep learning models, such as Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and Transformer-based architectures, struggle to capture motion dynamics with long-term dependencies or noise in their inputs. To overcome these limitations, this work proposes an Evolved Parallel Recurrent Network (EPRN) with wavelet transforms for high-precision motion recognition. The EPRN framework utilizes parallel recurrent pathways to enhance temporal modeling, while wavelet-based feature extraction preserves the fine-grained details of motion at multiple spatial and temporal resolutions. The proposed method has been tested on benchmark sports motion data and compared with several common architectures, including LSTM, Gated Recurrent Units (GRUs), and Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) models. The experiments demonstrated that EPRN outperforms the other models, reducing the root mean squared error (RMSE) by 23.5% and increasing the structural similarity index (SSIM) by 12.7%, indicating its effectiveness in reconstructing motion trajectories with reduced error. Furthermore, the residual analysis confirms the result that EPRN has lower error variability and less sensitivity to abrupt motion transitions, thus being a more robust solution for real-world applications. The results, therefore, indicate that combining wavelet-transform-based feature extraction with recurrent deep learning significantly enhances the accuracy of motion recognition. The real-life applications of this work include sports performance analysis, real-time motion tracking, and rehabilitation systems. Future work will focus on multimodal data fusion (e.g., video plus wearable sensor data) and also lightweight EPRN variants suitable for real-time applications."

Therefore, there is a pressing need for an artificial intelligence-based model that can facilitate the diagnostic process and reduce errors. Existing networks often have high parameters, high gigaflops, and low accuracy. This research addresses this gap by proposing a transformer-based architecture. We developed a Swin transformer as an encoder to improve segmentation accuracy in medical images by leveraging deep feature extraction.

This capability enables the model to analyze the structural information of medical images at various levels, resulting in improved performance in segmenting complex regions. We also employed the dynamic attention enhancement block to further enhance the features extracted from the DFFB output. This block utilizes spatial and channel attention mechanisms to emphasize key areas in the images, thereby enhancing the model's overall accuracy.

These parameters need to be considered when cut-off values indicating the need for&#x0D; treatment or even surgery are established. The aim of present work is to study the relation of&#x0D; weight of the heart with age and weight of cadaver.&#x0D; Material and Methods: The study was performed in the Department of Anatomy, Shri Ram&#x0D; Murti Smarak Institute of Medical Sciences, Bareilly on 30 hearts from embalmed cadavers.&#x0D; The hearts were procured from the cadavers available in our department. The heart was&#x0D; thoroughly cleaned and measurements were taken.&#x0D; Results: The mean heart weight was 223.37 ± 57.78 g. Significant relationship between age of&#x0D; the cadaver and weight of the heart (p=0.0004), weight of cadaver and weight of heart&#x0D; (p=0.0001) was observed.&#x0D; Conclusion: The above study provides valuable data of the heart in our geographical location,&#x0D; which may be useful for cardiac surgeons and physicians."

Observational registries and early trial data indicate that TAVI is technically feasible in selected BAV anatomies, with device-success rates exceeding 90%. Nonetheless, bicuspid morphology is still technically demanding, with several possible pitfalls during transcatheter procedure and pre-procedural planning compared with tricuspid valve. The rates of moderate-to-severe paravalvular leak (PVL), permanent pacemaker implantation (PPI), and annular complications remain high, especially in the presence of extensive calcifications with raphe or tapered roots, underscoring the importance of meticulous multimodality imaging, dedicated sizing algorithms, and device-specific strategies. Long-term durability signals are encouraging but remain limited, underlining the need for prospective trials with extended follow-up. This review summarizes current knowledge on BAV anatomy and its management, exploring the available evidence supporting the role of transcatheter approach in this challenging and unique scenario."

OpenAlex,aortic stenosis,NATURAL HISTORY OF DEGENERATIVE AORTIC STENOSIS: A SYSTEMATIC REVIEW OF DISEASE COURSE AND PREDICTORS OF PROGRESSION,Gustavo Henrique de Moura Vardasca; Eduardo Coviello Mendes De Campos,10.56238/levv16n54-021,2025-11-05,LUMEN ET VIRTUS,"Introduction: Degenerative aortic stenosis (AS) is the most common valvular disease in aging populations, characterized by progressive calcification and narrowing of the aortic valve leading to left ventricular overload and heart failure. Understanding the natural history and predictors of disease progression is critical for optimizing timing of intervention and patient follow-up. Objective: The main objective of this systematic review was to evaluate the natural course of degenerative AS and identify clinical, echocardiographic, and biochemical predictors of progression. Secondary objectives included assessing annual changes in hemodynamic parameters, incidence of adverse cardiac outcomes, and impact of comorbidities on disease acceleration. Methods: A systematic search was performed in PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, Cochrane Library, LILACS, ClinicalTrials.gov, and ICTRP. Observational and interventional studies published in the last 5 years were included, with extension to 10 years if fewer than 10 eligible studies were available. Two independent reviewers screened titles and abstracts, extracted data, and assessed bias using RoB 2, ROBINS-I, or QUADAS-2 as appropriate. Certainty of evidence was graded using GRADE. Results and Discussion: 27 studies met inclusion criteria. Most cohorts demonstrated a nonlinear yet measurable progression of valve calcification and gradient increase over time. Elevated baseline aortic jet velocity, lipoprotein(a), and valvular calcium scores were consistent predictors of faster progression. The pooled annual increase in mean gradient ranged between 4–8 mmHg, and event-free survival declined significantly once peak velocity exceeded 4.0 m/s. Conclusion: Degenerative AS is a dynamic and heterogeneous condition influenced by metabolic, inflammatory, and structural mechanisms. Early identification of high-risk phenotypes may guide timely valve replacement and improve outcomes."

This study evaluated its performance following aortic valve replacement (AVR). Methods This single-center, prospective, observational study included patients aged ≥ 60 years with end-diastolic interventricular septum thickness (IVSd) ≥ 12 mm, who underwent hydroxydiphosphonate (HDP) bone scintigraphy after AVR between March 2021 and July 2024. The diagnostic performance of the RAISE Score assessed at 30-day follow-up and of simpler screening parameters for pathological HDP uptake (Perugini 1–3) were analyzed, along with their association with all-cause mortality and heart failure (HF) hospitalization. Results Among 131 included patients (median age 81 years; 64% male) pathological HDP uptake was found in 21 (16%), and 11 (8.4%) were diagnosed with ATTR-CM. A RAISE Score ≥ 2 demonstrated 76% sensitivity and 56% specificity for pathological bone scintigraphy, while a Score ≥ 3 showed 62% sensitivity and 78% specificity. The parameters age ≥ 83 years and the combination of carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS) and/or N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) ≥ 1,400 pg/mL performed similarly to the RAISE Score. Cardiac HDP uptake showed a strong trend toward HF hospitalization (HR [95%-CI]: 5.81 [0.93–36.20]; p = 0.060) and all-cause mortality (HR [95%-CI]: 3.27 [0.95–11.24]; p = 0.060). CTS and/or NT-proBNP ≥ 1,400 pg/mL was significantly associated with higher all-cause mortality (HR [95%-CI]: 3.92 [1.04–14.84]; p = 0.044), whereas the RAISE Score was not. Conclusion After AVR, the complex RAISE Score showed lower sensitivity than originally reported, while simpler parameters demonstrated comparable predictive value for ATTR-CM screening. Advanced age, CTS history and elevated NT-proBNP levels seem most valuable for identifying candidates for bone scintigraphy. Graphical Abstract A total of 131 patients aged ≥ 60 years, with an IVSd ≥ 12 mm and an AVR between March 2021 and July 2024, underwent standard diagnostic evaluation for ATTR-CM, including HDP bone scintigraphy. Pathological findings on bone scintigraphy (Perugini Score 1–3) were observed in 16% of the patients and were associated with worse clinical outcomes. The performance of the proposed RAISE Score [11], along with simplified or modified screening parameters, was evaluated in predicting both pathological scintigraphy results and clinical outcomes. ATTR-CM = transthyretin amyloidosis cardiomyopathy; AVR = aortic valve replacement; CTS = carpal tunnel syndrome; HDP = hydroxydiphosphonate; IVSd = interventricular septum thickness at end-diastole; NT-proBNP = N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide."
OpenAlex,aortic stenosis,Abstract 4365172: Aortic Valve Type and Stenosis Can Be Identified from Wearable-Recorded Seismocardiograms Using Machine-Learned Classifiers,Ethan Johnson; Michael Chinkers; Cynthia K. Rigsby; Joshua D. Robinson; Bradley D. Allen; Michael Markl,10.1161/circ.152.suppl_3.4365172,2025-11-03,Circulation,"Introduction: Patients with aortic valve disease, such as bicuspid aortic valve (BAV), require regular echocardiography or cardiovascular (CV) MRI to monitor for complications such as valve stenosis (AS) and aortic dilation. However, repeated imaging can be burdensome and incur substantial cost. Seismocardiogram (SCG) chest acceleration measurements recorded by inexpensive wearable devices can give indicators of valve-mediated hemodynamic changes, and as such may have supplemental value for such patients. This study investigated using SCG recordings coupled with a novel machine-learned (ML) classifier for SCG signals to identify patient valve type and presence/absence of aortic valve stenosis (AS). Hypothesis: We hypothesize that accurate classification of aortic valve type and AS can be made from SCG recordings with ML analysis compared to those from standard-of-care imaging (ground truth: cardiac MRI or echo). Methods: Healthy controls (no known CV disease) and aortic valve disease patients with tricuspid (TAV), BAV, or post-repair mechanical valve who received echo or MRI (clinical CV protocol) were enrolled for same-day 2-minute wearable SCG measurement (fig. A). Standard clinical assessment of valve/flow function was used (fig. B). Informed consent was given with IRB oversight. Clinical imaging used 4D flow MRI (1.5T,1-3mm3/30-40ms) or 2D Doppler echo (1.7-3.3MHz,12-40FPS). From clinical read of valve type/function, subjects were grouped in four classes: AS (any degree), BAV no-AS, TAV no-AS, mechanical. A hybrid network with convolutional neural network and multi-layer perceptron was trained (80/20 train/test) to classify patient valve status from SCG wavelet coefficients and demographics (age/sex/height/weight). Performance was evaluated by 20-fold cross-validation. Results: Enrolment was 129 subjects (97 MRI/32 echo): 46 controls (45.9±17.4y/20F) and 83 patients (22.4±15.8y/20F; 67 BAV/6 TAV/10 mech.). Classification area-under-curve (AUC) was high for all classes (AUC≥0.79). Across all ML validations, correct classification was achieved for ≥75% of subjects. Conclusion: This evaluation of a machine-learned classifier for SCG indicate potential utility in screening for valve-mediated hemodynamic changes, which reverberate through the chest and cause altered vibrations. The low cost and ease of acquisition for SCG would make it an appealing complement to imaging as the current standard for aortic valve abnormality screening and management."
OpenAlex,aortic stenosis,Abstract 4360927: Flow Matters: Prognostic Value of Sex-Specific Transvalvular Flow Rate in PLFLG Aortic Stenosis,Shani Dahan; Jacob P. Dal‐Bianco; C. Cabrera; Jonathan Passeri; Evin Yucel; Giselle Alexandra Suero-Abreu; Rachel Goldberg; Robert A. Levine; Judy Hung,10.1161/circ.152.suppl_3.4360927,2025-11-03,Circulation,"Background: Paradoxical low-flow, low-gradient (PLFLG) severe aortic stenosis (AS) is a high-risk phenotype characterized by low transvalvular gradients despite preserved left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF). While stroke volume index is conventionally used to define flow state, transvalvular flow rate (Q)—a measure incorporating both volume and ejection duration— offers a more physiologic assessment of forward flow. Given known sex-based differences in flow dynamics, we aimed to evaluate whether sex-specific Q thresholds are associated with adverse outcomes in PLFLG severe AS. Methods: We included 1,189 patients with adjudicated PLFLG severe AS (aortic valve area &lt;1.0 cm2, mean gradient &lt;40 mmHg, LVEF ≥50%, and Q ≤210 mL/sec) from an institutional echocardiographic database. Sex-specific Q thresholds were derived using the maximally selected rank statistic (≤150 mL/sec in males, ≤180 mL/sec in females). The primary outcome was a composite of all-cause mortality and aortic valve replacement (SAVR/TAVR). Results: In both sexes, lower Q was associated with a smaller aortic valve area, lower stroke volume index and reduced transvalvular gradients. Patients with low Q had significantly lower event-free survival, particularly among females, for both all-cause mortality and the composite outcome (log-rank p&lt;0.001)(Figure). In a multivariable analysis, low Q independently predicted adverse composite outcome in both males (HR 1.54, 95% CI: 1.10–2.16) and females (HR 1.39, 95% CI: 1.16–1.65). Conclusion: Sex-specific transvalvular flow rate thresholds are independently associated with adverse outcomes in paradoxical low-flow low-gradient severe aortic stenosis. These findings support the clinical utility of sex-specific Q, particularly in women, for refining risk stratification and guiding timely intervention."

Sehnert; Saumya Das,10.1161/circ.152.suppl_3.4369991,2025-11-03,Circulation,"Introduction: Heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) remains a leading cause of morbidity and mortality despite current therapies. The transverse aortic constriction (TAC) model in rodent mimics conditions such as hypertension and aortic stenosis and is widely used to study HFrEF. SGK1, a stress activated kinase, plays a key role in cardiac remodeling, fibrosis, and inflammation, critical in HF progression. Genetic inhibition of SGK1 by cardiac-specific expression of dominant-negative SGK1 in a TAC model is shown to be cardioprotective. Small molecule inhibitors of SGK1 (SGK1i) have not previously been evaluated in the TAC model. Research Questions: To evaluate the efficacy of novel, potent and selective SGK1i in a TAC model. Methods: Male, Sprague Dawley Rats, that had undergone TAC (20G suture) or sham surgery were dosed once a day via oral gavage from Day 3 until the end of the study on Day 56 with vehicle, SGK1i A, or SGK1i B. All animals had echocardiography on Days 21, 28, 42 and 56 to monitor disease progression. Tissues were stained by picrosirius red, and collagen was quantified using ImageJ software. Results: SGK1i ameliorated the progression to heart failure following TAC compared to the vehicle treated group, noted by a higher ejection fraction in the SGK1i groups compared to the vehicle group that is apparent even at day 21 (EF%: Sham 71.93, Vehicle 59.27, SGK1i A 70.66, SGK1i B 72.20) and is sustained through day 56 (EF%: Sham 70.50, Vehicle 49.87, SGK1i A 65.28, SGK1i B 64.22). In addition, parameters of LV structure were preserved in the SGK1i groups through the course of the study (LVESV mL Day 56: Sham 0.11, Vehicle 0.23, SGK1i A 0.13, SGK1i B 0.13). Morphometric measurements confirmed a significant increase in HW/BW in vehicle treated animals, which was mitigated by SGK1i. Hemodynamic studies confirmed the beneficial effects of SGK1i compared to vehicle treated animals (LVEDP, stroke work preserved, LV elastance better), with SGK1i groups not significantly different from sham animals. Finally, histological analysis demonstrated significantly less fibrosis and myofibrillar disarray in similar sections of SGK1i treated versus vehicle groups. Conclusions: SGK1i prevented the development of TAC pressure overload-induced decline in systolic function, had beneficial effects on cardiac hypertrophy, and reduced fibrosis. These data support the continued development of SGK1 inhibitors as promising novel therapeutics for HF."
OpenAlex,aortic stenosis,Abstract 4367976: Aortic Tortuosity Predicts Conduction Disturbances After TAVR via Aortic Angle and Membranous Septum Length: A Structural Equation Modeling Approach,Takamitsu Nakamura; Takeo Horikoshi; Miu Eguchi; Tsuyoshi Kobayashi; Manabu Uematsu; Toru Yoshizaki; Akira Sato,10.1161/circ.152.suppl_3.4367976,2025-11-03,Circulation,"Background: Transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) has broadened treatment options for elderly patients with severe aortic valve stenosis (AVS), including those with challenging vascular anatomy such as increased aortic tortuosity. We previously demonstrated that a higher aortic tortuosity index (ATI), defined as the ratio of aortic length (from the sinotubular junction to the terminal aorta) to body height measured by 3D-computed tomography, was associated with complete atrioventricular block (CAVB). However, the anatomical mechanisms linking ATI to conduction disturbances (CD) requiring pacemaker implantation (PMI) remain unclear. Purpose: To investigate whether anatomical variations—specifically, aortic angle and membranous septum (MS) length—mediate the association between ATI and CD requiring PMI after TAVR. Methods: We analyzed 198 consecutive patients with severe AVS who underwent TAVR. ATI, aortic angle, and MS length were quantified using pre-procedural 3D-CT imaging. CD requiring PMI within 30 days post-TAVR was observed in 20 patients (10.2%). Patients were stratified by median ATI (3.24), aortic angle (49°), and MS length (3.3 mm). Structural equation modeling (SEM) was applied to evaluate both direct and indirect effects of ATI on CD through aortic angle and MS length. Results: Patients with higher ATI (&gt;3.24) had a significantly greater incidence of CD requiring PMI than those with lower ATI (18.2% vs. 3.0%, p = 0.001). SEM demonstrated a significant direct effect of higher ATI on CD (path coefficient = 0.26, p &lt; 0.01), along with a significant indirect effect mediated by aortic angle and MS length (path coefficient = 0.15, p &lt; 0.05). Conclusion: Higher ATI is associated with increased risk of CD requiring PMI after TAVR, and this relationship is mediated by steeper aortic angle and shorter MS length. Aortic tortuosity may reflect age-related anatomical remodeling that predisposes patients to conduction injury during TAVR."

However, its narrow therapeutic index and susceptibility to drug interactions demand careful monitoring. We present a case of subacute mechanical aortic valve thrombosis likely precipitated by a warfarin–trazodone interaction. Case Presentation: A 58-year-old man with a history of bicuspid aortic stenosis requiring mechanical valve replacement—previously stable on chronic warfarin therapy (5 mg daily)—presented to the ED with three days of worsening dyspnea, cough, and upper back pain. Upon arrival, he was hypertensive, hypoxic, and in respiratory distress, exhibiting cold extremities, bilateral crackles, and an audible mechanical valve click. Labs revealed an INR of 1.3 (previously therapeutic), lactate 9.0 mmol/L, troponin 233 ng/L, and BNP 6812 pg/mL. CTA showed possible multifocal pneumonia. Initially, he was diagnosed with septic shock and ARDS, requiring vasopressors and BiPAP. Shortly after, he suffered a cardiac arrest, requiring intubation and vasopressor escalation. Transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) revealed a peak gradient of 3.7 m/s and mean gradient of 28 mmHg across the prosthetic valve. Urgent transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) showed severely restricted leaflet motion with torrential aortic regurgitation—highly suggestive of valve thrombosis. Due to prohibitive surgical risk, thrombolysis with alteplase (25 mg over 6 hours) was administered. Repeat TEE demonstrated improved leaflet motion (velocity 2.2 m/s, mean gradient 17.6 mmHg), LVEF of 25%, and new severe mitral regurgitation. He was stabilized on milrinone and extubated by hospital day five. Despite restarting warfarin—at doses up to 30 mg daily (three times his prior regimen)—therapeutic INR was not achieved until 10 days later. Further interrogation revealed, thirteen days prior to ED visit, he was started on trazodone 50 mg. No other interacting medications or hepatic dysfunction were identified. Trazodone was identified as the likely culprit and had been discontinued. His INR subsequently normalized. Discussion: Trazodone may reduce warfarin efficacy, leading to subtherapeutic INR and valve thrombosis in mechanical valve patients. While the exact mechanism is unclear, proposed theories include CYP2C9 induction, increased warfarin clearance, or protein-binding displacement. This case highlights the need for close INR monitoring when initiating trazodone in patients on warfarin."

He became unresponsive at home, prompting ED evaluation. Initial ECG was unremarkable with no ischemic changes. Troponins peaked at 100 ng/L. A transthoracic echocardiogram showed a normal left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) of 60–65% with no wall motion abnormalities. Elective cardiac catheterization was pursued to evaluate for coronary artery disease. Differential Diagnosis: Acute coronary syndrome (ACS), stroke, transient ischemic attack, seizure, GERD, and anxiety were considered. The normal ECG and preserved ejection fraction initially lowered suspicion for ACS, though rising troponins remained concerning. Treatment and Management: Coronary angiography revealed severe multivessel disease including diffuse left main coronary artery (LMCA) stenosis. Midway through the procedure, the patient developed chest pain and cardiac arrest due to pulseless electrical activity and received 25 minutes of cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) before acheiving return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC). Emergent veno-arterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (VA-ECMO) was initiated. A non-selective aortic root angiogram showed 100% LMCA occlusion and the patient underwent salvage percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) to the LMCA. A micro-axial pump was placed. He underwent rescue three-vessel coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) after stabilization. Outcome and Follow-Up: Despite aggressive intervention, the patient’s LVEF dropped to 14% with persistent cardiogenic shock. Serial echocardiograms showed no improvement. He was transitioned to comfort care and passed away 10 days after admission. Teaching Points: Total LMCA occlusion is a rare but catastrophic event, especially when iatrogenically precipitated during elective procedures. Non-invasive cardiac imaging (e.g., coronary CTA, calcium scoring) may help stratify risk before elective catheterization in patients with significant risk factors prior to initiating invasive procedures. Early recognition, effective CPR, mechanical circulatory support including ECMO and micro-axial pumps, and coordinated multi-disciplinary revascularization strategies are critical in such high-risk presentations."

Our meta-analysis of reconstructed time-to-event data aimed to compare percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) + transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) with coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) + surgical aortic valve replacement (SAVR) in AS with CAD. Methods: We systematically searched four databases (PubMed, Web of Science, Scopus, and Cochrane Library) up to March 2025. Individual patient data (IPD) reconstructed from time-to-event data were used to estimate hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for all-cause mortality. Dichotomous data were analyzed using risk ratios (RR) and with 95% confidence intervals (CI). Results: Our study included 15 studies with a total of 162,305 patients. PCI + TAVI significantly increased all-cause mortality compared to CABG + SAVR at 48 months (HR 1.29, 95% CI 1.23–1.35, P&lt;0.001), however, reduced the risk of in-hospital acute kidney injury (AKI) (RR 0.37, 95% CI 0.21–0.66, P=0.0007), and on short term: major adverse cardiac event (MACE) (RR 0.67, 95% CI 0.50–0.91, P=0.0093) and new-onset atrial fibrillation (AF) (RR 0.23, 95% CI 0.17–0.32, P&lt;0.0001). Moreover, PCI + TAVI was associated with an increased risk of myocardial infarction on long-term (RR 2.05, 95% CI 1.89–2.23, P&lt;0.0001). Conclusions: PCI + TAVI was associated with a significantly higher all-cause mortality and an increased long-term risk of MI compared to the CABG + SAVR. However, it significantly lowered the risk of in-hospital AKI, as well as the short-term incidence of new-onset AF and MACE. However, high quality prospective clinical trials are warranted to reassess current guidelines and refine treatment recommendations."

Although PCSK9 inhibitors effectively lower LDL-C and Lp(a)-lowering therapies are currently being developed, their combined effect on long-term ASCVD risk remains unclear. Research Question: In this study, we investigate the effects of genetically proxied inhibition of LPA and PCSK9, both individually and in combination, on ASCVD risk. Methods: We analyzed ~450,000 unrelated European ancestry participants from the UK Biobank. Two sets of complementary genetic instruments for LPA and PCSK9 were derived: (1) rare (minor allele frequency &lt; 0.001) predicted loss-of-function (pLoF) variants from whole-exome sequencing and (2) common cis-pQTLs (cis-acting protein quantitative trait loci) from imputed genotype arrays and the proteomics data. We used logistic regression models (separately for rare variants and common cis-pQTLs), adjusted for age, sex, and the first five genetic principal components, to estimate associations between these genetic instruments and ASCVD (a composite of coronary artery disease, myocardial infarction, and ischemic stroke) and all-cause mortality. Odds ratios (ORs) were reported per allele (for cis-pQTLs) or per carrier status (for rare variants). Mendelian randomization (MR) and other cardiovascular endpoints served as a sensitivity analysis. Results: Rare pLoF variants in PCSK9 (OR 0.74, p=0.0034) - as well as having a rare variant in either LPA or PCSK9 (OR 0.88, p=0.033) - were associated with lower ASCVD odds. In contrast, rare LPA variants alone showed no significant association with ASCVD (OR, 0.97; p = 0.67). For the common cis-pQTL instruments, lower genetically proxied LPA, PCSK9, or both were associated with significantly reduced ASCVD odds. Dual inhibition showed the greatest effect on reducing ASCVD risk (OR 0.82, p = 5.9 × 10^-34) and was also associated with reduced all-cause mortality (OR 0.95, p = 0.003). MR analyses supported these findings. Notable risk reduction was also found for endpoints including aortic stenosis, abdominal aortic aneurysm, and peripheral artery disease. Conclusion: In this large genetic analysis, combined inhibition of Lp(a) and PCSK9 was associated with the most pronounced reduction in ASCVD and mortality risk. These findings support the use of dual inhibition strategies in patients with elevated Lp(a) and LDL-C levels."

Evidence remains limited regarding early LV reverse remodeling post transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR), and its potential prognostic significance. Objectives. To assess (1) early LV reverse remodeling after TAVR; (2) predictors associated with reverse remodeling; (3) independent parameters associated with all-cause mortality. Methods: Transthoracic echocardiography was performed prior to TAVR and before discharge (5±4 days), in pts with severe symptomatic AS who underwent successful TAVR. Early LV reverse remodeling was assess by changes in LV ejection fraction (LVEF), interventricular septum wall (ISW) and posterior wall (PW) thickness, LV mass and diastolic function (E/A, left atrial diameter). Results: A total of 147 pts were included (age 78±5 yrs, 51% women). Over a median follow-up of 4 yrs (IQR 2 to 6 yrs), 12 pts (8%) died. Early post-TAVR there was significant improvement in LVEF (Image 1A) and regression of LV mass (Image 1B), with no significant early changes in diastolic parameters. Additionally, patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) showed greater increase in LVEF (t=2.3, p=0.024), while those with insulin-dependent diabetes showed greater regression in LV mass (t=2.5, p=0.012). Patients admitted in NYHA classes III-IV (73 pts, 50%) had greater improvement in both LVEF (t=-3.7, p&lt;0.001) and LV mass (t=2.5, p=0.011). Inadequate regression of ISW thickness was the strongest echocardiographic predictor of death (t=3.51, p=0.001); a lower, but significant effect was seen for PW (t=2.20, p=0.034). On multivariable analysis, CKD was the only independent parameter associated with all-cause mortality (OR=3.6, p=0.018, AUC=0.86)(Image 2). Conclusions. Patients with severe symptomatic AS experience LV reverse remodeling early after successful TAVR, as demonstrated by significant improvement in LVEF and regression of LV hypertrophy, especially in those with associated comorbidities (more advanced heart failure, insulin-dependent diabetes, CKD). Limited regression of LV hypertrophy and CKD were the strongest predictors of death."
OpenAlex,aortic stenosis,Abstract 4363253: Peri-Procedural Complications in Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement with Amyloidosis: Insight from the National Inpatient Sample 2016-2019,SaiPrithvi Parvataneni; Samy Ramzy; Ramtej Atluri,10.1161/circ.152.suppl_3.4363253,2025-11-03,Circulation,"Background: Transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) is rapidly becoming commonplace for severe symptomatic aortic stenosis (AS). As amyloidosis is becoming more frequently diagnosed, its association with aortic stenosis is coming to light. Cardiac amyloidosis has been historically associated with significant morbidity and mortality. Since many amyloidosis patients may have aortic stenosis, we aimed to assess outcomes in these individuals undergoing TAVR. Hypothesis: Patients with severe aortic stenosis (AS) and concurrent cardiac amyloidosis have worse clinical outcomes compared to those with severe AS alone. Given the increased prevalence of AS among patients with cardiac amyloidosis, would initiating tafamidis therapy prior to transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) or surgical aortic valve replacement (SAVR) improve outcomes in this population? Methods: We utilized the National Inpatient Sample from 2016-2019 to identify 217,575 hospitalized adults who underwent TAVR for AS. These hospitalizations were further stratified based on the presence of Amyloidosis. A multivariate regression model was used to adjust for confounders and analyze the variables. Results: Of those who underwent TAVR, 245 had amyloidosis. In-hospital mortality was higher in those with amyloidosis (3.1% vs 1.4%; p=0.001). Figure 1 shows the Forrest plot for multivariate analysis of periprocedural complications when adjusted for patient demographics, comorbidities, and hospital characteristics. When adjusted similarly, TAVR patients with amyloidosis had longer length of stay (LOS) by 1.2 days (p&lt;0.001) and had additional hospital costs (HC) of $43,160 (p&lt;0.001). Conclusion: TAVR patients who had amyloidosis had significantly worse outcomes in terms of AKI, cardiogenic shock, pneumonia, and atrial fibrillation. There was a trend towards worse outcomes for mortality, LOS, and HC, ventricular tachycardia, vascular complications, intubation, and atrial flutter but was not statistically significant. Some limitations of the study include lack of outpatient follow-up and lower statistical power due to small sample size of amyloidosis patients. Amyloidosis is typically underdiagnosed which could result in their misclassification. While inpatient outcomes seem to be worse in those with amyloidosis. Outpatient follow-up is needed to identify whether this population sees the long-term benefits from TAVR as those without amyloidosis."

Tsai; Todd B. Seto,10.1161/circ.152.suppl_3.4366505,2025-11-03,Circulation,"Introduction: Transcatheter percutaneous aortic valve replacement (TAVR) was FDA-approved as an alternative to surgical aortic valve replacement (SAVR) in high (2012), intermediate (2016) and low-risk (2019) pts with aortic stenosis (AS). We assessed the impact of TAVR on SAVR in a marjority-minority population in Hawaii. Methods: We used data from The Queen’s Medical Center STS/ACC TVT and STS Adult Cardiac Surgery registries to identify all pts who underwent TAVR or isolated SAVR from 2012-23. We compared demographics, comorbidities, pre-op risk of mortality (ROM) score, procedural data and in-hospital outcomes. We used SPSS for descriptive analyses and parametric and non-parametric tests as appropriate. Results: From 2012-23, 1,732 pts had aortic valve replacement (AVR): 489 (28.2%) isolated SAVR and 1,243 (71.8%) TAVR. Whites, Asians, and Native Hawaiians underwent 38.1%, 47.6%, and 11.3% of procedures respectively. Total volume decreased during COVID-19 pandemic (2020-2023), with TAVR also negatively impacted in 2018-19 by changes in staffing. From 2012-23, each additional year was associated with a 21.0% increase in the odds of receiving TAVR vs. SAVR (OR 1.2, p &lt; 0.001) - a corresponding 17.4% annual decrease in the odds of undergoing SAVR. The odds of receiving TAVR were 2.3 times higher during 2020-23 than before (p &lt; 0.001). SAVR ROM significantly decreased with time (r = -0.170, p&lt; 0.001). SAVR pts were younger (64.3 ± 12.5 vs. 79.1 ± 9.8 yrs, p &lt; .001) with lower ROM (2.2 ± 3.2 vs 5.4 ± 4.2, p &lt; .001) and more urgent procedures (14.7% vs 3.6%, p &lt; 0.001). Conversely, TAVR pts were more often women (39.3% vs 28.8%, p &lt; .001), with more diabetes (40.4% vs 31.3%, p &lt; 0.001), prior MI (19.2% vs 9.4%, p &lt; 0.001), and Medicaid/Medicare (84.8% vs 57.3%, p &lt; 0.001). In-hospital mortality was significantly lower in TAVR vs SAVR (1.6% vs 3.3%, p = 0.02). Overall, the total number of AVRs increased 30.9% between 2013-14 (116.5 procedures/yr) and 2022-23 (152.5 procedures/yr). Among pts &lt;65y, TAVR increased from 2013-14 to 2022-23 (9.1% vs. 42.6%) and SAVR decreased (90.9% vs.57.4%). Conclusion: With expanding indications for TAVR to include low-risk pts, annual TAVR volume has started to rebound following the COVID-19 pandemic. Despite fewer SAVRs, the annual number of all AVRs has substantially increased over the past decade, suggesting that TAVR has expanded access to AVRs to a broader range of pts."
OpenAlex,aortic stenosis,Abstract 4368321: A Rare Unusual Location Of A Papillary Fibroelastoma Originating From The Coumadin Ridge,Joud Fahed; Wongelawit Zerihun; D. S. Moodie; Kaushal Sigdel; Matthew R. Voss; Jennifer Doran,10.1161/circ.152.suppl_3.4368321,2025-11-03,Circulation,"Introduction: Primary heart tumors are rare, about 0.02% of cases with nearly half of all benign heart tumors being myxomas, while lipomas, papillary fibroelastomas and rhabdomyomas each make up about 10%. Fibroelastomas mostly originate on the mitral or aortic valves; less frequently on the tricuspid valve, ventricular or atrial septum. We present a unique case of a fibroelastoma originating from the coumadin ridge. Case Presentation: A 70-year-old woman was evaluated for a TAVR workup due to recent worsening of fatigue and dyspnea. Physical examination revealed grade three ejection systolic murmur with diminished S2 and severe aortic stenosis was noted on transthoracic echocardiogram. Cardiac CT showed an atrial mass. Transesophageal echocardiography demonstrated a heterogenous left atrial mass measuring 2.7 x 2.4 cm; originates from the tip of the Coumadin ridge, independently mobile with a dandelion-like gelatinous appearance, and did not take up Definity contrast (Figures 1, 2, 3). The patient underwent surgical aortic valve replacement with mass excision through the interatrial septum. Pathologic examination revealed 2.5 x 2.2 x 1.5 cm tan-white, villous, gelatinous soft tissue consistent with fiberoelastoma. Discussion: Fibroblastoma varies in size 2-70 mm, with over 80% on the heart valves and rarely in extravalvular cardiac structures. They may be symptomatic or discovered incidentally during evaluations for other conditions. Coumadin ridge (Left atrial ridge or fold) is an anatomical structure in the left atrium characterized by a prominent ridge of tissue between the left atrial appendage and the left superior pulmonary vein. The prevalence of this location is not explicitly documented in the literature, with only a few rare case reports describing such occurrences. They are typically pedunculated, mobile and often flutter or prolapse with cardiac motion and better detected on transesophageal echocardiography. Surgical intervention is recommended as per American Heart Association/ American Stroke Association guidelines for symptomatic tumors and &gt; 1 cm, or mobile and even asymptomatic due to the high risk of embolic events. Resection can be performed safely with native valve preservation and excellent long-term outcomes. Conclusion: This case emphasizes the need to consider uncommon tumor locations, like Coumadin ridge, and the critical role of comprehensive cardiac imaging while evaluation of intracardiac masses."

Chaliki,10.1161/circ.152.suppl_3.4364600,2025-11-03,Circulation,"Background: Patients with low gradient non-severe aortic stenosis (AS) at rest, in the context of reduced left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) (less than 50%), occasionally undergo dobutamine stress echocardiogram (DSE). However, limited data is available in the literature regarding the utility of DSE in this context. Methods: We conducted a retrospective study on patients with non-severe AS and LVEF less than 50% at rest who underwent DSE after Institutional Review Board approval. Retrospective data was extracted including rest and DSE parameters using an internal database. Only patients greater than 18 years old, who had an LVEF less than 50%, mean gradient (MG) less than 40 mmHg, and valve area greater than or equal to 1 cm 2 at rest were included in the study. Univariate and multivariate regression methods were used to identify which resting variables were associated with severe AS (MG greater than 40 mm Hg and valve area less than 1 cm 2 ) with DSE. Results: A total of 124 patients were included in the study. The mean age of patients was 78 years (±9) and 84% were male. The mean resting LVEF was 34% (±8%) while it was 40% (±12%) with DSE, mean stroke volume index at rest was 39 mL/m2 (±9) while it was 45 mL/m2 (±10) with DSE, MG at rest was 20 mmHg (±7) while it was 31 mmHg (±10) with DSE, and mean aortic valve area at rest was 1.27 cm 2 (±0.27) while it was 1.24 cm 2 (±0.29) with DSE. Of the 124 patients with non-severe AS at rest, 13 (10.5%) patients had severe AS with DSE. MG at rest was associated with severe AS (OR 1.3; 95% Cl: 1.1 - 1.5; p &lt; 0.001) in a multivariate logistic regression model after adjusting for age, sex, LVEF at rest, SV index at rest. Resting aortic valve mean gradient also showed the highest AUC in relation to likelihood of having severe AS (0.87) (figure 1). Conclusion: Our study indicated that DSE remains useful in identifying severe AS in certain patients (up to 10%) who exhibit non-severe AS at rest in the setting of reduced LVEF. Additionally, MG at rest is the most reliable parameter to determine those who may benefit from undergoing DSE. This is one of the first studies to our knowledge in the literature suggesting that DSE may still be useful in identifying severe AS patients despite non-severe AS (i.e., valve area greater than or equal to 1 cm 2 ) at rest with reduced LVEF. Further research is warranted to validate our findings."
OpenAlex,mitral regurgitation,Relative Survival Following TEER for Significant Mitral Regurgitation: A Contemporary Cohort Analysis,Marcel Almendárez; Isaac Pascual; Beatriz Nieves; Rut Álvarez‐Velasco; Alberto Alperi; Rebeca Lorca; Carmen de la Hoz; Víctor León; Luis Carlos Zamayoa; Ismael Rivera; Asier Herrero; Pablo Avanzas,10.3390/jcm14217825,2025-11-04,Journal of Clinical Medicine,"Background/Objectives: Mitral regurgitation (MR) is the most common valvular defect worldwide, with an increasing incidence attributed to the aging population. Transcatheter edge-to-edge repair (TEER) is a viable treatment, but its long-term survival impact, particularly across sexes, remains underexplored. We aimed to assess relative survival (RS) and excess mortality (EM) in patients undergoing TEER for significant MR, with a focus on sex-based differences. Methods: We analyzed 253 patients treated with TEER between October 2015 and August 2024, stratified by sex. Observed survival (OS) was calculated using the actuarial life table method; expected survival (ES) was estimated via the Ederer II method using matched population data. Primary endpoints were RS and EM; secondary endpoints included mortality differences by MR subtype. Results: OS at 1, 2, and 3 years was 88.9%, 87.4%, and 78.9%, respectively. EM peaked in the first year (7.8%) and declined thereafter. RS was lower than in the general population, primarily due to persistently reduced RS and elevated EM in men. Women achieved RS comparable to matched peers from year one. Sex was not an independent predictor of mortality (HR 0.88, 95% CI 0.38–2.03, p = 0.771). Conclusions: In patients with significant MR undergoing TEER, EM was concentrated in the first year. Women reached RS comparable to the general population, while men showed persistent excess mortality. Sex was not independently associated with survival after adjustment."
OpenAlex,mitral regurgitation,Abstract 4371805: False-Positive Aortic Intimal Flap on Echocardiography in an Asymptomatic Adolescent: Clinical Correlation Prevents Misdiagnosis,Tapendra Koirala; Siddharth Mahajan; Ryan Jones,10.1161/circ.152.suppl_3.4371805,2025-11-03,Circulation,"Background: Echocardiography is frequently used as a first-line imaging tool for aortic evaluation, but its susceptibility to artifacts can lead to false-positive findings. Aortic dissection is a critical diagnosis that requires confirmation with advanced imaging before initiating treatment. This case report highlights the clinical importance of clinical correlation and confirmatory imaging when echocardiographic findings suggest aortic dissection in the absence of symptoms. Case presentation: A 12-year-old male with a remote history of self-resolving dyspnea and previously noted trivial mitral regurgitation presented for routine follow-up. He was clinically well with no cardiac symptoms, normal vital signs, and an unremarkable physical exam. Echocardiography revealed an apparent intimal flap (Figure 1-3) in the proximal ascending aorta, raising concern for aortic dissection. There was no associated turbulent flow, pericardial effusion, or signs of hemodynamic compromise. Due to the gravity of potential dissection, a contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) aortogram was performed. CT imaging showed normal aortic anatomy with no evidence of dissection, intimal flap, aneurysm, or other structural abnormalities. Retrospective echocardiographic image review suggested the finding was likely an artifact, possibly due to reverberation or suboptimal transducer angulation. A repeat echocardiogram three months later showed a persistent but less prominent artifact. No intervention was required, and the patient remained asymptomatic. Conclusion: This case demonstrates that echocardiographic artifacts can mimic life-threatening conditions such as aortic dissection. CT aortography remains the gold standard in confirming aortic pathology, particularly in cases where echocardiographic findings are incongruent with the clinical presentation. Incorporating clinical judgment and confirmatory imaging prevents unnecessary anxiety, testing, and interventions, especially in pediatric patients."

Individual patient and procedural factors such as age, comorbidities, and aortic manipulation influence stroke risk. This meta-analysis aims to evaluate predictors of stroke risk in patients undergoing CABG. Methods: A comprehensive search was conducted across major databases to identify studies assessing the predictive factors for stroke risk in patients undergoing CABG. Odds ratios (OR) with 95% CIs were pooled using a random effects model, and all analyses were performed using R studio version 4.4.3. Results: A total of 16 studies comprising 123,535 patients were included. Atrial fibrillation, female sex, diabetes mellitus, heart failure, hypertension, cardiovascular disease, peripheral arterial disease, renal failure, carotid bruits, and previous stroke were all significantly associated with an increased risk of stroke, with odds ratios (ORs) ranging from 1.33 to 4.94. Previous strokes (OR: 3.08; 95% CI: 1.98, 4.80) and carotid bruits (OR: 4.94; 95% CI: 2.49, 9.85) showed the strongest associations. However, no significant associations were observed for angina (OR: 1.19; 95% CI: 0.59,2.39), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (OR: 1.41; 95% CI: 0.75, 2.63), myocardial infarction (OR: 1.19; 95% CI: 0.76, 1.87), mitral regurgitation (OR: 1.18; 95% CI: 0.76, 1.84), or previous thoracic surgery (OR: 1.26; 95% CI: 0.59, 2.69). Despite varying degrees of heterogeneity across outcomes, leave-one-out analyses consistently confirmed the robustness of these results, indicating that no individual study significantly altered the overall findings. Conclusion: This meta-analysis identifies key predictors of stroke following CABG, with previous strokes and carotid bruits showing the strongest associations. Recognizing these risk factors enables targeted prevention and management strategies, potentially reducing stroke incidence and improving patient outcomes."

Rehfeldt,10.1161/circ.152.suppl_3.4343741,2025-11-03,Circulation,"A 44-year-old recent heart transplant recipient supported by VA-ECMO presented to the operating room (OR) for left ventricular (LV) vent removal. She had a history of double-inlet LV with right atrioventricular valve atresia and transposition of great arteries, status post fenestrated Fontan complicated by end-stage heart failure. Three days ago, she underwent a fourth sternotomy and orthotopic heart transplant complicated by coagulopathy and severe bi-ventricular dysfunction necessitating initiation of central VA-ECMO. Due to massive blood product transfusion and ventricular dilatation, an apical LV vent was inserted. Postoperatively the arterial line waveform remained non-pulsatile. The patient was brought to the OR for mediastinal debridement and removal of the LV vent for the purpose of assessing ventricular function and improving arterial pulsatility. Pulse pressure remained negligible at an ECMO flow of 4.5 L/min. Transeosphageal echocardiography (TEE) demonstrated extensive thrombosis of the aortic root, particularly involving the right and non-coronary sinuses (Fig 1a). The aortic valve (AV) did not open. Patency of the left main coronary ostium was evident by color Doppler (Fig 1b) although no right coronary artery (RCA) flow could be visualized. The tip of LV vent was seen tenting the anterior leaflet of mitral valve (MV) causing significant regurgitation. (Fig. 2a-d) After vent removal, LV contraction gradually increased and the AV began to open. This progressively dislodged thrombus from the aortic root. At the conclusion of imaging, there was a highly mobile, bi-lobed thrombus attached to the sinotubular junction (Fig 1c-d). Right ventricular (RV) function remained severely reduced. Moderate mitral regurgitation persisted, arising from A2 leaflet prolapse. This patient subsequently underwent transcatheter thrombectomy and aspiration of the aortic root with cerebral protection device. Coronary angiogram confirmed proximal RCA occlusion (Fig. 3). Attempts to remove RCA thrombus were only partially successful. She eventually required a second heart transplant due to RV infarction. Discussion: This case illustrates a TEE-detected complication of excessive LV venting during VA-ECMO support, namely aortic root thrombosis associated with lack of AV opening. TEE also demonstrated the associated complications of RCA occlusion and iatrogenic mitral valve injury. Unfortunately, these complications were not detected soon enough to avoid RV infarction."

Leonardo Rodriguez; Anand Mehta; Shinya Unai; Ben Alencherry,10.1161/circ.152.suppl_3.4369952,2025-11-03,Circulation,"A 56-year-old woman presented to her primary care physician with a 1-year history of facial flushing and short-lived paroxysms of chest pain. An electrocardiogram was performed which showed normal sinus rhythm and p-mitrale. Transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) revealed normal left ventricle (LV) size and function, moderate to severe aortic regurgitation, moderate mitral regurgitation (MR), moderate tricuspid regurgitation (TR), and mild pulmonic regurgitation. An agitated saline study suggested an intrapulmonary shunt (positive after &gt;10 beats). Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (CMR) confirmed these findings but reclassified the TR and MR as severe and the LV as dilated. CMR also incidentally noted numerous complex hepatic masses, largest measuring 6cm. Dedicated liver MRI confirmed this, and biopsy showed strong, diffusely positive staining for neuroendocrine markers, consistent with a well-differentiated neuroendocrine tumor (carcinoid). Positron Emission Tomography/Computed Tomography (PET/CT) revealed high uptake in the pancreatic head, cecum, and right scapula in addition to known liver lesions. Treatment with octreotide was initiated after obtaining a baseline serum serotonin level 1489 ng/mL (normal 50-220 ng/mL). The patient reported mild symptoms and NT Pro BNP was elevated at 265 pg/mL (normal &lt;125 pg/mL). Given LV dilation, severe valve disease, and likely concealed symptoms, cardiac surgery consultation was pursued. Transesophageal echocardiogram with moderate sedation was deferred due to risk of carcinoid crisis. In coordination with oncology, surgery was scheduled after initiating octreotide. Preoperative octreotide infusion was administered, and she underwent four-valve replacement with bioprostheses. Intraoperatively, all four valves had thickened, retracted leaflets; a 7 mm patent foramen ovale (PFO) was also identified and closed. Pathology of valve specimens showed extracellular plaque deposition and bland spindle cells, consistent with carcinoid valve disease. The patient had an uneventful postoperative course. Carcinoid heart disease is a rare, morbid manifestation of neuroendocrine tumors, mediated by elevated serotonin and other vasoactive substances causing fibrotic valve dysfunction. It usually affects right-sided valves, but left-sided involvement may occur with intracardiac shunt or pulmonary metastases. This case illustrates the multidisciplinary diagnosis and management of an exceedingly rare form of carcinoid heart disease."

Kevin Heist; Dan Blendea,10.1161/circ.152.suppl_3.4367285,2025-11-03,Circulation,"Background: Functional mitral regurgitation (FMR), both atrial (AFMR) and ventricular (VFMR), results from multiple interacting mechanisms including atrial and ventricular remodeling, changes in mitral annular geometry, leaflet tethering, and heart rate variability. The relative contribution of each factor to FMR severity remains unclear. Purpose: We aimed to assess the short-term effect of a one-time change (shock) in each FMR determinant on the evolution of MR severity and other variables. Additionally, we quantified how much of the variance in MR severity is explained by shocks to its known etiological factors. Methods: Transthoracic echocardiography was used to evaluate FMR in 26 patients, yielding 810 systolic timestamps (583 for the AFMR group and 227 for the VFMR group, 30 fps). For each frame, we recorded RR interval, MR jet area, LA and LV volumes, MV annular diameter, and tenting height. We estimated vector autoregression (VAR) models separately in AFMR and VFMR groups, followed by Forecast Error Variance Decomposition (FEVD) up to step 8 (~264 msec). The FEVD at step 8 quantified the percent of MR variance attributable to each variable. To assess statistical significance, we repeated VARs for each variable pair and visually evaluated impulse response function (IRF) plots: a variable was considered significant if its IRF 95% CI excluded 0. Results: FEVD revealed high self-persistence: most variables primarily explained their own future values. LV volume emerged as a key upstream influencer across the network, while MR area had limited predictive power (Figure 1A, C). In AFMR, MR area was largely self-driven (92.7%) with modest contributions from LV volume (3.2%) and tenting height (2.4%) (Figure 1B). IRF plots showed that only MR area, LA volume, and LV volume had statistically significant effects on MR area (Figure 2). In VFMR, MR area remained self-driven (83.9%), but external contributions were stronger: RR (6.3%), tenting height (3.6%), and MV annulus (3.1%) (Figure 1D). Only MR area, tenting height, and LV volume showed significant IRF effects (Figure 3). Conclusions: In AFMR, short-term MR variability appears driven by LA and LV volume, though LV volume shows a stronger effect, possibly due to transient ventricular changes being more detectable than slow atrial remodeling. In VFMR, MR variability is shaped primarily by tenting height and LV volume, reinforcing the role of subvalvular tethering and dynamic loading in VFMR pathophysiology."

Aim: To characterize the types, clinical correlates, and long-term outcomes of POAF in patients undergoing mitral valve surgery for degenerative MR. Methods: Patients with MVP and moderate or severe degenerative MR who underwent mitral valve surgery between 2010-2024 at Karolinska University Hospital were included. Data were extracted from electronic medical records, ECGs, and echocardiograms. Comprehensive outcome tracking was performed with no patients lost to follow-up. Patients were excluded if they had prior atrial fibrillation/flutter, mitral stenosis, rheumatic mitral valve disease, endocarditis, or prior mitral valve surgery. Cox regression was adjusted for age, sex, BMI, hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, diabetes, hemoglobin, prior PCI or CABG, eGFR, NYHA class, pulmonary hypertension, LVEF, and mitral valve repair vs replacement. Results: Among 786 patients, 49.7% developed POAF, 82.4% during the index hospitalization. Most events were paroxysmal 89.5%, persistent 6.1%, and permanent 4.3%. Patients with POAF were older, more often in NYHA class III-IV, had lower LVEF and elevated pulmonary artery systolic pressures compared to those without POAF. No differences were observed in preoperative left atrial volume index, MR severity, MVP etiology or anticoagulation use between the groups. Patients with POAF were less likely to have undergone mitral valve repair, had longer cardiopulmonary bypass and cross-clamp time, and more frequently underwent concomitant CABG or tricuspid valve intervention. During a median follow-up time of 4.4 years, POAF was independently associated with increased risk of heart failure hospitalization, permanent pacemaker implantation and mitral valve reoperation, Figure. There were no significant associations with endocarditis, stroke or all-cause mortality. Conclusions: POAF occurred in nearly half of all patients undergoing mitral valve surgery for degenerative MR, most commonly in paroxysmal form during the index hospitalization. POAF was associated with worse preoperative status, more complex surgical procedures, and significantly increased long-term risk of heart failure, pacemaker implantation and reoperation. These findings highlight the need for strategies to prevent and manage POAF in this high-risk population."

Pressman,10.1161/circ.152.suppl_3.4362147,2025-11-03,Circulation,"Background: Mitral annular calcification (MAC) is a chronic inflammatory condition that is associated with future cardiovascular events. There is limited data that explores how MAC impacts outcomes in patients with pre-existing mitral regurgitation (MR). Methods: This is a retrospective analysis using the TriNetX US Collaborative Network database. A database of hospitalized patients ≥50 years was queried using ICD-10 and TriNetX curated codes. We identified those given a discharge diagnosis of MR between 2020-2023, excluding patients with rheumatic mitral valve disease or ESRD. We then stratified by presence/absence of a new diagnosis of MAC (occurring after MR diagnosis). Cohorts were balanced for socio-demographics, body mass index, and common comorbidities including hypertension, hyperlipidemia, diabetes, and tobacco use, with a standard difference of &lt;0.1 considered to indicate adequate balancing. Hazard ratios were calculated for outcomes, with a P&lt;0.05 considered significant. Results: Our query yielded 11,462 patients in the MAC group and 450,474 patients in the no MAC group. Following propensity matching, each group had 11,462 patients. All targeted variables were adequately balanced. Average age was similar in both the MAC and no MAC groups (76 years vs 75.8 years). The populations were majority white (80.3% vs 81.2%) and female (56.8% vs 57.0%). BMI was also similar (29.2 vs 28.7). Among patients with pre-existing MR, subsequently diagnosed MAC was associated with increased 1-year risk of hospitalization (HR 1.22, 95%CI 1.180-1.262, p&lt;0.0001), ICU admission (HR 1.38, 95%CI 1.250-1.524, p&lt;0.0001), ischemic heart disease (HR 1.446, 95%CI 1.289-1.622, p&lt;0.0001), new onset HFpEF (HR 1.286, 95%CI 1.160-1.425, p&lt;0.0001), cerebrovascular disease (HR 1.341, 95%CI 1.190-1.512, p&lt;0.0001), prosthetic valve replacement (HR 2.126, 95%CI 1.786-2.530, p&lt;0.0001), and mitral stenosis (HR 3.16, 95%CI 2.490-5.234, p&lt;0.0001). There was not a significant difference between groups for HFrEF (HR 0.955, p=0.4377), cardiogenic shock (HR 1.188, p=0.1098), or cardiac arrest (HR 1.155, p=0.1979). Conclusions: In patients with previously diagnosed MR, a subsequent diagnosis of MAC was associated with increased 1-year risk of hospitalization, new onset ischemic heart disease or HFpEF, and a variety of other adverse cardiovascular outcomes."
OpenAlex,mitral regurgitation,Abstract 4357473: Prevalence and Recovery of Arrhythmia-Induced Cardiomyopathy in Patients with Newly Diagnosed Heart Failure Using a Wearable Defibrillator: A Real-World Cohort Study,Joerg Yogarajah; Jana Dannenbaum; A. Halim; M. Mensch; Malte Kuniss; Thomas Neumann; Andreas Rieth; Julia Treiber; Samuel Sossalla; Andreas Hain,10.1161/circ.152.suppl_3.4357473,2025-11-03,Circulation,"Background: Arrhythmia-induced cardiomyopathy (AIC) is a potentially reversible cause of heart failure triggered by sustained arrhythmias. Its true real-world prevalence and clinical recognition remain limited. This study aimed to assess the frequency, predictors, and outcomes of AIC in patients with newly diagnosed left ventricular systolic dysfunction (LVSD) and concurrent arrhythmia, undergoing rhythm control while protected by a wearable cardioverter-defibrillator (WCD). Methods: We analyzed 780 patients treated with a WCD between 2017 and 2023. Among them, patients with newly diagnosed idiopathic LVSD (LVEF &lt;35%) and arrhythmias (atrial fibrillation, flutter, or ventricular ectopy &gt;20%) were identified. Diagnostic workup included echocardiography, cardiac MRI, and ischemia testing or coronary angiography. Patients underwent rhythm control (cardioversion, antiarrhythmic drugs, and/or catheter ablation) and were followed up to 6 months. AIC was defined as LVEF improvement &gt;15% in patients with restored sinus rhythm. Results: Among 780 patients treated with a WCD, 142 (18.2%) had first diagnosis of LVSD in the presence of arrhythmia (Figure 1). Of these, 68 (47.9%) had an identifiable etiology (Figure 2). The remaining 74 (52.1%) with idiopathic LVSD were analyzed. At mean follow-up of 133 days (4.5 months), 20 (27%) of 74 patients remained in arrhythmia (non-responders). Among 54 responders with restored sinus rhythm, 32 (59.3%) fulfilled AIC criteria; 22 (40.7%) were non-AIC. LVEF improved from 28% to 43% in AIC vs. 24% to 32% in non-AIC. Full recovery (LVEF &gt;50%) was achieved in 56.3% of AIC patients during follow-up. Atrial fibrillation was most common (81.3% AIC vs. 95.5% non-AIC), followed by flutter; ventricular ectopy occurred in 9.4% of AIC cases. Heart failure therapy was comparable. Non-AIC patients showed larger LVEDD/LVESD, lower heart rates, more mitral regurgitation, and more frequent late gadolinium enhancement on MRI. No appropriate WCD shocks occurred. ICDs were implanted in 36.4% of non-AIC vs. 3.1% of AIC patients (p=0.001). No deaths were reported. LVEF &lt;25% predicted lack of full recovery (p=0.04). Conclusions: AIC is a common and reversible form of LVSD in patients with arrhythmia and newly diagnosed idiopathic cardiomyopathy. Early rhythm control supported by WCD, combined with detailed diagnostics including cardiac MRI and ischemia testing, enables identification of reversible dysfunction and may reduce unnecessary ICD implantation."

Peterson; John D. Newell; Eric A. Hoffman; Barry A. Borlaug,10.1161/circ.152.suppl_3.4369639,2025-11-03,Circulation,"Introduction: Heart failure (HF) affects interstitial lung structure and function. AI-assisted quantitative computed tomography (qCT) offers possibility of objective assesment of lung structure, allowing to detect the presence and the severity of HF. Hypothesis: Can automated qCT analysis discriminate HF from controls and identify tissue structures most linked to degree of congestion ? Methods: Subjects underwent right heart catheterization (RHC), native CT chest imaging (full inspiration/expiration) by Naeotom-α photon-counting CT scanner (Siemens), lab testing, echocardiography. Automated AI-based analysis (VIDA Diagnostics) was employed to evaluate lung volumes, densities and tissue texture. Image series were used in mediastinal and lung window reconstruction with slice thickness 0,8 mm and increments 0,5 mm. Results: 186 HF patients (85% HFrEF, NYHA 2.8±0.5, 58 y, 80% males, NTproBNP 4491 pg/ml, LVEF 26%) and 43 controls of similar sex and BMI were analyzed; both groups free of primary lung disease. In HF, 85 % had PH (mPAP&gt;20mmHg). HF patients had comparable inspiratory lung volume, reduced air volume and increased lung tissue volume, compared to controls. Mean lung density (-782±50 vs -832±25 HU, p&lt;0.0001), density variability and estimated lung fluid content (21.3 vs 16.7%, p&lt;0.0001) were all higher in HF compared to controls. Across various density cut-offs, the most notable difference was at lung tissue density &lt; -856 HU at inspiration. Lung tissue density corelated with mean PA pressure (r=0.49, p&lt;0.0001), and less with pulmonary vascular resistance (r=0.21, p=0.006). Insp/exp scan analysis showed no difference in air trapping, but reduced lung tissue compliance (Jacobian strain: 1.8±0.4 vs 1.6±0.3, p=0.0005) in HF. Lung texture analysis showed increased ground-glass opacity (GGO) mass (48.8 g vs 9.1 g; p &lt; 0.001), reticulation (42.2 g vs. 8.4 g; p &lt; 0.001) and consolidation (0.5 g vs 0.2 g; p=0.0011) in HF compared to controls, with no difference in honeycombing. GGO mass correlated strongly with pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (PCWP) (r=0.48, p&lt;0.001) and mitral regurgitation grade (r=0.28,&lt;0.0001), but not with inflammation (hsCRP, IL6, WBC), smoking exposure or oncotic pressure. Conclusions: qCT distinguished HF patients from controls by increased lung tissue mass, reduced air volume, increased lung density and increased mass of GGO and reticulation. GGO mass in HF strongly reflects increased hydrostatic pressure, but not inflammation."

Transcatheter mitral valve-in-valve (ViV) implantation is a challenging but increasingly viable option, especially in high-risk patients. We report a complex mitral ViV procedure in a 78-year-old woman with multiple comorbidities and severe mitral bioprosthetic valve failure. Case Report: A 78-year-old woman with a history of RHD and surgical MVR 12 years prior was readmitted for progressive dyspnea (NYHA III) and pulmonary edema despite high-dose diuretics. Past history included hypertension, atrial fibrillation, chronic kidney disease (Cr=3.0 mg/dL), and VVi pacemaker. Catheterization revealed severe pulmonary venocapillary hypertension (27 mmHg), moderate pulmonary artery hypertension (59×22 [35] mmHg), and elevated right atrial pressure (19 mmHg). Transesophageal echo showed severe regurgitation of a severely calcified mitral bioprosthesis (external effective annulus=26 mm). Left ventricle (LV) outflow tract obstruction risk was low (area: 292 mm 2 ). STS-PROM mortality for surgical reintervention was 8.2%. The heart team opted for mitral ViV with a Sapien Ultra 29mm valve. Using a Swartz 8F sheath and BRK needle, a posteroinferior transseptal puncture was performed, and a 0.035"" guidewire was advanced to the LV and exchanged for a pigtail catheter. A Safari extra-support guide was then positioned in the LV, and a second stiff wire was placed in the superior left pulmonary vein. Due to difficulty advancing the prosthesis, sequential septal dilations were performed with 8.0 mm and 10.0 mm balloons. The Sapien Ultra was then advanced across the septum but could not cross the stenotic surgical valve. The wire was repositioned from the pulmonary vein to the LV, and valvuloplasty was done with a 20×30 mm AltoSa balloon. The valve was then successfully navigated and implanted under rapid pacing with nominal deployment. Post-procedure 3D echo confirmed good valve dynamics with a mean gradient of 2 mmHg and visualization of a ruptured surgical leaflet. At 4-month follow-up, the patient remains in NYHA class I, with no adverse events. Conclusion: This case illustrates the feasibility of mitral ViV in RHD with severe prosthetic calcification. Preprocedural planning, balloon preparation, and wire strategy were critical for success. The Sapien Ultra prosthesis provided excellent hemodynamic results in a high-risk patient."

While intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP) therapy is recommended as a bridge to surgery in select cases, evidence supporting its clinical utility in this setting remains limited. Methods: We conducted a retrospective cohort study using the Nationwide Readmissions Database (NRD) from 2016 to 2020. Adult patients undergoing surgical correction for acute MR were identified using ICD-10-CM/PCS codes. Propensity score matching was performed to compare outcomes between patients who received preoperative IABP and those who did not. The primary outcome was in-hospital mortality. Secondary outcomes included in-hospital complications, 30- , 90-, and 180-day readmissions, and resource utilization. Results: Of 33,644 hospitalizations for surgical repair of acute MR, 1,691 (5.0%) received preoperative IABP. After 1:1 matching, 918 patient pairs were analyzed. IABP use was associated with significantly lower in-hospital mortality (2.8% vs. 6.0%, p &lt; 0.001), cardiogenic shock (12.9% vs. 18%, p &lt; 0.001), myocardial infarction (1.7% vs. 9.9%, p &lt; 0.001), MACCE (16.4% vs. 22.4%, p &lt; 0.001), acute kidney injury (28.5% vs. 51.0%, p &lt; 0.001), stroke (0.2% vs. 2.6%, p &lt; 0.001), and need for endotracheal intubation (5.5% vs. 20.2%, p &lt; 0.001). The IABP group had a shorter median hospital stay (10 vs. 13 days, p &lt; 0.001), but higher hospitalization costs ($83,118 vs. $49,343, p &lt; 0.001). Thirty-day readmission was significantly lower in the IABP group (8.3% vs. 11.7%, p = 0.02), with no differences at 90 or 180 days. Conclusion: In patients undergoing surgery for acute MR, preoperative IABP use was associated with improved in-hospital outcomes and lower 30-day readmission rates, despite higher resource utilization. These findings support a potential therapeutic role for IABP as a bridging strategy in this high-risk population and warrant validation through prospective studies."

Grau; Habib Jabagi; Paul Burns; Yonathan Litwok; Brian Sumner; Ashish Rai; Ernest S. Chang; Howard Goldschmidt; Suneet Mittal; Rajiv Tayal,10.1161/circ.152.suppl_3.4362838,2025-11-03,Circulation,"Description of Case: An 81-year old-female with paroxysmal atrial fibrillation (AF) and severe aortic stenosis presented with AF with rapid ventricular response and volume overload. She had undergone an uncomplicated transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) 14 days prior with post procedure echocardiogram (TTE) demonstrating ejection fraction greater than 70%, a mean gradient across the TAVR valve of 11 mmHg, and mild mitral regurgitation (MR). Management included diuresis, rate control, and a failed cardioversion. TEE at the time of cardioversion, while tachycardic, demonstrated systolic anterior motion of the mitral valve (SAM) but no gradient across the aortic valve. She underwent atrioventricular (AV) junction ablation and placement of a left bundle branch area pacing (LBBAP) lead. Immediately post-procedure, she developed acute dyspnea and a new systolic murmur. Right heart catheterization revealed pulmonary artery pressure 90/30 mmHg and wedge pressure 39 mmHg with a prominent v-wave, and cardiac index of 1.6 L/min/m 2 . A simultaneous LV-AO pressure tracing demonstrated a gradient of 52 mmHg. TTE revealed a late-peaking doppler signal across the aortic valve with a peak velocity of 4 m/s, SAM, and severe MR. An Impella CP was placed for circulatory support. TTE revealed the LBBAP lead was adjacent to a 1.8 cm basal septal bulge (Figure 1). The next day, a transvenous RV apical pacing lead was placed, and simulatenous LV-AO pressure tracing revealed a peak-to-peak gradient of 45 mmHg during LBBAP, which immediately decreased to 5 mmHg with RV apical pacing (Figure 2). This led to a decrease in MR from severe to mild. Given the dynamic nature of the obstruction, alcohol septal ablation was performed. The Impella CP was removed and vasopressors were weaned. A permanent RV apical lead was added and used for pacing. The patient remained hemodynamically stable and was discharged to rehabilitation. Discussion: This case highlights a report of dynamic left ventricular outflow tract (LVOT) obstruction precipitated by LBBAP in a patient post-TAVR who previously did not have evidence of LVOT obstruction. Previously, RV apical pacing was a seldom used treatment for obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. Changing the pacing location to RV apical pacing instantly resolved the LVOT obstruction highlighting the need to be wary of pacing strategies in post TAVR patients who may have septal hypertrophy and may be at risk of LVOT obstruction secondary to LBBAP."

Early diagnosis and surgical repair are vital due to rupture, embolization, and hemodynamic compromise risks. We present a case of pseudoaneurysm formation following bicuspid aortic valve (BAV) endocarditis and root reconstruction. Case Summary: A 70-year-old male with chronic back pain and benign prostatic hyperplasia presented with acute-on-chronic back pain, fever, and signs of sepsis. Blood cultures grew oxacillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus. Initial transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) showed reduced ejection fraction (EF 30–35%), severely calcified BAV with moderate insufficiency, but no vegetations. Coronary angiography revealed non-obstructive disease. He was treated with IV antibiotics and discharged to inpatient rehabilitation. Soon after, he re-presented with neurological deficits. Imaging revealed a right middle cerebral artery infarct and left occipital hemorrhage, suspected due to septic emboli or ruptured mycotic aneurysm. Repeat TEE showed severe aortic regurgitation, leaflet perforation, and perivalvular abscess. Emergent surgery included aortic valve replacement, abscess debridement, pericardial patch aortic root reconstruction, and anterior mitral leaflet repair. Pathology confirmed active endocarditis with vegetations and abscesses. Postoperative TEE showed a stable prosthesis and improved EF (40–45%). He completed antibiotics and was discharged home. TEE done at a routine follow-up three years later revealed an echogenic sinus of Valsalva structure with a &gt;1.2 cm wide neck communicating with the ascending aorta—findings consistent with pseudoaneurysm from pericardial patch dehiscence. Redo sternotomy and a modified Bentall procedure were performed, including explantation of the bioprosthesis, root and valve replacement with a bioprosthetic conduit, ascending aorta replacement, and coronary reimplantation. The procedure was successful with preserved cardiac function and clinical improvement. Discussion: This case illustrates the severe sequelae of BAV endocarditis, including late pseudoaneurysm formation post-reconstruction. Contributing factors may include persistent infection, mechanical stress, and impaired healing. Given the significant mortality risk of rupture, early detection, prompt surgical intervention, and ongoing multidisciplinary surveillance are essential for optimal management."
OpenAlex,mitral regurgitation,Abstract 4351394: Severe Aortic Stenosis Due to Libman-Sacks Endocarditis as the First Manifestation of SLE in a Young Male,Said Abdelrahman; Mahmoud Okour; Rania Aldeek; Mo’men Aldalal’ah; Elise F. Nassif; Ahmad Okour,10.1161/circ.152.suppl_3.4351394,2025-11-03,Circulation,"Background: Libman-Sacks endocarditis (LSE) is a rare, non-infective form of endocarditis, often associated with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and antiphospholipid syndrome (APS). It is characterized by sterile, verrucous vegetations that typically affect the mitral and aortic valves. While mitral regurgitation and aortic regurgitation are more frequently reported, severe aortic stenosis (AS) as the primary manifestation of LSE is exceedingly rare, with a reported prevalence of only 1.1% among affected patients. Even more unusual is its presentation as the first sign of undiagnosed SLE in a male patient, given the strong female predominance of the disease, with a female-to-male ratio of approximately 8:1. Case: A previously healthy 37-year-old male, presented with severe chest pain. A Transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) revealed severe aortic stenosis (Figure1), with vegetations on the right coronary cusp (RCC) and non-coronary cusp (NCC) of the aortic valve. His left ventricular ejection fraction was reported as normal, and minimal pericardial effusion was also detected. Infective endocarditis and pericarditis were suspected and he was started on analgesics and colchicine. Empirical antibiotic treatment was initiated, and blood cultures were collected. Transesophageal echo revealed vegetation on the RCC and NCC of the aortic valve, confirming endocarditis (Figure2). His blood cultures returned with negative results, and an autoimmune workup was consistent with the diagnosis of SLE and APS (Table1). A diagnosis of Libman-Sacks endocarditis was suspected as the underlying cause of the valvular disease. He was started on prednisolone, enoxaparin, hydroxychloroquine, warfarin, and aspirin. On follow-up six months later, TEE and TTE showed no significant change in the severity of his AS, nor the vegetation. Therefore, an aortic valve replacement was planned. Discussion: This is a rare case of a male patient with no prior symptoms who presented with LSE as the first manifestation of SLE and APS. It involved severe aortic stenosis, a less common outcome, as LSE typically causes regurgitation. Diagnosis was challenging due to the atypical presentation and initial suspicion of infection. Despite immunosuppressive treatment, the stenosis persisted, necessitating eventual aortic valve replacement. Early diagnosis and management of SLE and APS are crucial to reduce the risk of thromboembolic complications and potentially prevent irreversible organ damage."

Initial vitals: blood pressure 78/50 mmHg, pulse rate 100 bpm, and oxygen saturation 94%. Examination revealed bilateral pulmonary crackles and grade 4/6 holosystolic murmur at the cardiac apex. The electrocardiogram suggested inferolateral STEMI, and the patient was taken for coronary catheterization, and intubated due to hypoxic respiratory failure from pulmonary edema. Impella CP was placed for hemodynamic support. Catheterization revealed 100% occlusion of the mid-left circumflex (LCx), 75% occlusion of the distal left anterior descending artery, and chronic total occlusion of the right coronary artery. Two drug eluting stents were deployed to the mid-LCx lesion, achieving TIMI 3 flow. Emergent transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE) revealed hyperdynamic LV systolic function, severe mitral regurgitation (MR) with severe MV flail involving the posterior leaflet (Figure 1a-c). The posterolateral papillary muscle head was ruptured (Figure 1d). Despite Impella CP and pressor support with norepinephrine at 4 mcg/min, cardiogenic shock persisted; mixed venous oxygen saturation (MVO2) was 47%, pulmonary artery pulsatility index (PAPi) was 1.4, cardiac power output (CPO) was 0.61 W. Upgrading to Impella 5.5 improved MVO2 to 68%, PAPi to 2.5, and CPO to 1.16 W. He underwent coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) and surgical mitral valve replacement (MVR) with a bioprosthetic valve. Following surgical MVR, TTE revealed an appropriately functioning bioprosthetic valve, and LV ejection fraction of 35-40% with multiple areas of hypokinesis. Despite appropriate prosthetic valve function, the patient suffered pulmonary hemorrhage, septic shock, and expired on hospital day 10. Discussion: Papillary muscle rupture is an uncommon complication of acute myocardial infarction but is often fatal. In our patient, TTE was imperative in timely recognition and management of acute MR and preparation for MVR. Impella mechanical circulatory support was used as a bridge to surgical intervention with MVR and temporized the patient’s cardiogenic shock. Despite its importance, literature on Impella use in this condition is scarce. While the patient ultimately expired, prompt use of echocardiography and Impella were important to bridge the gap to MVR."

Exposure to hypothermia during cardiac surgery can lead to hemolysis, transfusion reactions, and disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). Meticulous thermal control and interdisciplinary coordination are essential to optimize outcomes. Case: A 68-year-old man with prior mitral valve repair, atrial fibrillation, and multivessel coronary artery disease presented with progressive heart failure. Imaging confirmed severe mitral stenosis, tricuspid regurgitation, and a high coronary calcium burden. He underwent CABG, mitral valve replacement, tricuspid repair, Maze procedure, and left atrial appendage exclusion. Preoperative labs revealed CAD, prompting a normothermic CPB strategy. Despite avoiding hypothermia and using warmed fluids, the patient developed hemolysis, DIC, and multiorgan failure postoperatively. Escalation to intra-aortic balloon pump and VA-ECMO was ineffective, and he ultimately died. Decision-making: The presence of CAD required early hematology input and intraoperative modifications including normothermic perfusion and warmed cardioplegia. Plasmapheresis and complement blockade (e.g., sutimlimab) were not accessible in this urgent setting but represent important future strategies. Despite optimal support, including transfusions and ECMO, the patient experienced progressive hemolysis and hemodynamic collapse. This case highlights the need for proactive planning, especially in patients with known CAD undergoing cardiac surgery. Conclusion: CAD can result in fatal complications during CPB despite best practices. This case underscores the importance of CAD screening, perioperative vigilance, and early use of targeted therapies. It highlights a need for consensus guidelines and research into disease-specific interventions, and reinforces the role of a coordinated, multidisciplinary approach in managing rare hematologic conditions during cardiac surgery."

Cardiac involvement in HES can closely resemble infective endocarditis both clinically and echocardiographically, complicating diagnosis and appropriate management. Case Presentation: A 33-year-old woman with sickle cell disease (HbSS) presented with vaso-occlusive crisis, persistent fever, and a new cardiac murmur suggestive of mitral regurgitation. Initial transthoracic echocardiography revealed a mobile, vegetation-like mass (0.9×1.5 cm) on the posterior mitral leaflet (Figure 1). Blood cultures transiently yielded Escherichia coli, prompting treatment with antibiotics for suspected infective endocarditis. Despite antibiotic treatment, the patient continued to have febrile episodes and labs were notable for significant eosinophilia (&gt;1500/µL), raising suspicion for a non-infectious etiology such as Loeffler endocarditis. Methodology: Transesophageal echocardiography demonstrated an extensive lesion (1.4×1.3 cm) contiguous with the subvalvular myocardium, consistent with mural involvement and fibrotic changes atypical for bacterial endocarditis but highly suggestive of eosinophilic endocarditis (Figures 2-3). Comprehensive hematologic evaluation identified elevated serum IgE, tryptase levels, and confirmed the presence of the FIP1L1-PDGFRA fusion gene, supporting a diagnosis of myeloproliferative HES. Results: The patient's management subsequently shifted to targeted HES therapy with high-dose corticosteroids, alongside supportive treatments with hydroxyurea and exchange transfusions for sickle cell disease. Following this adjustment, the patient showed rapid clinical improvement, and follow-up imaging confirmed regression of the cardiac lesion. Discussion: This case highlights the essential role of multimodal echocardiography for differentiating Loeffler endocarditis—with significant myocardial infiltration and fibrosis—from infective endocarditis, especially in atypical cases involving rare pathogens like Gram-negative bacteria. Clinicians should maintain a high index of suspicion for underlying inflammatory causes when faced with persistent symptoms refractory to antibiotics. Early recognition of Loeffler endocarditis enables prompt targeted anti-inflammatory therapy with steroids--thereby improving patient outcomes and preventing progression to restrictive cardiomyopathy."
OpenAlex,valvular heart disease,Abstract 4346565: The inhibition of ATP citrate lyase prevents pathological cardiac fibrosis via the regulation of de novo lipogenesis and histone acetylation,Naoya Kuwahara; Manabu Nagao; Masakazu Shinohara; Kenta Kaneshiro; Tatsuro Ishida; Hiromasa Otake,10.1161/circ.152.suppl_3.4346565,2025-11-03,Circulation,"Background: Cardiac fibrosis is characterized by excessive extracellular matrix deposition in heart tissue that occurs early in heart failure (HF) and is caused not only by cardiac diseases such as ischemic heart disease and valvular diseases but also by lifestyle diseases such as hypertension and diabetes. Therefore, the inhibition of cardiac fibrosis has been considered an important therapeutic approach for treating HF. ATP citrate lyase (ACLY) is a key metabolic enzyme that converts mitochondria-derived citrate into acetyl-CoA. ACLY is essential for de novo lipogenesis (DNL) and histone acetylation, needs for cellular growth and organ fibrosis. Although fatty acids are required for energy production and biomass synthesis in the heart, the biological roles and regulatory mechanisms of ACLY-mediated DNL in pathological cardiac fibrosis remain largely unknown. Hypothesis: The inhibition of ACLY reduces pathological cardiac fibrosis by suppress DNL and histone acetylation. Methods: Adeno-associated virus serotype 9 (AAV9)-mediated shRNA targeting Acly was intravenously injected into C57BL/6J male mice from the retro-orbital sinus. The mice were subsequently continuously infused with a mixture of angiotensin II (AngII) and phenylephrine (PE) for two weeks. Cardiac phenotypes were evaluated via histological staining. Cell migration assays, stable isotope tracing with 13C-labeled glucose, and chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays were performed using human cardiac fibroblasts (HCFs). Results: ACLY expression was upregulated in the heart sections of mice treated with AngII/PE, especially in fibrotic areas. Masson’s trichrome staining and immunoblots revealed that gene silencing of Acly significantly reduced cardiac fibrosis and the expression of fibrous proteins in these mice. And gene silencing of Acly improves prognosis. SiRNA-mediated ACLY knockdown suppressed the proliferation and expression of fibrous proteins in cultured HCFs stimulated with transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β). Mechanistically, ACLY inhibition reduced DNL, limiting the fatty acid supply essential for cellular growth and proliferation; it also decreased H3K9 and H3K27 acetylation, in addition to the presence of acetylated H3K9 and H3K27 at the promoter regions of fibrotic genes. Conclusion: Our findings demonstrated that ACLY plays pivotal roles in promoting pathological cardiac fibrosis.

Ricketti; Ayobamidele Balogun,10.1161/circ.152.suppl_3.4367684,2025-11-03,Circulation,"Introduction: Endovascular stents are commonly used for vascular access in patients undergoing hemodialysis. While these devices are generally safe, rare but serious complications such as stent migration and associated endocarditis can occur. Migration into cardiac chambers has been reported, often requiring surgical intervention due to the high risk of valvular damage. Case presentation: A 71-year-old male with a medical history of end-stage kidney disease on dialysis and hyperlipidemia, presented with fevers and shortness of breath. On presentation vital signs were notable for tachycardia. Sepsis was suspected, and blood cultures grew Streptococcus gallolyticus, and subsequently started on Ceftriaxone. Echocardiogram revealed a large, migrated endovascular stent in the right atrium, measuring approximately 6 cm × 1.4 cm. Stent appeared to be attached to the anterior leaflet of the tricuspid valve. Left ventricular function ejection fraction was 55%. No vegetations or pericardial effusion were appreciated. Patient reported undergoing an uncomplicated creation of the left arm fistula with vascular stent approximately two years prior. Percutaneous retrieval was attempted twice unsuccessfully. Later, his course was complicated by cardiac tamponade requiring pericardiocentesis, with drainage of approximately 550 mL of sanguineous fluid. This complication was suspected due to myocardial microperforation during the attempted stent retrieval. Following hemodynamic stabilization, the patient underwent cardiac surgery with successful removal of the migrated stent and bioprosthetic tricuspid valve replacement. He then completed a full course of antibiotics for bacteremia and was discharged to a physical rehabilitation facility. Discussion: Stent migration into the heart is a rare but potentially life-threatening complication. It’s commonly associated with improper sizing, placement, or vessel wall degradation over time. Once in the cardiac chambers, stents can cause mechanical damage, serve as a nidus for infection, and impair valvular function. While percutaneous retrieval is typically the first-line approach, surgical intervention is often necessary when complications like tamponade or valve involvement occur. This case calls attention to the importance of long-term monitoring of intravascular devices, especially in patients with dialysis access, and highlights the need and importance for multidisciplinary management when complications arise."
OpenAlex,valvular heart disease,Abstract 4360993: Phenotypic Sex-Based Differences in Left Ventricular Geometry in Chronic Aortic Regurgitation,Anika Sonig; Lydia DeAngelo; Richard H. Grimm; L. Leonardo Rodriguez; Brian P. Griffin; Zoran Popović; David Chen; Christopher Nguyen; Deborah Kwon,10.1161/circ.152.suppl_3.4360993,2025-11-03,Circulation,"Background: Chronic Aortic Regurgitation (AR), a prevalent form of valvular heart disease, is associated with significant mortality and morbidity if left untreated. Emerging studies demonstrate significant sex-specific differences in AR presentation and clinical outcomes, yet current management guidelines do not account for these sex differences. Additionally, females with AR tend to exhibit increased symptoms despite reduced ventricular volume and preserved function. Research Question: How do left ventricular structure and geometry differ between sexes across varying severities of AR? Methods: A single-center, retrospective cohort study was conducted and included patients with an aortic regurgitant fraction &gt;20% by cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) or ≥ moderate AR by echocardiography. AR severity was quantified using regurgitant fraction (ARFrac) thresholds, quantified by CMR (Mild: ARFrac &lt; 20, Moderate: 20 ≤ ARFrac ≤ 33, Severe: ARFrac &gt; 33). Cardiac geometry measured by CMR was determined using LV mass index (LVMassi), left ventricular end diastolic diameter indexed (LVEDDi), LV end systolic diameter index (LVESDi), interventricular septal thickness (IVS), posterior wall thickness (PWT), LV length, and derived indices including relative wall thickness (RWT) and sphericity. Volumetric measures included LVEDVi, LVESVi, and LVEF. Comparisons were stratified by sex, and significance was assessed using Wilcoxon rank-sum tests. Results: We evaluated 370 patients with AR, 63 female (17%), median age of 51 years. See Table 1 for the comparisons of age, hypertension, diabetes, ARFrac, and LV morphologic features stratified by sex. Radar plots significant sex differences in morphologic features across varying AR severity levels (mild, moderate, and severe). Opposite changes in RWT and sphericity were present in the setting of severe AR, based on sex. Conclusion: There are evident sex-specific differences in AR LV remodeling. Males exhibit more chamber dilation with increased sphericity and RWT with severe AR, while females maintain smaller, with decreased sphericity and increased RWT in the setting of severe AR. These differences may contribute to disparities in symptom presentation and AR severity. Recognizing sex-based remodeling patterns may inform the future development of more personalized clinical guidelines for AR management, including risk stratification and surgical referral thresholds."

Bohra; Aishwarya Yamparala; Kyle Gobeil,10.1161/circ.152.suppl_3.4361536,2025-11-03,Circulation,"Background: Understanding cardiovascular mortality is key for shaping public health priorities. Two major sources in the U.S.—CDC WONDER and the Global Burden of Disease (GBD) study—report mortality differently. While CDC WONDER reflects death certificate data, GBD employs modeling techniques and redistributes ill-defined (""garbage"") codes to improve cause of death attribution. Prior comparisons have focused on ischemic heart disease and stroke, but other cardiovascular conditions remain understudied. Methods: We examined trends in valvular heart disease (I34.0-I37.9), hypertensive heart disease (I11.0, I11.9), peripheral arterial disease (I70.2), infective endocarditis (I38), and aortic aneurysm (I71) using both databases from 1999–2020. Annual U.S. mortality data from GBD and CDC WONDER were analyzed. For each condition, absolute deaths and crude mortality rates (CMRs) per 100,000 population were extracted. Percent change from 1999 to 2020 was calculated. CMRs were reported with 95% uncertainty intervals (UI) for GBD and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for CDC WONDER. Results: Substantial differences were found between the databases. Valvular heart disease deaths rose by 38.8% (GBD) and 32.2% (CDC). CMRs increased from 7.15 (UI: 7.62–6.18) to 8.33 (9.12–6.74) in GBD and from 11.8 (CI: 11.7–11.9) to 13.2 (13.1–13.4) in CDC. Hypertensive heart disease exhibited the most pronounced increase where deaths rose by 147.2% (GBD) and 474.7% (CDC). GBD CMRs rose from 10.6 (11.2–9.46) to 22.0 (23.62–19.21); CDC from 8.9 (9.2–8.9) to 43.8 (44.3–43.8). Peripheral arterial disease deaths rose 20.9% (GBD) but fell 50.4% (CDC). CMRs changed from 3.21 (3.45–2.82) to 3.26 (3.55–2.78) in GBD and from 0.6 (0.6–0.7) to 0.3 (0.3–0.3) in CDC. Infective endocarditis deaths increased by 41.9% (GBD) and 36.4% (CDC). CMRs rose from 2.4 (2.53–2.17) to 2.86 (3.07–2.50) in GBD and from 3.3 (3.4–3.3) to 3.8 (3.9–3.8) in CDC. Aortic aneurysm deaths declined 31.6% (GBD) and 18.9% (CDC). GBD CMRs fell from 6.19 (6.45–5.63) to 3.55 (3.76–3.15); CDC from 7.9 (8.0–7.8) to 5.4 (5.5–5.3). Conclusion: Cardiovascular mortality trends varied significantly between GBD and CDC WONDER. Differences were especially striking in hypertensive heart disease and peripheral arterial disease, likely due to methodological variation in death coding and redistribution. Awareness of these discrepancies is crucial for interpreting national mortality data and informing policy."

Marchlinski,10.1161/circ.152.suppl_3.4337942,2025-11-03,Circulation,"Background: Non-ischemic cardiomyopathy (NICM) patients with heart failure (HF) undergoing ventricular tachycardia (VT) ablation are at risk for long-term HF events. Left ventricular (LV) endocardial unipolar (Uni) and/or bipolar (Bi) low voltage areas (LVA) at ablation indicate abnormal myocardium, and their extent may predict HF events. Objective: To evaluate and compare the prognostic ability of endocardial Uni-LVA and Bi-LVA for the prediction of HF outcomes in NICM patients undergoing VT ablation. Methods: NICM and HF patients undergoing VT ablation between Jan 2020 and Dec 2023 at the Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania were included. Exclusions were ARVC, HCM, valvular disease, prior cardiac surgery. Uni-LVA was defined as &lt;8.27mV and Bi-LVA &lt;1.5mV during sinus/paced rhythm. Patients were followed at 6 weeks post-ablation, then at 6-month intervals. The HF outcomes included death, LVAD implant, heart transplant, or HF hospitalization. Patients were grouped into mild, moderate, and severe tertiles based on the extent of Uni-LVA and Bi-LVA. The association between tertiles and HF outcome was assessed by Cox regression, adjusted for age, sex, CKD, and LVEF. Results: A total of 137 patients with NICM and HF (mean age 62±12 years; 22.6% women) underwent VT ablation and LV endocardial voltage mapping. Of those, 129 had HFrEF (LVEF 30.5±10.8) and 8 had HFpEF (LVEF 56.5±4.4). Median Bi-LVA was 12.9% [IQR 5.4, 22.5] of the total LV endocardial surface. Bi-LVA tertiles were &lt;8% (mild), 8-18.5% (moderate), &gt;18.5% (severe). Median Uni-LVA was 50.1% [IQR 27.8, 76.5] of the total endocardial LV surface. Uni-LVA tertiles were &lt;35% (mild), 35–68% (moderate), &gt;68% (severe). HF outcomes occurred in 51 (37.2%) patients over a median follow-up of 2.6 years [IQR 1.8, 4.6]. HF outcome incidence was similar between mild Bi-LVA (24.4%, reference) and moderate Bi-LVA (30.4%, HR=0.77, 95%CI: 0.34–1.74, p=0.5), but significantly higher in severe Bi-LVA (56.5%, HR=2.8, 95%CI: 1.3–5.7, p=0.005). HF outcome incidence was 13.3% in mild Uni-LVA (reference), and significantly increased in moderate Uni-LVA (41.3%, HR=2.96, 95%CI: 1.1–7.6, p=0.02) and severe Uni-LVA (56.5%, HR=4.4, 95%CI: 1.7–10.9, p&lt;0.001). Conclusions: The extent of endocardial LVA, particularly unipolar abnormalities, noted during VT ablation in NICM patients is a prognostic indicator for late HF outcomes. Even moderate degrees of Uni-LVA are associated with a threefold increase in the risk of late HF outcomes."

McKindley; Jennifer Ken-Opurum; Ron Preblick; Omar M. Aldaas; Sujatha Sistla; April Slee; Jonathan C. Hsu,10.1161/circ.152.suppl_3.4367249,2025-11-03,Circulation,"Background: Rhythm control with catheter ablation (CA) of atrial fibrillation (AF) leads to reverse remodeling of AF substrate. Comorbidities may impact this process and outcomes. Sparse cardiovascular (CV) guidelines address comorbidities and rhythm control practices after CA. We characterized incident comorbidities after index CA that may impact outcomes, reablation, or antiarrhythmic drug (AAD) practices after CA in the ARRC-AF study. Methods: 2,429,863 patients in Optum’s deidentified Market Clarity Data (Market Clarity ® ) newly diagnosed with AF (2007–2021) were followed until disenrollment, death, or study end; 23,323 patients underwent index CA. Comorbidity status before CA and comorbidity event rates after CA were analyzed. We examined these before and during intervening periods between CAs and while receiving medical therapy. Results: Among the 23,323 patients who underwent index CA (median follow-up: 3.2 years; 44.6% prescribed AADs), baseline comorbidities included hypertension (51.8%), coronary artery disease (17.9%), obstructive sleep apnea (14.4%), diabetes (11.7%), heart failure (10.5%), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (8.9%), peripheral vascular disease (5.4%), valvular heart disease (4.9%), and chronic kidney disease (1.1%). During follow up, 19,461 patients (83.4%) had no further CA; 3,862 patients (46.7% prescribed AADs) had ≥1 reablation (1 reablation, 14.2%; 2 reablations, 2.0%; ≥3 reablations, 0.4%; interval between Cas of 539, 536, and 458 days, respectively). Individual comorbidity event rates after CA ranged from 0 to 4.7% in the 3 cohorts with ≥1 comorbidity/patient ( Table ). Conclusion: After CA, new comorbidities continue to emerge at a modest rate. In general, comorbidity event rates increased as the number of reablations increased. Both CV and non-CV comorbidities need to be assessed before reablation (with and without long-term AAD therapy) for potential impact on endpoints and need best practice management. Co-morbidities can impact outcomes and need to be considered for their impact on sample sizes, study endpoints, morbidity, and mortality in AF ablation trials. Optimizing management of comorbidities could potentially improve results of AF interventions"

Emerging evidence indicates that oxidative stress plays a significant role in the pathophysiology of CAVD by promoting damage to the endothelium lining the aortic valve. Our previous data provided evidence that sortilin orchestrates a complex intracellular signaling pathway culminating in endothelial dysfunction in mice through increased ROS production. Research Questions: To unveil the potential involvement of sortilin in the molecular mechanisms linking endothelial injury and oxidative stress in the progression of CAVD. Methods: Isolated human valve endothelial cells were used to identify the molecular mechanisms in vitro. Göttingen minipigs were randomly assigned to either a standard diet (SD) or a diet high in fat and cholesterol (HF) for 20 weeks. During this period, they received oral administration of either a placebo or the sortilin inhibitor AF38469. Blood samples were collected at baseline, during, and at the end of treatment for biochemical and oxidative stress marker analyses. Aortic cusps were analyzed histologically for cellularity, collagen, fibrosis, and calcification. Immunohistochemistry and Western blot assessed oxidative stress and osteoblast markers. Vascular reactivity studies evaluated endothelial function in isolated resistance vessels. Results: Immunohistochemistry revealed that the HF diet compromised endothelial integrity on the aortic valve surface, while sortilin inhibition preserved it. Furthermore, the HF diet group exhibited increased oxidative stress, activation of myofibroblast/osteoblast phenotypes, and mineralization in the valve, all of which were reduced by the sortilin inhibitor. Moreover, AF38469 significantly prevented the increased plasma cholesterol ( p&lt; 0.0001) and triglyceride ( p&lt; 0.0001) levels as well as the endothelial dysfunction observed in the placebo-treated HF diet group. Conclusions: Our data suggest that sortilin negatively regulates valvular degeneration by influencing the destruction of endothelial integrity, the increase in inflammation and oxidative stress, thereby highlighting its therapeutic potential in CAVD."

Research Question/Hypothesis: We hypothesised that unsupervised machine learning (ML) applied to routinely collected variables could yield a more informative HF stratification than the conventional LVEF-based framework. Goals/Aims: To develop an ML-derived multidimensional HF classification, test its prognostic performance, and compare it with existing LVEF categories. Methods/Approach: We analysed 13,238 patients in the nationwide JROAD-HF registry in Japan. Forty-six clinical, laboratory, and echocardiographic variables entered a latent-class model; the cohort was randomly split 1:1 into discovery and internal-validation sets to assess robustness. (Figure 1) Clinical endpoint defined as a composite of 5-year cardiovascular death and heart failure readmission. Results: The model identified three phenogroups by minimum Bayesian Information Criteria. Phenogroup 1 “Advanced Low-Output HF” (predominantly male, age 73.6 ± 12 years) showed severe systolic dysfunction (LVEF 35.5 %), renal impairment, and heavy burdens of ischemic heart disease (52 %) and cardiomyopathy (29%). Phenogroup 2 “Early Afterload-Mismatch HF” (predominantly male, age 68.8 ± 12 years) was the youngest, markedly hypertensive, with intermediate LVEF (41.9%) and diverse etiologies. Phenogroup 3 “Elderly HFpEF-like HF” (predominantly female, age 84.5 ± 7 years) was lean and anemic, with preserved LVEF 53.5%, atrial fibrillation (45%), and valvular disease (42%). The four most discriminative variables were age, total bilirubin, LV diastolic diameter, and serum hemoglobin rather than LVEF and yielded an adjusted Rand index of 0.94 in the validation set, indicating excellent reproducibility. Five-year Kaplan–Meier curves showed the lowest mortality in Phenogroup 2 and the highest in Phenogroup 1 (log-rank p &lt; 0.001), whereas LVEF categories showed no significant separation (p = 0.267) (Figure 2 A and B). Conclusions: ML-driven phenomapping of routine hospital data delineated three distinct HF groups that outperformed the traditional LVEF classification in prognostic discrimination."

McNamara; Evangelos K. Oikonomou; Aline Pedroso; Rohan Khera,10.1161/circ.152.suppl_3.4369348,2025-11-03,Circulation,"Background: Wearable devices can capture 1-lead ECGs but are primarily used for detecting rhythm disorders. AI deployed on these ECGs could enable scalable detection of structural heart diseases (SHDs). However, wearable ECGs are noisier than clinical ECGs, and it is essential to develop and validate noise-resilient models that reliably detect SHD on real-world wearable devices. Aim: We first developed and externally validated a noise-adapted AI-ECG model to detect SHD from lead I of clinical ECGs. In the prospective WATCH-SHD study, we then assessed its performance in detecting SHD from an Apple Watch-acquired 1-lead ECG. Methods: Using 266,054 ECGs from 110,006 patients at Yale (2015–23), we developed an AI-ECG algorithm to detect SHD from lead I ECGs (resembling Apple Watch 1-lead ECGs) paired with echocardiograms within 30 days. SHD was defined as a composite of LVEF &lt;40%, severe left-sided valvular disease, or severe LVH (IVSd &gt;15 mm + LV diastolic dysfunction). ECGs were augmented with random Gaussian noise during training to improve the model’s robustness against noisy signal acquisition. The model was then externally validated in 44,591 patients across 4 community hospitals and 3,014 participants from the population-based ELSA-Brasil. Subsequently, we prospectively enrolled 600 participants undergoing an outpatient echocardiogram at Yale and obtained a 30-s, 1-lead ECG with an Apple Watch to assess the AI tool’s performance in detecting SHD. ECG acquisition and inference were conducted in real-time using the CarDS-Plus app. Results: The AI model had an AUROC of 0.92 (95% CI, 0.91-0.93) for detecting SHD from lead I of clinical ECGs in the Yale test set and generalized well to the external cohorts, with AUROCs ranging from 0.89 to 0.92. In the prospective WATCH-SHD, 596 of 600 participants (99.3%; median age 62 years [IQR, 46–71]; 52% women) successfully obtained a 1-lead ECG on the Apple Watch, of whom 21 (5.3%) had SHD. This included 15 with LVEF &lt;40%, 5 with severe valvular disease, and 1 with severe LVH. The AI model had an AUROC of 0.88 (0.78–0.98) for detecting SHD from Apple Watch-acquired 1-lead ECG. At the threshold for optimizing Youden’s index, the model’s sensitivity was 86%, specificity 87%, NPV 99%, and PPV 27% for detecting SHD. Conclusions: A noise-adapted AI tool integrated with an automated platform can detect SHD from a 30-s, 1-lead ECG acquired with an Apple Watch. This has the potential to transform SHD screening in communities."
OpenAlex,valvular heart disease,Abstract 4367966: Clinical and Demographic Predictors of Rapid Aortic Stenosis Progression: Moving Toward Individualized Surveillance Strategies,P. Michael Ho; Yi-Lin Wu; Fagen Xie; Wansu Chen; Ming‐Sum Lee,10.1161/circ.152.suppl_3.4367966,2025-11-03,Circulation,"Introduction: Aortic stenosis (AS) is the most common valvular heart disease requiring intervention in the US. Untreated symptomatic AS carries a one-year mortality rate of up to 50%, while timely diagnosis allows for effective treatment. AS progresses gradually over years and is typically monitored with surveillance echocardiography. AS progression rates vary significantly between individuals. Current guidelines recommend uniform surveillance intervals, which may result in unnecessary imaging for slow progressors and delayed diagnosis for rapid progressors. This study aims to analyze a large echocardiographic dataset with longitudinal follow-up to identify risk factors for rapid AS progression, ultimately supporting individualized surveillance strategies based on patient-specific risk profiles. Methods: This retrospective study included patients with serial echocardiograms between 2011 and 2021. A natural language processing algorithm was developed to extract AS severity from each report. Rapid AS progression was defined as an increase in Vmax of ≥0.3 m/s per year, and severe AS was defined as Vmax ≥4.0 m/s. Multivariable logistic regression models were constructed to evaluate clinical factors associated with rapid progression. Results: The study included 24,821 patients with borderline, mild, or moderate AS. Mean follow-up was 4.1 years. 2,492 patients experienced rapid AS progression and 1,998 progressed to severe AS. Factors associated with rapid progression included older age (OR 1.12, 95% CI 1.07–1.18), male sex (OR 1.18, 95% CI 1.08–1.29), renal disease (OR 1.13, 95% CI 1.03–1.24), liver disease (OR 1.25, 95% CI 1.06–1.47), and anemia (OR 1.19, 95% CI 1.02–1.38) while coronary artery disease was associated with a lower risk (OR 0.76, 95% CI 0.68–0.84). Among racial and ethnic groups, white patients had the highest risk of rapid AS progression. Conclusion: Approximately 10% of patients studied experienced rapid disease progression. Older age, male sex, white race, and clinical factors such as renal disease, liver disease, and anemia were associated with rapid AS progression. These patients may benefit from closer follow-up and shorter echocardiographic surveillance intervals. This work lays the foundation for developing a personalized risk score to inform patient-specific surveillance intervals based on individual risk profiles."
OpenAlex,valvular heart disease,Abstract 4337649: The Toothpaste Heart: Striking Imaging of a Multisystem Calcific Cardiovascular Case in a Young Male with ESRD,Maya Asami Takagi; Garrett Cohen; Sandhya Venugopal,10.1161/circ.152.suppl_3.4337649,2025-11-03,Circulation,"Introduction: Extensive vascular and valvular calcification is typically seen in older adults with longstanding cardiovascular disease. In younger patients, it often reflects complex systemic pathology. Case Presentation: A 44-year-old male presented with central, burning chest pain that worsened when lying flat and improved when upright, shortly after a dialysate adjustment and suspected leakage. His relevant history included cocaine-associated NSTEMI at age 22, non-ischemic cardiomyopathy with LVEF 30% diagnosed at age 39, and ESRD secondary to proliferative glomerulonephritis with monoclonal deposits. He underwent kidney transplant at age 27 but resumed peritoneal dialysis by age 29. Investigations: Coronary angiography revealed new triple-vessel CAD. Echocardiography showed LVEF 35%, moderately reduced RV function, low-flow low-gradient aortic stenosis, moderate-to-severe mitral annular calcification (MAC), mild mitral stenosis, and pulmonary hypertension. Non-contrast ECG-gated cardiac CT showed a 25 × 62 mm calcified apical mass, diffuse coronary and vascular calcifications, pleural calcifications, calcified pulmonary nodules, and dramatic “toothpaste-like” MAC suggestive of caseous transformation. Management: Despite extensive structural disease, the patient remained hemodynamically stable. A multidisciplinary heart team—including general cardiology, heart failure, and cardiothoracic surgery—guided evaluation. CT surgery was consulted for CABG consideration; further workup included a PET-FDG scan for myocardial viability. Pericardiectomy was discussed due to concern for constrictive pericarditis in the setting of pericardial calcifications, though right heart catheterization did not show hemodynamic findings of constriction. Ultimately, CABG was deferred due to patient stability and preference to delay intervention. Medical therapy included heparin, dual antiplatelet therapy, statin initiation, and renal-adjusted guideline-directed heart failure treatment. Conclusion: This case highlights extreme cardiovascular and extraosseous calcification in a young patient with ESRD and chronic heart failure. The “toothpaste” appearance of the mitral annulus suggests caseous transformation, a rare MAC variant. While vascular calcification is common in ESRD, this represents a severe form of CKD–mineral bone disorder. Multidisciplinary care is essential in managing overlapping cardiac, renal, and metabolic conditions, and in guiding personalized risk stratification."
OpenAlex,valvular heart disease,Abstract 4370895: Combined left- and right-sided native valve infective endocarditis with no predisposing risk factors or intracardiac shunt,Diana Inshyna; Abdul Hakim Almakadma; Farzane Saeidifard,10.1161/circ.152.suppl_3.4370895,2025-11-03,Circulation,"Combined left and right-sided Infective Endocarditis (IE) is rare and typically occurs with underlying predisposing factors such as intravenous drug use, presence of hemodialysis catheters, congenital defects, and intracardiac devices. We present a 62-year-old woman with diabetes, hypertension, and severe peripheral vascular disease, diagnosed with combined left- and right-sided native valve IE despite lack of typical underlying risk factors. She presented with altered mental status and sepsis; blood cultures were positive for Streptococcus group G . Initial transthoracic echocardiogram revealed an 8 mm echogenicity on the atrial aspect of the mitral valve. Subsequently, a transesophageal echocardiogram was performed, revealing a large (2 x 0.9 cm) highly mobile mass on the anterior leaflet of the mitral valve with mild to moderate mitral regurgitation (Figures 1,2) ; additionally, a small size (0.9 x 0.7 cm) highly mobile mass was seen on the tricuspid valve with mild tricuspid regurgitation ( Figures 1,3 ), meeting criteria for combined left- and right-sided infective endocarditis. The patient was assessed by the cardiothoracic team, and due to presence of multiple comorbidities the risk of surgery was deemed to outweigh the benefits for valve replacement or repair. Therefore, she was treated medically with broad-spectrum antibiotics with subsequent significant improvement and did not develop any complications throughout her hospital stay. IE has an incidence of 3–10 cases per 100,000 annually in developed countries, with Staphylococcus aureus as the most common pathogen. Tricuspid valve IE accounts for 5–10% of cases. Although rare, combined left and right-sided IE can develop without underlying risk factors as in our clinical case. Multivalvular IE also poses greater risk for severe complications, including valvular dysfunction, heart failure, abscess formation, and conduction abnormalities, as well as systemic and pulmonary embolization, contributing to high morbidity. This case illustrates the importance of early diagnosis and individualized treatment in rare presentations of combined IE. It highlights that conservative, non-surgical management can be effective in select patients and supports the need for further research to guide treatment strategies in complex IE cases."

Graviss; Maan Malahfji; Dipan J. Shah,10.1161/circ.152.suppl_3.4366354,2025-11-03,Circulation,"Objective: The clinical trajectory of patients with moderate aortic stenosis (AS) complicated by concomitant mitral regurgitation (MR) remains poorly defined. While management strategies in severe AS are well established, patients with moderate AS and MR often fall below guideline-based thresholds for intervention despite symptoms and remodeling. We used cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR)—a robust modality for accurate valve quantification, particularly in mixed valvular disease— to assess the prognostic impact of MR in moderate AS and to compare the outcomes to patients with severe AS. Methods: We analyzed consecutive patients from the DeBakey CMR Registry (2008–2023) with ≥moderate AS on clinically indicated CMR. Exclusions included &gt;mild aortic regurgitation or mitral stenosis, subaortic obstruction, infiltrative cardiomyopathies, pre-capillary pulmonary hypertension, advanced malignancy, or unavailable follow-up. Patients were stratified by AS severity (moderate vs. severe) and MR grade (&lt;moderate vs. ≥moderate), with valve severity assessed per current CMR guidelines. The primary outcome was a composite of cardiovascular death or heart failure hospitalization. Statistical analysis was performed in R (Vienna, Austria), with significance defined as p&lt;0.05. Results: In a multivariate Cox regression analysis of 422 patients with moderate AS, both mitral regurgitant (MR) fraction on CMR (hazard ratio [HR] per 5% increase: 1.10; 95% CI: 1.04–1.16; P &lt; 0.001) and the presence of ≥ moderate MR (HR: 1.86; 95% CI: 1.31–2.65; P &lt; 0.001) were independently associated with the composite outcome (Table 1). In moderate AS, penalized spline regression analysis showed a statistically significant increase in risk with increasing MR fraction (P&lt;0.001 for linearity; P=0.028 for non-linearity; Figure 1). Kaplan-Meier curves demonstrated poorer 3-year event-free survival in patients with moderate AS and concomitant ≥moderate MR (33%) compared with both isolated severe AS (71%) and severe AS with ≥moderate MR (49%) (Figure 2). Conclusion: In moderate AS, concomitant MR is an independent predictor of adverse clinical composite outcomes. Patients with moderate AS and ≥moderate MR had worse composite outcomes than those with isolated severe AS, underscoring the additive risk of dual-valve pathology. These findings support more vigilant monitoring and may justify re-evaluation of treatment thresholds in this mixed valvular disease subgroup."
OpenAlex,valvular heart disease,Abstract 4352981: Use of Pre-procedural Computed Tomography for Ventricular Tachycardia and Pre-ventricular Contraction Ablations,Michael E. DeBakey; Mary Pelling; Wissam Mekary; Aparna Sajja; Anand Shah; Neal Bhatia,10.1161/circ.152.suppl_3.4352981,2025-11-03,Circulation,"Introduction: Ventricular arrhythmias are prevalent in patients with both ischemic cardiomyopathy (ICM) and non-ischemic cardiomyopathy (NICM) and are associated with increased mortality. Multi-modality imaging may aid in characterization of Ventricular Tachycardia (VT) substrate. We evaluate the utility of pre-procedural cardiac computed tomography (CT) in predicting substrate for ventricular arrhythmias in patients with ICM and NICM within the Emory healthcare system. Methods: Patients who underwent VT or PVC ablation were identified via retrospective chart review from October 2022 through May 2024. Patients with ICM or NICM along with pre-procedural Cardiac CT were included. Results: A total of 298 ablations were reviewed. Among these, 14 patients (average age 62 ± 15 years; 64% male) had pre-procedural cardiac CT that identified potential VT or PVC substrate. Of these patients, 36% (n=5) had documented ICM, 64% (n=9) had NICM. Notably, 14% (n=2) of the CT findings showed evidence of scar, 14% (n=2) indicated subepicardial fat, and all 14 patients (100%) exhibited various wall motion abnormalities (see figure). Mapping and ablation locations were consistent with pre-procedural CT imaging in 64% (n=9) of the cases. The 36% (n=5) of mismatches were primarily found in patients undergoing ablation in papillary muscles or those with bundle branch reentry, areas that are known to be poorly visualized on CT. Conversely, all matched patients (n=9) had CT findings of wall motion abnormalities, scar, or subepicardial fat corresponding to ablation sites. 21% (n=3) of patients exhibited mid-diastolic potentials on mapping that aligned with pre-procedural CT imaging. 43% (n=6) of patients exhibited late potentials on mapping that aligned with pre-procedural CT imaging. Of note, one patient’s CT findings did not match the location of ablation though did align with late potentials on mapping. Conclusions: While there are no clear guidelines on obtaining pre-procedural cardiac CT for VT ablations, our single academic institution experience suggests excellent localization of VT substrate in patients with ICM and NICM by imaging. The few patients with imaging who did not correlate with ablation targets, were those with ablations in papillary muscles, valvular heart disease, or bundle branch reentry, which are challenging to visualize with CT. These results support the potential role of cardiac CT in enhancing the accuracy of VT substrate characterization."
OpenAlex,valvular heart disease,Anti‐Malondialdehyde Low‐Density Lipoprotein Antibodies and Valvular Calcification: A Substudy of the SCOT‐HEART Trial,Adam Hartley; Michelle C. Williams; Amit Kaura; Sarah Verhemel; Mikhail Caga‐Anan; Damini Dey; Marc R. Dweck; Dorian O. Haskard; Michael Joner; Manuel Mayr; David E. Newby; Ramzi Khamis,10.1161/jaha.125.041524,2025-11-03,Journal of the American Heart Association,"Background Coronary computed tomography–derived valve calcification is becoming increasingly important in the multi‐modality assessment of valvular disease, especially in aortic and mitral valve disease. Separately, natural antibodies targeted against malondialdehyde‐modified low‐density lipoprotein (MDA‐LDL), an important subset of all oxidized LDLs, are related to fewer atherosclerosis and cardiovascular events. This study sought to investigate the association between the prevalence of aortic and mitral valve calcification with IgG and IgM anti‐MDA‐LDL antibodies. Methods In a substudy of the multicenter randomized controlled SCOT‐HEART trial (Scottish computed tomography of the heart), blood biomarkers were measured using laboratory‐developed enzyme‐linked immunosorbent assays and assessed in tertiles, with adjustment for the ASSIGN cardiovascular risk score. Results In 830 patients (53% male, 57.6±9.8 years) with a heavy burden of cardiovascular risk factors, the highest tertile of IgM anti‐MDA‐LDL was associated with a lower prevalence of aortic valve calcification (odds ratio, 0.59 [95% CI, 0.36–0.96], P =0.04) and mitral valve calcification (odds ratio, 0.26 [95% CI, 0.07–0.72], P =0.02). The highest tertile of IgG anti‐MDA‐LDL was associated with a lower prevalence of mitral valve calcification (odds ratio, 0.36 [95% CI, 0.10–0.99], P =0.05), but not aortic calcification. Conclusions Anti‐MDA‐LDL antibody levels were associated with a lower prevalence of aortic and mitral valve calcification. Assessment of these novel biomarkers may be useful in screening patients for valve calcification, as well as providing novel insights into potential pathological relationships."
OpenAlex,valvular heart disease,Abstract 4364054: Prevalence and Clinical Correlates of Valvular Abnormalities in Systemic Sclerosis: Associations with Pulmonary Vascular and Disease Severity,Lea R. Goren; Garrett Goldin; Ryan Osgueritchian; George Morcos; Hoda Mombeini; Adrianne Woods; Laura K. Hummers; Stephen C. Mathai; Fredrick M. Wigley; Ami A. Shah; Monica Mukherjee,10.1161/circ.152.suppl_3.4364054,2025-11-03,Circulation,"Background: Cardiac involvement is a major contributor to morbidity and mortality in systemic sclerosis (SSc), yet valvular heart disease remains underrecognized. Fibrotic and vascular remodeling in SSc may predispose to valve lesions, which can exacerbate right or left heart failure, particularly in the presence of pulmonary hypertension (PH). Emerging data suggest that valvular dysfunction, especially regurgitant lesions, is associated with more advanced cardiopulmonary disease and may serve as a marker of increased mortality risk. We aimed to characterize the burden and distribution of valvular disease across SSc subtypes and PH phenotypes. Methods: We analyzed a cohort of SSc patients from Johns Hopkins Medicine who were referred for transthoracic echocardiogram for evaluation of pulmonary vascular disease between September 2003 and April 2025. Demographic and clinical metrics, invasive hemodynamics, and echocardiographic parameters were analyzed. Patients were classified into limited cutaneous SSc, diffuse cutaneous SSc, or SSc with overlap of another mixed connective tissue disease (MCTD). PH subtype was determined based on invasive hemodynamics and World Health Organization classification. Disease duration was calculated from date of Raynaud’s onset. Comparative analyses were conducted using ANOVA, Chi-Squared tests, and ordered logistic regression. Results: Our cohort consisted of 211 SSc patients, mean age 64 ± 13 years, 82% female, 71% white, 52% limited SSc subtype, 74% with PH, Table 1 . Patients with interstitial lung disease associated PH or pulmonary arterial hypertension displayed significantly higher odds for more severe tricuspid regurgitation (TR) compared to those without PH (p = 0.001), Table 2 . Additionally, individuals with diffuse SSc showed a higher prevalence of advanced TR compared to those with limited SSc (p = 0.037) and MCTD (p = 0.019). Among patients with MCTD, extensive aortic regurgitation was more prevalent than in limited SSc (p = 0.018), and the occurrence of higher-grade mitral regurgitation was significantly greater compared to both limited (p = 0.021) and diffuse SSc (p = 0.037). Conclusion: Valvular regurgitation is a prevalent and clinically relevant manifestation in SSc, particularly among patients with PH and diffuse SSc or MCTD. These findings underscore the importance of routine echocardiographic surveillance to detect and manage valvular disease early in the course of SSc-related cardiopulmonary involvement."
OpenAlex,valvular heart disease,Abstract 4367705: A Rare Case of Watchman Device Embolization to the LVOT Managed by Percutaneous Retrieval,Soumyadeep Bag; Gautam Reddy; Brittain Heindl,10.1161/circ.152.suppl_3.4367705,2025-11-03,Circulation,"Case: An 82-year-old male with a history of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, coronary artery disease, heart failure with preserved ejection fraction, and end-stage renal disease on hemodialysis underwent a concomitant pulmonary vein isolation with pulsed field ablation and left atrial appendage (LAA) closure with a watchman device as he was a poor candidate for long-term anticoagulation. A 27 mm Watchman device was successfully deployed into the LAA with all PASS criteria (position, anchor, size, seal) being met. However, a transthoracic echocardiogram 24 hours later revealed that the device had dislodged from the LAA, and lodged in the left ventricular outflow tract (LVOT). The device was retrieved percutaneously via right femoral artery access under fluoroscopy and transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE) guidance. An 8.5F Agilis NXT steerable sheath (Abbott Vascular, Santa Clara, CA) was introduced through the femoral artery into the ascending aorta. A Rescue Combo 8mm forceps (Boston Scientific, Marlborough, MA) was advanced across the aortic valve. The Watchman was grasped to orient the anchors away from the valve and was retracted into the descending aorta with gentle traction. The device was released in the infrarenal aorta. After preclosure with two Proglides the Agilis was exchanged for an 18F Gore Dryseal (WL Gore, Flagstaff, AZ) sheath. The forceps was reintroduced and the device was grasped and collapsed into the large sheath. It was then removed intact from the body. Post-procedure TEE showed no valvular or ascending aortic trauma from the retrieval. The patient was monitored overnight in the cardiac intensive care unit and discharged in stable condition on apixaban. Discussion: LAA occlusion with the Watchman device is an effective strategy for stroke prevention in patients with atrial fibrillation at high stroke risk, with contraindications to long-term anticoagulation. Although device dislodgement is rare, as seen in the PROTECT-AF (0.6%) and EWOLUTION (0.2%) trials, some cases have been documented in the literature. Most dislodged devices migrate into the left atrium, left ventricle, or aorta, and are typically removed percutaneously or surgically. Our case highlights a rare instance of LVOT migration of a Watchman device, emphasizing the importance of early post-procedural imaging and structural cardiology evaluation before considering surgery. It also provides valuable insights into removing a dislodged Watchman device via the aortic approach."
OpenAlex,valvular heart disease,Abstract 4357549: Multi-Center Validation of a Non-exercise Machine Learning Prediction Model Equivalent to Cardiopulmonary Exercise Parameters in Cardiovascular Patients,Atsuko Nakayama; Hiroki Sakuma; Jérémy Bernard; Tomoharu Iwata; Kunio Kashino; Yoshitaka Iso; Keisuke Kida; Akashi Yoshihiro; Mitsuaki Isobe; Hitonobu Tomoike,10.1161/circ.152.suppl_3.4357549,2025-11-03,Circulation,"Background: A symptom-limited incremental cardiopulmonary exercise testing (CPET) is rigidly applied to patients with cardiovascular disease for assessing exercise capacity and prognosis, yet its widespread use is limited by the need for sophisticated equipment and specialists. We developed a machine learning (ML) prediction model for anaerobic threshold heart rate (AT-HR) and peak oxygen uptake (VO 2peak ) using over 20,000 CPET cases, which provides these measures from non-exercise clinical and demographic variables. This study aimed to validate the ML derived algorithm on multi-center cohorts. Methods: We analyzed CPET data during 2018 and 2024 from patients with cardiovascular disease across three high volume institutions: Sakakibara Heart Institute (n=336), St. Marianna University Hospital (n=300), and Showa Medical University Fujigaoka Hospital (n=101). The testing protocols were the same among three institutes. Gradient boosting regression created the ML model incorporating non-exercise 78 features for the predictions of AT-HR and VO 2peak . Predictive accuracy was assessed by the mean of the absolute error (MAE) and R 2 across institutions and disease subgroups (ischemic heart disease excluding post-coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG), post-CABG, post valvular surgery, heart failure, and aortic disease). Results: The mean age was 67 ± 29 years, with 552 participants (75%) being male. Although the institutions differed in patient demographics and disease profiles, the ML algorithm demonstrated high predictive accuracy across centers and subgroups of each diseases. AT-HR and VO 2peak difference between measured and predicted by ML ranged from 6.37 to 7.32 bpm, and from 2.64 to 1.88 mL/kg/min, respectively across disease categories, with consistent R 2 values indicating strong model performance. Bland-Altman plots confirmed minimal bias. The algorithm effectively and equally applied to each institutions despite differences in equipment, patient characteristics, and clinical staffs. Conclusions: This multi-center validation study confirms the robustness and clinical applicability of a ML algorithm. The model enables practical prediction of key CPET parameters without the need for exercise testing, offering a standardized, accessible tool for risk stratification and management of cardiovascular disease. This approach has the potential to expand the use of CPET-derived insights into diverse clinical situations."
