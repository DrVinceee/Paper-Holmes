PubMed,aortic stenosis,Transcatheter aortic valve degeneration: a combined clinical and translational perspective.,Joshua Yoon; Quentin Liabot; Colin Jamieson; Brooke MacLeod; David Meier; Stephanie L Sellers,10.1136/heartjnl-2025-326405,2026-01-19,Heart (British Cardiac Society),"As transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) is increasingly used in younger and lower-risk patients, long-term valve durability has become a growing concern. Bioprosthetic valve degeneration (BVD) is multifactorial, encompassing calcific and non-calcific structural deterioration, non-structural deterioration, valve thrombosis and procedural or device-related factors. This review aims to provide a look across the spectrum of understanding BVD, presenting insights from fundamental and translational science through to the clinic to give a comprehensive overview of the mechanisms underlying BVD in TAVI valves. This review highlights the pivotal role of multimodality imaging in detection, classification and monitoring of degeneration and discusses the emerging pharmacological and engineering innovations aimed at preventing degeneration. Finally, reintervention strategies, including redo-TAV and surgical explantation, are explored with an emphasis on CT-based planning and bench-testing insights that have enhanced our understanding of BVD and inform ongoing procedural refinement. These perspectives support a proactive and tailored approach to managing transcatheter aortic valve degeneration across the patient's lifetime."

Heart and circulatory physiology,"Left ventricular (LV) flow state is associated with unfavorable outcome in patient with severe aortic stenosis. However, there is little information on its impact on long-term prognosis in a population without valvular disease. To examine the impact of LFS on all-cause mortality in multi-ethnic population we analyzed 4398 asymptomatic participants without clinical cardiovascular disease undergoing cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) in the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis. LV stroke volume index (SVi), LVEF and myocardial contraction fraction (MCF) were measured. LV flow states were classified as normal flow state (NFS, SVi >35 ml/m2), low-flow state (LFS, 30-34 ml/m2) and very low-flow state (VLFS: SVi <30 ml/m2). Clinical data were collected at enrollment. Participants were followed up for a median of 14.2 years. All-cause and cardiovascular disease mortalities were used as primary endpoints. All-cause mortality was 16.2% and cardiovascular disease mortality 3.5%. VLFS and LFS groups had more cardiovascular risk factors and lower cardiac performance than NFS. The relationship between all-cause mortality and SVi was ""L-shape with the ""breakpoint"" at 33.5ml/m2 for a statistical significance (p=0.009). All-cause mortality was significantly associated with LFS after adjusted for age, sex, LVEF, and LV mass index with hazard ratio (HR) 1.81, 95% CI: 1.31-2.49 for VLF and HR: 1.21, 95% CI: 0.95-1.54 for LFS with overall p value 0.001). The highest cardiovascular disease mortality was seen in VLFS."

Case reports,"Transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) is increasingly performed, with TAVI-in-TAVI reinterventions becoming more frequent. Coronary access after TAVI-in-TAVI can be severely limited by neoskirt formation.
A 74-year-old man with extensive comorbidities and prior TAVI-in-TAVI (Evolut and Sapien valves) presented with chest pain and troponin elevation. Angiography showed severe left main artery and left anterior descending artery stenoses, but selective coronary engagement was impossible given complete neoskirt obstruction. Using transcatheter electrosurgery, a Steelcore guidewire insulated in a microcatheter was energized to perforate the neoskirt. Percutaneous coronary intervention with drug-eluting stents was successfully completed, with an excellent final result.
To our knowledge, this is the first report of electrosurgical neoskirt perforation to enable coronary revascularization after TAVI-in-TAVI.
Electrosurgery can safely perforate a neoskirt, restoring coronary access. This novel strategy may become essential as TAVI-in-TAVI procedures increase."

PubMed,aortic stenosis,Overestimation of Aortic Stenosis in Thiamine Deficiency: Two Cases With Distinct Underlying Conditions.,Satoshi Kurisu; Hitoshi Fujiwara,10.7759/cureus.99487,2025-12,Cureus,"The severity of aortic stenosis (AS) can be overestimated in high-flow states, and thiamine deficiency is an underrecognized cause of high-output circulatory states. We report two elderly females who developed thiamine deficiency-related high-output circulatory states, initially leading to an overestimation of AS severity. Case 1 was assessed as severe but was downgraded to moderate after thiamine replacement, and case 2 was initially assessed as moderate but was reclassified as mild after treatment. Case 1 had a history of gastrectomy, predisposing her to thiamine deficiency due to limited postoperative intake and a more alkaline gastric environment. Case 2 had liver cirrhosis and was on long-term spironolactone and loop diuretics, contributing to thiamine depletion via renal losses and impaired gastrointestinal utilization. Both patients exhibited refractory edema and hyperdynamic left ventricular wall motion. Thiamine deficiency impairs adenosine triphosphate production, reducing systemic vascular resistance and triggering compensatory high-output circulatory states. Prompt thiamine replacement improved symptoms and hemodynamic parameters. These cases highlight the importance of recognizing reversible high-flow states to avoid misinterpretation of AS severity and ensure accurate evaluation and management."

We describe the anesthetic management of a 37-year-old multiparous patient with severe multivalvular disease (severe mitral stenosis, severe aortic insufficiency, and severe tricuspid regurgitation with stenosis) and atrial fibrillation, presenting with signs of congestive heart failure, who was submitted to an elective cesarean section at 37 weeks of gestation. Following admission, she received targeted medical optimization in a cardiac intensive care setting, including rate control and diuretic therapy, with subsequent clinical improvement. Anticoagulation with low-molecular-weight heparin was suspended 24 hours before surgery. Considering her fixed cardiac output and the potential harm of abrupt hemodynamic shifts during surgery, a slow-onset epidural anesthesia under invasive monitoring was performed. Incremental boluses of 0.75% ropivacaine, combined with early vasopressor support, allowed for an adequate sensory block, maintaining hemodynamic stability throughout surgery. Intraoperative tachyarrhythmia was managed through cautious fluid administration and pharmacological treatment. Oxytocin was carefully and slowly administered to prevent sudden reductions in systemic vascular resistance. Since resumption of therapeutic anticoagulation was planned due to high thromboembolic risk, the epidural catheter was removed at the end of the surgery. A multimodal analgesic strategy was adopted, including a single epidural morphine bolus and bilateral transversus abdominis plane blocks. Both maternal and neonatal outcomes were favorable. This case highlights the importance of meticulous preoperative optimization and planning, the safety of graded neuraxial anesthesia, and the need for multidisciplinary discussion when managing parturients with advanced multivalvular heart disease."

We sought to develop and validate an algorithm-based rules engine to identify patients with untreated sAS and to evaluate differences between those who did and did not subsequently receive guideline-concordant treatment with aortic valve replacement (AVR).
We curated discrete and nondiscrete data from our echocardiography system, then created a rules engine to identify and grade aortic stenosis. We assessed sensitivity and specificity of the rules engine to identify sAS using manual adjudication. We additionally conducted a retrospective cohort analysis to identify demographic and socioeconomic factors associated with receipt of guideline-concordant AVR treatment for sAS.
The rules engine demonstrated 100% sensitivity and 95.4% specificity for identifying sAS across n ​= ​2162 echocardiographic studies from unique patients. Univariate analyses revealed patients with untreated sAS were more likely to be older and female, with no appreciated differences by race, ethnicity, insurance status, or neighborhood-level socioeconomic scores. In multivariable analyses, older individuals, women, and those with Medicare/Medicare advantage were less likely to undergo AVR. Among treated patients, those who underwent surgical AVR were more likely to be younger, male, and have lower socioeconomic neighborhood scores.
Untreated sAS is prevalent but can be accurately identified at scale using an echocardiogram report-based rules engine. Disparities in the receipt of AVR persist, particularly among women, older adults, and patients with nonprivate insurance coverage. The systematic use of automated algorithmic protocols may facilitate valvular heart disease identification and reduction of treatment disparities."

Timely transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) may reverse these processes. Transfemoral access remains the primary access method for TAVR, but the limited technique restricts early intervention in patients with narrow femoral arteries. This study aimed to evaluate the safety and feasibility of a novel balloon dilation in sheath (BinS) technique designed to facilitate transfemoral TAVR in such patients.
This multicenter, prospective, and first-in-human early feasibility study included patients with severe AS and challenging femoral anatomy who underwent TAVR using the BinS technique between February 2023 and August 2024. The primary endpoint was the 30-day rate of major adverse events. The secondary endpoint was the rate of major adverse events at 6 months. The clinical endpoints included major post-procedural complications.
Fifteen patients (mean age 73.5 ± 7.3 years; 66.7% male) were treated successfully with the BinS technique via transfemoral access. There were no cases of all-cause mortality, stroke/transient ischemic attack, or severe major vascular access site complications defined by Valve Academic Research Consortium (VARC)-3 at both 30 days and 6 months. No myocardial infarction or paravalvular leakage was observed. 12 patients obtained VARC-3 technical success. Two patients experienced postprocedural arterial dissection, and two developed new-onset conduction abnormalities (left bundle branch block or permanent pacemaker implantation). At 30 days, left ventricular ejection fraction improved significantly from 50.8 ± 17.0% pre-procedure to 59.9 ± 14.6% post-procedure (p < 0.001).
The BinS technique appears to be a safe and effective method for enlarging the narrow femoral lumens during TAVR. By broadening transfemoral TAVR eligibility, this approach may permit earlier hemodynamic unloading, thereby mitigating adverse cardiac remodeling and potentially improving long-term outcomes. Larger, longer-term studies are warranted to confirm these findings."

Case reports,"Suicide left ventricle (LV) is a rare, potentially fatal complication after transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI). It is typically caused by dynamic left ventricular outflow tract obstruction (LVOTO) following abrupt afterload reduction. Accelerated junctional rhythm (AJR) is an uncommon peri-procedural arrhythmia, and its role in precipitating suicide LV has not been reported.
An 87-year-old woman with extremely severe aortic stenosis was admitted for transfemoral TAVI. Concentric LV hypertrophy with a sigmoid septum and preserved systolic function was observed on baseline transthoracic echocardiography. She developed profound hypotension immediately after valve deployment. Transoesophageal echocardiography (TOE) revealed severe LVOTO and marked mitral regurgitation (MR) due to systolic anterior motion (SAM) of the mitral valve. The simultaneous appearance of AJR abolished atrial contraction, further reducing LV preload. Left ventricular outflow tract obstruction and SAM resolved during sinus rhythm, but recurred during AJR. Haemodynamics improved with rapid volume loading, vasoconstrictor administration and continuous right ventricular pacing, thereby reducing obstruction via induced ventricular dyssynchrony. Accelerated junctional rhythm resolved spontaneously following emergence from anaesthesia, and a stable sinus rhythm was maintained. The patient was discharged on postoperative Day 12 without recurrence.
This case reports AJR as a novel trigger for suicide LV after TAVI, leading to preload reduction and promoting SAM, LVOTO, and MR. Intraoperative TOE provided clear rhythm-dependent imaging of LVOT dynamics. Vigilant rhythm monitoring and prompt, targeted haemodynamic management, including pacing to induce ventricular dyssynchrony, are crucial for prevention and treatment in predisposed patients with small, hypertrophied ventricles with a sigmoid septum."

We aimed to investigate the association between the early residual mean postprocedural gradient (ERMPG) after TAVI and long-term SVD rates as well as the association of SVD with bioprosthetic valve failure (BVF) and 10-year mortality rates.
Patients with severe aortic valve stenosis enrolled in the Medtronic One Hospital Clinical Service at 10 Italian centres were included in the study. ERMPG was measured with echo-Doppler at hospital discharge or within 3 months from TAVI.
Between September 2007 and December 2014, 1,291 patients undergoing TAVI with a CoreValve/Evolut valve met the enrolment criteria of the study. After a median follow-up of 59.4 months, there were 46 patients with SVD (cumulative incidence rate 3.6%). A significant stepwise increase in the risk of SVD was apparent across tertiles of ERMPG (p=0.009), and in the multivariable analysis, ERMPG was an independent predictor of SVD (adjusted subdistribution hazard ratio [sHR] 1.05, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.01-1.08; p=0.004). Among the 46 patients with SVD, 25 (54.3%) had or developed BVF. SVD was associated with increased 10-year rates of all-cause mortality (adjusted hazard ratio 2.12, 95% CI: 1.49-3.00; p<0.001) and cardiac mortality (adjusted sHR 5.78, 95% CI: 2.63-12.71; p<0.001) compared with no SVD.
Echo-Doppler-derived ERMPG measured within 90 days from TAVI is an independent predictor of SVD. SVD is associated with high rates of BVF, and it is an independent predictor of all-cause mortality and cardiovascular mortality."

While transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) is established for symptomatic AS, its objective functional benefits in asymptomatic individuals are not well-defined.
To evaluate the safety and hemodynamic efficacy of TAVR in asymptomatic patients with severe aortic stenosis and to objectively quantify their functional recovery using cardiopulmonary exercise testing (CPET).
In this single-center retrospective study, 156 asymptomatic patients with severe AS undergoing TAVR with the VitaFlow valve were enrolled. Safety endpoints were adjudicated per Valve Academic Research Consortium (VARC-3) criteria. Efficacy was assessed via serial echocardiography and brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) levels at baseline, 1 day, 7 days, 3 months, and 12 months. Functional capacity was objectively quantified using CPET at baseline, 1 month, and 12 months.
Procedural success was 100% with no mortality, stroke, or major complications. Hemodynamics improved immediately (mean gradient: 51.6 ± 11.7 to 13.7 ± 7.2 mmHg, p < 0.001) and remained stable at 12 months. BNP levels decreased significantly from 7 days onward (p < 0.05). CPET revealed substantial improvements in functional capacity: peak oxygen uptake (VO₂) increased from 15.6 ± 3.6 to 19.8 ± 4.0 mL/kg/min (p < 0.001), anaerobic threshold (AT) increased, and ventilatory efficiency (VE/VCO₂ slope) decreased (all p < 0.001). The incidence of exercise-induced adverse events also significantly declined.
TAVR is a safe and highly effective intervention for asymptomatic severe AS, resulting in immediate hemodynamic improvement and sustained, objective enhancement of functional capacity, as rigorously quantified by CPET."

Recent trials show promising results of sodium glucose co-transporter 2 inhibitors in CHF patients.
In this observational cohort study, we aim to explore the cardiovascular outcomes of SGLT2 inhibitors vs standard care in CHF patients undergoing TAVR using a large research network database.
A retrospective cohort analysis of deidentified, aggregate patient data from the TriNETX research network was conducted. Subjects with CHF who underwent a TAVR procedure, were ≥18 years old, and received either SGLT2 inhibitors or standard of care were included in the analysis. After propensity score matching, outcomes were reported at 6-month and 1-year follow-up. The primary outcome was a composite of acute myocardial infarction, stroke, all-cause mortality, and acute CHF.
A total of 21,828 CHF patients undergoing TAVR were identified, of whom 2,464 were on SGLT2 inhibitors therapy. Following propensity score matching, 2,039 patients were included in each group. The primary composite outcome was not statistically different at 6 months among patients receiving SGLT2 inhibitors compared to those receiving standard care (HR: 0.79; P = 0.067). SGLT2 inhibitors use was associated with a significantly lower risk of acute myocardial infarction (HR: 0.69; P = 0.043) and all-cause hospitalization/emergency room visits (HR: 0.69; P < 0.001). At 1 year, no significant differences were observed for the primary and individual endpoints except for all-cause hospitalizations (HR: 0.73; P < 0.001) and urinary tract infections (HR: 0.77; P = 0.009).
Among CHF patients undergoing TAVR, SGLT2i use was not associated with a reduced risk of the primary composite outcome at 6-months and 1-year intervals."

The relevance of this signal to long-term prognosis remains unclear. We aim to assess predictors of long-term mortality with focus on diffuse fibrosis.
Single-centre prospective observational cohort study of patients with severe, symptomatic AS undergoing AVR. Patients were assessed using echocardiography, high-sensitivity cardiac troponin T (hs-cTnT), N-terminal pro-B type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) and CMR including T1 mapping for ECV% quantification. All-cause mortality was identified using the NHS National Spine Database. Univariable and multivariable Cox regression models were fitted to assess all-cause mortality associations. 168 patients (age 72 [65-77] years, 55% male) underwent CMR. Over a follow-up period of 9.7 (6.8-10.9) years, 76 deaths occurred. Patients who died had higher ECV% (29.9% vs 27.6%, p=0.014) and greater LGE (3.9% vs 2.0%, p=0.013). Univariable predictors of mortality were age, atrial fibrillation (AF), left atrial area, left atrial volume, total cholesterol, triglycerides, HDL:LDL ratio, non-bicuspid aortic valve, hs-cTnT, NT-proBNP, EuroSCORE II and ECV%. On multivariable regression, age, AF and ECV% remained significant predictors of mortality, independently of sex. AIC indicated that the model with four covariates was preferable to the one also including EuroSCORE II and coronary artery disease, and this result was confirmed by a likelihood ratio test (p=0.387).
In the longest follow-up cohort of T1 mapping in severe AS, we demonstrate diffuse fibrosis remains an independent predictor of long-term mortality. Integration of ECV% in baseline risk stratification should be explored further in patients with AS undergoing AVR."

Adults with successfully treated COA exhibit significantly higher incidence of hypertension. The objective of this study was to measure differences in the structure and mechanics of proximal and distal aortic tissue from the first age-appropriate, physiologically relevant growing porcine model of COA. This animal model also enabled the evaluation of a cutting-edge serially dilatable stent. Quantitative histologic analysis measured structural changes and the mechanical properties were investigated through uniaxial, shear lap, and peel tests of tissue from sham, control COA, and treated COA animals. Our original hypothesis that proximal aortic tissue from control and treated COA groups would be thicker and have less elastin was false. There were no significant differences in elastin content, collagen content, lumen area, or lumen-to-tissue area between groups. Mechanically, distal tissue also exhibited no difference in either uniaxial or shear lap stiffness, failure stress, or failure strain between groups. Distal tissue from the COA control and treated COA groups however, exhibited, a lower circumferential failure peel tension, suggesting interlamellar strength was reduced. When compared with other previously published animal models of COA, a clear distinction was timing - our growing porcine model is the first for which COA was induced and treated at physiologically relevant time points. Our results indicated minimal adverse vascular remodeling in either the COA control or treated COA groups, however, it is unclear if this was due to a lack of severity, if elastinogenesis compensated for damage, or if another unknown mechanism prevented remodeling. STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCE: Coarctation of the aorta is one of the most common congenital heart diseases, yet the mechanisms behind it and its associated comorbidities remain poorly understood. To our knowledge, this was the first study to characterize tissue from a growing porcine model, with coarctation induced and treated at a physiologically relevant ages. Additionally, we investigated a new and emerging technology to treat coarctation and correlated the mechanical characterization of the aortic tissue with structural changes observed via quantitative histologic analysis."

Randomized trials and observational studies that developed and validated HRQoL PROMs for adults with ischaemic heart disease (IHD), aortic stenosis (AS), atrial fibrillation (AF), heart failure (HF), or generic CVD were included, published from inception of databases to 8 February 2025 using PubMed, Web of Science, and Embase. Independent reviewers selected and extracted the psychometric properties of each PROM in accordance with the Consensus-based Standards for the selection of health Measurement Instruments (COSMIN) checklist: content validity, reliability, internal consistency, structural validity, criterion/convergent, cross-cultural validity, measurement error, hypothesis testing, and responsiveness. Each PROM was graded using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation approach. Of 9430 articles, 220 studies for 38 different PROMs were included (HF n = 17, 45%; AF n = 11, 29%; IHD n = 7, 18%; generic n = 2, 5%; AS n = 1, 3%). Eleven PROMs (29%) satisfied all nine COSMIN criteria; the majority (n = 19, 50%) required further validation and eight were deemed inadequate for clinical use (21%).
This scoping review of HRQoL PROMs in individuals with common CVDs found evidence that many PROMs do not fulfill all nine COSMIN criteria for methodological quality, and for some CVDs there is a limited choice of suitable PROMs for HRQoL measurement. There is an opportunity to improve HRQoL evaluation for use within routine care and research."

There have been recent publications regarding improved diagnostic criteria for apical hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, shift towards ""excessive trabeculations"" rather than historically termed non-compaction, and expanding knowledge of arrhythmogenic cardiomyopathies. Exercise induced cardiac remodeling can be mistaken for these pathologies, among others. As the evaluation of cardiomyopathies changes with the growing understanding of the pathology, it is important that these updates are compared to the potential physiologic adaptation seen in athletic training. It is imperative for the practicing cardiologist to remain knowledgeable of these evolving guidelines."

No overall difference in all-cause mortality was observed between sexes (OR: 0.83; 95% CI 0.65 to 1.06), though a significant protective effect for female sex was found among intermediate-risk patients (OR: 0.64; 95% CI 0.49 to 0.84; I²=0%). Women had a significantly higher risk of major bleeding (OR: 1.35; 95% CI 1.21 to 1.52; I²=15%). No significant sex-based differences were identified in cardiovascular mortality (OR: 0.98), stroke/TIA (OR: 0.96) or PPI (OR: 1.05).
Female sex was associated with a lower all-cause mortality among intermediate-risk patients undergoing TAVI, but also with a higher overall risk of major bleeding. These findings suggest the need for further investigation into sex-related anatomical and procedural factors.

Eighty-eight patients under 18 years who underwent ALCAPA repair from 2003 to 2022 were included. Baseline clinical and echocardiographic data, including MR and left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF), were recorded pre-operatively and at multiple post-operative follow-ups (discharge, 1 month, 6 months, 1 year, and annually thereafter). Friedman's Test and correlation/regression analyses were used to assess the impact of pre-operative MR on ventricular function recovery. The median age at surgery was 6 months(range 1-197), and the median hospital stay was 17 days. 56.81% of patients had moderate to severe MR pre-operatively, while only 25% had moderate to severe MR at 1-year follow-up. Mitral valve repair was performed in 44% of cases with significant MR. Pre-operative MR grades positively correlated with post-operative MR (ρ = 0.574, p < 0.001) and pre-operative LVEF correlated with post-operative LVEF (ρ = 0.698, p < 0.001). Linear regression analysis showed that patients with lesser MR had more change in LVEF (38 to 63.66%) than the moderate to severe MR group (42.22% to 66.38%, odd's ratio=-3.073, p = 0.024). Irrespective of severity of pre-operative MR, left ventricular function improved significantly after the surgical repair. Patients with pre-operative mild MR tended to experience more pronounced gains in LVEF following repair."

From July 2022 to April 2025, a total of 50 video-assisted minimally invasive combined heart valve surgeries were performed in the Department of Cardiovascular Surgery of the First Affiliated Hospital of Anhui Medical University. Combined heart valve procedures include mitral and tricuspid valve surgery and mitral and aortic valve surgery, as well as large atrial septal defect repair combined with mitral and tricuspid valve surgery. The 4th right intercostal incision along the anterior axillary line was set as the primary access for the surgical procedure of combined mitral and tricuspid valves. The 3rd intercostal incision next to the sternum was set as the primary access for the surgical procedure of combined aortic and mitral valves. The 4th right intercostal incision along the midclavicular line was set as the primary access for the surgical procedure of combined mitral and tricuspid valves concomitant with a large defect of the atrial septal. The perioperative data of patients was collected.
All patients underwent the video-assisted minimally invasive surgery completely. A total of 49 patients were discharged as expected except for only 1 older patient who was transferred into a local medical institution for extended rehabilitation due to delayed postoperative awakening. Postoperatively, excellent function of replaced prosthetic valves without paravalvular leaking has been confirmed. Moreover, there was no or less than mild regurgitation for repaired mitral and tricuspid valves. Also, postoperative complications, including III atrioventricular block, renal failure, and severe hypoxaemia, have not been found.
Video-assisted minimally invasive surgery for combined heart valves is safe and effective with a short-term satisfactory outcome."

We conducted a meta-analysis of randomised trials comparing long-term outcomes between these treatment strategies.
We aimed to compare long-term clinical outcomes between TEER plus GDMT and GDMT alone in symptomatic moderate-to-severe FMR.
Major electronic databases were searched for randomised trials comparing TEER plus GDMT with GDMT alone in FMR. The primary outcome was death or first hospitalisation due to heart failure at 24 months. The key secondary outcome was first hospitalisation due to heart failure at 24 months. Summary hazard ratios (HRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were computed by mixed-effects Cox models based on reconstructed time-to-first event individual patient data and random-effects models based on study-level data.
Three randomised trials (MITRA-FR, COAPT, and RESHAPE-HF2) were included, for a total of 1,422 patients assigned to TEER plus GDMT (n=703) or GDMT alone (n=719). The primary outcome was significantly lower in the TEER plus GDMT group compared with the GDMT-alone group by one-stage analysis (HR 0.72, 95% CI: 0.56-0.92; p=0.010). However, the two-stage analysis marginally failed to confirm this result (HR 0.72, 95% CI: 0.51-1.00; p=0.052) and showed substantial heterogeneity (I²=80.3%; p=0.006). Hospitalisation due to heart failure was significantly lower in the TEER plus GDMT group, regardless of the statistical method used (one-stage: HR 0.65, 95% CI: 0.48-0.88; p=0.006; two-stage: HR 0.66, 95% CI: 0.45-0.96; p=0.031). However, heterogeneity was substantial (I²=81.2%; p=0.005). All-cause death and cardiovascular death at 24 months were not significantly different between treatment groups but became significant after excluding MITRA-FR in the leave-one-out analysis.
In symptomatic moderate-to-severe FMR, TEER plus GDMT significantly reduces death or hospitalisation due to heart failure and hospitalisation due to heart failure at 24 months."

This study aimed to assess medium-term outcomes and identify key predictive factors of mortality or surgical reintervention at 2 years after transcatheter PVL closure.
The prospective Fermeture de Fuite ParaProthétique (FFPP) Registry included consecutive symptomatic patients undergoing transcatheter PVL closure across 24 European centres between 2017 and 2019. Predictive factors for mortality and surgical reintervention were analysed over a 2-year follow-up.
A total of 213 symptomatic patients underwent 237 procedures. The mean age was 68±11 years, with a median European System for Cardiac Operative Risk Evaluation (EuroSCORE) II of 6 (interquartile range [IQR] 4-10). PVL involved the mitral valve in 64.6% of cases and mechanical prostheses in 53.3%. Heart failure and haemolytic anaemia were present in 89.5% and 49.8% of patients, respectively. The transapical approach was used in 6.8% of cases. Technical success was achieved in 87.3% of procedures, and clinical success at 1 month was achieved in 70.5% of patients. The median follow-up was 24.4 months (IQR 23.2-26.4). The survival rate at 2 years without the need for surgical reintervention was 66.1% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 60.1-72.7). Multivariate analysis identified mitral PVL, mechanical valves, and haemolytic anaemia as independent risk factors for adverse outcomes during follow-up. The absence of clinical success at 1 month was the strongest predictor of adverse outcomes (hazard ratio 5.00, 95% CI: 2.70-9.09; p=0.001).
Transcatheter PVL closure offers a durable therapeutic option for high-risk patients when early clinical success is achieved. Mitral valve involvement, mechanical prostheses, and haemolytic anaemia remain key predictors of poor outcomes over a 2-year follow-up."

Non-invasive echocardiographic markers, such as the echocardiographic Pulmonary to Left Atrial Ratio (ePLAR), calculated by dividing the peak tricuspid regurgitation velocity (TR Vmax) by the ratio of the transmitral E-wave to mitral annular e' velocity, may facilitate early risk stratification and reduce reliance on invasive procedures. Eighty-nine adult patients with unrepaired ASD underwent comprehensive echocardiography and right heart catheterization. ePLAR and additional echocardiographic parameters were measured, and their ability to identify elevated PVR (≥5 Wood Units, WU) was assessed through correlation and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis. PVR ≥ 5 group showed elevated ePLAR (0.41 vs. 0.29, p < 0.0001. ePLAR showed moderate ability to predict elevated PVR (AUC 0.754). The TR Vmax/ right ventricular outflow tract velocity-time integral (RVOT VTI) and TR Vmax²/RVOT VTI ratio demonstrated stronger discrimination (AUC 0.907 and 0.929).

Clinical, operative, and echocardiographic data were analyzed, including left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) and mitral regurgitation (MR). Follow-up evaluations were performed at 1 and 6 months postoperatively.
The median age at surgery was 9 months. Early mortality occurred in 17.4%, with no late deaths during follow-up.

LASr is typically assessed using speckle-tracking echocardiography (STE), which was developed to measure strain in the left ventricle. Despite its strength demonstrated in several clinical studies, the application of STE to the left atrium presents well-known limitations: thin walls, anatomical discontinuities, far-field location, and inter-vendor variability. The present study aims to evaluate the efficacy of an alternative method for assessing LASr, based on the percentage shortening of the atrial wall contour, by directly comparing it with STE-derived LASr values.
We retrospectively analyzed 246 patients in sinus rhythm with severe organic mitral regurgitation. The 2D contour strain method quantifies changes in the length of the two-dimensional (2D) endocardial atrial wall contour between end-systolic and end-diastolic frames. The peak strain value is calculated as: (maximum perimeter length-minimum perimeter length)/maximum perimeter length × 100.
2D contour strain measurements were feasible in all patients. A strong correlation was observed between STE-derived and 2D contour-derived LASr values, with an R-value of 0.93. On average, 2D contour strain measurements underestimated LA peak strain by approximately 1% compared to STE. The consistency of 2D contour LA strain measurements, as assessed by inter- and intra-observer reproducibility, was excellent.
These findings suggest that 2D contour LA strain is a feasible and reliable alternative to STE for assessing LASr. This approach is particularly valuable in echocardiography labs where STE software for LA is unavailable."

While mitral valve replacement (MVR) alone may improve left heart parameters, concomitant tricuspid ring annuloplasty (TRA) might prevent right-sided deterioration.
This retrospective study analyzed 129 patients undergoing MVR between 2016 and 2019. Patients were divided into two groups: isolated MVR (n = 71) and MVR+TRA (n = 58). Long-term echocardiographic outcomes were compared, including LVDD, LVSD, LVEF, LA diameter, IVS thickness, pulmonary flow rate, PAP, and TI degree.
Both groups showed regression in left heart dimensions postoperatively; however, left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) significantly decreased in the MVR-only group (p < 0.001) while it remained stable in the MVR + TRA group (p = 0.598). Severe tricuspid insufficiency occurred in 12 % (95 % CI 5-21 %) of patients undergoing isolated MVR and 0 % (95 % CI 0-6 %) of those undergoing MVR + TRA (p < 0.001). The mean difference in the change of pulmonary artery pressure (ΔPAP) between groups was 12.0 mmHg (95 % CI 6.5-17.3, p = 0.002), and both pulmonary artery pressure and left atrial diameter significantly decreased postoperatively in the MVR + TRA group.
Performing TRA during MVR surgery offers significant protective effects against TI progression and right heart overload. Even in cases with mild TI but annular dilation, simultaneous TRA may be a rational and beneficial strategy to ensure long-term cardiac stability."

A total of 310 patients with HOCM who underwent interventricular septal myectomy were retrospectively analyzed. Patients were divided into a MAC group (n = 24) and a non-MAC group (n = 286). Demographic characteristics, echocardiographic parameters, and clinical data were compared between groups. Major adverse cardiovascular and cerebrovascular event (MACCE) and circulating levels of brain natriuretic peptide, Apelin, and Galectin-3 were analyzed.
Patients with MAC were older and showed higher prevalence of aortic annular calcification, mitral leaflet thickening, and moderate-to-severe tricuspid regurgitation (P < 0.05). Multivariate analysis identified gender, age, aortic annular calcification, moderate-to-severe tricuspid regurgitation, and mitral leaflet thickening as independent risk factors for MAC. Patients with MAC showed larger left ventricular end-diastolic volume, reduced left ventricular ejection fraction, and greater left atrium mass, and a higher incidence of MACCE than those without MAC (P < 0.05).
In HOCM undergoing septal myectomy, MAC is associated with adverse cardiac remodeling and unfavorable clinical outcomes. Identification of related factors may aid risk stratification and perioperative management."

However, the prognostic relevance of left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) in this population remains unclear.
We analyzed data from 821 patients undergoing M-TEER at four German tertiary care centers between 2011 and 2022. Patients were stratified into heart failure subgroups based on LVEF: heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF, LVEF ≥50%), mildly reduced ejection fraction (HFmrEF, LVEF 41-49%), and reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF, LVEF ≤40%). Propensity score matching was used to balance baseline characteristics. The primary endpoint was all-cause mortality, with secondary endpoints including cardiovascular mortality and major adverse cardiac and cerebrovascular events (MACCE).
HFrEF patients exhibited greater comorbid burden, including higher rates of coronary artery disease and functional MR. Despite these differences, no significant association was observed between LVEF and long-term mortality, even after propensity score matching. Long-term survival rates at three years were similar across subgroups: 50.8% for HFrEF, 60.6% for HFmrEF, and 58.9% for HFpEF (p=0.2). Patients with HFrEF experienced higher in-hospital mortality (5.2%) than HFmrEF (0%) and HFpEF (2.5%), primarily due to non-cardiac causes. The overall rate of major adverse cardiac and cerebrovascular events (MACCE) was low at 3.8% (31/821) without significant difference between the respective subgroups. Multivariable analysis identified high-grade tricuspid regurgitation, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and impaired renal function as stronger predictors of mortality than LVEF.
LVEF demonstrated limited prognostic value for long-term outcomes following M-TEER, challenging its role as a standalone marker in this population. Procedural safety and efficacy were consistent across subgroups, underscoring the viability of M-TEER in surgically inoperable patients. Given the significant higher in-hospital mortality rate due to non-cardiac causes in the HFrEF subgroup, tailored therapeutic strategies addressing the underlying diseases should be pursued to optimize outcomes. Future studies should explore possible improvements in risk assessment and patient selection, for example by integrating emerging imaging modalities and accounting for comorbidities, to improve treatment outcomes."

Occasionally, mitral valve repair is inadequate (residual MR), or result in mitral stenosis, or is associated with systolic anterior motion (SAM) of the mitral valve and left ventricular outflow tract obstruction. Two- and three-dimensional Transesophageal echocardiography (2D and 3D TEE) can precisely diagnose the mechanisms, location and scallops causing MR, identify the mechanisms of repair failure, identify the predictors of SAM, and help decide when to return to bypass and address the residual lesion. The review comprehensively describes 2D and 3D TEE imaging methods relevant for evaluating the mechanisms of MR, identification of the location of MR, and the predictors of SAM prior to valve repair; and describes imaging methods to identify the presence of mitral stenosis and SAM post-repair. Further, the review discusses the importance of more-than-mild residual MR, describes the evaluation of residual MR and discusses pitfalls in differentiating mild and more- than-mild residual MR."

Consecutive patients post-TAVI with high-degree AV block and LVEF ≥ 50% were randomized to LBBP or RV pacing. The primary endpoint was survival with an improvement of ≥ 1 point in New York Heart Association functional class or a ≥ 25% increase in distance covered on the 6-minute walking test. Secondary endpoints were change in LVEF, septal flash, mitral regurgitation, N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide, heart failure hospitalization, score on symptoms, and QRS duration.
Twenty-four patients were included in the study, 12 in each arm. Both groups showed a similar incidence of the primary endpoint: 33.3% (n = 4) in the LBBP group vs 25% (n = 3) in the RV group (P = 1.0). In relation to secondary endpoints, significant shortening in the QRS was observed in the LBBP group compared with the RV group (median: -39 ms vs 0 ms, P < 0.001). Septal flash excursion was significantly lower for the LBBP group (median: 0 mm vs 2 mm, P = 0.03). There was no difference between groups on any other endpoint.
Similar midterm outcomes were obtained with LBBP and RV pacing in an elderly population with high-degree AV block and preserved LVEF after TAVI. The pilot Phys-TAVI trial showed the feasibility of LBBP in this population. Larger randomized clinical trials with longer follow-up are needed to test for differential clinical outcomes between pacing modalities.

Cardiovascular risk and prevention,"Left atrial appendage closure (LAAC) effectively lowers stroke risk in atrial-fibrillation (AF) patients who cannot tolerate long-term anticoagulation. Device-related thrombosis (DRT), although infrequent, carries a threefold increase in subsequent embolic events and remains a therapeutic challenge, even with the newer Watchman FLX occluder.
A 72-year-old woman with paroxysmal AF (CHA2DS2-VASc = 5; HAS-BLED = 2) underwent LAAC with a 30 mm Watchman FLX after bleeding-limited warfarin use. She was prescribed dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) post-procedure. Eight weeks later, cardiac CT detected a device-surface thrombus; warfarin (INR 2.5-3.0) achieved complete resolution by 7 months. Despite continued anticoagulation, repeat CT at 22 months revealed a larger thrombus. Transesophageal echocardiography confirmed recurrent DRT.
This case underscores multifactorial DRT pathogenesis: patient-specific hypercoagulability (age, persistent AF, PAI-1 variant), anatomic factors (large LAA, 30 mm device), and premature INR reduction. Current evidence indicates that early hypoattenuation thickening on cardiac CT, peri-device leak, and suboptimal antithrombotic regimens are associated with DRT. Emerging data support CT-based surveillance, individualized anticoagulation-potentially favoring direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs)-and next-generation, endothelialization-oriented device designs.
Recurrent, large-burden DRT can occur late after Watchman FLX implantation despite initial thrombus resolution and guideline-directed therapy. Optimal management requires (1) vigilant, multimodality imaging follow-up; (2) stringent, patient-tailored anticoagulation with real-time INR or DOAC level assessment; (3) consideration of genetic or laboratory markers of thrombophilia; and (4) advances in device bioengineering to accelerate endothelial healing. Further studies should refine risk-stratified antithrombotic strategies and validate imaging biomarkers to pre-empt DRT in high-risk LAAC recipients."

Nonetheless, the intrinsic anchoring mechanism remains obscure.
The aim of this study was to assess the feasibility of implementation of the NCPI method using self-expanding THVs for TAVR in severe PNAR and dilated ascending aortas (AAOs), and to elucidate the anchoring mechanism of the NCPI.
The study consecutively enrolled patients with severe PNAR and significantly dilated AAOs, who underwent TAVR with a NCPI technique. Clinical outcomes and a composite of all-cause mortality at 30 days and 12 months were assessed. Additionally, the post-TAVR cardiac multidetector computed tomographies (MDCTs) were conducted to investigate the anchoring mechanism.
A total of 12 patients were enrolled. The median age was 77 years, and the mean Society of Thoracic Surgery (STS) risk score was 10.1%, with a mean aortic annular perimeter of 80.0 mm, a median ascending aortic diameter of 47.9 mm. Device success rates were 100%. In all patients, post-TAVR cardiac MDCT analysis revealed stable anchorage of the THV via the non-coronary side insertion and the left-coronary side compacting contact achieved by the NCPI method despite the presence of ascending aortic dilation.
Preliminarily speaking, with the implementation of the NCPI method, the utilization of off-label self-expanding THVs for TAVR in severe PNAR and significantly dilated AAOs is deemed feasible. Stable anchorage of the THV was achieved using the NCPI method."

We sought to evaluate trends in CVD during pregnancy and maternal, obstetric, and fetal outcomes in pregnant women with CVD in the Kaiser Permanente Northern California (KPNC) integrated healthcare system. This retrospective cohort study included adult KPNC members with moderate or greater valvular heart disease, cardiomyopathy, congenital heart disease, or ischemic heart disease during pregnancy from 2010-2021. Bivariate analyses and multivariable logistic regression were used to evaluate associations between demographic and clinical risk factors and maternal outcomes in pregnant patients with CVD. Of 320,902 pregnancies, 763 (0.24%) were identified with clinically significant CVD. The prevalence of CVD increased from 0.19% to 0.34% over the decade, predominantly due to an increase in prevalence of women with congenital heart disease. Mean gestational age at delivery was 36.7 weeks with 19.5% experiencing preterm delivery. Cesarean section, pre-eclampsia or eclampsia, and postpartum hemorrhage rates were 29.5%, 20.8%, and 9.7%, respectively. Fetal loss beyond the first trimester occurred in 7.1% pregnancies. Adverse maternal cardiac outcomes occurred in 55 (7.2%) of patients, predominantly driven by congestive heart failure hospitalizations. There were 4 deaths (0.5%) during pregnancy or within 1 year postpartum. Pre-existing CVD (aOR 0.20, p=0.002) and cardiac medication use (aOR 4.13, p<0.001) were significant predictors of adverse maternal outcomes. Higher left ventricular ejection fraction (aOR 0.95, p=0.018) was associated with lower odds of adverse maternal outcomes. In conclusion, understanding risk factors for adverse pregnancy outcomes in a diverse, contemporary population of patients with CVD can help refine cardio-obstetric risk assessment and preconception counseling."

The surgical indication for LVD remains controversial.
A 31-year-old man was diagnosed with LVD through multimodality imaging that involved electrocardiogram, transesophageal echocardiography, cardiac computed tomography angiography, and magnetic resonance imaging. Intracardiac echocardiography and electrophysiological mapping confirmed the arrhythmia originating inside the diverticular cavity. With ineffective conservative treatment, surgery became the preferable option. The surgical approach was guided by preoperative three-dimensional printed reconstruction. The procedure involved diverticulum patch repair combined with radiofrequency ablation and, unexpectedly, mitral valve replacement. The patient recovered well.
VT originating from an LVD is a rare and catastrophic complication, with multimodal imaging essential for diagnosis. Surgical repair and radiofrequency ablation are effective treatments for LVD complicated by arrhythmia.
Treatment with medication alone may be insufficient for LVD with VT, and surgery is recommended."

Despite this, aortic valve replacement rates remain low for patients with severe AS due to challenges in identifying clinically significant AS in time. This has prompted the need to develop and investigate novel diagnostic modalities. The objective of this study was to develop and validate novel, non-invasive diagnostic algorithm leveraging seismocardiography (SCG) data to detect severe AS.
A device capable of collecting a single-lead ECG and a three-dimensional SCG signal using a microelectromechanical-based accelerometer was used to collect sensor data. Phase 1 data were collected for training and validation of an algorithm for AS detection. Phase 2 data were collected as a blinded independent test set with age-matched and sex-matched patients as controls.
In phase 1 of the study, 115 subjects (n=56 AS patients and n=59 controls; mean age 73.8±10.4 years) were collected for training and validation of an algorithm for AS detection. Once model development was complete, the frozen model was then evaluated in a fully independent, single blinded phase 2 cohort of 99 subjects (n=50 AS patients and n=49 controls; mean age 76.8±6.4 years) for final analysis. The algorithm accurately classified 89 out of 99 patients, with four true AS cases misclassified as controls and six true control cases misclassified as AS. The sensitivity, specificity and area under the curve of the model were 92% (95% CI 84.5% to 99.5%), 87.8% (95% CI 78.6% to 96.9%), and 96% (95% CI 91.9% to 99.9%), respectively.
This SCG-based algorithm to detect severe AS demonstrated high sensitivity and specificity when tested in a blinded, age-matched and sex-matched cohort. These findings suggest that this technology may hold potential as a low-cost diagnostic tool for the detection of AS."

While a subset of AVSc patients progresses to AS, reported rates vary widely. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to better define the natural history of AVSc progression.
Following Preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses (PRISMA) guidelines, we searched PubMed, Scopus and Web of Science through July 2025 for observational studies reporting AS development in AVSc patients. Primary outcomes were progression to any degree of AS and to severe AS. Pooled event rates were calculated using a random-effects model. Heterogeneity and publication bias were assessed using standard statistical methods. Meta-regression explored associations with clinical and demographic variables.
Eight studies (n=12 388 patients) reported on the progression of AVSc patients to any AS stage, and nine studies (n=19 486 patients) on the progression to severe AS. Over a median follow-up of 4.0 years, 14.1% of AVSc patients progressed to any AS stage (effect size: 0.14; 95% CI 0.02 to 0.53), and 2.0% to severe AS (effect size: 0.02; 95% CI 0.003 to 0.094). Heterogeneity was high, but no publication bias was detected. Meta-regression found no significant predictors of progression.
Approximately one in six AVSc patients progresses to AS within 4 years, and 2% develop a severe disease. These findings underscore the importance of structured echocardiographic surveillance and support AVSc as a clinically relevant marker of systemic cardiovascular risk."

However, existing prediction models face dual challenges: insufficient feature representation and limited explainability of the decision. To address these challenges, this study proposes a dynamic multiscale cross-band fusion filter network (MCFNet) for end-to-end seizure prediction. Specifically, the model first decomposes EEG signals into multiscale components and incorporates a cross-band fusion attention mechanism to achieve multi-granularity signal fusion. Subsequently, the synchronous spectral filtering network, comprising both static and dynamic filtering modules, is designed to capture the periodic components and cross-channel dependencies in EEG signals. Notably, two explainable methods are introduced: a joint feature visualization strategy and an efficient feature ablation analysis, helping to bridge the gap between the ""black-box"" nature of deep learning and clinical needs. Evaluated on the CHB-MIT dataset, MCFNet achieves a sensitivity of 97.13%, a specificity of 97.22%, and a false positive rate (FPR) of 0.0326/h. Experimental results show that MCFNet not only exhibits superior predictive performance but also maintains a low FPR, offering a feasible scheme for clinical application of EEG-based seizure prediction."

Soft computing techniques are now widely used to reduce the time and cost associated with traditional MSL estimation methods. Historical MSL data is frequently used to predict future values, yet the application of soft computing models to analyze climate change's impact on MSL remains relatively unexplored. This study aims to develop and compare various soft computing techniques for modeling MSL fluctuations using meteorological data. Random forest (RF), support vector regression (SVR), K-nearest neighbors (KNN) regression, deep neural network (DNN), Gaussian process regression (GPR), and stacked ensemble methods are employed in this study. The newly developed models are statistically assessed for their effectiveness in modeling MSL at Damietta station, Egypt. Variables environmental data such as surface water temperature, pressure, air temperature (average air temperature, dewpoint, wet-bulb, and heat index), and humidity and wind attributes (speed and direction) are utilized and evaluated in modeling MSL. The results indicate that RF, KNN, and GP outperformed other proposed models in modeling MSL during both training and testing phases. The developed weighted stacked ensemble model, integrating RF, KNN, and GPR, outperformed the base models with a correlation coefficient (R) of 0.88 and normalized root mean square error (RMSE) of 0.056 m. MSL modeling at the study station was particularly sensitive to variations in water temperature, wind speed and direction, and atmospheric pressure. This methodology serves as a valuable framework for climate-driven MSL forecasting in developing coastal regions lacking long-term tide records, directly contributing to UNESCO's Ocean Decade Challenge 5 on coastal resilience."

This study assesses the efficiency of morphine extraction and particle content of filtrates produced by various methods employed by drug users in Trondheim, Norway. The findings provide important insights that can inform harm-reduction services and healthcare providers in efforts to reduce injection-related morbidity among people who already inject drugs.
Four extraction methods were evaluated using 60 mg Dolcontin tablets: Method A (no coating removal, 3-minute boiling), Method B (coating removal, crushing, 3-minute boiling), Method C (coating removal, 3-minute boiling), and Method D (coating removal, 10-minute boiling). Resulting solutions were filtered using cotton balls, and morphine content was quantified using LC-MS/MS. Particle content of filtrates was analyzed using slide scanning, deep learning-based particle segmentation, and QuPath image analysis software.
Morphine recovery ranged from 81.2% (Method D) to 91.3% (Method B). Method A yielded a significant presence of small insoluble particles (<100 μm), while Method B yielded the highest density of the largest particles (>500 μm). Method C exhibited the highest density of medium-sized particles (100-500 μm). Method D generated the fewest particles across all size categories.
The extraction methods used by injecting drug users result in significant variability in morphine recovery and particle content of filtrates. Method D (10-minute vs. 3-minute boiling) demonstrated the highest efficiency in particle reduction, with only 10% less morphine recovery. Lack of coat removal significantly increases the number of primarily small (<100 μm) fragments. These findings highlight the importance of evidence-based harm-reduction measures to mitigate risks associated with injecting tablet-derived solutions. The results may support harm-reduction counselling and service design aimed at reducing particulate exposure and related complications, without endorsing or facilitating drug use."

Traditional diagnostic methods relying on histopathological examination are often time-consuming, resource-intensive, and susceptible to subjective interpretation. Moreover, inter-observer variability can further compromise diagnostic consistency, leading to delays in timely intervention. In recent years, advances in Artificial Intelligence (AI) and computer-aided diagnostic systems have shown transformative potential in medical imaging, enabling faster, objective, and reproducible detection of complex disease patterns. Particularly, deep learning-based models have demonstrated remarkable accuracy in histopathological analysis, making them promising tools for OSCC diagnosis and early clinical decision-making.
This study introduces a Deep Visual Detection System (DVDS) designed to automate OSCC detection using histopathological images. Three convolutional neural network (CNN) models-EfficientNetB3, DenseNet121, and ResNet50-were trained and evaluated on two publicly available datasets: the Kaggle Oral Cancer Detection dataset containing 5192 images labeled as Normal or OSCC, and the NDB-UFES dataset comprising 3763 images categorized into OSCC, leukoplakia with dysplasia, and leukoplakia without dysplasia. Data augmentation techniques were employed to mitigate class imbalance and enhance model generalization, while advanced image preprocessing methods and training strategies such as EarlyStopping and ReduceLROnPlateau were applied to ensure stable convergence. Results Among the models tested, EfficientNetB3 consistently delivered superior performance across both datasets. On the binary classification task, it achieved a test accuracy of 97.05%, with precision, recall, and F1-score all at 97.05%, specificity of 97.17%, and sensitivity of 96.92%. On the multi-class NDB-UFES dataset, it again outperformed the other models, attaining a 97.16% accuracy, matching precision, recall, and F1-score, and specificity of 98.58%. In contrast, DenseNet121 and ResNet50 showed substantially lower accuracy scores in both experiments.
These results highlight the importance of model architecture and preprocessing in medical image classification tasks. The proposed Deep Visual Detection System (DVDS), built upon EfficientNetB3, demonstrates high reliability and robustness, suggesting strong potential for deployment in clinical settings to aid pathologists in rapid and consistent OSCC diagnosis. This approach could significantly streamline diagnostic workflows and support early intervention strategies, ultimately enhancing patient care."

To overcome these limitations, the current study proposes a new hybrid architecture, LSTM Enhanced RoBERTa (LER), that combines the sequential learning ability of Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks with the deep contextual knowledge provided by the RoBERTa transformer model. The LER model proposed here is tested on the popular ISEAR emotion dataset and registers an impressive accuracy of 88%, which surpasses many robust baseline models.

The product combines storm-surge residuals predicted with an Informer-based deep learning workflow (benchmarked against LSTM, CNN-LSTM, and ConvLSTM) with astronomical tides estimated by UTide from historical observations. Predictors are drawn from ERA5 reanalysis and multi-source tide-gauge records are used for training and validation. For each station, the model with best validation skill generates residuals combined with tidal harmonics to form daily maxima. Across stations, the reconstruction attains a mean correlation coefficient of 0.81 and RMSE of 11.7 cm for daily maxima; for events above the 95th percentile, the mean correlation is 0.68 and RMSE is typically below 20 cm. The release includes metadata, data splits, and skill metrics for transparency and reuse. This dataset enables spatiotemporal analyses of extreme coastal water levels and coastal hazard mitigation in regions with sparse observations. Daily maxima are computed as the sum of the maximum tide and maximum surge. This serves as an upper bound, as the peaks of tide and surge rarely coincide. Using hourly data, we estimate a mean non-coincidence bias of 14.9 cm (14.8%). Additionally, station-specific statistics are provided for user adjustment."

Additionally, the model achieved robust performance on the CLHLS independent validation set (AUROC: 0.7440 95%CI: 0.6784-0.7993). SHAP analysis identified sleep duration, age, self-rated health status, and physical pain as core factors, and revealed gender- and age-related heterogeneity in depression risk profiles.
DARNet effectively models the dynamic trajectory of geriatric depression in the Chinese population, combining excellent predictive performance with interpretability. It enables identification of high-risk individuals and guides stratified interventions, offering a practical tool for intelligent depression risk monitoring. Future integration of multi-center clinical data from diverse populations would enhance its real-world application value."
PubMed,deep learning,scPlantAnnotate: an accurate and robust transformer-based model for plant cell type annotation.,Chunyang Lu; Manish Sridhar Immadi; Yen On Chan; Sameep Dhakal; Dong Xu; Marc Libault; Trupti Joshi,10.1016/j.jare.2026.01.035,2026-01-17,Journal of advanced research,"Accurate cell type annotation remains a major bottleneck in plant single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq), where existing tools are often adapted from animal studies and perform sub-optimally on plant data. The lack of plant-specific computational frameworks limits the construction of plant cell atlases and downstream biological discovery.
We develop and evaluate scPlantAnnotate, a Transformer-based reference annotation framework tailored for plant scRNA-seq data, and benchmark it against state-of-the-art deep learning and conventional methods across multiple plant species.
Species-specific scPlantAnnotate models were trained using curated datasets from Arabidopsis thaliana, Zea mays, Oryza sativa, and Glycine max. We compared scPlantAnnotate with leading baselines under both standard random-split evaluation and a more stringent leave-one-dataset-out setting, which tests robustness to completely unseen datasets and tissue types.
scPlantAnnotate consistently outperforms existing approaches across all four species under random-split evaluation. In the leave-one-dataset-out setting for A. thaliana, where performance drops markedly for all methods due to strong batch effects and dataset heterogeneity, scPlantAnnotate nonetheless achieves the highest Accuracy, Macro-F1, Balanced Accuracy, and Macro-AUROC on average and ranks first on most held-out datasets. These results demonstrate improved robustness to dataset shifts, a critical yet underexplored challenge in plant scRNA-seq analysis. A freely accessible web server enables users to annotate their own datasets using pretrained models.
scPlantAnnotate provides a plant-specific, Transformer-based framework for single-cell annotation that delivers state-of-the-art performance and enhanced robustness to unseen datasets. By addressing limitations of existing tools and enabling scalable reference-based annotation, scPlantAnnotate supports the development of comprehensive plant cell atlases and facilitates broader use of single-cell genomics in plant biology."

Leveraging deep learning for enzyme engineering, we redesigned a pectinase using ProteinMPNN guided by multiple sequence alignment. Our top-performing variant, DS-5, incorporated 72 mutations and achieved an 8.9-fold increase in catalytic activity compared to the wild-type. DS-5 also displayed significantly improved thermostability, with an optimal temperature increasing by 10°C, and robust performance over a wide pH range (7.0-11.0). Structural and molecular dynamics analyses revealed the source of this enhancement: a remodeled surface electrostatic potential due to the increase of five positively charged residues, forming an extended positive groove that potentially improves substrate binding affinity. This rationally designed enzyme demonstrated superior performance in applied settings, including apple juice clarification and tobacco degradation. Furthermore, treating tobacco leaves with DS-5 substantially improved their sensory profile by elevating the concentration of desirable flavor compounds like sucrose and lactones. Our study provides a framework for deep learning-guided engineering highly efficient enzymes, directly linking catalytic improvements to enhanced end-product quality for industrial applications."
PubMed,deep learning,Accelerating dataset generation for machine learning using large language models: a pharmaceutical additive manufacturing case.,Paola Carou-Senra; Lucía Rodríguez-Pombo; Carmen Alvarez-Lorenzo; Alvaro Goyanes,10.1016/j.ijpharm.2026.126587,2026-01-17,International journal of pharmaceutics,"Creating high-quality datasets for training machine learning models in specialized domains like pharmaceutical research is often constrained by the manual effort required to extract and compute critical parameters from heterogeneous literature. A novel deep prompt-engineering framework was developed to transform GPT-4 into a robust tool for automated and accelerated generation of structured datasets. Using a multi-set prompt strategy, GPT-4 analysed 70 full-text articles from literature on pharmaceutical inkjet printing to extract and compute 22 domain-relevant variables. These variables were organized into three main parameter groups: (i) printing parameters, (ii) rheological properties, and (iii) drug dose parameters, which were analysed using dedicated prompts. The outputs were benchmarked against a human-curated dataset compiled over four months by four domain experts, previously used to train machine learning models for predicting inkjet printability. Iterative prompt engineering yielded an overall accuracy of 0.942 across 4,217 individual variable-level data points, with computed variables reaching 0.983 accuracy despite multi-step calculations and unit conversions. Inter-day reproducibility was stable, and sensitivity, specificity, and predictive values all exceeded 0.900. Remarkably, the workflow reduced processing time from hours of human effort to <3.5 min per article. This novel prompt-engineering approach enabled GPT-4 to generate reliable, high-quality, literature-derived datasets, dramatically reducing manual effort while maintaining expert-level accuracy. Ultimately, this novel strategy facilitates the scalability of machine learning in pharmaceutical, and other data-intensive domains."
PubMed,deep learning,Mitigating data center bias in cancer classification: Transfer bias unlearning and feature size reduction via conflict-of-interest free multi-objective optimization.,Farnaz Kheiri; Shahryar Rahnamayan; Masoud Makrehchi,10.1016/j.artmed.2026.103351,2026-01-10,Artificial intelligence in medicine,"Bias in the decision-making processes of trained deep models poses a significant threat to their reliability. Such bias can lead to overoptimistic results on observed data while compromising generalization to unseen datasets. Training data may contain hidden patterns related to task-irrelevant attributes, such as data centers, causing models to exploit these unintended correlations rather than learning the main task. This results in biased predictions that favor certain attributes. To address this issue, we propose an unlearning approach based on Conflict-of-Interest-Free Multi-Objective Optimization, designed to train an unlearning layer that explicitly reduces reliance on irrelevant patterns. Our method aims to minimize the gap between internal accuracy (evaluated on data centers seen during training) and external accuracy (evaluated on entirely unseen data centers) caused by biased model behavior. As a case study, we investigate how data center-specific signatures embedded in cancerous features can lead to misleadingly high internal performance and a significant drop in performance on test samples from external data centers. By evaluating various methods and objective functions, our proposed approach achieves strong generalizability on external validation data by jointly reducing feature dimensionality and excluding conflict-of-interest samples during the k-Nearest Neighbor (KNN) searching process. We compare our method against multi-task and adversarial learning approaches for bias mitigation. Results show that our method outperforms others in narrowing the internal-external performance gap while also improving external validation accuracy. To ensure robustness, we conducted experiments using k-fold cross-validation across k different data centers, further validating the generalizability of our approach. Although this study focuses on cancer-related features and data center biases, the proposed method is model-agnostic and can be applied to any biased feature set extracted by a deep learning model."
PubMed,deep learning,Controlling gene expression using AI designed Cis-regulatory elements.,Yan Xia; Yi-Xin Huo,10.1016/j.biotechadv.2026.108802,2026-01-18,Biotechnology advances,"Cis-regulatory elements (CREs) play a crucial role in regulating gene expression by controlling transcription, making the understanding and design of these elements essential for the advancement of biology. Traditional approaches often rely on empirical rules and iterative experimentation, which can be time-consuming and labor-intensive. Recent advances in deep learning have begun to influence this field by improving the accuracy of predictions for existing elements and offering preliminary strategies for designing synthetic CREs. Specialized design models can incorporate high-throughput experimental data, and DNA foundation models draw on pre-trained genomic representations to inform the design process. These approaches have shown encouraging progress in generating promoters, enhancers and more complex regulatory architectures. Nonetheless, substantial challenges remain, including limited data availability, gaps between computational predictions and experimental outcomes, and limited model interpretability. Moreover, although AI-driven methods hold considerable promise for CRE prediction and design, their generative capabilities are still constrained by data quality and by the tendency of current models to rely predominantly on sequence-level features without fully capturing broader regulatory context. In this review, we examine how emerging AI technologies may support more systematic and targeted design of synthetic CREs, and we discuss key challenges and future directions, including multimodal modeling, reinforcement learning (RL), and system-level regulatory network design."

With a focus on the prevalent psychological complications following the onset of this condition, this study aimed to explore the correlation between antenatal depression and Corona disease anxiety, personality traits, and postpartum depression during the COVID-19 pandemic.                                                           Materials and Methods:                     This cross-sectional descriptive-analytical study investigated women receiving care at health centers affiliated with Kerman University of Medical Sciences during the last month of their pregnancy and the postpartum period in 2022. Following the acquisition of informed consent, participants were assessed using various measures, including demographic and obstetric information, the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale, the Corona Disease Anxiety Scale (CDAS), and the NEO Personality Inventory-Revised during their third trimester of pregnancy. The same group of participants completed the Edinburgh Depression Scale and the Corona Disease Anxiety Scale (CDAS) 4-6 weeks after childbirth.                                                           Results and Discussion:                     There was a significant correlation between family income, unwanted pregnancy as perceived by both the mother and father, and antenatal depression. Additionally, marital satisfaction played a significant role in postpartum depression. Furthermore, antenatal depression was significantly associated with neuroticism, agreeableness, and physical symptoms related to Corona disease anxiety. Personality traits, with the exception of extroversion and conscientiousness, and various domains of Corona disease anxiety, excluding psychological symptoms, were also significantly associated with postpartum depression.                                                           Conclusion:                     During pandemics or epidemics, such as the COVID-19 outbreak, experiencing mental distress during pregnancy can contribute to mental health issues during the postpartum period. This risk is particularly true in individuals with unique personality traits, emphasizing the need for increased focus on mental health within prenatal care during these crises."

Method:                     This cross-sectional study was conducted in Kerman, Iran. Data were collected from patients who visited Afzalipour Hospital in Kerman more than twice during the COVID-19 epidemic from the end of February 2020 to March 21, 2021. We conducted two key analyses: 1. Mixed effect logistic regression was used to check the relationship between the variables and COVID-19 severity. 2. Mixed effect linear regression was used to check the relationship between the variables and the length of stay in the hospital.                                                           Results:                     The findings indicated that the most important risk factors for the severity of COVID-19 were heart diseases (OR=1.67,95%CI:1.20-2.30), increasing age (OR=2.23 for age&gt;54, 95%CI:1.70- 2.90), male gender (OR=1.47,95%CI:1.10-1.96), respiratory diseases other than asthma, and frequency of admission (OR=1.60,95%CI:1.20-2.15). All patients who underwent readmission experienced a shorter duration of hospitalization during their subsequent admission (OR=0.94,95%CI:0.91,0.96) and had a higher mortality rate (30% within 14 days, 26.6% between 14-90 days). Patients readmitted at intervals of 14-90 days and greater than 90 days exhibited lower disease severity compared to those readmitted within the 0-14 day period.                                                           Conclusion:                     Examining readmissions, the severity of COVID-19, and the length of hospital stay in affected patients are important factors for planning and allocating resources for COVID-19 management and treatment. These factors can help policymakers develop effective clinical guidelines for hospitalization or outpatient treatment of COVID-19 patients and contribute to reducing the burden of disease in the community."

Kinovea, as an accessible motion-analysis software, provides both visual and quantitative feedback. However, its application in supporting technique development among beginner athletes remains insufficiently explored. Aim: This study aims to describe the use of Kinovea in biomechanics training and examine its contribution to the awareness of kinematic characteristics and movement techniques among beginner athletes. Methods: A descriptive qualitative design involved 72 beginner athletes aged 18–25 years selected through purposive sampling. Data were collected over 16 weeks through interviews, field observations, and motion video recordings analyzed using Kinovea. Kinematic data focused on joint angles, stride behavior, and movement phases during walking, running, and the flight phase. Qualitative data were analyzed using content analysis with NVivo 12, while kinematic results were interpreted descriptively to identify performance patterns and areas for technical refinement. Result: Kinematic analysis showed coordinated joint-angle patterns across all phases. Walking analysis identified arm swing angles of 50.9°–58.8° and leg separation angles of 64.3°–67.2°, indicating a stable gait rhythm. The running analysis revealed knee angles of 68.8°–69.8° and elbow angles of 87.6°–89.1°, indicating efficient propulsive mechanics. The flight phase demonstrated knee angles of 81.2°–87.8° and elbow angles of 80.4°–88.3°, suggesting effective momentum use and postural stability. These measurements supported stride-efficiency assessment and technique evaluation. Qualitative findings revealed that Kinovea enabled athletes to interpret movement phases and identify technical inefficiencies through slow-motion and frame-by-frame visualization. Conclusion: Kinovea supports basic motion analysis by providing clear kinematic information and helping beginner athletes observe and refine their movement techniques. The findings also offer practical value for coaches by enabling more precise identification of inefficient patterns and guiding targeted corrections during early-stage training."

Integrated care pathways (ICPs) supported by structured data systems may improve safety and outcomes, but real-world evidence in AS remains limited. We aimed to characterize a contemporary cohort of patients with severe AS managed within an ICP at a tertiary hospital, comparing profiles and outcomes by treatment strategy, and to describe diagnostic procedures and the implementation of cardiac rehabilitation (CR) interventions embedded in the pathway. Methods Prospective observational study of all consecutive patients with AS evaluated by a multidisciplinary heart team between 2018 and 2022. Baseline characteristics and frailty, diagnostic tests, CR interventions, procedural details, and outcomes were collected via an interoperable data management platform and compared across treatment groups: surgical (SAVR) or transcatheter (TAVR) valve replacement, or conservative management. Early survival was assessed using Kaplan–Meier analysis with log-rank testing. Results Among 984 patients (median age 78 years, 42% women), 43.9% underwent SAVR, 49.8% TAVR, and 6.3% were managed conservatively. TAVR and conservative groups were older, frailer, and had higher comorbidity. Device success at 30 days was high (≈91%), with periprocedural death at 2.5% for interventions, vs. 9.7% early mortality for conservative management ( p &amp;lt; 0.001). Early survival differed significantly (log-rank p = 0.004). TAVR had higher permanent pacemaker implantation (21.7% vs. 7.4% for SAVR, p &amp;lt; 0.001) and major vascular complications (4.1% vs. 0.2%, p &amp;lt; 0.001), while SAVR had more reoperations (8.3% vs. 0.2%, p &amp;lt; 0.001) and atrial fibrillation (18.9% vs. 10.1%, p = 0.001). Prehabilitation was implemented in 64.6% of candidates, while postprocedural CR remained underutilized (11.3%). Conclusions Integrated care for a cohort of patients with AS, supported by structured data management, enabled comprehensive profiling, systematic outcome monitoring, and identification of improvement areas. Both SAVR and TAVR achieved high success with low early mortality, while conservative management had poor survival."

The HALP (hemoglobin, albumin, lymphocyte, and platelet) score is an easily obtainable composite index that reflects nutritional status and systemic inflammation. Methods: In this single-center retrospective study, 140 patients who underwent TAVR between 1 April 2021, and 31 October 2024, were included. Patients were stratified according to the median HALP score (32.65) into low (&lt;32.65)- and high (≥32.65)-HALP groups. In-hospital outcomes were mortality, bleeding requiring transfusion of &gt;5 units of red blood cells, acute kidney injury (AKI), need for mechanical ventilation &gt;24 h, and length of hospital stay. Associations between the HALP score and clinical outcomes were evaluated using multivariable regression analyses, and the discriminatory performance of HALP was assessed using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves. Results: Patients with low HALP scores had higher rates of in-hospital mortality (11.4% vs. 4.2%; p = 0.002), bleeding (28.6% vs. 5.7%; p &lt; 0.001), AKI (11.4% vs. 2.9%; p &lt; 0.001), and need for mechanical ventilation &gt;24 h (25.7% vs. 14.4%; p = 0.002), as well as longer hospital stay (4.82 ± 1.50 vs. 3.62 ± 1.94 days; p = 0.001) compared with the high-HALP group. In multivariable models, a lower HALP score remained independently associated with all adverse in-hospital outcomes. ROC analysis showed good discriminatory ability of the HALP score for mortality (area under the curve [AUC] = 0.816; cut-off = 20.16), bleeding (AUC = 0.798; cut-off = 24.94), AKI (AUC = 0.737; cut-off = 26.21), and need for mechanical ventilation (AUC = 0.735; cut-off = 27.36). Conclusions: The HALP score is independently associated with adverse in-hospital clinical outcomes in patients undergoing TAVR and may serve as a simple and practical tool for early risk stratification in this population."

Bisson; Amandine Granier; Mélanie Burban; Anne Bernard; Laurent Fauchier,10.3390/jcm15020714,2026-01-15,Journal of Clinical Medicine,"Background: Sodium–glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors (SGLT2 inhibitors), initially developed for glycemic control in type 2 diabetes, have demonstrated robust cardiovascular and renal benefits. Emerging evidence suggests that these agents may also affect valvular pathobiology, particularly in degenerative aortic stenosis (AS), through anti-inflammatory and antifibrotic mechanisms. Objectives: This study evaluated whether SGLT2 inhibitor use is associated with improved clinical outcomes in degenerative AS, including all-cause mortality and the need for SAVR or TAVR, recognizing that these endpoints represent surrogate rather than direct measures of valve hemodynamic progression. Methods: A retrospective cohort analysis was conducted using TriNetX, a federated electronic medical record-based research network. Diagnoses are captured using ICD-9/ICD-10-CM codes and medications using ATC codes. Adults with non-rheumatic AS were stratified by SGLT2 inhibitors use. Propensity score matching (1:1) was performed to balance baseline characteristics between treated and untreated groups (n = 10,912 per group). Primary outcomes included all-cause mortality, TAVR, and SAVR during follow-up. Echocardiographic parameters (AVA, Vmax, mean gradient) were not systematically available. Results: After adjustment for comorbidities, SGLT2 inhibitor use was independently associated with lower all-cause mortality (6.15% vs. 9.34% HR 0.595; 95% CI 0.552–0.641; p &lt; 0.001), TAVR (2.81% vs. 2.89% HR 0.835; 95% CI 0.746–0.934; p = 0.002), SAVR (1.28% vs. 1.90% HR 0.514; 95% CI 0.442–0.599; p &lt; 0.001), cardiac arrest (0.82% vs. 1.21% HR 0.71; 95% CI 0.582–0.867; p &lt; 0.001), and end-stage kidney disease (0.40% vs. 1.0% HR 0.292; 95% CI 0.222–0.384; p &lt; 0.001). Although these associations may suggest slower disease progression, interpretation is limited by the lack of systematic echocardiographic follow-up. Conclusions: In addition to their established benefits in heart failure and renal protection, SGLT2 inhibitors may have valve-preserving effects in degenerative AS. Because true hemodynamic progression could not be evaluated, these results should be viewed as associations with surrogate clinical endpoints. Prospective studies with standardized imaging are required to determine whether SGLT2 inhibition can directly alter the course of this currently untreatable disease"
OpenAlex,aortic stenosis,Mid-Term Results of the Multicenter CAMPARI Registry Using the E-Liac Iliac Branch Device for Aorto-Iliac Aneurysms,Francesca Noce; Giulio Accarino; Domenico Angiletta; Del Guercio L; Sergio Zacá; Mafalda Massara; Pietro Volpe; Antonio Peluso; Loris Flora; Nicola De Rosi; Umberto Marcello Bracale,10.3390/jcdd13010048,2026-01-15,Journal of Cardiovascular Development and Disease,"Background: Intentional occlusion of the internal iliac artery (IIA) during endovascular repair of aorto-iliac aneurysms may predispose patients to pelvic ischemic complications such as gluteal claudication, erectile dysfunction, and bowel ischemia. Iliac branch devices (IBDs) have been developed to preserve hypogastric perfusion. E-Liac (Artivion/Jotec) is one of the latest modular IBDs yet reports on mid-term performance are limited to small single-center cohorts with short follow-up. The CAMpania PugliA bRanch IliaC (CAMPARI) study is a multicenter investigation of E-Liac outcomes. Methods: A retrospective observational cohort study was conducted across five Italian vascular centers. All consecutive patients undergoing E-Liac implantation for aorto-iliac or isolated iliac aneurysms between January 2015 and December 2024 were identified from prospectively maintained registries. Inclusion criteria comprised elective or urgent endovascular repair of aorto-iliac aneurysms in which an adequate distal sealing zone was not available without covering the IIA and suitability for the E-Liac device according to its instructions for use (IFU). Patients with a life expectancy &lt; 1 year or hostile anatomy incompatible with the IFU were excluded. The primary end point was freedom from branch instability (occlusion/stenosis, kinking, or detachment of the bridging stent). Secondary end points included freedom from any endoleak, freedom from device-related reintervention, freedom from gluteal claudication, aneurysm-related and all-cause mortality, acute renal failure, and sac regression &gt; 5 mm. Results: A total of 69 consecutive patients (68 male, 1 female, median age 72.0 years) received 74 E-Liac devices, including 5 bilateral implantations. The mean infrarenal aortic diameter was 45 mm and the mean CIA diameter 34 mm; 14 patients (20.0%) had a concomitant IIA aneurysm (&gt;20 mm). Concomitant fenestrated or branched aortic repair was performed in 23% of procedures. Two patients received a standalone IBD without implantation of a proximal aortic endograft. Technical success was achieved in 71/74 cases (96.0%); three failures occurred due to inability to catheterize the IIA. Distal landing was in the main IIA trunk in 58 cases and in the posterior branch in 13 cases. Over a median follow-up of 18 (6; 36) months, there were four branch instability events (5.4%): three occlusions and one bridging stent detachment. Seven patients (9.5%) developed endoleaks (one type Ib, two type II, two type IIIa, and two type IIIc). Five patients (6.8%) required reintervention, and five (6.8%) reported gluteal claudication. There were seven all-cause deaths (10%), none within 30 days or related to aneurysm rupture; causes included COVID-19 pneumonia, acute coronary syndrome, melanoma, gastric cancer, and stroke. No acute renal or respiratory failure occurred. Kaplan–Meier analysis showed 92% (95% CI 77–100) freedom from branch instability in the main-trunk group and 89% (60–100) in the posterior-branch group (log-rank p = 0.69). Freedom from any endoleak at 48 months was 87% (95% CI 75–95), and freedom from reintervention was 93% (95% CI 83–98). Conclusions: In this multicenter cohort, the E-Liac branched endograft demonstrated high technical success and favorable early–mid-term outcomes. Preservation of hypogastric perfusion using E-Liac was associated with low rates of branch instability, endoleak, and reintervention, with no 30-day mortality or aneurysm-related deaths. These findings support the safety and efficacy of E-Liac for aorto-iliac aneurysm management, although larger prospective studies with longer follow-up are needed."
OpenAlex,aortic stenosis,Anesthetic and procedural strategy for coexisting severe aortic stenosis and carotid artery stenosis: A case report,Yuri Okada; Rio Oishi; Satoshi Kimura; Moritoki Egi,10.5412/wjsp.v16.i1.115792,2026-01-15,World Journal of Surgical Procedures,"BACKGROUND Aortic stenosis (AS) often coexists with carotid artery stenosis. However, clear guidelines for the optimal treatment strategy and sequencing of interventions in patients with both conditions are lacking. CASE SUMMARY A 79-year-old man with a history of hypertension presented with right-sided paralysis and pain. Magnetic resonance imaging revealed multiple infarctions in the left cerebral hemisphere and severe stenosis of the left carotid artery. Transthoracic echocardiography also identified coexisting severe AS. Carotid artery stenosis increases the risk of stroke during aortic valve manipulation; therefore, carotid intervention may be recommended prior to aortic valve treatment. However, perioperative hypotension and bradycardia associated with carotid intervention can precipitate circulatory collapse in patients with severe AS. After a multidisciplinary conference, the decision was made to first perform transcatheter aortic valve implantation under general anesthesia, followed by carotid endarterectomy 4 months later. Both procedures were completed successfully without complications. CONCLUSION Treatment strategy should be individualized, balancing perioperative risks and benefits in patients with severe AS and carotid artery stenosis."
OpenAlex,aortic stenosis,[Analysis of optimizing indications for fetal pulmonary valvuloplasty based on a multi-parameter scoring system].,Y Wang; Y Sun; G Luo; S L Pan,,2026-01-15,PubMed,"<b>Objective:</b> To establish a multi-parametric scoring system for predicting postnatal circulatory outcomes in fetuses with critical pulmonary stenosis (CPS) and pulmonary atresia (PA) with intact ventricular septum (IVS), in order to optimize the indications for fetal pulmonary valvuloplasty (FPV). <b>Methods:</b> This was a retrospective cohort study. A total of 96 fetuses diagnosed with CPS-IVS or PA-IVS at the Women and Children's Hospital, Qingdao University between July 2018 and June 2021 were included. Fetuses who did not undergo FPV constituted the modeling cohort, while those who underwent FPV constituted the validation cohort. Fetuses were classified into biventricular and non-biventricular circulation groups based on postnatal circulatory outcomes, and prenatal fetal echocardiographic parameters were compared. Inter-group comparisons were performed using the <i>t</i> test, Mann-Whitney <i>U</i> test, <i>χ</i><sup>2</sup> test or Fisher exact test. Based on inter-group differences, parameters associated with postnatal circulatory outcomes were screened in the modeling cohort. For continuous variables, optimal cut-off values were determined using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves and the Youden index and then dichotomized. Right ventricular endocardial fibroelastosis (EFE) was graded as 0, 1 or 2 according to severity. <i>OR</i> of each parameter were calculated, and a multiparametric scoring system was constructed. ROC curves were used to evaluate its predictive performance. Post-FPV outcome improvement was assessed in the validation cohort. <b>Results:</b> Among the 96 fetuses, 78 were assigned to the modeling cohort and 18 to the validation cohort. Postnatally, biventricular circulation was achieved in 56 cases (72%) in the modeling cohort and 13 cases in the validation cohort. In the modeling cohort, the right ventricular long-axis/left ventricular long-axis (RV/LV), tricuspid annulus diameter/mitral annulus diameter (TV/MV) and pulmonary valve annulus/aortic valve annulus (PV/AV) in the non-biventricular group were lower than that in the biventricular group (all <i>P</i><0.05). The optimal cut-off values for predicting postnatal circulatory outcomes were 0.65, 0.82 and 0.78, respectively. There was statistically significant difference in the distribution of circulatory outcomes between fetuses with grade 2 EFE and those with no or grade 1 EFE (<i>χ</i><sup>2</sup>=21.28, <i>P</i><0.001). Therefore, right ventricular EFE was dichotomized in the model as ""none or grade 1"" versus ""grade 2"". Each parameter was assigned a corresponding weight based on its <i>OR</i> value, and an integer score was obtained to construct the scoring system: grade 2 right ventricular EFE was assigned 5 points, RV/LV≤0.65 was assigned 2 points, TV/MV≤0.82 was assigned 2 points, and PV/AV≤0.78 was assigned 1 point, with a maximum total score of 10 points. At cut-off scores of 3, 4, and 5 points, the areas under the curve were 0.88, 0.91, and 0.88, respectively, with the highest specificity (0.95, 95% <i>CI</i> 0.84-0.99) observed at a score threshold of 5 points. In the validation cohort, 15 fetuses had scores ≥5 points, among whom 10 fetuses achieved biventricular circulation after birth, whereas in the modeling cohort, only 1 of 18 fetuses (scores≥5 points) achieved biventricular circulation. <b>Conclusions:</b> A multiparametric scoring system based on prenatal fetal echocardiographic parameters can effectively predict non-biventricular postnatal outcomes in fetuses with CPS-IVS and PA-IVS. By identifying high-risk patients, the indications for FPV can be optimized."

OpenAlex,aortic stenosis,Importance of digital media in patient education for transcatheter aortic valve implantation,Florian Genske; Anna Riepe; Elias Rawish; Thomas Stiermaier; Ingo Eitel; Christian Frerker; Tobias Schmidt,10.4330/wjc.v18.i1.113783,2026-01-15,World Journal of Cardiology,"BACKGROUND Patient consent discussion is an essential part of preoperative patient preparation. It is the main basis of decision making for the patient. Transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) has been established as the standard treatment option for symptomatic aortic stenosis-patients. Current guidelines recommend transfemoral TAVI for patients aged 70 years or older, independently of the surgical risk and for patients below 70 years of age if they are at high surgical risk. AIM To evaluate beneficial aspects of an explanatory video in addition to conventional medical counseling. METHODS The study was conducted as a prospective, single-arm, monocentric cohort study. Eligible patients received conventional medical counseling, followed by an educational video. Evaluation of the conventional counseling and the educational video was obtained through a 32-item questionnaire. Two hypotheses were tested: Hypothesis 1: Showing an explanatory video in addition to the standard patient consent discussion improves the mediation of medical facts; and hypothesis 2: Showing an explanatory video in addition to the standard patient consent discussion improves patient satisfaction and confidence. RESULTS In total, 66 patients, scheduled for transfemoral TAVI were included, 59% of them were male and 41% female, averaging 81 ± 6.1 years old. Conventional medical counseling by the attending physician was the major criterium for overall patient satisfaction and had more influence on the absence of preprocedural tension than the transfer of additional factual knowledge through the video. Nearly two-thirds (61%) reported that the video enhanced their understanding of the procedure’s benefits, while 42% indicated a better understanding of the potential risks and 56% felt that watching the video contributed to decreased preprocedural tension. CONCLUSION Conventional medical counseling was most important for overall patient satisfaction. Educational videos aid in information transfer, in the reduction of preprocedural tension and were strongly sought after by the patients."
OpenAlex,aortic stenosis,CMR FEATURE TRACKING GLOBAL LONGLUTONAL STRAIN: A Novel Tool to Refine Sudden Cardiac Death Risk Prediction in Hypertrophic Cardiomomply,MD/PhD Camilo Fernández Bravo,10.5281/zenodo.18244930,2026-01-14,Zenodo (CERN European Organization for Nuclear Research),"Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) stands as one of the most common inherited cardiac disorders, characterized by abnormal thickening of the heart muscle, particularly the left ventricular (LV) myocardium, in the absence of other identifiable causes such as hypertension or aortic stenosis. First described in the mid-20th century, HCM has since been recognized as a heterogeneous condition with a broad spectrum of clinical presentations, ranging from asymptomatic individuals to those experiencing severe symptoms like heart failure, arrhythmias, and sudden cardiac death (SCD). The prevalence of HCM is estimated at approximately 1 in 500 individuals in the general population, though recent genetic and imaging studies suggest it may be as high as 1 in 200 when including subclinical cases. This makes HCM not only a significant public health concern but also a leading cause of SCD in young adults and athletes. Genetically, HCM is primarily an autosomal dominant disorder, with mutations in genes encoding sarcomeric proteins—such as myosin heavy chain (MYH7), myosin-binding protein C (MYBPC3), and troponin T (TNNT2)—accounting for the majority of cases. These mutations disrupt the normal architecture and function of cardiac myocytes, leading to myocardial hypertrophy, disarray, and fibrosis. The hypertrophy is often asymmetric, most commonly affecting the interventricular septum, but it can involve other regions like the apex or be concentric in nature. This structural remodeling impairs diastolic relaxation, increases LV outflow tract (LVOT) obstruction in a subset of patients (obstructive HCM), and predisposes the heart to electrical instability. Clinically, patients with HCM may present with symptoms such as dyspnea, chest pain, syncope, or palpitations, often exacerbated by exercise. However, a substantial proportion remain asymptomatic until a catastrophic event occurs. Diagnosis typically involves a combination of family history, electrocardiography (ECG) showing LV hypertrophy patterns, and imaging modalities like echocardiography, which reveals wall thickness greater than 15 mm in adults (or 13 mm in those with a family history). Cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) imaging has become indispensable for detailed tissue characterization, identifying fibrosis via late gadolinium enhancement (LGE), which is a hallmark of adverse remodeling. Despite advances in management, including beta-blockers, calcium channel blockers, septal myectomy, alcohol septal ablation, and implantable cardioverter-defibrillators (ICDs), the unpredictable nature of SCD remains a central challenge in HCM care. SCD, often due to ventricular arrhythmias like ventricular tachycardia or fibrillation, accounts for up to 1% annual mortality in HCM cohorts, with higher rates in younger patients. Identifying those at highest risk is crucial to guide preventive therapies, yet current strategies fall short in precision."
OpenAlex,aortic stenosis,Assessment of the Genetic Relationship Between Circulating Cytokines and Calcific Aortic Valvular Stenosis Using a Bidirectional Mendelian Randomization Analysis,Junyi He; Boao Chen; Junling Mao; Ni Xia; Lingfeng Zha,10.1096/fj.202502613r,2026-01-14,The FASEB Journal,"ABSTRACT Available studies have found associations between several cytokines and calcific aortic valvular stenosis (CAVS). To better comprehend the causal link between circulating cytokines and CAVS, we performed a bidirectional Mendelian randomization (MR) study. Genetic variants associated with 41 cytokines were obtained from public genome‐wide association study (GWAS), and summary statistics for GWAS of CAVS were obtained from the FinnGen consortium. Forward MR analysis was conducted to determine the impacts of 41 cytokines on CAVS risk and reverse MR analysis was used to determine whether genetic susceptibility to CAVS altered the levels of these cytokines. Inverse‐variance weighting (IVW) was implemented as the primary method, and several different sensitivity analyses were used to verify the reliability of the findings. Our results found no significant association between 41 cytokines and CAVS risk. However, increased levels of interleukin‐18 (IL‐18) (odds ratio [OR] = 1.080, 95% CI: 1.024–1.139) and interferon‐gamma (IFN‐γ) (OR = 1.157, 95% CI: 1.028–1.302) had suggestive connections with an elevated risk of CAVS, and increased levels of IL‐13 (OR = 0.942, 95% CI: 0.890–0.997) and IL‐5 (OR = 0.892, 95% CI: 0.804–0.990) had suggestive associations with a reduced risk of CAVS. A reverse MR analysis found that CAVS had a suggestive relationship with a reduced level of platelet‐derived growth factor BB (PDGF‐BB) (OR = 0.920, 95% CI: 0.853–0.993) and IL‐4 (OR = 0.925, 95% CI: 0.856–1.000). Our findings suggest the causal effects of IL‐18, IFN‐γ, IL‐13, and IL‐5 on CAVS risk, and genetic predisposition of CAVS may reduce the levels of PDGF‐BB and IL‐4."
OpenAlex,aortic stenosis,Temporal Cardiorenal Dynamics and Mortality Prediction After TAVR: The Prognostic Value of the 48–72 h BUN/EF Ratio,Aykan Çelik; Tuncay Kırış; Fatma Esin; Semih Babacan; Harun Erdem; Mustafa Karaca,10.3390/jcm15020676,2026-01-14,Journal of Clinical Medicine,"Background: Renal and cardiac dysfunction are major determinants of adverse outcomes following transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR). The ratio of blood urea nitrogen to left ventricular ejection fraction (BUN/EF) integrates renal and cardiac status into a single physiological index. This study aimed to evaluate the prognostic value of both baseline and temporal (48–72 h) BUN/EF ratios for predicting mortality after TAVR. Methods: A total of 429 patients (mean age 76 ± 8 years; 51% female) who underwent TAVR for severe aortic stenosis between 2017 and 2025 were retrospectively analyzed. The primary endpoint was long-term all-cause mortality; in-hospital mortality was secondary. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves, Cox regression, and reclassification metrics (NRI, IDI) assessed prognostic performance. Restricted cubic spline (RCS) analysis explored non-linear associations. Results: During a median follow-up of 733 days, overall and in-hospital mortality rates were 37.8% and 7.9%, respectively. Both baseline and 48–72 h BUN/EF ratios were independently associated with mortality (HR = 3.46 and 3.79 per 1 SD increase; both p &lt; 0.001). The temporal ratio showed superior discrimination for in-hospital mortality (AUC = 0.826 vs. 0.743, p = 0.007). Adding baseline BUN/EF to EuroSCORE II significantly improved model performance (AUC 0.712 vs. 0.668, p = 0.031; NRI = 0.33; IDI = 0.067). RCS analysis revealed a linear relationship for baseline and a steep, non-linear association for temporal ratios with mortality risk. Conclusions: The 48–72 h BUN/EF ratio is a robust dynamic biomarker that predicts early mortality after TAVR, while baseline BUN/EF identifies patients at long-term risk. Integrating this simple bedside index into risk algorithms may refine postoperative monitoring and improve outcome prediction in TAVR populations."
