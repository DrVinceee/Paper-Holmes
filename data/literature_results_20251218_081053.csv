PubMed,aortic stenosis,Twin-to-twin transfusion syndrome: from pathophysiology to long-term outcome-a narrative review.,Maëlig Abgral; Grégoire Dumery; Charles Mégier; Edouard Leyne; Dominique Luton; Alexandra Benachi; Daniela Laux; Roberta Centorrino; Lucie Caffin; Alexandre J Vivanti,10.1007/s00431-025-06695-4,2025-12-17,European journal of pediatrics,"Twin-to-twin transfusion syndrome (TTTS) is a severe complication of monochorionic twin pregnancies caused by unbalanced placental vascular anastomoses. Fetoscopic laser photocoagulation (FLP) is the standard treatment, although neonatal outcomes remain variable. This review aimed to summarize immediate, short-term, and long-term neonatal outcomes following FLP for TTTS. A narrative review of published clinical trials, cohort studies, and meta-analyses was conducted, focusing on survival, neurological, cardiovascular, and renal outcomes in neonates following FLP, including comparisons between selective and Solomon techniques. FLP significantly improves survival rates, with at least one twin surviving in 80-90% of cases. However, prematurity remains frequent, with median delivery at 32-34 weeks. Short-term brain injury occurs in 2-8% of cases, and long-term neurodevelopmental impairment affects 3-14% of survivors. Cardiovascular complications, such as pulmonary stenosis and aortic coarctation, develop at follow-up in 8% of cases, while renal dysfunction, primarily in donors, is reduced after FLP compared with expectant management.
FLP substantially enhances survival in TTTS, but neonatal morbidity remains a subject of concern. Persistent neurological, cardiac, and renal complications warrant multidisciplinary, long-term follow-up to optimize developmental outcomes for survivors.
• Fetoscopic laser photocoagulation improves survival in severe twin-to-twin transfusion syndrome compared with amnioreduction.
• Despite improved survival, long-term neurological, cardiac, and renal morbidities remain significant, emphasizing the need for multidisciplinary, prolonged postnatal follow-up of TTTS survivors."

This study explored whether haemodynamic parameters from four-dimensional flow MRI (4D flow MRI) are associated with the potential progression to AVR.
15 patients with moderate AS underwent baseline 4D flow MRI and echocardiography, with repeat echocardiography within 2 years. Patients were categorised into AVR (n=8) or no-AVR (n=7) groups based on whether they underwent AVR during follow-up.
AVR occurred a mean of 396±156 days after baseline. The AVR group had higher follow-up peak velocity (p=0.001), mean pressure gradient (p=0.022) and smaller valve area (p=0.004). Baseline peak vortex volume was greater in the AVR group (p=0.009) and was associated with AVR with an area under the curve of 0.88 (95% CI 0.82 to 1.00). Peak vortex volume moderately correlated with baseline (r=0.69) and follow-up (r=0.63) peak velocity and baseline mean pressure gradient (r=0.59) measured by echocardiography.
Abnormal vortex formation may reflect haemodynamic alterations associated with AS progression and eventual AVR. These exploratory results should be validated in larger cohorts to define the potential role of 4D flow MRI-based vortex assessments in AS evaluation."

Transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) and percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) represent a valid alternative. This study sought to investigate clinical outcomes after TAVR+PCI vs. SAVR+CABG in patients with severe AS and CAD. A systematic review was conducted from inception until December 2024 for randomized controlled and propensity score-matched studies comparing TAVR+PCI and SAVR+CABG for patients with severe AS and CAD. Kaplan-Meier-derived individual patient data was retrieved when available. Primary endpoint was all-cause mortality. The study was registered with PROSPERO (CRD42025642206). Six studies met our inclusion criteria with a total of 1,998 patients: 1,007 in the TAVR+PCI group and 990 in the SAVR+CABG group. The hazard ratio of all-cause mortality varied over time between groups: TAVR+PCI showed a lower incidence of all-cause mortality in the first 19 days, with a reversal at 73 days favoring SAVR+CABG. Patients undergoing TAVR+PCI group experienced lower rates of stroke-free survival (p=0.039), postoperative reintervention (p=0.020), atrial fibrillation (p<0.001), and acute kidney injury (p=0.001) rates, while they were at higher risk of postoperative moderate/severe aortic regurgitation (p<0.001), permanent pacemaker implantation (p=0.005) and major vascular complication (p<0.001). Major bleeding didn't differ (p=0.358). A percutaneous treatment approach offered an early survival benefit over a surgical approach in patients with severe AS and CAD but was associated with worse survival at mid-term follow-up."

We describe such a patient who presented with early transcatheter heart valve (THV) failure and underwent redo TAVI with an Allegra THV, with an emphasis on redo TAVI planning concepts & process.
The Allegra THV's distinctive design allows for higher effective orifice areas in small annuli while commissural post movement owing to a flexible outflow reduce leaflet stress.
Redo TAVI procedures require meticulous CT analysis for procedural and hemodynamic success. The Redo TAVI app by Dr Bapat is an essential aid, and the Allegra THV a useful consideration in redo TAVI procedures with small annuli."

However, some patients with severe aortic stenosis exhibit eccentric remodeling with enlarged left ventricular cavities, enabling a normal flow, low ejection fraction (NF-LEF) phenotype. We assessed the prevalence, hemodynamic characteristics, and post-transcatheter aortic valve implantation outcomes of NF-LEF.
In this substudy of the COMPARE-TAVI 1 trial, 979 patients undergoing transfemoral transcatheter aortic valve implantation were stratified by left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) (< or ≥50%) and stroke volume index (< or ≥35 mL/m2) into 4 groups: normal flow, normal LVEF, NF-LEF, low flow, normal ejection fraction, and low flow, low ejection fraction.
NF-LEF was observed in 10.7% of patients. Reduced LVEF was associated with previous myocardial infarction, pacemakers, New York Heart Association class >2, atrial fibrillation, moderate or worse mitral regurgitation, and larger left ventricular cavities (P<0.001) with eccentric hypertrophy (P=0.004). Compared with low-flow, low-ejection fraction, patients with NF-LEF more frequently had moderate or worse aortic regurgitation (P=0.007), whereas low flow, low ejection fraction showed poorer diastolic indices, suggesting diastolic dysfunction with high left ventricular filling pressures. Patients with low flow, normal ejection fraction were the most symptomatic and showed less improvement in 6-minute walk distance at 1 year compared with normal flow, normal ejection fraction. During follow-up, both low-flow groups demonstrated significant increases in stroke volume index (P<0.001), whereas LVEF also improved among patients with reduced LVEF (P<0.001).
NF-LEF is a prevalent aortic stenosis phenotype characterized by preserved flow despite reduced LVEF, likely driven by eccentric remodeling with moderate or worse aortic regurgitation and more favorable diastolic properties, with similar survival and time-to-event outcomes across phenotypes after transcatheter aortic valve implantation at long-term follow-up. Despite higher comorbidity burdens, patients with NF-LEF showed functional and clinical improvements comparable with normal flow, normal ejection fraction, indicating a severe aortic stenosis phenotype."

A 36-year-old woman with triple-positive APS, prior ischemic strokes, and chronic hypertension discontinued her anticoagulation therapy with acenocoumarin 1 week before presenting sudden, severe, transfixing epigastric and mesogastric pain radiating to the back, nausea, vomiting, and hypertension (174/118 mmHg). Initial tests showed anemia (9.8 g/dL), leukocytosis, elevated LDH, and an INR of 1.44. The abdominal CT angiography revealed an aortic stenosis of 54% caused by a thrombus extending into the celiac trunk (95% stenosis) and subacute splenic infarction. Anticoagulation was resumed alongside analgesia. One week later, celiac stenosis reduced to 44%. She was discharged on enoxaparin, hydroxychloroquine, and nifedipine. After 1 month, blood pressure was controlled, and a small residual aortic thrombus persisted without celiac trunk thrombosis evidence. This case highlights the importance of early recognition of APS and its complications, including rare vascular manifestations, and illustrates the potential role of conservative treatment in managing the rare vascular manifestation of APS, where standardized treatment guidelines are lacking."

Advances,"Transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) has transformed the gold standard management of aortic stenosis (AS). Following device approval, surrounding market competition was noted to spur institutional adoption. With the exponential growth of TAVR, it remains unclear how market competition may influence utilization.
The authors sought to evaluate the association of hospital market competition with TAVR utilization in the contemporary period.
All adults undergoing TAVR or surgical aortic valve replacement for AS from 2018 to 2021 were tabulated from 7 Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project State Inpatient Databases. Market competition was calculated using the Herfindahl-Hirschman Index, based on a variable radius comprising 75% of total discharges for each institution. Patients treated at hospitals in high market competition areas were grouped as competitive (others: noncompetitive).
Among 137,734 patients undergoing surgical aortic valve replacement or TAVR, 83,650 (61%) were competitive. The 2 groups were of clinically similar age, sex, and preoperative comorbidity burden. Following risk-adjustment, treatment at a high market competition hospital was associated with significantly greater likelihood of receiving TAVR (adjusted OR [AOR]: 1.68; CI: 1.26-2.23). On age stratification, this effect remained true across age strata, with the greatest effects noted among patients <50 years (AOR: 1.54; CI: 1.12-2.11) and 50 to 60 years (AOR: 1.30; CI: 1.14-1.48). Moreover, care at a high market competition center was linked with similar odds of mortality and composite complications but significantly greater per-patient costs.
Increasing hospital market competition was linked with increased likelihood of TAVR, particularly among younger populations. Our findings suggest regional competition may be 1 variable that influences clinical practice in the treatment of AS."

Case reports,"Left ventricular outflow tract (LVOT) obstruction is a rare but fatal complication after transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI). Early detection and timely intervention are essential for favorable clinical outcomes.
We report a case of LVOT obstruction diagnosed and dynamically monitored via a SavvyWire (Haemonetics). A 78-year-old woman underwent transfemoral TAVI for severe valve stenosis, and continuous hemodynamic monitoring by the SavvyWire identified a significant aorto-left ventricular pressure gradient with systemic hypotension immediately after valve deployment, indicating LVOT obstruction. Prompt administration of intravenous fluids and vasopressors resulted in rapid hemodynamic stabilization.
This case underscores the utility of the SavvyWire for immediate detection and management of dynamic LVOT obstruction, potentially improving safety profiles in TAVI procedures.
Continuous monitoring of the aorto-left ventricular pressure gradient can facilitate early diagnosis of LVOT obstruction in TAVI procedures."

Case reports,"The etiology of reduced left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) is often multifactorial, making it difficult to isolate a primary cause.
A patient presented with symptomatic heart failure, severe aortic stenosis, reduced LVEF (35%), and frequent premature ventricular contractions (PVCs). Transcatheter aortic valve replacement led to modest improvement. Syncope later revealed high-degree trifascicular atrioventricular block, prompting cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT). Despite CRT and optimized medical therapy, LVEF declined, and PVC burden increased. PVC ablation at the left ventricular outflow tract reduced PVC burden to <1%, restoring LVEF to 55%.
This case highlights the complex interaction between aortic stenosis, conduction disease, and ventricular ectopy. Although transcatheter aortic valve replacement and CRT offered partial benefit, significant improvement occurred only after PVC ablation, supporting the concept of ectopy-induced cardiomyopathy and its reversibility after rhythm control.
In persistent cardiomyopathy, PVCs should be considered a reversible cause, warranting stepwise and multimodal management."

Cardiovascular interventions,"Right ventricle-pulmonary artery (RV-PA) coupling is prognostically important in valvular heart disease.
The authors performed a systematic review and meta-analysis to quantify the association of RV-PA coupling with clinical endpoints after intervention for aortic stenosis (AS), mitral regurgitation (MR), and tricuspid regurgitation (TR).
The primary outcome was all-cause mortality, and the secondary outcome was a composite of major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE). A random-effects model was used to compute pooled effect estimates, and summary receiver-operating characteristic curves identified optimal RV-PA thresholds.
In total, 30 interventional studies (N = 12,992) met eligibility criteria, including 14 AS (n = 6,100), 12 MR (n = 5,032), and 4 TR (n = 1,860) studies. Tricuspid annular plane systolic excursion (TAPSE) to pulmonary artery systolic pressure (PASP) was the most studied RV-PA coupling index. Reduced TAPSE/PASP was independently associated with all-cause mortality (AS adjusted HR: 1.69 [95% CI: 1.30-2.20]; MR adjusted HR: 1.94 [95% CI: 1.40-2.69]; P < 0.001) and the composite MACE (AS adjusted HR: 1.60 [95% CI: 1.29-2.00]; MR adjusted HR: 2.01 [95% CI: 1.54-2.62]; P < 0.001). There were significant nonlinear associations between TAPSE/PASP and adverse outcomes in AS and MR (P < 0.001). There were insufficient data to estimate a pooled effect-size in TR. Optimal TAPSE/PASP thresholds to predict all-cause mortality were ≤0.51 mm/mm Hg for AS interventions, ≤0.33 mm/mm Hg for MR interventions and ≤0.44 mm/mm Hg for TR interventions.
TAPSE/PASP is an independent predictor of outcomes after interventions for AS and MR. The disease-specific TAPSE/PASP cutoffs could be integrated into risk-stratification models to better predict mortality before valve interventions and improve patient selection."

Recently, basal septal bulge (BSB) has been reported as a predictor of CD. However, the impact of BSB on CD using ACURATE neo/neo2 remains unclear. We hypothesized that the left bundle branch could be damaged in patients with large BSB even by low radial force. This study investigated the predictors of CD after TAVR using ACURATE neo/neo2 and the impact of BSB on CD.
We retrospectively analyzed 518 patients who underwent TAVR with ACURATE neo/neo2 in a single center. New-onset CD was defined as 30-day new permanent pacemaker implantation or new left bundle branch block lasting until discharge. The endpoints were the predictors of CD and the effect of BSB.
The incidence of CD was 11.0%. Multivariate analysis showed that complete right bundle branch block (odds ratio [OR]: 3.45; 95% CI: 1.63-7.30), membranous septum length <2 mm (OR: 2.14; 95% CI: 1.19-3.85), and BSB ≥3 mm (OR: 2.17; 95% CI: 1.22-3.86) were independent baseline predictors of CD. Postdilatation was the sole procedural predictor (OR: 2.28; 95% CI: 1.03-5.02). The risk of CD could be stratified according to the number of baseline predictors in patients with BSB ≥3 mm (0: 9.5%, 1: 26.1%, 2: 66.7%, p < 0.0001).
BSB was significantly associated with CD in ACURATE neo/neo2, and CD risk could be stratified using baseline factors in patients with large BSB. These findings might be beneficial for periprocedural management and TAVR strategy."

We aimed at evaluating the early clinical outcomes of TAx vs transfemoral (TF) access for TAVR.
We conducted a retrospective observational study stemming from the prospective RISPEVA registry, including all consecutive patients undergoing TAVR since 2013 at our Institution, where TAx is the only alternative access site whenever TF is contraindicated.
A total of 2164 patients were included: 60 (2.8 %) in the TAx group, and 2104 (97.2 %) in the TF group. Notably, no patient required alternative accesses or was referred for surgical aortic valve replacement. Baseline characteristics, including surgical risk scores such as EuroScore II (TAx = 5.3 ± 5.7, TF = 3.6 ± 3.7, p < 0.001) and comorbidities such as prior myocardial infarction (TAx = 10 [17.2 %], TF = 157 [8.1 %], p = 0.025), were clearly disfavoring the TAx group. Despite higher procedural times in the TAx group (69 ± 24 vs 59 ± 13 min, p < 0.001), procedural success rates were high in both groups (TAx = 58 [96.7 %], TF = 2077 [98.7 %], p = 0.191).

Similar findings were obtained at multivariable adjusted analyses and those based on inverse probability of treatment weighting, despite their limited reliability given low event-per-variable ratios and instability.
In this single-center retrospective study, TAx TAVR was feasible whenever TF was not envisionable, and yielded quite favorable short-term clinical outcomes. While promising, these findings remain descriptive and hypothesis-generating, thus requiring additional prospective and randomized validation."

The aim of this study was to compare the 1-year clinical outcomes, including valve performance, in patients undergoing TAVR with the S3UR compared to the SAPIEN 3 or SAPIEN 3 Ultra (S3/S3U). Patients with severe native aortic stenosis who underwent TAVR with either the S3UR or the S3/S3U valve were matched using propensity scores. Predictors of 1-year outcomes were identified. A subgroup analysis of patients who underwent post-TAVR CT was conducted. Among 4,908 patients, 312 matched pairs were assessed. At 1-year, compared to the S3/S3U group, the S3UR group exhibited lower all-cause mortality (HR: 0.42; 95% CI: 0.18-0.96; p = 0.041). The S3UR group demonstrated superior hemodynamic performance, including lower transvalvular gradients, larger effective orifice areas, and decreased incidence of severe prosthesis-patient mismatch and paravalvular leak. In patients who underwent post-TAVR CT (n = 280), prevalence of hypoattenuated leaflet thickening (HALT) at 30-day was lower in the S3UR group compared to S3/S3U (5.7% vs 16.2%; p = 0.006). In multivariate analysis, the S3UR group was independently associated with lower 1-year mortality and reduced HALT. In this propensity score-matched cohort, compared with the S3/S3U group, the S3UR group demonstrated favorable clinical outcomes and superior hemodynamic performance. In subgroup analysis, S3UR was also associated with a lower HALT incidence."
PubMed,aortic stenosis,Impact of clonal hematopoiesis of indeterminate potential on prognosis in patients with severe aortic valve stenosis: a meta-analysis.,Huang Sun; Ruijie Li; Xingyu Cao; Huawei Wang; Peng Ding; Yan Ang; Xiying Guo,10.1007/s00392-025-02823-0,2025-12-15,Clinical research in cardiology : official journal of the German Cardiac Society,"Clonal hematopoiesis of indeterminate potential (CHIP), commonly involving TET2 and DNMT3A mutations, is increasingly recognized as a cardiovascular risk factor, but its prognostic role in severe aortic valve stenosis (AVS) remains unclear. This study aimed to systematically evaluate the impact of CHIP on survival in AVS patients undergoing valve replacement.
A systematic search of PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, and Scopus through May 2025 identified observational studies of CHIP in AVS patients undergoing valve replacement. Eligible studies used validated genomic sequencing methods to identify CHIP and reported mortality outcomes. Two reviewers independently extracted study characteristics, outcomes, and related variables. Pooled hazard ratios (HRs) were calculated, with subgroup analyses by mutation type and geographic region, and meta-regression to assess effect modifiers. Risk of bias was assessed using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale, and sensitivity and publication bias analyses were also assessed.
Five studies with 1,175 patients were included. CHIP showed a non-significant trend toward increased all-cause mortality (HR = 1.58; 95% CI: 0.97-2.57; P = 0.0687; I2 = 64.8%). When defined by TET2 mutations, CHIP was significantly associated with worse survival (HR = 1.91; 95% CI: 1.43-2.56; P < 0.001, I2 = 0%), whereas DNMT3A mutations were not. In Western cohorts, CHIP was significantly associated with increased mortality (HR = 1.65; 95% CI: 1.28-2.12; P < 0.0001; I2 = 38.7%). Meta-regression identified body mass index (BMI) as a significant modifier of the CHIP-mortality association (P = 0.0069).
CHIP, particularly TET2-related mutations, is associated with poorer survival in patients with severe AVS undergoing valve replacement. In Western populations, CHIP was significantly associated with increased mortality. Higher BMI further strengthened this association across all patients. These findings indicate that CHIP may be a potential marker for risk stratification and preventive strategies, but confirmation in larger and more diverse cohorts is required."

Case reports,"Anomalous coronary artery from the opposite sinus is a rare congenital anomaly with potentially fatal outcomes. Anomalous right coronary artery (ARCA) with a malignant interarterial course is strongly linked to sudden cardiac death Beyond description of anatomy, optimal management requires careful diagnostic evaluation and individualized decision-making.
We present 3 cases of ARCA with malignant interarterial course: 1) an 80-year-old man with severe aortic stenosis, 2) a 61-year-old woman with exertional angina and interarterial narrowing, and 3) a 25-year-old asymptomatic woman with ventricular ectopy and significant proximal narrowing. Each case highlights unique diagnostic challenges and therapeutic considerations.
Coronary computed tomography angiography is the gold standard for defining anatomy, whereas functional testing, cardiac magnetic resonance, and invasive imaging refine risk stratification. Management ranges from surveillance with lifestyle modification in low-risk, asymptomatic patients to surgical correction (unroofing, reimplantation, or coronary artery bypass grafting) in young or high-risk individuals. We summarize these principles in a practical flowchart to guide clinicians.
Early recognition, structured diagnostic work-up, and risk-based individualized management are essential to prevent adverse outcomes in ARCA. This case series provides both illustrative clinical examples and an evidence-based framework for evaluation and management."

Accurate and sensitive detection of this abnormal expression remains challenging. Herein, we develop an innovative dual-mode photoelectrochemical/ratiometric fluorescence (PEC/RFL) biosensor based on G-quadruplex nanowire (G4 NW)-enhanced copper/cerium codoped carbon dots (CuCe-CDs) for exosomal lncRNA assays, using deep learning for artificial intelligence diagnosis of exosomal lncRNA. Target exosomal lncRNA triggers three-dimensional bipedal DNAzyme walkers to form numerous CuCe-CD-labeled G4 NWs (G4-CD NWs) with the joint help of K+ and bifunctional Mg2+. Since G4 NWs not only load abundant CuCe-CDs but also enhance the nanozyme activity and FL intensity of CuCe-CDs, a dual-mode PEC/RFL biosensor for the highly sensitive and accurate assay of exosomal lncRNA is built. Moreover, deep learning is utilized to excavate the potential pattern hidden in data of our established method and successfully distinguishes lung cancer in people with a diagnostic accuracy of 95.7%. We think that the developed biosensor combined with deep learning offers an innovative tool for exosomal lncRNA assays and early intelligent diagnosis of cancer."
PubMed,deep learning,Deep learning and TOPSIS-based multi-criteria decision-making framework for urban road defect detection and sustainable maintenance planning.,Zhaodong Zhong; Ziyan Ren,10.1038/s41598-025-31682-y,2025-12-17,Scientific reports,"In most cities, especially large ones, one of the most significant factors influencing the Quality of Life (QoL) is the urban and public transportation networks. In order to guarantee traffic safety, lower maintenance costs, and promote the sustainability of contemporary cities, urban road infrastructure must be maintained. Conventional techniques for identifying surface flaws in roads are frequently time-consuming, labor-intensive, and unable to satisfy the real-time requirements of intelligent urban management. However, most of the currently available models focus only on the detection of surface flaws without estimating the severity or linking the outcomes to actionable maintenance priorities. Such a solution makes their usage limited for real-time urban management and sustainability-based decision-making. To overcome these limitations, the present study has proposed an improved YOLOv8 model with an additional secondary head for severity classification and incorporated Multi-Criteria Decision-Making through TOPSIS. The new dual-framework model enables the simultaneous performance of detection, estimation of severity, and data-driven prioritization for maintenance planning, becoming a major leap beyond currently used one-dimensional methods of detection. The enhanced model presented in this research performs better than the original YOLOv8 with MCDM, according to results from experimental on the road defect detection dataset. Results show that the suggested framework can achieve a viable short-term strategy without sacrificing long-term effectiveness. It promotes proactive infrastructure upkeep, strengthens the resilience of urban mobility, and aids in the creation of more secure and sustainable transportation systems."

Consequently, developing approaches capable of extracting spatially relevant intercellular interaction information from scRNA-seq data is of substantial importance for elucidating mechanisms underlying disease initiation and progression.
Here, we present DeepPNCC, a novel deep learning framework that reconstructs pseudo-spatial cell-cell interaction networks (PSCCIs) from scRNA-seq data by leveraging latent spatial cues preserved in undissociated cell aggregates. Built on a variational graph autoencoder (VGAE) enhanced with adversarial regularization, DeepPNCC uniquely integrates local adjacency matrices derived from multiplet data, without relying on prior knowledge such as ligand-receptor pairs, to infer global, spatially informed interaction landscapes. DeepPNCC is available as an open-source Python package.
DeepPNCC outperforms existing methods in recovering interactions aligned with spatial transcriptomics across mouse brain and breast cancer datasets. In breast cancer, the inferred cell-cell interaction network reveals a closed-loop signaling axis in triple-negative breast cancer, in which cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) and perivascular-like cells (PVL) promote angiogenesis through the ADM-CALCRL-STAT1-CD40/CCL2/ICAM1 pathway. These findings provide important clues for elucidating the regulatory mechanisms of the tumor microenvironment.
DeepPNCC provides an efficient tool for spatially informed analysis of scRNA-seq data, enabling the reconstruction of pseudo-spatial cell-cell interaction networks from datasets lacking explicit spatial information. This approach expands the spatial analytical scope of scRNA-seq and facilitates mechanistic dissection of cellular ecosystems in both health and disease."
PubMed,deep learning,Decoding preparatory movement state-based motor imagery with multi layer energy decoder.,Yuxin Zhang; Mengfan Li; Miaomiao Guo; Guizhi Xu; Alan Wang,10.1186/s12984-025-01837-z,2025-12-17,Journal of neuroengineering and rehabilitation,"Motor imagery (MI) is a widely used paradigm in brain-computer interface (BCI) research due to its potential applications in areas such as motor rehabilitation. As a purely cognitive process, MI produces low-amplitude, non-stationary EEG. Despite improving accuracies, cross-subject variability and limited generalization continue to motivate approaches that strengthen MI representations and enhance system robustness.
We designed a task-guided preparatory movement state-based motor imagery (PMS-MI) paradigm that elicits a brief motor preparatory state before MI and captures EEG features from both the preparation and imagery phases. To decode the features effectively, we introduced a multilayer energy decoder (MLED) that integrates graph signal processing (GSP): EEG is modeled as intra- and cross-frequency multilayer brain networks, and a graph Fourier transform (GFT) projects the signals into network energy features before classification. We benchmarked the PMS-MI paradigm and the MLED method across multiple time window lengths using a panel of classical and deep-learning classifiers.
The PMS-MI paradigm elicited significant energy variations during the movement preparation phase and induced earlier event-related desynchronization (ERD) with broader frequency band activation during MI, compared to traditional MI paradigms. Classification performance using CSP in the PMS-MI paradigm surpassed that of the traditional paradigm at all time windows. Further accuracy improvements were achieved with the MLED method. Brain network analysis revealed distinct neural representations between the preparation and MI phases, and MLED effectively captured these differences. Feature fusion of preparation and MI stages resulted in classification accuracies exceeding 85% for both 1 s and 4 s windows. The results demonstrate that both algorithmic design and paradigm choice play important roles in MI EEG decoding, with their relative contributions varying across temporal windows and experimental conditions.
Integration of preparatory movement states into the movement imagery process can generate distinguishable features at different stages and improve the classification performance of BCI systems. The proposed PMS-MI paradigm, combined with the MLED decoding method, provides a promising direction for developing more accurate and robust BCIs, particularly in the context of neurorehabilitation."
PubMed,deep learning,Structured reflective sessions enhance knowledge and clinical skills in operating room technology students: a Solomon four-group study.,Nasser Hassani Nia; Sahar Karami; Farimah Shahraki; Mahmoud Kohan,10.1186/s12909-025-08431-w,2025-12-18,BMC medical education,"Clinical education plays a critical role in preparing operating room technology students for high-stakes, procedure-intensive environments. However, traditional training methods often fail to promote deep, transferable learning and structured reflective habits. Importantly, the effectiveness of structured reflective sessions in operating room technology education remains underexplored. This study therefore aimed to evaluate whether structured reflective sessions improve theoretical knowledge, practical skills, and educational satisfaction among operating room technology students.
We conducted a Solomon four-group quasi-experimental study to separate the effects of the reflection-based intervention, pre-testing, and their interaction. Sixty undergraduate students in the 3rd and 5th semesters were assigned to four groups (intervention with pre-test, control with pre-test, intervention without pre-test, control without pre-test). The intervention used Gibbs' six-stage model and comprised a 2-hour introductory workshop, weekly scenario-based analyses and guided small-group discussions over six weeks, and individual reflective journaling during clinical placements. Data were collected with a validated 20-item MCQ, Direct Observation of Procedural Skills (DOPS) checklists, and a standardized satisfaction questionnaire. Statistical analyses included paired and independent t-tests, ANCOVA (to adjust for baseline scores), and two-way ANOVA (to test pre-test × treatment interactions).
Participants in the intervention groups showed significantly higher post-test MCQ scores (mean = 17.46 vs. 12.86; p < 0.001) and higher DOPS scores (mean = 88.8 vs. 53.0; p < 0.001) compared with controls. Educational satisfaction was also greater in the intervention arm (mean = 78.35 vs. 70.97; p < 0.001). Solomon-design analyses indicated that these gains were attributable to the reflective intervention and not to pre-test sensitization. The intervention produced a large effect on clinical experience scores (partial η² = 0.41).
Structured reflective sessions, delivered via Gibbs' reflective cycle, significantly enhance theoretical understanding, psychomotor performance, and learner satisfaction among operating room technology students. We recommend integrating structured reflective practice into clinical curricula to strengthen the depth and sustainability of professional learning in high-complexity clinical settings."

In Japan, the serum biomarkers surfactant protein-D (SP-D) and KL-6 are commonly used to monitor interstitial lung diseases (ILD) in clinical practice, but their potential role in the early detection of lung fibrosis has not yet been fully clarified. Although chest radiography is also considered a possible tool for identifying subclinical pulmonary fibrosis, detecting early-stage disease remains challenging. A deep learning-based software, BMAX, was recently developed to identify fibrosing ILD on chest radiographs. Its capability to detect lung fibrosis in a health-checkup setting requires validation.
Study participants were randomly recruited from individuals undergoing routine health examinations. All participants underwent chest radiography and serum SP-D and KL-6 testing. Those with elevated biomarker levels (≥ 110 ng/mL for SP-D and ≥ 500 IU/mL for KL-6) or radiographic abnormalities were advised to undergo further evaluation with chest computed tomography (CT). Lung fibrosis on CT was assessed independently by one pulmonologist and one thoracic radiologist. BMAX assigned a confidence score for lung fibrosis (ranging from 0 to 1) on each radiograph. In participants who underwent CT, the sensitivity and specificity of BMAX (using a confidence score > 0.3 as the threshold), SP-D, and KL-6 for detecting lung fibrosis were evaluated.
Among the 2,751 individuals enrolled, 228 were recommended for CT, and 81 underwent the scan. Lung fibrosis was identified on chest CT in 8 of the 81 participants. The positivity rates for SP-D, KL-6, and BMAX (confidence score > 0.3) were 5.9%, 2.4%, and 5.9%, respectively. SP-D showed a sensitivity of 1.000 and a specificity of 0.315, while KL-6 showed a sensitivity of 0.750 and a specificity of 0.753. BMAX demonstrated a sensitivity of 1.000 and a specificity of 0.904.
SP-D and KL-6 may be useful screening biomarkers for lung fibrosis in health checkup settings, offering high sensitivity and moderate positivity rates. BMAX also appears promising as a standalone screening tool for detecting lung fibrosis on chest radiographs."

These methods often struggle to adapt to varying process conditions and equipment configurations, which are common in modern fabrications (fabs). Furthermore, previous research has typically relied on simplified simulators of cluster tools, failing to capture the full complexity of real-world semiconductor manufacturing equipment. To address these challenges, this study examines the potential of deep reinforcement learning (DRL) for optimizing cluster tool scheduling. This research presents a comprehensive simulation environment that models a cluster tool system, including both vacuum (VTM) and atmospheric (ATM) robots. This study progressively evaluates DRL agents, starting with a single-agent deep Q-network (DQN) and advancing to a multi-agent DQN (MADQN) framework to schedule the combined VTM-ATM system. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed DRL agents consistently outperform traditional rule-based methods in terms of productivity and adaptability. In the complex multi-agent environment, the MADQN agent demonstrated robust performance across all tested configurations, achieving a productivity improvement of up to 8.9% over standard rule-based scheduling methods. These findings highlight the potential of DRL to overcome the limitations of existing scheduling methods and significantly enhance productivity in semiconductor manufacturing."

Despite advances in deep learning for medical image segmentation, maintaining airway continuity remains a challenge, particularly due to intra-class imbalance between large and small branches and blurred CT details. To address these challenges, we propose a progressive curriculum learning pipeline and a Scale-Enhanced U-Net (SE-UNet) to improve detail extraction, thereby enhancing segmentation continuity. Compared with previous connectivity-aware methods, our framework directly tackles the imbalance between large and small branches through end-to-end progressive learning, while balancing airway tree completeness and accuracy. Specifically, our curriculum learning pipeline comprises three stages. Stage 1 performs coarse learning to extract main airways. Stage 2 introduces a General Union Loss (GUL) to improve the identification of smaller airways. In Stage 3, we propose an Adaptive Topology-Responsive Loss (ATRL), which encourages the network to focus on preserving airway continuity. Throughout all stages, a crop sampling strategy is employed to reduce feature interference between airways of varying scales, effectively addressing the intra-class imbalance. The progressive training pipeline shares the same SE-UNet, integrating multi-scale inputs and Detail Information Enhancers (DIEs) to enhance information flow and effectively capture the intricate details of small airways. Additionally, we propose a robust airway tree parsing method and hierarchical evaluation metrics to provide more clinically relevant and precise analysis. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms existing approaches on the ATM'22 challenge dataset and achieves a 9.631% improvement in the Tree length Detection rate (TD) of small airways and a 4.622% improvement in the Branch Detection rate (BD) of the overall airway tree on our in-house dataset, thereby significantly enhancing small-airway accuracy and overall airway tree completeness."

However, the high dimensionality and complexity of omics data present major challenges. Computational approaches that extract stable biomarkers and enable reliable classification across cancer types and stages are needed.
A novel feature selection method, sDCFE (synergistic Discriminative Cluster-based Feature Extraction), was developed by extending Fisher-like variance analysis with a median absolute deviation (MAD) regularization term and a cluster separation component to enhance robustness and interpretability. Features selected by sDCFE were compared with those obtained from XGBoost, and the intersected set of 82 genes was evaluated through functional enrichment (KEGG, Reactome, GO BP), survival analysis (Kaplan-Meier, Cox regression), and biomarker novelty assessment against six external resources. Hybrid classification models integrating XGBoost, sDCFE, and deep learning were applied to pancancer classification, and the framework was further extended to lung squamous cell carcinoma (LUSC) staging using RNA-seq and methylation data.
The overlap between sDCFE and XGBoost yielded 82 candidate biomarkers enriched in cancer-related pathways, including cell cycle regulation, immune signalling, and DNA repair. Novelty assessment stratified these genes into established, emerging, and novel categories. Six genes-HFE2, LOC339674, SERINC2, SFTA3, SOX2OT, and ACPP-emerged as the most promising candidates, supported by enrichment and survival associations across multiple cancers. The hybrid model achieved near-perfect pancancer classification on TCGA (accuracy = 99.3%, MCC = 0.992, AUC = 1.0) and demonstrated strong generalizability on PCAWG (accuracy = 94%, MCC = 0.929, AUC = 0.997). In the LUSC staging task, multiomics integration improved classification performance: the CNN-based model reached 84% accuracy, while logistic regression applied to sDCFE-ranked features achieved 88.5% accuracy with superior calibration, highlighting the robustness of the selected features.
sDCFE provides a principled extension of Fisher-like methods, enabling stable and interpretable biomarker selection. When combined with XGBoost and deep learning, the framework achieves highly accurate and biologically grounded cancer classification across both cancer types and stages. The identification of novel and prognostic biomarkers, including HFE2, LOC339674, SERINC2, SFTA3, SOX2OT, and ACPP, underscores its translational potential. These results position the framework as a promising precision oncology tool to support early diagnosis, risk stratification, and treatment decision-making."

This work explores AL7075 T6 AWJ-based Deep Hole Drilling (DHD) using a full factorial design with accurate modeling and optimization performed through machine learning and evolutionary algorithms. The objective is to investigate the influence of process parameters and to model, and predict the optimal AWJ-DHD settings, such as waterjet pressure, standoff distance, and abrasive mass flow rate, on drilling qualities including geometrical and dimensional precision (kerf angle, kerf ratio), surface roughness, and drilling efficiency. Four machine learning models, Adaptive Boosted Regression (ABR), Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGB), Decision Tree (DT), and Random Forest (RF) were developed with experimental data to enhance prediction accuracy and process efficiency. Among the developed models, RF had the lowest testing error value for all responses with root mean square values of 0.046 (kerf angle), 0.0078 (kerf ratio), 0.044 (surface roughness), and 0.027 (drilling rate). Moth-Flame Optimization (MFO), Differential Evolution (DE), and Sine Cosine Algorithm (SCA) were used for multi-response optimization of AWJ deep hole drilling parameters. The optimal algorithm for each response was selected using Deng's similarity-based ranking. The ranking revealed SCA algorithm outperformed MFO and DE. The SCA algorithm discovered optimal parameter setting for AWJ-DHD as a water pressure of 350 MPa, standoff distance of 1.5 mm, and an abrasive mass flow rate of 300 g/min. Under these conditions, the predicted responses were a kerf angle of 0.048⁰, kerf ratio of 0.011, a surface roughness of 1.438 μm, and a drilling rate 0.769 mm/s.

This study introduces, ViTTL, lightweight deep learning framework for assessing the severity of AD using MRI data. ViTTL integrates Vision Transformers (ViT) with pre-trained convolutional neural networks utilized in transfer learning mode, to extract informative features from 2D MRI slices. Among the evaluated combinations, the ViT-DenseNet201 model integrated with an artificial neural network (ANN) classifier achieved the highest classification accuracy (99.89%) on the OASIS dataset. To ensure interpretability, we incorporated LIME and GRAD-CAM method, which consistently focus on cortical and hippocampal regions known to be associated with Alzheimer's pathology. The average Dice similarity coefficient across runs was 0.85 with a standard deviation of 0.03, indicating high consistency in the model's focus regions against ground truth annotations by expert radiologists. ViTTL also achieved a substantial reduction in model size from 83.0 MB to 6.47 MB enabling deployment in resource-limited environments without compromising performance. Validation on an independent dataset (Kaggle) and comparative performance analysis against state-of-the-art methods further support the robustness and generalizability.

In this paper, we propose a Multi-Scale Fusion U-Net architecture (MFU-Net), aiming to achieve significant recognition performance through straightforward enhancements to the traditional U-Net design. Specifically, we design a multi-scale feature fusion module within the skip connections of the U-Net architecture to effectively integrate multi-scale semantic and spatial information. This is followed by the incorporation of a multi-head attention mechanism in the bottleneck layer to enhance the recognition of critical feature regions. Finally, a weighted class-balanced loss is introduced into the loss function to improve the model's ability to identify minority classes.

However, existing methods rely heavily on manual or semi-automated annotations, limiting scalability and broader applicability. We introduce a highly automated training dataset generation pipeline that combines one-shot detection with systematic refinement, producing tens of thousands of high-quality annotations from bright-field microscopy while significantly reducing manual effort and annotation costs. Using multi-regional datasets from France, Hungary, and Sweden, we trained object detection models on seven pollen taxa and evaluated their performance on both external pure and mixed species slides and real-world airborne samples. We assessed the reusability of pretrained vision models for pollen detection, aiming to reduce the need for extensive retraining. Using linear probing, we identified foundational Vision Transformers (ViTs) as the most effective feature extractors and integrated them into Faster R-CNN detection models. We benchmarked these models against ResNet50, a widely adopted backbone in biological imaging. On held-out regions of the training datasets, our models achieved high performance in both classification and detection tasks. On independent reference slides from other datasets, ViTs continued to outperform ResNet50 in classification. However, in full object detection and under real deployment conditions, ResNet50-based models remained competitive and achieved the highest accuracy for detecting Ambrosia, a major allergen with public health significance. Cross-dataset generalization remains a challenge, underscoring the need for domain adaptation techniques such as stain normalization and data augmentation. This study establishes a scalable framework for AI-assisted pollen monitoring, supporting large-scale slide digitization and enabling applications in long-term ecological research, allergen surveillance, and automated biodiversity assessment."
PubMed,deep learning,MRI-based deep learning and radiomics pipeline for myxoid liposarcoma: a feasibility study in a rare sarcoma.,Jakob Steiner; Marcus Bloice; Jasminka Igrec; Bernadette Liegl-Atzwanger; Andreas Leithner; Michael Fuchsjäger; Martin Urschler,10.1038/s41598-025-27217-0,2025-12-17,Scientific reports,"Myxoid liposarcoma (MLPS) is a rare soft tissue sarcoma characterized by histopathological variability, which poses challenges for accurate grading and treatment planning. This study evaluated the feasibility of an automated MRI-based pipeline that combines deep learning and radiomics for non-invasive tumor assessment. In a retrospective multicenter cohort of 48 patients with histologically confirmed MLPS, a 3D U-Net convolutional neural network was trained to perform automatic tumor segmentation on axial T2-weighted MR images. Radiomics features were subsequently extracted from the segmented volumes and used to train a Random Forest classifier for predicting tumor grade, defined by centralized histopathological review according to WHO criteria. The segmentation model achieved a median Dice similarity coefficient of 0.892. The radiomics-based grading classifier reached a mean area under the curve of 0.745, with an F1-score of 0.729 and a balanced accuracy of 0.723 in distinguishing high-grade from low-grade tumors. Most classification errors occurred in borderline or histologically heterogeneous cases. These findings suggest that automated segmentation and radiomics analysis may offer valuable support for MLPS grading and complement histopathology, particularly in diagnostically complex cases. Further prospective validation in larger cohorts is warranted."

This study assessed whether deep-learning (DL) reconstruction can yield diagnostic-quality images from a 5-min scan.
We retrospectively analysed 207 studies (1035 slices) obtained between April 2018 and June 2020. After cropping to 64 × 64 striatal regions, 600, 185 and 250 images from 120, 37 and 50 patients were used for training, validation and testing. Six convolutional architectures-U-Net (one-five depths), V-Net, U-Net +  + , R2U-Net, Attention U-Net and TransUNet-were trained to translate 5-min into virtual 25-min images. Image quality was assessed with peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) and structural similarity index (SSIM), analysed by Friedman and Dunn-Holm tests. A blinded reader study involved three nuclear medicine physicians grading 50 cases (100 striata) on a four-point scale; agreement with the 25-min consensus was measured by weighted κ and intra-/inter-observer intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC).
All DL reconstructions significantly outperformed raw 5-min images in PSNR and SSIM (p < 0.01). The four-layer U-Net achieved the highest quality (PSNR 32.7 ± 1.7 dB, SSIM 0.842 ± 0.069), ≈1.8 dB and 0.13 higher than baseline, and statistically indistinguishable from 25-min images (p > 0.05). Reader concordance improved from fair with baseline (κ = 0.29-0.41) to substantial with the four-layer U-Net (κ = 0.62-0.70); intra-reader ICC was 0.84-0.93 and inter-reader ICC 0.73-0.75.
A compact four-layer U-Net restores diagnostic fidelity to 5-min 123I-ioflupane SPECT, enabling an 80% reduction in scan time without loss of quantitative metrics or interpretability. DL-accelerated protocols may enhance comfort, reduce motion artefacts and increase throughput, warranting prospective multicentre validation."
PubMed,deep learning,Advanced deep-learning model for temporal-dependent prediction of dynamic behavior of AC losses in superconducting propulsion motors for hydrogen-powered cryo-electric aircraft.,Shahin Alipour Bonab; Frederick Berg; Wenjuan Song; Alexandre Colle; Mohammad Yazdani-Asrami,10.1038/s44172-025-00554-8,2025-12-17,Communications engineering,"Superconducting motors offer high power density, compactness, and efficiency for hydrogen-powered cryo-electric aircraft, but AC operation in cryogenic temperatures produces thermal losses that must be estimated accurately and rapidly at the design stage to optimize efficiency, minimize cryogenic heat load, and maximize specific power density. Traditional modeling approaches fall short-Finite-element is too slow/costly for system-level models, analytical models and look-up tables lack accuracy/flexibility, and earlier intelligent models gave only cycle-averaged (static) losses. Here we demonstrate AI can rapidly and accurately predict dynamic AC losses for superconducting propulsion motors. Using a large dataset of motor configurations, our AI-driven approach both predicts cycle-averaged and time-dependent morphology of instantaneous AC loss waveforms across various operating conditions and generalizes to unseen designs. Integrated into system-level model-based design, these AI-surrogate models enable rapid model trials, compliance checks, and the discovery of integration issues within simulated environments before propulsion motor deployment. Our deep learning-based model achieves a prediction time of less than 9 ms with a 99.97% accuracy (R2), making it suitable for system-level modeling of electric powertrains in hydrogen-powered cryo-electric aircraft. Furthermore, we benchmarked 14 AI and 2 mathematical fitting techniques for estimating average AC losses, providing comparative performance analysis. The results highlight that AI-based surrogate models enable high-accuracy, low-latency loss predictions to achieve optimal performance in superconducting propulsion motors in aircraft powertrain design."

PubMed,deep learning,A holistic framework for strengthening security of healthcare data through encryption utilizing blockchain technology.,Pokuri Venkataradhakrishnamurty; K Malathi,10.1038/s41598-025-31698-4,2025-12-18,Scientific reports,"Healthcare data security is increasingly critical due to the sensitive nature of patient information and the rising prevalence of cyber-attacks on medical systems. Existing techniques to security enhancement are evaluated, demonstrating their limits and emphasizing the urgent need for novel solutions. To address these issues, this study proposes a Blockchain-integrated Advanced Encryption Standard (BCT-AES) framework to enhance the privacy, integrity, and security of healthcare data. The framework combines Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) for feature extraction, Decision Tree (DT) and Logistic Regression (LR) for classification, and AES encryption integrated with blockchain technology to provide a decentralized, tamper-proof storage solution. In this hybrid design, CNN extracts meaningful patterns from patient records and medical images, which are then classified by DT and LR models to facilitate predictive analytics while maintaining data confidentiality. Sensitive information is encrypted using AES before being recorded on the blockchain, ensuring robust access control and immutability. It further strengthens the data security and integrity when applied with AES. The results are carried out with Python software, meaning the proposed method has practicality in real life. The performance of the proposed BCT-AES framework was quantitatively validated, showing an average encryption time of 1.12 milliseconds, significantly outperforming existing methods such as AES-CP-IDABE (10.52 ms), Enhanced AES (20.9 ms), and AES-CBC (2.4 ms). Additionally, the framework demonstrated high classification accuracies, with DT achieving 99% and LR achieving 89%, indicating reliable predictive capabilities. By integrating deep learning with advanced encryption and blockchain, the proposed approach offers a practical and efficient solution for secure healthcare data management, supporting real-time analytics while preserving patient privacy."

Following the acquisition of informed consent, participants were assessed using various measures, including demographic and obstetric information, the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale, the Corona Disease Anxiety Scale (CDAS), and the NEO Personality Inventory-Revised during their third trimester of pregnancy. The same group of participants completed the Edinburgh Depression Scale and the Corona Disease Anxiety Scale (CDAS) 4-6 weeks after childbirth.                                                           Results and Discussion:                     There was a significant correlation between family income, unwanted pregnancy as perceived by both the mother and father, and antenatal depression. Additionally, marital satisfaction played a significant role in postpartum depression. Furthermore, antenatal depression was significantly associated with neuroticism, agreeableness, and physical symptoms related to Corona disease anxiety. Personality traits, with the exception of extroversion and conscientiousness, and various domains of Corona disease anxiety, excluding psychological symptoms, were also significantly associated with postpartum depression.                                                           Conclusion:                     During pandemics or epidemics, such as the COVID-19 outbreak, experiencing mental distress during pregnancy can contribute to mental health issues during the postpartum period. This risk is particularly true in individuals with unique personality traits, emphasizing the need for increased focus on mental health within prenatal care during these crises."

Method:                     This cross-sectional study was conducted in Kerman, Iran. Data were collected from patients who visited Afzalipour Hospital in Kerman more than twice during the COVID-19 epidemic from the end of February 2020 to March 21, 2021. We conducted two key analyses: 1. Mixed effect logistic regression was used to check the relationship between the variables and COVID-19 severity. 2. Mixed effect linear regression was used to check the relationship between the variables and the length of stay in the hospital.                                                           Results:                     The findings indicated that the most important risk factors for the severity of COVID-19 were heart diseases (OR=1.67,95%CI:1.20-2.30), increasing age (OR=2.23 for age&gt;54, 95%CI:1.70- 2.90), male gender (OR=1.47,95%CI:1.10-1.96), respiratory diseases other than asthma, and frequency of admission (OR=1.60,95%CI:1.20-2.15). All patients who underwent readmission experienced a shorter duration of hospitalization during their subsequent admission (OR=0.94,95%CI:0.91,0.96) and had a higher mortality rate (30% within 14 days, 26.6% between 14-90 days). Patients readmitted at intervals of 14-90 days and greater than 90 days exhibited lower disease severity compared to those readmitted within the 0-14 day period.                                                           Conclusion:                     Examining readmissions, the severity of COVID-19, and the length of hospital stay in affected patients are important factors for planning and allocating resources for COVID-19 management and treatment. These factors can help policymakers develop effective clinical guidelines for hospitalization or outpatient treatment of COVID-19 patients and contribute to reducing the burden of disease in the community."

Kinovea, as an accessible motion-analysis software, provides both visual and quantitative feedback. However, its application in supporting technique development among beginner athletes remains insufficiently explored. Aim: This study aims to describe the use of Kinovea in biomechanics training and examine its contribution to the awareness of kinematic characteristics and movement techniques among beginner athletes. Methods: A descriptive qualitative design involved 72 beginner athletes aged 18–25 years selected through purposive sampling. Data were collected over 16 weeks through interviews, field observations, and motion video recordings analyzed using Kinovea. Kinematic data focused on joint angles, stride behavior, and movement phases during walking, running, and the flight phase. Qualitative data were analyzed using content analysis with NVivo 12, while kinematic results were interpreted descriptively to identify performance patterns and areas for technical refinement. Result: Kinematic analysis showed coordinated joint-angle patterns across all phases. Walking analysis identified arm swing angles of 50.9°–58.8° and leg separation angles of 64.3°–67.2°, indicating a stable gait rhythm. The running analysis revealed knee angles of 68.8°–69.8° and elbow angles of 87.6°–89.1°, indicating efficient propulsive mechanics. The flight phase demonstrated knee angles of 81.2°–87.8° and elbow angles of 80.4°–88.3°, suggesting effective momentum use and postural stability. These measurements supported stride-efficiency assessment and technique evaluation. Qualitative findings revealed that Kinovea enabled athletes to interpret movement phases and identify technical inefficiencies through slow-motion and frame-by-frame visualization. Conclusion: Kinovea supports basic motion analysis by providing clear kinematic information and helping beginner athletes observe and refine their movement techniques. The findings also offer practical value for coaches by enabling more precise identification of inefficient patterns and guiding targeted corrections during early-stage training."

OpenAlex,aortic stenosis,Outcomes of Surgical versus Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement: A Clinical Review,"Stang, Grace",,2026-01-01,Digital Commons - Gardner-Webb University (Gardner–Webb University),"Introduction: Surgical aortic valve replacement (SAVR) has been the predominant treatment for aortic stenosis (AS) for decades. However, transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) is becoming increasingly popular. Originally, TAVRs were only performed on patients who were deemed high-risk for surgery and would have died without the valve replacement. The purpose of this paper is to determine if TAVR or SAVR has better health outcomes for all patients no matter their surgical risk. Methods: A search via PubMed database was done using the key words “aortic stenosis”, “surgical aortic valve replacement”, “transcatheter aortic valve replacement”, and “mortality.” Additional search filters were applied for randomized control trials, systematic reviews, and meta- analyses. Dates were restricted to the last 5 years, and restrictions were added for English language and free full text only. This yielded 67 results and 5 were selected. Results: Of the five reviewed articles, all were meta-analyses and one systematic review. There was a total of 52122 patients. Primary endpoints across all articles were that there is no significant difference between TAVR and SAVR in the outcomes studied. Discussion: This review of studies provided supportive evidence that both TAVR and SAVR are valid treatment options or AS. TAVR had better short-term outcomes while SAVR had better long-term outcomes."

Multidetector computed tomography (MDCT)-derived methods for calculating aortic valve area (AVA) may improve diagnostic concordance, but their diagnostic performance, validation against invasive hemodynamics, and the influence of left ventricular outflow tract (LVOT) morphology on severity grading remain insufficiently investigated. Methods: We retrospectively analyzed 307 patients with normal-flow, high-gradient calcific AS who underwent echocardiography, MDCT, and cardiac catheterization. AVA was calculated using (1) echocardiographic LVOT diameter, (2) hybrid Doppler–MDCT planimetric LVOT area, and (3) corrected echocardiographic LVOT diameter (×1.13). Agreement, correlation, and diagnostic performance were assessed using Bland–Altman analysis, Pearson correlation, ROC analysis, and McNemar’s test. Subgroups defined by diagnostic concordance and MDCT-derived LVOT size were compared using ANOVA. Results: Hybrid AVA showed a strong correlation with echocardiographic AVA (r = 0.749, p &lt; 0.001), with a mean difference of +0.11 ± 0.15 cm2. Both methods demonstrated similar relationships with invasive and non-invasive hemodynamic markers of AS severity. When combined with echocardiography, the hybrid method increased concordant classification of severe AS by 8%. In contrast, corrected AVA performed significantly worse, leading to more discordant classifications. LVOT size was significantly associated with variability in AVA and Doppler velocity index, independent of flow status. Conclusions: Hybrid MDCT-derived AVA provides diagnostic performance equivalent to echocardiography and improves concordance in selected patients. LVOT size influences key echocardiographic parameters and may warrant tailored diagnostic thresholds."

The advent of transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) has revolutionized the treatment of patients previously considered ineligible for surgical aortic valve replacement (SAVR). TAVR provides a relatively safe intervention that leads to improvements in survival, symptoms, and functional status within months of implantation. A major complication following TAVR is the occurrence of paravalvular leaks (PVLs), which have been associated with increased mortality and higher rates of heart failure-related hospitalizations. PVLs refer to abnormal blood flow between the implanted valve and the aortic wall, which can compromise the functionality of the device. Careful pre-procedural planning enables the identification of patients at higher risk for PVL development. Although the incidence of PVLs has decreased with the introduction of newer-generation transcatheter valves, the condition remains clinically relevant. Due to the complex anatomy of the aortic valve apparatus and interference from the prosthetic frame, accurate evaluation of PVLs requires a multimodal diagnostic approach. Current evidence on PVL management is limited. In most cases, a conservative approach is adopted, while interventional strategies (such as pre- and post-dilatation, percutaneous PVL closure, and TAVR-in-TAVR) are reserved for selected patients. We performed a systematic literature review to summarize the incidence, predictors, diagnostic techniques, and management strategies of PVLs following TAVR."

Surgical intervention remains challenging, especially in high-risk individuals with significant comorbidities. Case: We report the case of a 58-year-old male with Marfanoid features, a history of spontaneous pneumothorax, and chronic smoking (45 pack-years), who presented with acute aortic dissection extending from the ascending aorta to the aortoiliac bifurcation. Preoperative transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) revealed severe aortic insufficiency. The patient underwent successful aortic root replacement using the Tirone David procedure. Postoperative imaging (TTE and CT scans) confirmed a well-positioned aortic root graft, with no evidence of stenosis or regurgitation. Conclusion: This case demonstrates the efficacy of the Tirone David procedure in managing extensive aortic dissection with aortic insufficiency in high-risk patients, offering durable outcomes and valve preservation."

Since these processes can be involved in diseases like cardiac valve stenosis or aortic aneurysms, predicting possible blood flow alterations and their effects on the cellular structure of the aortic wall is a highly relevant aim in medical research. While theoretical models have been established to describe and predict flow characteristics, the development of more flexible and precise experimental methods to generate different flow patterns and quantify flow-induced changes in cellular structures remains a challenge. For this purpose, we present a chip-based flow setup that allows for the analysis of cultured human aortic endothelial cells (HAEC) under versatile and easily tunable flow conditions via generation of surface acoustic waves (SAW). To address the question if exposure of endothelial cells to acoustically induced streaming in our setup leads to short-term changes in cellular structure, we cultivate HAEC cells for 3 h and show that the morphology and actin cytoskeletal structure is altered depending on the intensity of the surface acoustic wave and the resulting applied shear stress. Future applications of our experimental setup could facilitate predictions of early changes in the structure of cells in the aortic wall that are induced by aortic dysfunctions and blood flow alterations."

While small defects may remain asymptomatic, larger perimembranous defects are frequently associated with significant hemodynamic compromise and progressive valvular dysfunction. We describe the case of a 12-year-old boy with a large perimembranous VSD who presented with recurrent dull, intermittent chest pain, dyspnea, and easy fatigue, symptoms not typically emphasized in pediatric VSD cases. Echocardiography revealed a 5 mm left-to-right shunt (Vmax 4.6 m/s), severe subaortic stenosis due to a subaortic membrane (aortic Vmax 5.4 m/s), and grade II aortic insufficiency. Laboratory tests demonstrated markedly elevated C-reactive protein levels (36.1), indicating systemic inflammation and possible infectious complications. Management included infection control, daily Tansopril therapy, and surgical intervention, with plans for long-term follow-up using echocardiography and laboratory monitoring. When compared with published pediatric cases from Argentina and India, which primarily reported progressive aortic regurgitation and left ventricular outflow tract obstruction, respectively, our case is distinctive due to its initial dominant presentation of chest pain and its strong inflammatory profile. This underscores the heterogeneity of clinical manifestations in VSD and highlights the need for individualized evaluation and treatment strategies to prevent progression and long-term morbidity."

Rigolin,10.1001/jamacardio.2025.4561,2025-12-17,JAMA Cardiology,"Importance Primary mitral regurgitation (MR) is a prevalent valvular lesion. Current American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association guidelines include class I recommendations for intervention for severe primary MR at the onset of symptoms, significant left ventricular (LV) enlargement (end-systolic dimension ≥40 mm), or dysfunction (ejection fraction ≤60%), with a class IIA recommendation for mitral valve repair when performed at an experienced surgical center. Recent data suggest a survival penalty when waiting for class I surgical guideline indications, and novel markers of decompensation are under investigation. Observations Comprehensive assessment of MR severity using echocardiography is critical, and when warranted, cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) is complementary. Assessment of LV size and function, as well as serial changes in both, is crucial for determining timing of surgery. New-onset atrial fibrillation, left atrial enlargement, pulmonary hypertension, and exercise-induced changes in LV function should also be considered in borderline scenarios. The roles of LV volumes, global longitudinal strain, CMR-derived measures of myocardial dysfunction, and cardiac biomarkers are worthy of further investigation regarding consideration for early surgical intervention. Conclusions and Relevance A more refined approach incorporating assessment of extravalvular cardiac injury, novel imaging markers, and biomarkers is needed to optimize surgical timing in primary MR. Further research is warranted to validate these emerging parameters and refine guidelines to improve patient outcomes."

Understanding the mechanism of MR, whether primary, due to intrinsic valve abnormalities, or secondary, resulting from atrial or ventricular remodeling, is essential for optimal management. Echocardiography, particularly advanced modalities such as three-dimensional imaging and strain analysis, plays a central role in this process. It allows accurate quantification of MR severity, detailed characterization of valve and ventricular anatomy, and assessment of remodeling, all of which are critical for determining the optimal timing for intervention. Beyond diagnosis, echocardiography is indispensable in guiding therapy selection: it informs surgical planning by defining leaflet pathology for repair versus replacement strategies, and directs transcatheter interventions by guiding interatrial septal puncture, catheter orientation, and device deployment in real time. While surgery remains the gold standard for primary MR, transcatheter approaches including edge-to-edge repair and emerging mitral valve replacement are increasingly relevant, particularly in patients at high surgical risk or with complex anatomy. This review emphasizes the pivotal role of echocardiography in the pre-procedural assessment of MR, highlighting its ability to integrate anatomical, functional, and hemodynamic information to guide patient-tailored therapeutic strategies and optimize outcomes within a Heart Team framework."

OpenAlex,mitral regurgitation,Three-Dimensional Echocardiographic Approach to Mitral Valve After Transcatheter Edge-to-Edge Repair,Rishi Kumar; Serena S. Dasani; Kara G. Fields; Guillem Roca; Lauren Cornella; Douglas C. Shook; Charles Nyman; Sula Nasra; Chinyere Archie; Pinak Shah; Stanton K. Shernan; Sergey Karamnov,10.1213/ane.0000000000007756,2025-12-15,Anesthesia & Analgesia,"BACKGROUND: Evaluation of the mitral valve during transcatheter edge-to-edge repair (TEER) for management of mitral regurgitation is commonly guided by intraprocedural interventional transesophageal echocardiography (TEE). The risk of iatrogenic mitral stenosis (MS) remains a concern, particularly in patients requiring multiple clips, since the mitral valve orifice area (MVA) is reduced. The value of conventional flow-based echocardiographic methods to rule out MS is limited by intraprocedural and general anesthesia (GA)-induced hemodynamic variability. This retrospective study introduces the novel adaptation of a 3-dimensional (3D) Orifice Area (3DOA) technique to evaluate post-TEER MVA. We evaluated the degree of agreement between MVAs derived via TEE 3DOA, TEE pressure half-time (PHT), and postprocedure transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) PHT with patients awake. METHODS: TEE and TTE images from 20 adult patients with severe mitral regurgitation undergoing a TEER (MitraClip, Abbott) procedure were retrospectively reviewed. MVAs obtained by MTEE 3DOA and TEE PHT under GA were compared to those acquired with TTE PHT with patients awake. Agreement was assessed via calculation of Bland–Altman 95% limits of agreement and Lin’s concordance correlation coefficients, both with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). RESULTS: There was good agreement between TEE 3DOA-derived MVA measurements under GA and TTE PHT-derived MVA measurements in awake patients, as reflected by Bland–Altman (lower limit of agreement: −.0.45 [95% CI, −.58 to −.31] and upper limit of agreement: 0.26 [95% CI, 0.12–0.4]), and an excellent concordance correlation coefficient value (0.95 [95% CI, 0.86–0.98]). In contrast, agreement between TEE PHT-derived MVA and TTE PHT-derived MVA was weak, with much broader limits of agreement (lower limit of agreement: −1.6 [95% CI, −2.19 to −1.02] and upper limit of agreement: 1.43 [95% CI, 0.84–2.01]) and a weak concordance correlation coefficient value (0.46 [95% CI, 0.02–0.75]). CONCLUSIONS: In this retrospective cohort study, we demonstrated excellent agreement between TEE-3DOA-derived MVA under GA and TTE PHT-derived MVA in awake patients, but not between TEE versus TTE PHT. These findings warrant further validation in larger patient datasets to assess the utility of 3D echocardiographic approaches in evaluating MVA after TEER."

Due to similarity in their risk factors and pathophysiology, an association between diabetic retinopathy (DR) and cardiovascular events is expected. The objective of the study was to analyze the effects of different types of DR on left ventricular hypertrophy and dysfunction in patients with type 2 diabetes. Material and Methods: A hospital-based analytical cross-sectional study was conducted from 2020 to 2022 in a tertiary care facility in Tamil Nadu, and it analyzed the data of patients with type 2 diabetes for over 5 years. The participants were divided into two groups: Non-proliferative DR (NPDR) and proliferative DR (PDR). Results: In the present study, with respect to DR, the echo results showed a strong connection between the left ventricular mass, end diastolic diameter, mean E wave/A wave ratio, and mean isovolumetric relaxation time. There was also a correlation between the echo results and the volume of the mitral regurgitation jet. Furthermore, we found that 29 cases with left ventricular dysfunction (LVD) had NPDR, while 32 cases without LVD had PDR ( P &lt; 0.05). Conclusion: Regular screening of all diabetic patients for potential complications, followed by strain echocardiography for high-risk individuals, is crucial for early detection and management. It is a cost-effective strategy for diagnosis, treatment, and prognosis. A key takeaway from this study is the importance of identifying high-risk patients during their asymptomatic stage by assessing microvascular complications."

Case summary A 42-year-old immunocompetent man with no structural heart disease or recent interventions presented with fever and dyspnoea. Blood cultures grew Lactobacillus rhamnosus. Transoesophageal echocardiography revealed a large vegetation on the aortic valve causing severe regurgitation, along with severe mitral regurgitation due to anterior leaflet perforation. The only identifiable risk factor was regular probiotic consumption. The patient underwent successful double valve replacement and completed six weeks of antibiotic therapy with favourable outcome. Discussion A literature review identified 22 published cases of L. rhamnosus endocarditis. Most were associated with underlying valvular disease, invasive procedures, or probiotic use. This case highlights the need to consider Lactobacillus spp. as a potential pathogen, not merely a contaminant, in the appropriate clinical context, and calls for careful patient selection and monitoring when prescribing probiotics."

Vegetations are usually small and are managed with immunosuppression and anticoagulation. Case summary A 50-year-old female presented to her hospital with left leg weakness, with imaging showing a right parietal stroke and an old occipital lobe stroke. Inpatient transthoracic echocardiography showed a large mitral valve (MV) vegetation with moderate-to-severe mitral regurgitation (MR). She self-discharged against medical advice before further workup could be completed and was lost to follow-up until persuaded to have an outpatient transoesophageal echocardiogram, which showed severe MR with a large (2cm x 3cm) mass attached to the posterior MV leaflet. Blood cultures were negative. Review of previous blood tests showed a triple-positive APLS panel, which was positive on repeat testing. She underwent successful mechanical MV replacement. Valve histology was consistent with Libman-Sacks endocarditis. Warfarin therapy was continued, complicated by subdural haematoma (successfully treated), but with no further thromboembolic events. Subsequent anti-nuclear antigen testing was positive, and hydroxychloroquine was commenced. Transoesophageal echocardiography one year later showed a well-functioning MV prosthesis. Discussion The management of young individuals with ischaemic stroke should include attention to atypical causes. Libman-Sacks endocarditis is usually associated with small vegetations and high thrombotic risk, usually managed medically with anticoagulation and treatment of underlying conditions. Our case was atypical, with presence of a large vegetation causing significant valvular dysfunction, but demonstrates that replacement with mechanical prostheses can be a feasible management strategy."

However, the clinical implications of M‐TEER in patients requiring mechanical circulatory support (MCS) for unstable hemodynamics remains unclear. This study aimed to evaluate the outcomes of MCS‐assisted M‐TEER in critically ill patients. Methods Consecutive patients who underwent M‐TEER for significant mitral regurgitation were identified from the Japanese multicenter OCEAN‐Mitral (Optimized Catheter Valvular Intervention–Mitral) registry. All‐cause death was compared between the cohort undergoing MCS‐assisted M‐TEER and a virtual control group receiving MCS alone without undergoing M‐TEER, estimated using the Seattle Heart Failure Model. Additionally, logistic regression analysis was conducted to identify factors associated with in‐hospital death following MCS‐assisted M‐TEER. Results A total of 3764 patients were included in the analysis (mean age, 81 years; 54.9% men; 70.1% with secondary mitral regurgitation), of whom 105 underwent MCS‐assisted M‐TEER. Procedure success exceeded 95%, irrespective of MCS use. The 1‐year mortality rate in the MCS‐assisted M‐TEER group was lower than the estimated mortality rate in the virtual control group (43.2% versus 69.5%). Factors associated with in‐hospital death included frailty, inflammation, and hypoalbuminemia. In a landmark analysis starting from discharge date, there was no statistically significant difference in cardiovascular death or heart failure hospitalization between the groups with or without the use of MCS (hazard ratio, 1.45 [95% CI, 0.93–2.26]; P =0.10). Conclusions MCS‐assisted M‐TEER appears to be a viable and effective therapeutic strategy for carefully selected patients with significant mitral regurgitation and unstable hemodynamics.

Their utility in patients with degenerative mitral regurgitation (DMR) undergoing transcatheter mitral edge-to-edge repair (M-TEER) remains unclear. Objectives To evaluate the prognostic value of RV-PA coupling and PAPi in DMR patients treated with M-TEER. Methods This retrospective single-center study included 293 patients with DMR undergoing M-TEER between 2012 and 2022. RV-PA coupling was assessed by echocardiographic tricuspid annular plane systolic excursion (TAPSE) to systolic pulmonary artery pressure (sPAP echo ) and, in a subset, invasively (TAPSE/sPAP invasive ). PAPi was calculated as (sPAP—diastolic PAP) / right atrial pressure. The primary endpoint was all-cause mortality at 2 years; the secondary endpoint was a composite of mortality or heart failure hospitalization. Results RV-PA uncoupling (TAPSE/sPAP echo &lt; 0.307 mm/mmHg) was associated with higher 2-year mortality (52.2% vs. 22.2%; HR = 2.64; p &lt; 0.001) and composite events (56.4% vs. 30.1%; HR = 2.22; p = 0.0023). Similar results were observed with invasively derived TAPSE/sPAP (cut-off &lt; 0.315 mm/mmHg). In contrast, PAPi &lt; 3.65 was not associated with outcomes. TAPSE alone showed no prognostic significance. Conclusion RV-PA coupling, but not PAPi, predicts mortality and heart failure rehospitalization following M-TEER in DMR patients. These findings highlight the value of RV-PA coupling indices for risk stratification and support their routine use in preprocedural assessment. Graphical Abstract"

Methods PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, and Cochrane Library databases were searched from the date of establishment to November 22, 2024. Two investigators independently screened the literature, extracted data, and evaluated the quality of the included studies. Meta-analysis was performed using Stata18.0 software. Results Finally, 23 studies were included, all of which scored ≥7 on the Newcastle–Ottawa scale. Meta-analysis results showed that, the left ventricular end-systolic volume index ( P &amp;lt; 0.01), left ventricular end-diastolic volume index ( P &amp;lt; 0.01), and left ventricular mass index ( P &amp;lt; 0.01) of patients with MR were higher than those of healthy individuals. In contrast, the left ventricular ejection fraction ( P &amp;lt; 0.01) and global radial strain (GRS) ( P &amp;lt; 0.01) of patients with MR was lower than that of healthy individuals; the difference was significant. The E / A of both groups ( P = 0.22), global circumferential strain ( P = 0.43), global longitudinal strain ( P = 0.10), left ventricular relative wall thickness ( P = 0.20), and some indexes with significant heterogeneity were analyzed by subgroup according to the degree of MR. The combined results of most subgroup analysis were consistent with the overall results and the heterogeneity was reduced. Conclusion There is significant difference in the GRS between patients with MR and healthy individuals, which can provide reference for evaluating left ventricular function in patients with MR."

These may be associated with kyphoscoliosis, pulmonary, and cardiac diseases. However, the incidence of concomitant cardiac disease in patients with pectus deformities is not well-documented. There is no consensus on the optimal age for repair, the most effective technique, or whether a simultaneous or staged approach is preferable. This study presents our experience with combined pectus and cardiac surgery. Methods Thirteen patients (aged 6–32 years) with pectus deformities and concurrent cardiac disease underwent surgery between 2016 and 2024. Eleven had pectus excavatum, one had a mixed deformity, and one had Pouter chest wall deformity. Seven had Marfan syndrome, one had Noonan syndrome, and three had mitral valve regurgitation requiring Bentall and/or valve replacement. The patient with Pouter chest wall deformity had right ventricular outflow tract (RVOT) stenosis, pulmonary valve stenosis, and a patent foramen ovale. Another had a failed Ravitch repair with a right coronary artery to RVOT fistula. Results There was no mortality. All patients were extubated within 72 h, except one requiring reintubation for seven days due to COVID-19 pneumonia. Patients’ characteristics are summarized in Table 1. One patient with a previous failed Ravitch repair required bilateral costochondral fixation. Pectus repair outcomes were excellent in 11 patients, while two children developed postoperative pectus carinatum. Conclusion The choice between simultaneous or staged repair remains debated. Our experience suggests the modified open Nuss procedure is preferable for concomitant pectus and cardiac surgery, except when infeasible."
