With recent clinical trials indicating that transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) is at least on par with surgical aortic valve replacement (SAVR) in treating lower risk patients, there has been a rise in TAVR uptake in younger, lower risk patients, leading to an increased likelihood of bioprosthetic valve degradation within a patient's lifetime. This shift in treatment has changed the landscape of interventional cardiology, incentivising the Heart Team to now plan for the initial procedure with subsequent interventions in mind. While traditional multi-slice computed tomography image-based risk assessments are sufficient for initial valve placement, they fall short in their ability to accurately predict post-procedural outcomes and future interventions. Therefore, the need to balance competing risks to optimise patient outcomes over multiple interventions requires innovation. CT-derived computational techniques are being developed to incorporate biomechanics and fluid dynamics into the risk assessment process to allow more comprehensive analysis of the risks associated with different procedures. The goal of this review is to provide an overview of computational techniques that are being developed for the purposes of optimising outcomes in both the index and valve-in-valve interventions and to give cardiologists an understanding of how they may use computational modelling as an additional tool in the lifetime management of aortic stenosis."

A multicentre cross-sectional study.
We analysed data from the Searching for Atrial Fibrillation and Early Recruitment of Heart Failure in HCM registry, collected between 2018 and 2023.
Patients with HCM (n=499) aged ≥18 years from 12 institutions (Shizuoka Prefecture, Japan) were consecutively enrolled.
Clinical parameters, along with data from a short form of the Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire (KCCQ-12), were collected. The association between each clinical parameter and the KCCQ-12 score was analysed. Clinical parameters with a significant univariable association (p<0.05) were used in a multiple regression model to investigate independent clinical parameters associated with the KCCQ-12 score. The coefficients and relative importance of each parameter included in the multiple regression model were also evaluated.
In the univariable analysis, KCCQ-12 scores exhibited significant associations with 21 clinical parameters, including sex, left ventricular morphology and the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI). The multiple regression model with 12 parameters that had a significant univariable association exhibited an adjusted R2 of 0.48. In this model, the PSQI (standardised coefficient -0.39; p<0.001), history of sustained ventricular tachycardia or fibrillation, history of atrial fibrillation (-0.23; p<0.001), female sex (-0.19; p=0.035), systolic blood pressure (0.17; p=0.040), lateral E/e prime (-0.17; p=0.049) and A wave (-0.14, p=0.049) were independently associated with the KCCQ-12 score with high relative importance.
In patients with HCM, we investigated the association between the KCCQ-12 score and various clinical parameters. PSQI, as well as known heart failure-related clinical parameters, was significantly associated with the KCCQ-12 score. Visualising the associations of various clinical parameters with the KCCQ-12 score will help physicians to consider factors linked to the decline in QOL in patients with HCM."

To explore what factors have led us to consider more than 50% of the global population special, we assessed access to transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) by sex on national and local levels and studied post-TAVI outcomes by sex within our centre.
Population statistics from census data were compared against British Cardiovascular Intervention Society (BCIS) audit and local data.Using the National Institute for Cardiovascular Outcomes Research TAVI database, a retrospective analysis of 1049 consecutive patients from 2013 to 2023 was conducted at our UK tertiary centre.Primary outcomes were all-cause death, a three-point composite of major adverse cardiac events (MACE) comprising death, non-fatal myocardial infarction and non-fatal stroke during TAVI admission, and post-TAVI survival.
Nationally, females comprise 60% of over 75-year-olds; however, TAVI was performed more frequently in males: nationally (55.2% vs 44.8%, p<0.01) and locally (53.2% vs 46.8%, p<0.01). Males were 1.82 times more likely to undergo TAVI.Locally, females undergoing TAVI were older and had worse renal function, higher frailty and greater transvalvular gradients. Males had more cardiovascular comorbidity.In-hospital mortality and MACE did not differ by sex. Median survival was longer in females (1350 days vs 1728 days, p=0.02). Regression analysis demonstrated female sex as a predictor of increased survival (HR 0.73, 95% CI 0.61 to 0.88, p<0.01). Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, atrial fibrillation, frailty and poor mobility were identified as predictors of reduced survival.
In this retrospective, observational study, we have demonstrated an under-representation of females undergoing TAVI. This observation is likely of multifactorial cause, including different disease recognition, referral, investigation and treatment practices.We observed no difference in procedural death or MACE, but longer female survival, despite higher baseline age, frailty and renal impairment."

Zeitschrift fur Gefasskrankheiten,"Background: Bilateral symptoms of peripheral artery disease may be rarely caused by isolated atherosclerotic aortic stenosis or short occlusion. Standard therapies have been open surgery, balloon angioplasty and implantation of selfexpanding stents and stentgrafts. Materials and methods: In this retrospective study 54 consecutive patients were treated under local anaesthesia with a balloon-expandable endograft. Endpoints were safety, ankle-brachial and toe-brachial index (ABI, TBI), walking distance, clinical stage and re-interventions at long-term. Results: There were 36 women and 18 men, mean age 68 years; 48 patients suffered from claudication, 6 patients had rest pain with skin lesions in 3 cases. The technical success rate was 100%. There was an immediate average improvement of ABI from 0.76 +/- 0.26 at rest before intervention to 0.88 +/- 0.31 at rest after stentgraft implantation into the aortic stenosis. TBI improved from 0.48 +/- 0.17 to 0.58 +/- 23 at rest. Mean follow-up was 1 to 8 years (mean 4.46) years. Average walking distance improved from 124 m to 612 m. Of the 6 patients with rest pain or skin lesions all except 1 patient improved to at least claudication stage with a painfree walking distance over 200 m. No complications such as aortic rupture, dissection or peripheral embolisation occurred, 2 patients needed surgical revision of their calcified common femoral arteries at the access sites. Three patients developed at long-term recurrent stenosis due to the compression of stentgrafts by the calcified plaque burden which was solved by balloon angioplasty or implantation of an additional aortic stentgraft. Conclusions: Endovascular treatment of aortic stenosis or occlusion is feasible under local anaesthesia with good functional results, very low mortality and morbidity and durable results."

While transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) has shown early advantages over surgical aortic valve replacement (SAVR) in women, long-term sex-specific outcomes remain unclear. To evaluate outcomes at 5 years comparing TAVR versus SAVR a systematic review and meta-analysis was performed.
A systematic literature review was conducted, identifying all randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing TAVR with SAVR which included women with completed 5-year follow-up. The primary outcome was the composite of all-cause mortality or disabling stroke. Meta-analysis was performed using both random-effects and fixed-effect models. The study protocol was registered in PROSPERO (CRD420251004394).
Six RCTs were included with a total of 3,094 women (1,587 TAVR and 1,507 SAVR). Overall, no significant difference was observed in the primary outcome between TAVR and SAVR (Incidence Rate Ratios [IRR] 1.00, 95% Confidence Interval [CI]: 0.88-1.13, p = 0.98). Meta-regression did not find any association between key clinical covariates and the primary outcome. Trial sequential analysis demonstrated that the extracted sample size met the required information size, but a definitive treatment effect was not confirmed.
While TAVR shows an advantage over SAVR at 1-year follow-up in women, all-cause mortality or disabling stroke are similar in TAVR and SAVR at 5 years. Future studies must include sex-disaggregated reporting of both primary and secondary outcomes in order to comprehensively weigh risks and benefits of each intervention and inform personalized treatment strategies.

Because of the severe shortage of donors, a ventricular assist device (VAD) is necessary as a bridge to heart transplantation. However, reports on VAD implantation for cardiomyopathy in Danon disease patients are limited. Herein, we report a successful pediatric case with nearly 800-day of biventricular assistance as a bridge to heart transplantation. A 12-year-old girl with severe heart failure due to hypertrophic cardiomyopathy associated with Danon disease underwent left implantation of a Heartware VAD (Heartware Inc., Miami Lakes, FL, USA). Owing to severe right ventricular failure, she was unable to be weaned off the cardiopulmonary bypass, and a right VAD implantation was undertaken using a Gyro pump (Kyosera, Kyoto, Japan). However, the right ventricular function did not recover postoperatively, and she subsequently underwent right implantation of a Heartware VAD on postoperative day 34. Despite several VAD-related complications, including aortic and pulmonary valve insufficiency and a driveline infection requiring hospitalization, the patient was able to attend junior high school during the waiting period for a heart transplantation. After a total waiting period of 882 days, including 791 days of biventricular Heartware VAD assistance, the patient underwent a heart transplantation."

This study evaluated outcomes of aortic root replacement (ARR) when valve preservation was initially intended, irrespective of the eventual procedural success.
We retrospectively reviewed patients who underwent ARR (VSRR or Bentall) between 2002 and 2023, excluding those with aortic stenosis, prior AVR, endocarditis, or partial root replacement. Patients were categorized as single-clamp VSRR (S-VSRR, n=251), multiple-clamp VSRR (M-VSRR, n=16), failed VSRR (F-VSRR, n=10), and primary Bentall (n=548).
VSRR was unsuccessful, or required multiple cross-clamp attempts in 9.4% of cases. Failure occurred in 1.0% of aneurysm and 2.5% of dissection cases (p=0.28). Bentall patients were older (58 ± 14 years) than S-VSRR (48.2 ± 14.2 years) and M-VSRR (48 ± 13 years; p < 0.01). Preoperative severe AR was most frequent in F-VSRR (70%). Preservation succeeded in 83% with moderate-to-severe AR versus 89% with none-to-mild AR. Leaflet repair was more common in M-VSRR (43.8%) than S-VSRR (19.5%; p=0.02). In unadjusted analysis, F-VSRR was associated with more bleeding-related reoperations and longer ICU and hospital stays. At follow-up, 85.6% of S-VSRR and 68.7% of M-VSRR had none-to-mild AR. Mortality and reoperation rates were low across groups.
VSRR was technically challenging or unsuccessful in about 10% of cases, especially with advanced AR. Although mid-term survival and valve durability were comparable, these patients may experience higher perioperative morbidity, underscoring the need for careful patient selection and intraoperative judgement."

PubMed,aortic stenosis,Managing The Mitral Valve In HCM Surgery: Tips And Tricks.,Sara Ranchordás; Miguel Abecasis; Eduard Quintana,10.48729/pjctvs.574,2025-11-13,Portuguese journal of cardiac thoracic and vascular surgery,"Mitral regurgitation (MR) in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) patients is mainly due to systolic anterior motion (SAM) of the mitral valve (MV). However, other mechanisms contributing to mitral regurgitation may coexist as a result of further structural abnormalities. SAM might occur because of the increased septal thickness alone or due to simultaneous MV or subvalvular apparatus anomalies, such as mitral leaflet elongation, papillary muscle body anomalies, accessory papillary muscles or additional papillary muscle heads. Additionally, anomalous mitral chordae or the recently described mitral-aortic discontinuity (leading to a longer anterior mitral leaflet (AML)) can contribute to abnormal physiology. A closed aortomitral angle may also contribute. During intraoperative echocardiographic assessment, it is important to thoroughly evaluate the MV and the regurgitant jet to understand the mechanism(s) that cause MR in HCM patients. Although myectomy alone is frequently enough to correct SAM, concomitant MV procedures may be needed, especially when the septum is thin (<16-18 mm) and/or there is intrinsic MV disease. Detection of concomitant regurgitation mechanisms beyond SAM can eventually be identified preoperatively, either by direct structural detection (valve prolapse), by pharmacological palliation of SAM with vasopressors and negative inotropic agents or suspected by identification of anteriorly and centrally directed regurgitant mitral jets. Surgical techniques that can be employed to contribute to SAM elimination include plication/extension/retention plasty of the AML, resection/release/reorientation of papillary muscles, division of anomalous chordae, edge-to-edge repair, or, at times, prosthetic MV replacement. If there is structural MV disease concomitant to HCM, appropriately tailored techniques to address the MV may be used. Transoesophageal echocardiography at the end of the procedure should demonstrate elimination of SAM, resolution of LVOT obstruction, and appropriate coaptation of the MV leaflets and nearly resolution of MR. Provocation with inotropes can be used to ensure no latent obstruction persists."

Case reports,"Double aortic arch (DAA) is a rare congenital vascular anomaly that is typically diagnosed in infancy. In adult patients undergoing transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR), an undetected DAA can present unique anatomical and procedural challenges.
A 71-year-old woman with end-stage renal disease and severe aortic stenosis was incidentally found to have a DAA during preprocedural TAVR evaluation. The device was inserted via the right femoral artery, as it provided the largest vessel diameter and most favorable anatomy for device passage. The pronounced curvature of the aortic arch created an unfavorable anatomy that hindered advancement of the delivery system, even with multiple attempts using a double-stiff wire technique. Ultimately, a snare-assisted approach enabled successful navigation and valve deployment. The patient later developed postprocedural stroke, and the use of cerebral embolic protection was limited by her complex arch anatomy.
This case highlights the critical role of comprehensive imaging and individualized procedural planning in managing rare vascular anomalies during TAVR. It provides practical insight into overcoming severe arch tortuosity with snare-assisted techniques, offering educational value for interventionalists encountering similar structural challenges.
Snare-assisted techniques offer a practical solution for TAVR in patients with complex arch anatomy when standard approaches fail."

Cardiothoracic imaging,"Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) requires multimodality imaging for accurate diagnosis, risk assessment, and management strategies. Echocardiography serves as the primary imaging tool, evaluating left ventricular wall thickness, outflow tract gradients, and mitral valve morphology. It provides essential diagnostic information and guides treatment decisions, with stress echocardiography particularly valuable for detecting dynamic gradients in obstructive HCM and supporting preoperative planning for interventions such as myectomy. Cardiovascular MRI complements echocardiography through superior resolution, enabling detailed assessment of myocardial mass, flow dynamics, and comprehensive tissue characterization. Late gadolinium enhancement and extracellular volume measurements enhance prognostic evaluation and risk stratification. Cardiac MRI excels at helping distinguish HCM from phenocopies like infiltrative or storage diseases and detecting myocardial disarray, microvascular dysfunction, and abnormalities in myocardial metabolism. Nuclear imaging proves crucial for identifying HCM phenocopies, including transthyretin amyloidosis and sarcoidosis, providing specific diagnostic capabilities. Cardiac CT, while having a secondary diagnostic role, becomes invaluable for evaluating coronary anatomy in patients considered for septal reduction therapies, ensuring comprehensive preoperative assessment. This integrated multimodal approach provides comprehensive HCM evaluation, enabling precise diagnosis, robust risk stratification, and individualized treatment planning. Each modality contributes unique strengths that collectively enhance clinical decision-making and optimize patient outcomes in this complex myocardial disease.

We report the case of a male patient in his 70s with recurrent melena and profound anemia requiring multiple transfusions. Extensive initial investigations, including gastroscopy and colonoscopy, failed to identify a bleeding source. The diagnosis was suspected after echocardiography confirmed critical AS and was later confirmed by capsule endoscopy, which revealed bleeding small bowel angiodysplasia. Instead of pursuing direct endoscopic treatment of the angiodysplasia, the decision was made to address the underlying cause with transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI). Following the procedure, the patient's hemoglobin stabilized, and subsequent enteroscopy confirmed resolution of the angiodysplasia. This case highlights that in patients with AS and obscure GIB, maintaining a high index of suspicion for Heyde's syndrome is crucial. It demonstrates that timely intervention with TAVI can serve as a definitive treatment by resolving the bleeding diathesis through correction of the shear-stress platelet insult and underscores the importance of a multidisciplinary approach between cardiology and gastroenterology to achieve optimal patient outcomes."

This study investigated whether the Hemoglobin-Geriatric Nutritional Risk Index (H-GNRI) could predict major adverse cardiovascular events (MACEs) after TAVI. Methods: Patients who underwent TAVI at a single institution were classified into three groups according to their H-GNRI scores: low-risk (H-GNRI score = two), intermediate-risk (H-GNRI score = one), and high-risk (H-GNRI score = zero). The primary outcome was the occurrence of MACEs post-TAVI, and Kaplan-Meier survival and Cox proportional-hazard analyses were performed. Results: Of the 205 patients analyzed, 123, 67, and 15 were assigned H-GNRI scores of two, one, and zero. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis revealed that patients with H-GNRI scores of one and zero developed significantly more MACEs than those with a score of two (log-rank p = 0.0030; 1 vs. 2, p = 0.0032; 0 vs. 2, p = 0.0077). In the Cox proportional-hazard analysis, factors associated with MACEs included H-GNRI score (using score two as reference; score one: hazard ratio [HR] = 2.02, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.10-3.60, p = 0.021; score 0: HR = 2.67, 95% CI = 1.10-6.44, p = 0.028), procedure time (HR = 1.00; 95% CI = 1.00-1.01; p = 0.0093), and length of hospital stay after TAVI (HR = 1.02; 95% CI = 1.01-1.04, p = 0.0003). Conclusions: Preoperative H-GNRI scores were markedly associated with the incidence of postoperative MACEs in patients undergoing TAVI."

This article aims to present our institutional approach, supported by the current literature, in managing several challenging anatomical scenarios. We focus on seven high-impact scenarios-bicuspid aortic valve (BAV), hostile transfemoral access, iliofemoral/aortic tortuosity, adverse aortic angulation, heavy annulus/Left Ventricular Outflow Tract (LVOT) calcification, small annulus, and risk of coronary obstruction-and propose a practical approach to minimize the risk of complications. In BAV, current generation transcatheter heart valves (THV) achieve favorable early outcomes when sizing accounts for supra-annular constraints and implantation depth is tailored. Transfemoral access remains dominant in contemporary registries, yet a meaningful minority of cases require adjunctive peripheral vascular intervention to enable THV delivery-system passage. In case of annulus or LVOT calcification, small annuli, complex aortic anatomy, high risk for coronary obstruction, and pre-procedural Computed Tomography (CT) allow for an accurate sizing of THV and tailored procedural planning. A structured, CT-driven pathway that links anatomic findings to specific facilitation and bailout steps can standardize decision-making and improve safety across these challenging scenarios. We strongly highlight the importance to build a network where most complex procedures are carried out in Valve Centers where expert operators are trained to manage high volume, high complexity, and difficult complications."

The rates of moderate-to-severe paravalvular leak (PVL), permanent pacemaker implantation (PPI), and annular complications remain high, especially in the presence of extensive calcifications with raphe or tapered roots, underscoring the importance of meticulous multimodality imaging, dedicated sizing algorithms, and device-specific strategies. Long-term durability signals are encouraging but remain limited, underlining the need for prospective trials with extended follow-up. This review summarizes current knowledge on BAV anatomy and its management, exploring the available evidence supporting the role of transcatheter approach in this challenging and unique scenario."

We evaluated the clinical utility of the 6MWD by quantifying the gap between the expected and observed physical performance and estimating its determinants.
Outpatients with wild-type (ATTRwt)-CM were investigated. Standardized echocardiographic, laboratory and clinical assessments were performed. A regression formula derived from a healthy local population sample was applied to predict the expected 6MWD. Associations with 6MWD were analyzed by linear regression, adjusted for age and height. Explanatory multivariable models using backward elimination, regularization and clinical reasoning were calculated.
100 patients were analyzed. Their mean age was 78.7 (6.3) years and 86% were men. The mean observed 6MWD was 310 (113) m, which corresponded to about 65% of the expected performance. Significant predictors of the 6MWD were (ordered by decreasing explanatory power): high-sensitivity Troponin T, NT-proBNP, NAC disease stage, estimated glomerular filtration rate, atrial fibrillation, hemoglobin, hepatic vein dilation, mitral E-wave maximum velocity, left ventricular ejection fraction, and the tricuspid valve maximal regurgitation pressure gradient. Multivariable models yielded an R² of up to 45.9% with a root mean squared error of 82.9 m.
Physical performance as measured by the 6MWD in patients with ATTRwt-CM was remarkably compromised. Laboratory and imaging markers indicative of disease severity and congestion predicted the 6MWD in these patients. Cardiovascular markers explained a fair amount of 6MWD variability."

Case reports,"Degenerative mitral regurgitation (DMR) is associated with substantial morbidity and mortality if left untreated. While surgical repair remains the gold standard, mitral transcatheter edge-to-edge repair (M-TEER) is an established alternative for patients at high surgical risk. However, recurrent MR after initial M-TEER remains a therapeutic challenge and is associated with poor outcomes.
A 77-year-old patient presented with recurrent heart failure symptoms due to MR after prior CARILLON® device implantation for secondary MR at an external hospital in September 2019. Transoesophageal echocardiography revealed degenerative mitral valve disease characterized by a complex combination of posterior leaflet prolapse and anterior leaflet flail, resulting in a severe eccentric regurgitant jet.The patient underwent successful M-TEER with the MitraClip® system in December 2021. In June 2023, the patient was re-hospitalized for recurrent heart failure symptoms. Imaging revealed severe recurrent MR originating lateral to the implanted device. A redo M-TEER was performed using the PASCAL® system, requiring careful navigation through a narrow residual lateral orifice. The procedure resulted in a durable reduction to mild MR with sustained clinical stability at 18-month follow-up.
This case illustrates the anatomical challenges of DMR and demonstrates the feasibility and durability of redo M-TEER in high surgical risk patients with recurrent MR. It emphasizes the importance of individualized anatomical assessment and tailored device selection in complex valve anatomies."

Transcatheter edge-to-edge repair (TEER) is a viable treatment, but its long-term survival impact, particularly across sexes, remains underexplored. We aimed to assess relative survival (RS) and excess mortality (EM) in patients undergoing TEER for significant MR, with a focus on sex-based differences. Methods: We analyzed 253 patients treated with TEER between October 2015 and August 2024, stratified by sex. Observed survival (OS) was calculated using the actuarial life table method; expected survival (ES) was estimated via the Ederer II method using matched population data. Primary endpoints were RS and EM; secondary endpoints included mortality differences by MR subtype. Results: OS at 1, 2, and 3 years was 88.9%, 87.4%, and 78.9%, respectively. EM peaked in the first year (7.8%) and declined thereafter. RS was lower than in the general population, primarily due to persistently reduced RS and elevated EM in men. Women achieved RS comparable to matched peers from year one. Sex was not an independent predictor of mortality (HR 0.88, 95% CI 0.38-2.03, p = 0.771). Conclusions: In patients with significant MR undergoing TEER, EM was concentrated in the first year. Women reached RS comparable to the general population, while men showed persistent excess mortality. Sex was not independently associated with survival after adjustment."

Its prevalence and prognostic significance in athletes remain uncertain, raising important questions for pre-participation screening, eligibility for competition, and long-term follow-up. Methods: We systematically searched PubMed, Scopus, and EMBASE databases from inception through August 2025 for original studies reporting MVP prevalence in athletes, diagnosed by echocardiography or pathological assessment. Data on study characteristics, diagnostic definitions, prevalence, arrhythmias, and outcomes were independently extracted by three reviewers. Methodological quality was appraised using the National Institutes of Health Quality Assessment Tool for Observational Cohort and Cross-Sectional Studies. Results: Twelve studies published between 1987 and 2024 met inclusion criteria, enrolling 19,463 athletes from diverse sports and competitive levels. A total of 407 MVP cases were identified, corresponding to a crude pooled prevalence of 2.4%. Prevalence estimates varied substantially (0.2-20%), reflecting heterogeneity in study populations and diagnostic definitions. When all studies were pooled using a random-effects model, the overall prevalence was 2.0% (95% CI 1.2-2.8%). A sensitivity analysis restricted to contemporary, unselected athletic cohorts yielded a prevalence of 1.1% (95% CI 0.4-1.9%), closely aligning with population-based estimates. Ventricular arrhythmias were more frequent than supraventricular arrhythmias, particularly in association with bileaflet prolapse, leaflet thickening, or significant mitral regurgitation. Most athletes were asymptomatic, and only one prospective study provided long-term follow-up, confirming a generally benign prognosis, though rare adverse events (atrial fibrillation, valve surgery) were documented. Conclusions: MVP is relatively uncommon in athletes and occurs at rates similar to the general population. In most cases, prognosis is favorable and should not preclude sports participation. Nonetheless, recognition of high-risk phenotypes with arrhythmogenic potential highlights the need for individualized evaluation and tailored surveillance strategies in sports cardiology practice."

This case highlights the critical need for early diagnosis and intervention. An 18-year-old female presented with orthopnea, low-grade fever, chest tightness, and pulmonary edema. She had experienced dyspnea, weight loss, recurrent abdominal pain, and chronic anemia over the past six months. Examination revealed congested lungs, sweating, tachycardia, and laboratory findings indicative of inflammation. Echocardiography identified multiple obstructing masses in the left atrium moving into the left ventricle during diastole, causing severe mitral regurgitation. Imaging revealed old infarcts in the brain, liver, and spleen. Blood cultures were positive for Enterococcus faecalis, and empirical antibiotics were initiated. Urgent surgery was performed, including left atrial myxoma resection, mitral valve replacement with a bioprosthetic valve, left atrial appendage closure, and closure of the interatrial septum. Postoperative echocardiography confirmed normal left ventricular function and a well-functioning bioprosthetic mitral valve. The patient tolerated the procedure well and was discharged on a regimen of oral antibiotics for six weeks.
Infected cardiac myxomas, though rare, pose significant risks due to their potential for systemic embolization and severe complications. This case emphasizes the necessity of comprehensive diagnostic evaluation and timely surgical intervention to prevent catastrophic outcomes.
This case underscores the importance of a multidisciplinary approach and early surgical intervention in managing complex cases of infected cardiac myxoma with systemic embolization. Our findings reinforce the need for vigilance in diagnosing and treating such rare but life-threatening conditions."

Mitral Transcatheter edge-to-edge repair (M-TEER) has become a groundbreaking treatment option for high-risk patients ineligible for conventional surgery, with the MitraClip system standing as the most widely validated and utilized device in this field.
This study aimed to evaluate the immediate procedural outcomes and long-term clinical results of MitraClip interventions in Turkish patients with secondary mitral regurgitation. The primary objectives were to determine the rate of procedural success according to standardized Mitral Valve Academic Research Consortium (MVARC) criteria and to assess the proportion of patients achieving optimal mitral regurgitation reduction (MR ≤ 1+) at hospital discharge. The secondary objectives were to identify independent clinical, echocardiographic, and procedural predictors associated with rehospitalization for heart failure and all-cause mortality during follow-up, and to evaluate the durability of mitral regurgitation reduction and functional improvement over the medium-term follow-up period.
This retrospective study included 140 Turkish patients with moderate-to-severe (grade 3+) or severe (grade 4+) SMR who underwent MitraClip treatment between 2021 and 2024, with a median follow-up of 23.5 months (interquartile range [IQR]: 14.0–27.0). MR severity was assessed by comprehensive echocardiographic evaluation according to current guidelines, and post-procedure MR was classified as ≤ 1 + or > 1 + for outcome analyses.
The study population had a median age of 75.0 (IQR: 68.0–78.0) years, with 42.9% being female. Procedural success according to MVARC criteria was achieved in 137 patients (97.9%), while MR ≤ 1 + at discharge was observed in 95 patients (67.9%). During follow-up, 56.4% of patients required rehospitalization, and the mortality rate was 7.1%. Significant improvement in functional capacity was observed, with 88.6% of patients improving by at least one New York Heart Association (NYHA) functional class at 1-month follow-up (from 100% NYHA class III-IV at baseline to 11.4% class III, 70.0% class II, and 18.6% class I post-procedure). Multivariate analysis revealed that estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) (Hazard ratio [HR] 0.95, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.91–0.99, p = 0.03), atrial fibrillation (HR 1.62, 95% CI: 1.02–2.57, p = 0.04), and post-procedure MR severity (MR grade > 1 + vs. ≤1+) (HR 1.73, 95% CI: 1.13–2.65, p = 0.01) were associated with rehospitalization. Mortality risk was associated with lower hemoglobin (HR 0.92, 95% CI: 0.86–0.99, p = 0.04), and severe MR (HR 2.54, 95% CI: 1.09–5.92, p = 0.03).
MitraClip intervention demonstrated high procedural success rates in Turkish patients with SMR, leading to significant reduction in MR severity and improvement in NYHA functional class. While rehospitalization and mortality rates aligned with previous studies, specific clinical factors were identified as being associated with clinical outcomes.

The aim of this study was to understand M-TEER outcomes stratified by the extent of EMCD.
One-year outcomes from the randomized CLASP IID (Edwards PASCAL Transcatheter Valve Repair System Pivotal Clinical Trial) trial (NCT03706833) in prohibitive surgical risk patients with 3+ or 4+ DMR were analyzed by baseline EMCD stages (stage 0, no EMCD; stage 1, left ventricular remodeling; stage 2, left atrial remodeling; stage 3, pulmonary hypertension and/or tricuspid regurgitation; stage 4, right ventricular dysfunction).
The analysis included 211 patients: 53.1% in stages 0, 1, and 2 (n = 112), 13.3% in stage 3 (n = 28), and 33.6% in stage 4 (n = 71). Stages 0, 1, and 2 were combined because there were few patients in stage 0 (n = 3) and stage 1 (n = 1). At baseline, patients with more advanced cardiac damage had more comorbidities, lower functional and quality-of-life measures, and greater mitral regurgitation severity. One-year rates of clinical events among all stages were comparable for major adverse events (P = 0.343) and all-cause mortality (P = 0.644) and significantly different for heart failure hospitalization (P = 0.012). Patients in all stages achieved comparable echocardiographic and quality-of-life improvements at 1 year, including mitral regurgitation ≤1+ (P = 0.474), left ventricular diastolic (P = 0.619) and systolic (P = 0.676) volumes, and Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire score (P = 0.335), with significant improvements from baseline (P < 0.05 vs baseline for all).

The aim of this study was to evaluate the procedural feasibility, safety, and performance of the AltaValve system in treating patients with symptomatic mitral regurgitation (MR) and unsuitable for surgery.
The primary endpoint of the AltaValve Early Feasibility Study was technical success, defined as: 1) absence of procedural mortality; 2) successful delivery and deployment of the implant; 3) successful retrieval of the delivery system; and 4) no emergency surgery or re-intervention related to the implant. Echocardiographic data were assessed by an independent core laboratory, while all reported events were adjudicated by an independent clinical events committee.
A total of 30 patients with a median age of 77 years were enrolled. Median follow-up duration was 182 days (Q1-Q3: 171-191 days). Procedural success was achieved in 29 of the 30 cases (96.7%; 95% CI: 82.8%-99.9%). Reduction to mild or less MR was achieved in all surviving patients at 30 days and maintained in all but 1 patient at 6 months.

From August 2022 through April 2024, forty patients with unsuccessful SRTs who underwent TA-BSM were matched 1:3 to patients having TA-BSM as only invasive procedure for oHCM. The primary outcome was procedural success, defined as resting/provoked left ventricular outflow tract (LVOT) gradient < 30/50 mmHg and mitral regurgitation (MR) grade ≤1+ (of 4+) at 3-month follow-up.
Patients with prior SRT had higher incidences of preoperative right (20% vs. 4%) and left bundle branch block (10% vs. 2%) and non-sustained ventricular tachycardia (20% vs. 3%). At 3-month follow-up, procedural success was achieved in 34 (85%) patients with prior SRT and 106 (88%) with primary TA-BSM. Resting LVOT gradient was significantly reduced in both prior SRT (17 vs. 79 mmHg) and primary TA-BSM groups (13 vs. 73 mmHg). Mitral regurgitation improved (achieving ≤grade 1+) in 36 (90%) of 40 patients in the prior SRT group and in 111 (92%) of 120 patients in the primary TA-BSM group (P = 0.75). In addition, the quality of life was significantly improved following surgery.
TA-BSM with intraoperative real-time transesophageal echocardiographic guidance can provide satisfactory outcomes in oHCM patients. Equipoise of outcomes following TA-BSM supports its application in symptomatic patients after all types of failed SRT."

Myocardial work derived from noninvasive pressure-strain loop is a novel and promising afterload-independent approach to evaluate LV performance. We hypothesized that it may provide diagnostic and prognostic utility in these patients. This study aimed to evaluate myocardial work parameters in patients with significant primary mitral regurgitation, and explore their association with postinterventional LV ejection fraction and clinical composite events.
The study prospectively enrolled 180 patients with severe primary mitral regurgitation at baseline and patients were followed up for postinterventional LV function (>12 months) and clinical events (24.0 [23.3-24.6] months). Logistic regression and Cox proportional hazards regression analyses were performed as appropriate.
Compared with patients exhibiting postinterventional LV ejection fraction ≥50%, individuals with LV ejection fraction <50% demonstrated lower LV global longitudinal strain, global work index (GWI), global constructive work (GCW), and global work efficiency (P<0.001 for all) and higher global wasted work (P=0.001). Preinterventional LV global longitudinal strain, GWI, GCW, and global work efficiency were independent predictors of postinterventional LV dysfunction (P<0.05 for all). The predictive power of logistic regression models comprising LV global longitudinal strain, GWI, and GCW were similar but stronger than the model comprising LV ejection fraction. Preinterventional LV global longitudinal strain, GWI, GCW, and global work efficiency were independently associated with the risk of composite clinical events during follow-up (P<0.001 for all).
Myocardial work parameters, especially GWI, GCW, and global work efficiency, are independent predictors of postinterventional LV dysfunction and are associated with the occurrence of postinterventional clinical composite events."

The prospect of a minimally invasive intervention for dogs is a breakthrough development and simultaneously raises important questions of procedural timing, documenting benefit vs. risk, and outcomes compared to surgical repair or medical therapy alone. The evolution of M-TEER in humans has been documented through early feasibility studies, randomized clinical trials comparing M-TEER to medical therapy or surgical repair, and national and international registries. This review focuses on M-TEER technologies, patient selection, procedural performance, and outcomes in humans and dogs.

The structure of Lp(a) is similar to plasminogen and tissue plasminogen activator and it competes with plasminogen for its binding site, leading to reduced fibrinolysis. Furthermore, since Lp(a) stimulates the secretion of plasminogen activator inhibitor-1, it may lead to thrombogenesis. In this cross-sectional study, we aimed to investigate Lp(a) levels in patients with mechanical prosthetic valve thrombosis (MPVT). Blood samples for Lp(a) determination were obtained from 80 MPVT patients (median age: 48.5 (39-59.75) years; 47 male) and 75 age and sex matched controls (median age: 52 (39-63) years; 44 male) with normally functioning mechanical prosthetic valves. The Lp(a) levels in the PVT group were significantly higher than in the controls [22(16.2-39.4) vs. 6.9(2.9-24.6) mg/dL, p < 0.001]. Elevated Lp(a) levels, recent history of subtherapeutic anticoagulation, history of cerebrovascular accidents (CVA) and a low value of international normalized ratio on admission were found to be the independent predictors of PVT. Lp(a) levels above 19.6 mg/dL predicted PVT with a sensitivity of 65% and a specificity of 71% (AUC:0.767; 95%CI: 0.687 to 0.847; p < 0.001). Lp(a) levels were significantly higher in PVT patients with a history of CVA [42.0 (23.6-53.6) vs. 21.1 (16.1- 36.2) mg/dL, p = 0.012]. Elevated Lp(a) levels may be associated with MPVT. The assessment of plasma Lp(a) levels in patients with prosthetic heart valves may provide additive information regarding the risk of PVT and CVA."

Heart involvement in SSc patients includes diastolic dysfunction, conduction block, pericardial effusion, altered left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF), valvular pathology, as well as myocardial inflammation and/or fibrosis. To characterize the role of anti-RNA polymerase III (RNAPIII) antibody positivity in the pathophysiology of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)-related cardiac involvement in SSc patients.
We retrospectively analyzed four SSc patients with anti-RNAPIII antibodies who developed cardiac complications after COVID-19. This study was approved by the University of Osaka Clinical Research Review Board.
All patients were female and had been diagnosed within the past 3 years. Case 1 presented with elevated myocardial enzymes and severe cardiac injury requiring mechanical circulatory support. The diagnosis of COVID-19-related fulminant myocarditis was made. The other three patients did not have elevated myocardial enzymes but had elevated brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) or N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) and pericardial effusion or decreased LVEF and respiratory distress, suggesting the appearance of COVID-19-induced cardiac dysfunction.
Patients with anti-RNAPIII-positive SSc may have an increased risk of developing cardiac complications after COVID-19. The pathogenesis may involve angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2)-mediated mechanisms, which may include reducing ACE2 expression, leading to increased angiotensin II activity and induce cytokine storm. These results underline the importance of understanding the interplay between autoimmune diseases and infections in promoting immune-mediated cardiac injury. Further investigation is needed to characterize the role of anti-RNAPIII antibodies in the pathophysiology of COVID-19-related cardiac involvement."

This narrative (non-systematic) review synthesizes validated HRQoL instruments used in VHD, spanning generic tools - the Short Form-36 and derivatives (SF-12, SF-6D), EuroQol 5-Dimensions (EQ-5D), and World Health Organization Quality of Life - Brief (WHOQOL-BREF) - and disease-specific measures such as the Minnesota Living with Heart Failure Questionnaire (MLHFQ) and Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire (KCCQ). Instruments were included if (i) applied to adult VHD populations or valve interventions or (ii) demonstrated use in VHD cohorts; English-language sources (primarily 2015-2025) were prioritized, retaining seminal pre-2015 validation papers. Pediatric-only cohorts, non-validated tools, and case reports were excluded. MLHFQ and KCCQ were included on an evidence basis: both have been validated in valvular populations and used as key endpoints in pivotal interventional studies, demonstrating high reliability and sensitivity to change after surgical aortic valve replacement (SAVR), transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVI), and transcateter edge-to-edge repair (TEER). Their established minimal clinically important differences and the availability of a short form (KCCQ-12) further support feasibility and interpretability in practice. The review is descriptive and therefore psychometric properties (validity, reliability, responsiveness, minimal clinically important differences), covered domains, feasibility, and cultural/linguistic adaptation are summarized from existing studies. Emphasis is placed on domains most germane to VHD recovery - physical function, symptom burden, emotional well-being, and social/role participation - given their sensitivity to peri-interventional change. Recommendations for clinical integration (e.g., pairing a generic utility measure such as EQ-5D with a disease-specific tool such as KCCQ; standardized assessment at baseline, 30 days, six and 12 months) are evidence-informed (randomized trials, registries, guidelines). Key gaps include limited valve-specific content (e.g., prosthesis noise, anticoagulation burden), heterogeneity in instruments and time points, incomplete cultural validation, and scarce HRQoL data for emerging therapies (e.g. transcatheter mitral valve replacement, contemporary tricuspid interventions). As a narrative (non-systematic) purely descriptive synthesis, no formal risk-of-bias assessment or meta-analysis was conducted. The English-language restriction and heterogeneity across instruments and follow-up time points limit quantitative comparability and preclude definitive head-to-head conclusions. Future work should develop core outcome sets and VHD-specific modules, strengthen cross-cultural validation, and leverage digital patient-reported outcome platforms to improve comparability and clinical uptake."

Clinical electrophysiology,"Spontaneous echo contrast (SEC) with atrial fibrillation (AF) is known to increase stroke risk. However, the effect of SEC grades on outcomes after left atrial appendage closure (LAAC) remains unclear.
This study aimed to evaluate the impact of SEC grades on clinical outcomes after LAAC.
A total of 1,276 consecutive patients undergoing LAAC were analyzed. They were classified into SEC 0+, SEC 1/2+, and SEC 3/4+ groups based on preprocedural transesophageal echocardiography. Clinical outcomes were compared among the groups.
There were 595 (46.6%), 509 (39.9%), and 172 (13.5%) patients in the SEC 0+, SEC 1/2+, and SEC 3/4+ groups, respectively. The SEC 3/4+ group (11.5%) had a higher ischemic stroke/transient ischemic attack/systemic embolism incidence than the SEC 0+ (4.4%; P = 0.009) and SEC 1/2+ (5.4%; P = 0.047) groups; SEC grade, however, was not a significant predictor in multivariate analysis. Compared with the SEC 0+ group (2.8%), both the SEC 1/2+ (8.4%; P < 0.001) and SEC 3/4+ (12.4%; P < 0.001) groups were associated with a higher risk of device-related thrombus (DRT). When SEC grade and AF type were combined for assessment, SEC 3/4+ with nonparoxysmal AF was associated with both thromboembolic events (adjusted HR: 2.52; 95% CI: 1.22-5.20; P = 0.013) and DRT (adjusted HR: 2.89; 95% CI: 1.50-5.60; P = 0.003).
Patients with greater SEC grade displayed a higher incidence of thromboembolic events and DRT, and combined SEC grade and AF type independently predicted these events. Further research is needed regarding optimal treatment strategy in patients with severe SEC."

Our objective was to identify factors associated with diuretic response during ambulatory IV diuretic sessions in a population of advanced heart failure with no therapeutic project and a frequent flyer profile.
All patients with 4-h IV diuretic sessions were analysed. An initial bolus followed a tailored protocol for continuous infusion based on the patient's baseline diuretic dose. Variables associated with diuresis and natriuresis following furosemide infusion were evaluated using mixed linear models.
Seventy-six patients (mean age 75.4 years; LVEF 42.7%; eGFR 40.7 mL/min/1.73 m2) totalling 175 IV diuretic sessions were included. Mean diuresis was 1.0 L, natriuresis 92.6 mmol/L, and weight loss 610 grams. Baseline use of ACE inhibitors (+302 mL, P = 0.0005), eGFR (+160 mL per 10 mL/min/1.73 m2 increase, P < 0.0001), and addition of thiazide during the diuretic session (+238 mL, P = 0.0001) were associated with higher diuresis. Prior percutaneous mitral valve repair or chronic thiazide treatment was associated with lower diuresis. Baseline use of ACE inhibitors (+10.83 mmol/L, P = 0.018) was associated with higher natriuresis. Worsening renal function (>3 mg/L increase from baseline) and dyskalaemia 48 h after these sessions were uncommon (respectively 11% and 15%).
Ambulatory 4-h IV loop diuretic sessions induced a diuresis of approximately 1000 mL with a substantial sodium content, without causing significant complications. Addition of thiazide during the session increased diuresis and/or natriuresis, and could potentially be implemented to maximize the efficacy of ambulatory IV diuretic therapy."

The core of the system is a lightweight weighted convolutional neural network (WCNN) featuring a key weighting calculation (KWC) layer, which enhances noise robustness by adaptively weighting feature map channels based on global average pooling. The proposed system incorporates optimized feature extraction using Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCCs) guided by GradCAM, and a band energy ratio (BER) metric to assess signal quality, showing that lower BER values are associated with higher misclassification rates due to noise. Experimental results demonstrated classification accuracies of 99.6% and 90.74% on the GitHub PCG and PhysioNet/CinC Challenge 2016 databases, respectively, where the models were trained and tested independently. The proposed model achieved superior accuracy using significantly fewer parameters (312,357) and lower computational cost (4.5 M FLOPs) compared with previously published research. Compared with the model proposed by Karhade et al., the proposed model use 74.9% fewer parameters and 99.3% fewer FLOPs.

Surgical repair remains the gold standard for treatment; however, percutaneous closure has emerged as a promising alternative due to the availability of various occlusion devices. Each technique presents distinct advantages and limitations, particularly in terms of complications and long-term outcomes. We sought to evaluate the safety and mid-term outcomes of pmVSD closure employing the Nit-Occlud® Le VSD Coil within a single-centre, single-team setting. Methods: Of the 55 patients hospitalised for pmVSD closure, 45 children underwent the procedure with the Nit-Occlud® Le VSD device. Relevant clinical and defect-related data were collected during hospitalisation and throughout follow-up. Results: Among 45 patients, successful coil implantation was achieved in 41 cases (91.1%). Periprocedural complications occurred in 8 patients (17.8%), including haemolysis, transient atrioventricular block, aortic valve injury, transient ST-segment elevation and supraventricular tachycardia. Two of these complications (4.4%) were classified as severe. The occurrence of complications was significantly associated with the type of VSD shunt (p = 0.03). Conclusions: Transcatheter closure of pmVSD using the Nit-Occlud® Lê VSD Coil in young children is a feasible and safe option with careful patient selection. Patients with type C pmVSD appear to benefit the most. Nevertheless, potential complications, including haemolysis and aortic valve injury, require close monitoring."

The management of asymptomatic severe AS remains challenging and requires a tailored, patient-specific approach. Optimal timing of intervention in asymptomatic patients continues to be a matter of ongoing debate. In individuals with severe AS and reduced left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF), both the ESC/EACTS and ACC/AHA guidelines recommend aortic valve replacement (AVR), regardless of symptom status. In contrast, for patients with preserved LVEF (≥50%), the decision to proceed with AVR must be individualized and based on a comprehensive risk assessment. Risk stratification plays a central role in guiding early intervention strategies and should incorporate clinical findings, echocardiographic parameters, biomarkers, and advanced imaging techniques such as cardiac magnetic resonance and computed tomography. Recent randomized controlled trials have yielded mixed results regarding the mortality benefit of early AVR but have consistently demonstrated a reduction in heart failure-related hospitalizations. Timely intervention in carefully selected high-risk patients may improve long-term outcomes, while avoiding unnecessary procedures in lower-risk individuals remains equally important."

However, the specific impact of individual comorbid conditions on objective measures of exercise performance remains insufficiently characterized. The study aimed to identify predictors of reduced physical capacity in patients qualified for cardiac rehabilitation. Methods: A single-center retrospective analysis was conducted on 518 patients qualified for cardiac rehabilitation. After excluding 51 post-cardiac surgery patients, cardiopulmonary exercise testing data from 425 patients (316 men, median age 63 years) were analyzed. Comorbidities data, peak oxygen uptake (peak VO2), and the ventilation-to-carbon dioxide output slope (VE/VCO2 slope) were evaluated. Results: A significantly reduced exercise capacity (peak VO2 < 70% of the predicted value) was observed in 29.4% of patients, while an increased VE/VCO2 slope (≥36) was noted in 20.8% of patients. Univariate logistic regression identified sex, heart failure, valvular disease, peripheral artery disease, diabetes mellitus (T2DM), chronic kidney disease (CKD), Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI), left ventricular ejection fraction <50%, diastolic dysfunction, and anemia as predictors of both reduced peak VO2 and a steeper VE/VCO2 slope. Multivariate regression analysis further identified T2DM and CKD as independent predictors of reduced peak VO2, while sex, CKD, and CCI were independent predictors of a steeper VE/VCO2 slope. Conclusions: Among patients qualified for cardiac rehabilitation, patient's sex, T2DM, CKD, and the CCI emerged as key predictors of reduced exercise capacity. Reduced peak VO2 was more commonly observed in men, while women more frequently exhibited a steeper VE/VCO2 slope, indicating potential sex-related physiological mechanisms influencing exercise performance."

Present breast tumor segmentation methods are typically applied to high-resolution computed tomography images. However, fewer segmentation methods are utilized for positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) imaging systems.
Our goal is to develop a deep learning algorithm which combines functional and structural information for breast tumor segmentation in PET/CT images. This can enhance analytical accuracy and speed up the process of obtaining segmentation outcomes, thereby assisting physicians in subsequent patient diagnosis and treatment.
In this study, we explore an automatic image segmentation model to segment breast tumors in PET images. The proposed CT-Guided Transformer modules utilize features of various scales from CT images to generate attention maps for PET features. During the fusion process, effective consensus information is extracted from the features of two different modalities using similarity-based contrastive learning, thus enhancing the segmentation performance. Five evaluation metrics (Jaccard coefficient, Dice score, precision, sensitivity, and Hausdorff distance) are utilized to evaluate segmentation performance. The proposed algorithm is compared to the single-modality method and other multimodal fusion strategies.
Experiments are conducted using a collected clinical breast dataset alongside the public QIN-Breast benchmark, and the results show that the proposed algorithm accurately segments the outline of breast tumors, achieving superior performance (86.19% Dice, 75.73% Jaccard) on the primary dataset and outperforming standard cross-attention on the public dataset by 3.86% Dice and 3.64% Jaccard. The quantitative and visualization results confirm that our method outperformed single-modality input methods and fusion methods. Additionally, we evaluate the distribution of metrics collected by cases to further demonstrate the superiority of our approach.
We present a deep-learning-based method for the joint segmentation of anatomical and functional PET/CT images. Compared to single-modality and dual-modality methods with various fusion strategies, our approach significantly improves the accuracy of breast tumor delineation, demonstrating great potential for breast tumor diagnosis."

Artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) have emerged as promising tools for improving clinical outcomes and optimizing donor-recipient matching. However, their integration into clinical practice remains limited, and significant challenges regarding validation and ethical implementation persist. This systematic review synthesizes current research on AI-driven kidney allocation, focusing on predictive modeling, operational algorithms, and ethical considerations. We conducted a comprehensive literature search with no restrictions on publication year or country across biomedical databases (PubMed/MEDLINE, Embase), AI repositories (arXiv, IEEE Xplore), and clinical trial registries. Sixteen studies met inclusion criteria, encompassing retrospective cohort analyses, simulation studies, and algorithmic frameworks. Data were extracted on model performance, clinical outcomes, and fairness metrics, with quality assessed via modified QUADAS-2 and PROBAST tools. Findings revealed that AI/ML models-particularly deep learning and ensemble methods-outperform traditional risk scores (e.g., KDRI, EPTS) in predicting graft survival (C-index: 0.65-0.72) and waitlist outcomes. However, only a minority of studies integrated these predictions into actionable allocation policies, with most limited to simulation environments. Ethical frameworks were inconsistently applied; while fairness and transparency were frequently cited, few studies embedded them algorithmically. Key gaps included real-world validation, prospective bias audits, and standardized reporting of subgroup impacts. AI holds immense potential to enhance kidney allocation but requires rigorous clinical translation and ethical governance. Future research must prioritize multidisciplinary collaboration to bridge the divide between predictive accuracy and equitable implementation."

However, traditional linear genomic prediction models may be inadequate for predicting complex traits, such as feed efficiency, as they primarily capture additive genetic effects and overlook non-additive effects, including dominance and epistasis. Deep learning (DL) has the potential to address this limitation due to its ability to model non-linear patterns inherent in genomic data. The objectives of this study were to compare the predictive ability of DL models to the linear models for predicting feed efficiency (FE) trait in two boar populations, estimate the non-additive genetic variance captured by DL, and assess its effect on predictive ability. Our results showed that the DL models using the averaged-prediction method had the highest predictive ability in the sire line test population (0.381 for MLP and 0.377 for CNN), compared to 0.366 for linear models. DL models also showed higher abilities in the dam line test population, with MLP achieving a predictive ability of 0.364. Additionally, we showed that DL models captured non-additive variance; however, this did not significantly improve predictive ability. In conclusion, DL models, particularly MLP, demonstrated the highest predictive ability for FE, improving performance by approximately 4.1% for the sire line and 2.8% for the dam line compared to the traditional linear models. Therefore, DL models are recommended for predicting phenotypes and for estimating total genetic effects, including non-additive components. However, this comes at a significant increase of computational cost."

However, the influence of different image reconstruction algorithms, particularly deep learning reconstruction (DLIR) and adaptive statistical iterative reconstruction-Veo (ASIR-V), on the reproducibility of radiomic features remains poorly understood.
To evaluate the impact of DLIR and ASIR-V on CT radiomic features of carotid plaques.
76 patients with 104 carotid plaques who underwent head & neck CT angiography were retrospectively enrolled. Images were reconstructed by filtered back projection (FBP), ASIR-V (30%, 50%, and 80%) and DLIR (DL, DM, and DH). A total of 214 CT-based radiomic features were organized by statistic family (18 first-order; 75 texture: 24 GLCM, 14 GLDM, 16 GLRLM, 16 GLSZM, and 5 NGTDM) and transform domain (original and wavelet sub-bands); 121 features were extracted from wavelet sub-bands. Features were extracted from both 2D and 3D plaque images. The reliability of feature extraction was evaluated by the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC).
Different reconstruction algorithms influenced the most radiomic features. The percentages of first-order, texture, and features in the wavelet domain without statistical difference among 2D and 3D lesions for all seven groups were 0% (0/18), 12.0% (9/75), and 14.9% (18/121), respectively. Compared with FBP, the unaffected features for AV30%, 50%, and 80% decreased from 99.8% and 95.1% to 81.3%, and for DL, DM, and DH from 75.5% and 52.3% to 40.7%. Across statistic families, texture features were the most stable in pairwise comparisons in both the original and wavelet domains. Unaffected features in 2D lesion were larger than 3D lesion. The consistency of first-order feature in 3D lesion was excellent in both intra- and inter-observer, with ICC values ranging from 0.865 to 1 and 0.790 to 0.999, respectively.
Both ASIR-V and DLIR algorithms profoundly impact carotid plaque radiomics, with higher strengths exacerbating feature instability. Texture features exhibited superior robustness across all reconstruction protocols. Our findings advocate for a stability-driven approach to model development: prioritizing robust texture features and employing lower-strength DLIR are crucial steps to ensure the generalizability of radiomic biomarkers."

Sensitivity was 0.915/0.876 (Macro/Micro-average), and specificity was 0.954/0.959 (Macro/Micro-average). The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) was 0.935/0.917 (Macro/Micro-average). The diagnostic performance of the AADM was superior to that of junior endoscopists (accuracy: 0.938 vs. 0.866, P < 0.05) and comparable to senior endoscopists (accuracy: 0.938 vs. 0.937, P > 0.05). Additionally, junior endoscopists significantly improved their accuracy from 0.866 to 0.951 after receiving assistance from the AADM (P < 0.01).
The AADM demonstrated good diagnostic capability for JNET classification, facilitating more convenient and accurate diagnoses of colorectal tumors. AADM shows potential for optimizing surgical approach selection in colorectal tumor management. Further studies are needed to assess its effectiveness and cost-efficiency in real-world clinical settings."

The rarity of the disease, together with the lack of mutations in the classical tumor suppressor genes and the paucity of models, has impaired our understanding of the mechanisms of progression and the cell of origin of these tumors. Due to their higher frequency, this review focuses on Gastro-Entero-Pancreatic (GEP) and Lung NENs. While recent molecular profiling has shed light on the possible cell of origin of GEP- and lung NENs, many questions remain unanswered and further studies using proper in vitro and in vivo models are needed, combined with the latest technologies such as single-cell and spatial sequencing and deep-learning for digital pathology. Genomic and epigenomic evidence suggests that pancreatic NENs originate from adult pancreatic cells rather than common progenitor cells; however, ultimate proof in vitro or in vivo is still lacking. Similarly, emerging molecular evidence suggests that lung NENs may have very diverse origins, encompassing most lung cell types, but much work is still needed to pinpoint their cell of origin. Further, tumors with mixed endocrine and non-endocrine composition suggest the possibility of trans-differentiation and acquisition of neuroendocrine features in different cell types. This review aims to summarize emerging insights on this topic, highlight future directions for identifying the cell of origin of NENs in these organs and explore how this knowledge may ultimately translate into clinical advances."

Manual measurements on conventional 2-D magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) are affected by fetal motion, and there is no clear consensus regarding definitions for brain biometric parameters and anatomical landmark placements, making consistent reference plane and slice selection challenging. Automated biometry with 3-D slice-to-volume reconstruction (SVR) has the potential to improve the reliability of derived measurements, allowing precise quantification of fetal brain development. Previous published works have primarily focused on the technical feasibility of automated fetal brain biometry methods for T2-weighted (T2W) MRI. However, none have proposed solutions for automating the reporting of biometry results, which could enhance clinical utility and support real-time integration into routine clinical workflows. Furthermore, there is no consensus on a universal fetal biometry protocol for 3-D fetal MRI.
To implement and validate a fully automated biometry reporting pipeline for 3-D T2W fetal brain MRI, based on deep learning biometry measurements and computation of z-scores and centiles, by comparison to normative growth charts.
Automated extraction of 13 routinely reported linear fetal biometry measurements using deep learning localization of anatomical landmarks in 3-D reconstructed T2W brain images based on 3-D UNet and presentation of the results in an .html report with centile calculation. The automated biometry method was quantitatively evaluated on 90 retrospective cases against expert manual measurements. Additionally, the fully automated, end-to-end biometry reporting pipeline was prospectively evaluated on 111 cases across a wide range of gestational ages, field strengths, and scanning parameters. We also generated normal centile ranges for 19-40 weeks GA range from 406 normal control datasets.
The retrospective quantitative evaluation demonstrated good agreement with manual measurements, with the maximum absolute difference between automated vs. manual measurement within a 1-3-mm range. In the prospective evaluation, more than 98% of landmark placements were graded as acceptable for interpretation and measurements. The processing time of the pipeline was less than 5 min per case, with measurements and centiles available at the time of reporting. Inspection of the automated landmark placement and computed biometrics took 1-3 min per case. The generated normative growth charts demonstrate strong correlation with the trends in the previously reported works.
Our approach is the first to develop a fully automated biometry reporting pipeline for 3-D T2-weighted fetal MRI which integrates deep learning-based measurements, centile and z-score calculation vs. normative growth charts and report generation."

In this work, we present a comprehensive framework for mapping structural connectivity measured via diffusion-MRI to resting-state functional connectivity measured via magnetoencephalography, utilizing a deep-learning model based on a Graph Multi-Head Attention AutoEncoder. We compare the results to those from an analytical model that utilizes shortest-path-length and search-information communication mechanisms. The deep-learning model outperformed the analytical model in predicting functional connectivity in healthy participants at the individual level, achieving mean correlation coefficients higher than 0.8 in the alpha and beta frequency bands, in comparison to 0.45 for the analytical model. Our results imply that human brain structural connectivity and electrophysiological functional connectivity are tightly coupled. The two models suggested distinct structure-function coupling in people with psychosis compared to healthy participants ([Formula: see text] for the deep-learning model, [Formula: see text] in the delta band for the analytical model). Importantly, the alterations in the structure-function relationship were much more pronounced than any structure-specific or function-specific alterations observed in the psychosis participants. The findings demonstrate that analytical algorithms effectively model communication between brain areas in psychosis patients within the delta and theta bands, whereas more sophisticated models are necessary to capture the dynamics in the alpha and beta band."

The model was designed to incorporate recent advanced diagnostic techniques, including tumor radiomics, manual and automatic distal optic nerve width measurements, and qualitative PLONI assessments.
This retrospective, multicenter case-control study included patients with histopathologically confirmed PLONI and high-spatial-resolution pretreatment MR images. PLONI appearance was qualitatively assessed by two expert radiologists. Quantitative measurements of optic nerve diameter were automatically obtained using a segmentation model and compared to manual measurements by the radiologist using the area under the curve (AUC). The best-performing optic nerve measurements, along with clinical features and radiomic features derived from tumor delineations, were used for prediction modeling.
One hundred twenty-eight retinoblastoma patients (median age, 22 months [range, 0-113], 58 female) were included in this study. This resulted in 30 eyes with histopathologically proven PLONI and 146 control eyes without PLONI. Manual distal optic nerve diameter measurements were chosen for prediction modeling, as this significantly outperformed the automatic approach for detecting PLONI, achieving an AUC of 0.85 compared to 0.68 (p < 0.001) for the automatic method. The final logistic regression model, which integrated radiomic features and clinical features including optic nerve width and PLONI appearance MR imaging, achieved an AUC of 0.90 (95% CI: 0.86, 0.95, SD 0.07), outperforming the other models.
This study developed a high-performing model for predicting PLONI, highlighting the value of advanced MR imaging and the integration of both qualitative and quantitative features. By enhancing risk assessment, this model could provide clinicians with an additional tool for guiding treatment decisions, optimizing early intervention strategies, and ultimately improving patient care in retinoblastoma management.
Question Accurately detecting postlaminar optic nerve invasion in retinoblastoma remains challenging. Improved imaging-based prediction methods are needed to optimize risk assessment and potentially treatment decisions. Findings Manual distal optic nerve width measurements combined with qualitative imaging features and radiomics achieved high diagnostic performance for predicting postlaminar optic nerve invasion in retinoblastoma. Clinical relevance This study improves the prediction of postlaminar optic nerve invasion in retinoblastoma by integrating qualitative imaging assessments, optic nerve measurements, and radiomics, enhancing early detection and thus potentially reducing unnecessary aggressive treatments."

However, experimental methods for LDA identification need a significant amount of time and cost. Here, we introduce a novel deep learning-based method, LDA-CAMF, to infer LDA candidates. LDA-CAMF first designs a cross-attention mechanism to dynamically decode high-order interdependencies between lncRNAs and diseases, presents a multi-level feature fusion strategy to aggregate hierarchical node representations learned from different layers, and then fuse the original features and the optimized representations to enhance the model expressive ability, finally captures novel LDAs using XGBoost. In comparison with six state-of-the-art methods (SDLDA, LDNFSGB, IPCARF, LDASR, LDA-VGHB, and GEnDDn), LDA-CAMF computed the highest AUCs of 0.9632 and 0.9759, and the best AUPRs of 0.9369 and 0.9783 on lncRNADisease and MNDR under 5-fold cross validation, respectively.

However, accurately predicting crack mouth opening displacement (CMOD) in fiber-reinforced UHPC (FR-UHPC) presents significant challenges, as traditional empirical and physics-based models struggle to capture the complex nonlinear relationships between mix design, fiber geometry, and structural parameters. This study assembled a comprehensive experimental database containing eleven mix and material variables that control post-cracking behavior. Nine advanced machine learning algorithms were trained and evaluated using fivefold cross-validation, including kernel-based regressors, ensemble methods, deep neural networks, and the innovative tabular prior-data fitted networks (TabPFN). The modela were ensured interpretability through SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP), sensitivity analysis, contour mapping, and interaction diagrams. These analyses consistently showed that fiber volume (FV) and fiber length (FL) were the primary factors controlling CMOD, while silica fume content (SF), fly ash content (FA), initial notch depth (a₀), and water-to-binder ratio (w/b) had secondary effects. Feature selection improved predictive performance by narrowing the input space to the six most influential variables. With this optimized configuration, TabPFN delivered exceptional accuracy (R2 = 0.942, RMSE < 0.072 mm), surpassing ensemble methods (XGBoost, RFR, GBR) and kernel-based approaches (SVR, NuSVR, GPR). Model predictions were validated against experimental CMOD curves, and bootstrap resampling generated 95% confidence intervals, demonstrating that TabPFN provided both high precision and reliable uncertainty estimates. This research contributes three main innovations: (i) creation of a detailed experimental database for FR-UHPC fracture behavior, (ii) first application of TabPFN for CMOD prediction, and (iii) combined focus on interpretability and uncertainty quantification. The transparent, uncertainty-aware predictive framework developed here connects data-driven modeling with fracture mechanics, providing practical tools for designing and optimizing resilient UHPC structures."

Specifically: (a) Curvelet pooling optimization technology. We introduce the second-generation curvelet transform into the ResNet-50 pooling layer and adopt a collaborative learning pooling strategy of low-frequency and high-frequency information from the raw data decomposed via curvelet transform instead of max-pooling. This enhances the neural network's capability to capture detailed features of complex image data. (b) Multi-source attention mechanism fusion feature extraction technology. We selected two information sources: measured ground dynamometer cards and measured electrical power cards. The multi-head self-attention mechanism enables interactive complementarity between curvelet-decomposed image data from each information source, while achieving dynamic weighted fusion of the interactive complementary data via the adaptive attention mechanism. This process yields optimal global feature representations of multi-source fused data. (c) Multi-source semi-supervised classification deep learning. By integrating multi-source fused feature data with a semi-supervised classification algorithm based on the dual strategy of dynamic adjustment of pseudo-label confidence and self-adaptive class fairness regularization, the method leverages abundant multi-source unlabeled samples to improve model classification performance and generalization ability under limited labeled training samples. This further enhances the accuracy and practicality of condition recognition. Experimental data were collected from a high-pressure, low-permeability, thin oil reservoir block in an oilfield in China. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed method efficiently processes measured information source data in the sucker-rod pumping production system, improves the performance of traditional deep learning frameworks, explores the intrinsic correlations among multiple measured information source data of oil wells, and utilizes massive unlabeled working condition data to enhance the working condition recognition effect and engineering practicability with a minimal number of labeled samples.

However, the complexity and high dimensionality of EEG signals pose challenges for traditional classification methods, which often fail to capture intricate patterns. To address this, we propose a hybrid approach integrating Topological Deep Learning (TDL) with machine learning models-including Support Vector Machines (SVM), Random Forest (RF), Neural Networks (NN), and Logistic Regression (LR)-for Alzheimer's disease classification. By leveraging TDL, our method extracts topological and neural features from EEG data, enhancing the identification of disease-specific patterns that conventional models may overlook. The dataset consists of EEG recordings from 88 individuals, categorized into AD patients, FTD patients, and CN, providing a robust foundation for model evaluation. Our findings demonstrate that NN augmented by TDL achieve the highest classification accuracy, reaching up to 90% in distinguishing AD, FTD, and CN cases. These results highlight the potential of TDL-enhanced deep learning models in clinical applications, offering a more accurate and detailed tool for Alzheimer's disease diagnosis and differentiation from other neurodegenerative conditions.

The proposed system leverages YOLOv8's rapid and accurate visual recognition of deforestation indicators-such as tree stumps, logging machinery, and unauthorized human presence-while enhancing contextual reasoning and decision-making through LangChain agents. Extensive experiments using annotated satellite and drone imagery demonstrate steady improvements in training performance, with box_loss, cls_loss, and distribution focal loss reduced by more than 50%. Despite modest mean Average Precision (mAP50 ≈ 0.07), the integration of LangChain agents enabled dynamic threshold adjustment, reinforcement-learning-based feedback, and GIS-driven reporting, thereby reducing false positives and increasing recall (up to 24%) compared to baseline YOLO models. The framework not only provides actionable, geolocated alerts but also supports adaptive learning for evolving deforestation patterns.

Existing SST reanalysis products frequently lack the spatial and temporal granularity needed for these dynamic coastal areas. To address this, we explore an advanced data-driven approach to SST reconstruction using 4DVarNet, an end-to-end deep learning framework that integrates variational data assimilation with machine learning. While 4DVarNet has shown promising results in reconstructing SST fields, it lacks a robust mechanism for uncertainty quantification. We enhance the framework by incorporating a self-attention embedded variational autoencoder as a prior model, enabling probabilistic reconstruction and efficient sampling. The overall scheme includes a multiscale neural variational approach, self-supervised training, and the integration of pre-trained generative models. The proposed method demonstrates improved accuracy, resolving smaller spatial scales down to 33-45 km versus 59-69 km with current operational capabilities, faster convergence, and better representation of small-scale ocean features, offering a realistic path toward operational deployment of neural variational data assimilation techniques for high-resolution SST analysis in challenging regions."

These parameters need to be considered when cut-off values indicating the need for&#x0D; treatment or even surgery are established. The aim of present work is to study the relation of&#x0D; weight of the heart with age and weight of cadaver.&#x0D; Material and Methods: The study was performed in the Department of Anatomy, Shri Ram&#x0D; Murti Smarak Institute of Medical Sciences, Bareilly on 30 hearts from embalmed cadavers.&#x0D; The hearts were procured from the cadavers available in our department. The heart was&#x0D; thoroughly cleaned and measurements were taken.&#x0D; Results: The mean heart weight was 223.37 ± 57.78 g. Significant relationship between age of&#x0D; the cadaver and weight of the heart (p=0.0004), weight of cadaver and weight of heart&#x0D; (p=0.0001) was observed.&#x0D; Conclusion: The above study provides valuable data of the heart in our geographical location,&#x0D; which may be useful for cardiac surgeons and physicians."

A review of precise risk assessment in the contemporary era of transcatheter edge-to-edge mitral and tricuspid valve repair,Felix Ausbuettel; Carlo Federico Fichera,10.3389/fcvm.2025.1693291,2025-11-14,Frontiers in Cardiovascular Medicine,"Transcatheter edge-to-edge mitral and tricuspid valve repair (M-TEER, T-TEER) have emerged as meaningful treatment modalities among patients at high surgical risk suffering from valvular heart disease. While previous research has shown that optimal patient selection is crucial for treatment outcomes, recent studies have identified a multitude of factors that independently influence mortality. Although these findings can significantly support clinical decision-making, the large number of available studies renders an overview of this topic challenging. In this review, we provide a comprehensive overview of the currently identified factors associated with increased mortality after TEER. We also summarize the current evidence on published risk scores that stratify mortality risk after M-TEER and T-TEER. We aimed to provide clinical decision-making support for optimal patient selection and referral to TEER and to identify remaining gaps in evidence."
OpenAlex,valvular heart disease,Characterization of Left Ventricular Hemodynamic Forces in Mitral Regurgitation Using 4-Dimensional-Flow Magnetic Resonance Imaging,Monisha Ghosh Srabanti; Ali Fatehi Hassanabad; Lyes Kadem; Julio Garcia,10.1177/30494826251395620,2025-11-13,Journal of the Heart Valve Society,"Background: Mitral regurgitation (MR) is one of the most common valvular heart diseases. Despite the recognized importance of hemodynamic force (HDF) in cardiology, its exploration in MR has been limited. Therefore, using a retrospective observational study design, we aimed to investigate the potential of noninvasively assessed systolic and diastolic HDF derived from 4-dimensional-flow magnetic resonance imaging (4D-flow MRI) as markers for determining MR. Method: The study cohort included 15 controls (19-61 years) and 26 MR patients (20 with primary and 6 cases with secondary MR, 33-75 years) classified into trivial-to-severe MR through cardiac MRI. The 3 T/4D-flow MRI sequence was used to assess left ventricular (LV) HDF (integral of intraventricular pressure gradients over the LV cavity) in 3 directions (lateral-septal, inferior-anterior, and apical-basal) using “Segment,” v2.2 R6410. Results: A negative coefficient for peak-systolic apical-basal HDF corresponded to decreased ejection fraction (β = −8.1, SE = 3.3, t = −2.5, P = .03), and a positive association was found between LV mass index and peak-systolic apical-basal HDF (β = 25.6, SE = 11.1, t = 2.3, P = .04). Peak-systolic apical-basal and E-wave apical-basal (diastolic HDF at E-wave time point) HDF emerged as significant predictors in detecting severe MR (Estimate = 2.2, P = .007; Estimate = 1.8, P = .015, respectively). The peak-systolic apical-basal HDF was also notably correlated with age in moderate-severe MR ( r = 0.88, P = .022). Conclusion: Mitral regurgitation affects early diastolic filling and peak systolic ejection, indicated by peak-systolic and E-wave HDF in the apical-basal direction, offering insights into dynamic flow patterns and LV remodeling. Hemodynamic force analysis could enhance risk stratification and guide therapeutic decisions, complementing traditional diagnostic methods for improved MR management."
OpenAlex,valvular heart disease,Temporal Prognostic Factors in Elderly Patients with Acute Heart Failure: A Cohort Study from a Spanish Emergency Department,Itziar Ostolaza Tazón; Héctor Alonso Valle; Pedro Muñoz Cacho,10.20944/preprints202511.0861.v1,2025-11-13,Preprints.org,"Background/Objectives: Acute heart failure (AHF) is a common cause of hospitalization in older adults, associated with high morbidity and mortality. In this population, frailty, comorbidity, and functional variability significantly influence prognosis. This study evaluated short-term (30-day) and long-term (1-year) mortality predictors in elderly patients with AHF treated in the emergency department (HED), considering clinical variables, comorbidities, and precipitating factors (PFs). Materials and Methods: An observational cohort study was conducted based on a secondary analysis of older patients with AHF included in the Epidemiology of Acute Heart Failure in Emergency Departments (EAHFE) registry, treated at Hospital Universitario Marqués de Valdecilla (HUMV) between 2007 and 2022. Clinical, laboratory, and PF-related variables were collected. The primary outcome was all-cause mortality at 30 days and 1 year. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were performed. Results: A total of 548 patients were included (mean age: 80.7 years), of whom 78.6% required hospitalization, mainly in the Internal Medicine department. Mortality was 11.1% at 30 days and 29.9% at 1 year. Age, valvular heart disease, dementia, and elevated creatinine levels were independently associated with higher mortality. Hypoxemia and low-output symptoms were linked to short-term mortality, while NYHA class III and anemia were associated with long-term mortality. Among PFs, acute coronary syndrome (ACS) was related to worse short-term outcomes, whereas rapid atrial fibrillation (AF) was inversely associated with long-term mortality. Conclusions: The prognostic relevance of risk factors differs between short- and long-term outcomes in older patients with AHF. Incorporating clinical characteristics and PFs into risk stratification models may support individualized management and guide follow-up strategies tailored to the geriatric profile. This multidimensional approach is essential to improve clinical decision-making and outcomes in a highly vulnerable population."

Using a prospective multicentre cohort of patients treated for IE, we compared the performance of the 2023 ESC classification to that of 2015 ESC, 2019 European Heart Rhythm Association (EHRA) and 2023 Duke-International Society for Cardiovascular Infectious Diseases (ISCVID) classifications in patients with or without cardiac implantable electronic devices (CIEDs). Methods A total of 1180 patients treated for IE between January 2017 and October 2022 were categorised as having either definite or possible/rejected IE within each classification. The gold standard diagnosis of IE was independently adjudicated by experts as ‘certain’ or not. Definite and ‘certain’ cases of IE were cross-tabulated to calculate sensitivity, specificity and accuracy. Suspicion of lead IE was defined by specific anatomical or metabolic features of cardiac lead infection on imaging; or by pulmonary embolism without valvular vegetation; or by positive culture of a lead extracted during open-heart surgery. Results In the 269 patients with CIEDs, 208 (77.3%) were adjudicated as ‘certain IE’; 2023 Duke-ISCVID and 2023 ESC classifications achieved higher sensitivity (97.1% and 93.8%, respectively) but markedly lower specificity (31.1% and 41.0%, respectively) than 2015 ESC and 2019 EHRA classifications. In the 159 patients with CIEDs and lead IE (78.6% ‘certain IE’), while sensitivity remained high for all classifications, specificity dropped for 2023 Duke-ISCVID and 2023 ESC classifications (11.8% and 32.4%, respectively), but not for 2019 EHRA classification (67.6%). In the 911 patients without CIEDs (81.0% ‘certain IE’), sensitivity was higher than 96% for all classifications and specificity was 55.5%, 52.6% and 48.0% for 2015 ESC, 2023 Duke-ISCVID and 2023 ESC classifications, respectively. Conclusions The 2023 ESC and 2023 Duke-ISCVID classifications had a higher sensitivity but a lower specificity than the 2015 ESC classification in patients with CIEDs, especially among those with lead IE. In patients with CIEDs, the 2019 EHRA classification was the most accurate."

OpenAlex,valvular heart disease,Left ventricular false tendons as incidental findings in a case of sudden cardiac death: What is their role?,Luca Cerra; Eleonora Nardi; Giovanni Aulino; Matteo Polacco; Antonio Oliva; Vincenzo Arena,10.1016/j.jflm.2025.103025,2025-11-11,Journal of Forensic and Legal Medicine,"Sudden death (SD) can be defined as the unexpected natural death of a healthy individual occurring within the first hour after the onset of symptoms or, if death is unwitnessed, within 24 h of the victim being seen in a healthy state. In people younger than 35 yo, when the cause of SD is"" cardiac"" (sudden cardiac death-SCD), it is mainly due to cardiomyopathies and channelopathies. Among the predictors of SCD, obesity (a well-established independent risk factor for cardiovascular diseases) has been found to increase arrhythmic risk (i.e., every 5-unit increment in BMI confers a 16 % higher risk of SCD). We herein describe an autoptic case of an obese 32-year-old woman (BMI of 49.9), who was discovered deceased in her bed at home. Interestingly, at the heart examination, the presence of an abnormality in the tendon apparatus of the anterior mitral valve leaflet was observed. In fact, an accessory tendon chord connecting the apex of the leaflet to the distal third of the antero-lateral papillary muscle was found in addition to an unusual retiform appearance (""web-like"") of the whole mitral valve tendon apparatus. At histological examination of the ventricular myocardium, foci of confluent interstitial and perivascular myocardiosclerosis, along with perivascular fibrosis of coronary intramyocardial were observed. According to the literature, the valvular findings observed could plausibly account for the cause of death. In particular, a fatal arrhythmia due to the above-described tendons apparatus abnormality may developed. Nevertheless, obesity, which is a well-established risk factor for adverse cardiovascular events, may have contributed independently of the accessory chordal tendon. This case underscores the intricate interplay between the existence of left ventricular false tendons (LVFTs) and an elevated risk of ventricular tachycardia. From a speculative point of view, an LVFT may induce mechanical stretch in the interventricular septum, leading to heightened automaticity and triggering premature ventricular beats or arrhythmias. Comprehensive awareness of these structural anomalies and their morphological attributes is crucial for establishing correlations with potentially fatal arrhythmias and for formulating targeted preventive interventions."

Objectives We evaluated clinical outcomes with GLP-1 RA use post-TAVI in patients with T2D. Methods We conducted a retrospective cohort study using the TriNetX network, including 25,184 adults (≥18 years) with T2D who underwent TAVI (2015-2023). Patients were stratified based on GLP1-RA initiation within 14 days post-TAVI. Baseline characteristics, comorbidities, medications, and laboratory data were balanced using 1:1 propensity score matching (PSM). Cox models estimated hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for events from one-month post-TAVI until most recent follow-up. Results PSM yielded 1,101 patients per group, with a mean age of 73 years and 39% female. Mean follow-up duration was 2.2±1.1 and 2.6±1.8 years for GLP1-RA users and non-users, respectively. GLP1-RA use was also associated higher survival probability (HR 0.708 [95% CI, 0.583-0.859]), and lower rates of all-cause hospitalization (HR 0.790 [95% CI, 0.706-0.885]), major cardiovascular events (HR 0.849 [95% CI, 0.749-0.963]), and acute heart failure exacerbation (HR 0.785 [95% CI, 0.677-0.909]), acute kidney injury (HR 0.843 [95% CI, 0.719-0.988]), and major kidney events (HR 0.665 [95% CI, 0.510-0.866]). No differences were observed in acute myocardial infarction, cerebral infarction, or cardiac arrest. Conclusions In patients with T2D undergoing TAVI, GLP1-RA use are associated with significant survival benefits and improved cardiorenal outcomes. However, these findings are limited by the observational design, high comorbidity burden, lack of data on medication compliance and specific cause of death. Prospective trials are warranted to confirm these benefits."

Pulmonary hypertension is an important and grave hemodynamic consequence of mitral stenosis. Persistent pulmonary hypertension leads to increase right heart pressure, Right Ventricular Hypertrophy (RVH) and subsequently right heart failure. There are various electrocardiographic parameters and criteria of Right Ventricular Hypertrophy (RVH) for diagnosis of pulmonary hypertension in various disease. Different ECG parameters and criteria of Right Ventricular Hypertrophy (RVH) have different predictive value for diagnosis of pulmonary hypertension in MS patient. Echocardiography is an important non-invasive investigation for diagnosis, monitoring and selection of treatment and for prediction of mortality in MS patient. Obtaining good quality of 2D echocardiography is problematic in remote areas and they are not feasible for wide spread use due to cost and availability. So, ECG may be a guide for selecting appropriate patient for further testing. Objectives: This study was planned to identify more accurate parameters of ECG for prediction of pulmonary hypertension and Right Ventricular Hypertrophy (RVH) in patients with mitral stenosis. Methodology: This cross-sectional observational study was conducted in the Department of Cardiology, DMCH, from March 2018 to February 2019. A total of 100 patients with mitral stenosis (MS) who met the inclusion and exclusion criteria were enrolled. Detailed clinical history, physical examination, and baseline investigations were recorded for all participants. The study population was divided into two groups: Group I:MS patients without pulmonary hypertension (PASP &lt; 35 mmHg). Group II: MS patients with pulmonary hypertension (PASP ≥ 35 mmHg). A 12-lead ECG and Doppler echocardiogram were performed within 24 hours of the patient’s first contact. Fourteen different ECG parameters and criteria for right ventricular hypertrophy (RVH) were assessed. Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS version 22.0 for Windows. Results: 14 patients were found in group I and 86 patients were found in group II. Among the Group-II patents 18 patients had mild pulmonary hypertension (PASP = 35 ≤ 50 mmHg), 47 patients had moderate pulmonary hypertension (PASP = 50 ≤ 70 mmHg) and 21 patients had severe pulmonary hypertension (PASP ≥ 70 mmHg). Average age of patient in group-I: was 38.71 ± 9.6 years and average age of patients in group-II was 43.8 ± 13.1 years (p = 0.16) Sex distribution was also identical between 2 groups (p = 0.92). This study showed that among the different ECG criteria for detection of RVH in mitral stenosis patients (Which is a surrogate marker for pulmonary hypertension), only a few had good predictive value. In mild pulmonary hypertension, only R in V1 ≥ 7 mm has sensitivity (66.7%), specificity (100%), PPV (100%) and NPV (37.5%). In moderate and severe pulmonary hypertension, R in V1 ≥ 7 mm, R/S in V1 &gt; 1 andR in V1+S in V5 ≥ 10 mm had good sensitivity (60.5% and 63.2%; 65.1% and 68.4%; 53.5% and 63.2% respectively), good specificity (100% and 100%; 100% and 100%; 100% and 100% respectively), good PPV (100% and 100%; 100% and 100%; 100% and 100% respectively) and NPV (19% and 22.2%; 21.1% and 25%; 16.7% and 22.2% respectively). Conclusion: The sensitivity of the ECG parameters was as a whole low to moderate in detection of pulmonary hypertension by assessing presence of RVH. However, certain ECG criteria for RVH detection in mitral stenosis patients have acceptable predictive value only in moderate to severe pulmonary hypertension."

Studies have showed trace element concentrations varied in patients with AF and may be involved in the pathogenesis of AF. However, no data is currently available for those with VHD. Methods Urine samples as well as clinical data were collected from 72 VHD patients with AF (VHDAF) and 72 VHD patients without AF (VHD) and further analyzed for a panel of trace elements: lithium, manganese, cobalt, copper, zinc, arsenic, selenium, strontium, Cadmium, mercury, thallium, lead. Quantile g-computation was adopted to explore the joint effect of the 12 trace elements on AF in this population, and internal validation was performed using 1,000 bootstrap re-samples. Results Compared with the VHD group, Sr levels were reduced, while Mn, Cu and Hg concentrations were increased in the VHDAF group. Quantile g-computation model indicated a significant association between the mixtures of the 12 urinary trace elements and AF in patients with heart valve disease (adjusted OR: 2.051; 95% CI: 1.180–3.565; p = 0.011). Positive partial effect was owing to Cu (weight: 0.43) and Hg (weight: 0.18), while negative partial effect mainly attributed to Sr (weight: 0.43) and Li (weight: 0.23). Conclusion VHDAF patients had higher Cu levels and lower Sr levels, and the two elements have been supposed to exert the largest influence on AF. Further research is needed to establish the causal relationships."

Although the initial insult is driven by autoimmune responses triggered by Group A Streptococcus infection, the sustained progression of valvular fibrosis involves a complex interplay of persistent immune activation, chronic inflammation, and, critically, long‐term mechanical stress. Mechanical forces arising from altered hemodynamics and structural valve deformation perpetuate valvular interstitial cell activation, endothelial‐to‐mesenchymal transition, and extracellular matrix remodeling, thereby driving fibrosis even after acute inflammation resolves. Current therapeutic options to halt or reverse mitral valve fibrosis are limited, with surgical repair or replacement remaining the primary interventions for advanced disease. Advancing mechanistic understanding through physiologically relevant models, coupled with early diagnostic strategies and multitargeted antifibrotic approaches, holds promise for preserving valve function. Integrating molecular insights with scalable public health measures may ultimately mitigate the global burden of rheumatic heart disease and improve outcomes for affected populations."

This review outlines the complex interplay of traditional, transplant-specific, and recipient- and donor-related risk factors that sustain a high cardiovascular burden post-transplantation. While kidney function restoration reduces uremic toxins and improves cardiometabolic parameters, new challenges arise from immunosuppressive therapies, persistent hypertension, post-transplant diabetes mellitus, and chronic inflammation. Common cardiovascular complications include coronary artery disease, heart failure, valvular disease, peripheral artery disease, and refractory hypertension. Risk stratification tools and guidelines often fail to account for transplant-specific variables, resulting in suboptimal management. Although some pharmacological strategies and careful antihypertensive regimens show promise, most evidence is extrapolated from non-transplant populations due to the lack of dedicated randomized controlled trials. Emerging therapies like SGLT2 inhibitors, GLP-1 receptor agonists and non-steroidal mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists hold potential but require further validation in this population. Moreover, sex disparities persist in access to transplantation and in post-transplant outcomes, with men generally experiencing higher cardiovascular risk but women potentially facing greater relative mortality. The review underscores the urgent need for transplant-specific cardiovascular research, personalized therapeutic strategies including precision medicine, and greater inclusion of women in research. Optimizing cardiovascular outcomes in KTRs will require multidisciplinary collaboration, rigorous evidence generation, and an integrated approach to risk prediction, prevention, and treatment."

This pathology is the most prevalent valvular heart disease worldwide and is associated with a poor prognosis. Despite extensive research, no pharmacological treatments are available to slow or reverse valvular degeneration, making aortic valve replacement the only current therapeutic option. This lack of clinical success may stem from an incomplete understanding of the disease's mechanisms and the limitations of current preclinical models, which do not fully replicate the complexity of CAVD and its associated risk factors and comorbidities. Indeed, while existing models offer valuable insights, a deeper understanding of CAVD requires incorporating comorbidities, gender-specific mechanisms, and dynamic cellular and tissue-level changes. This review aims to provide the reader with an overview of preclinical models developed in recent years to study CAVD, assessing their strengths and limitations. We review how these models can be used to mimic and/or investigate the cellular and molecular mechanisms involved in CAVD development, and highlight how key risk factors and comorbidities can be incorporated to enhance the translational potential of research. We hope that this approach will help guide researchers in selecting the most appropriate model for their studies, with the goal of advancing the identification of effective therapeutic candidates."

Its causes can be divided into two large groups: those of genetic origin and those of nongenetic origin, which include infectious, toxic, and autoimmune disease causes, among others. Its natural course varies significantly based on the different etiologies and its diagnosis can influence the disease's management and prognosis. Clinical case: 29-year-old male, with a history of having suffered from Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia at the age of 4 with complete remission of the disease demonstrated at that time by bone marrow aspirate and immunophenotype, having been treated with anthracyclines. On this occasion, he attended due to the presence of sudden onset dyspnea and hemoptysis, for which in the first instance, due to the previously mentioned history, an attempt was made to rule out pulmonary thromboembolism with chest Angio tomography, which was corroborated by said study and demonstrating the presence of two intracavitary thrombi. Therefore, a transthoracic echocardiogram was performed, highlighting severe dilation of the left ventricle. Management for heart failure was adjusted based on structural alteration demonstrated by echocardiography, with favorable clinical evolution. Conclusions: The natural history of dilated cardiomyopathy is not easy to establish due to the wide heterogeneity of its etiology and the different rates of progression depending on it. In some cases, there may be functional recovery after acute myocardial damage, for example, in cardiomyopathy induced by tachycardia or in that induced by cardiotoxic drugs.
