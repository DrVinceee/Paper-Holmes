CT coronary angiography (CTA) and CT-derived fractional flow reserve (FFRCT) are tools used to assess CAD. However, adoption in the TAVR population is hindered by safety concerns with nitroglycerin and beta-blockers. The safety, accuracy, and utility of CTA and FFRCT optimised with these medications for TAVR have not been established.
This international, multi-center, prospective registry included severe AS patients referred for TAVR, assessed for CAD with CTA and FFRCT. Patients all received nitroglycerin and beta-blockers as needed to optimise image quality. Severe ventricular dysfunction, recent syncope/heart failure, critical hemodynamics, or prior revascularization were excluded. Significant CAD was defined as CTA stenosis ≥50 ​% and FFRCT≤0.75. Primary endpoint was per-patient sensitivity and negative predictive value (NPV) of CTA compared to invasive coronary angiography (ICA). Secondary endpoints included specificity and positive predictive value (PPV) of CTA and FFRCT, safety, feasibility (non-evaluable rate), and the modelled potential of CTA ​+ ​FFRCT to reduce pre-TAVR ICA.
327 patients (75.9 ​± ​9.7 years, 53 ​% male) underwent CTA. CTA was safe and well tolerated in nearly all patients, with transient hypotension in 4 (1.2 ​%). CTA was evaluable in 326 patients (99.7 ​%), with 9 (2.8 ​%) having a non-evaluable vessel. FFRCT and ICA were performed in 110 (33.6 ​%) and 133 (40.7 ​%) patients, respectively. Per-patient sensitivity, specificity, NPV, and PPV of CTA were 100 ​%, 71.4 ​%, 100 ​%, and 75.9 ​% and per-vessel 82.7 ​%, 78.9 ​%, 92.3 ​%, and 59.9 ​%. FFRCT improved specificity and PPV to 88.9 ​% and 88.0 ​% for per-patient and 95.1 ​% and 81.8 ​% for per-vessel analysis. Using a simulated triage model deferring ICA in patients with CTA <50 ​% or ≥50 ​% stenosis with FFRCT >0.75, 267 patients (81.7 ​%) could potentially have avoided ICA.
Coronary CTA performed with nitroglycerin and selective use of beta-blockers is safe and effective for assessing CAD in stable severe AS patients. Combining CTA and FFRCT enhances diagnostic accuracy, potentially reducing the need for invasive angiography and streamlining TAVR workup."

In this retrospective cohort study, we analysed 22 906 patients with HF undergoing echocardiography between 2010 and 2020. AS was classified as mild, moderate, low-gradient (LG) or severe according to guideline criteria. Outcomes were assessed using Cox regression, stratified by HF subtype and adjusted for clinical confounders. The primary endpoint was event-free survival, defined as all-cause mortality or aortic valve replacement (AVR).
Moderate AS was present in 5.5%, LG AS in 2.5% and severe AS in 6.5% of HF patients, with HF with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) being the most common HF subtype across all AS grades. Increasing AS severity was associated with a stepwise increase in adverse outcomes compared with HF patients without AS (adjusted HR 2.20 (95% CI 2.00 to 2.41) for moderate AS; 3.32 (95% CI 2.97 to 3.72) for LG AS and 6.20 (95% CI 5.74 to 6.69) for severe AS). These associations were consistent across HFpEF, HF with mildly reduced EF and HF with reduced EF. Despite established guideline indications, only 59.5% (95% CI 57% to 62%) of HF patients with severe AS underwent AVR within 2 years.
AS is common in HF and is associated with substantially worse long-term outcomes across all HF subtypes, even at non-severe stages. The high mortality risk and frequent lack of intervention highlight major treatment gaps and underscore the need for prospective trials evaluating earlier intervention strategies."

Confirmation of pathogenic gene variants can have important implications for the patient and their relatives. The UK National Genomic Test Directory (NGTD) provides strict criteria on the indications for GT; however, the European Society of Cardiology (ESC) recommends wider GT. We reviewed the prevalence of pathogenic genotypes in patients undergoing GT who did not meet the NGTD criteria.
We conducted a retrospective analysis of patients who underwent GT with a confirmed diagnosis of HCM or DCM attending the Essex Inherited Cardiac Conditions Clinic between January 2023 and January 2025.
257 patients were included in the analysis, with 136 patients with DCM (52.9%) and 121 patients with HCM (47.1%). The diagnostic yield of GT was 19.9% in DCM and 17.4% in HCM.14.8% of gene-positive patients with DCM and 14.3% of gene-positive patients with HCM did not meet current UK testing criteria, predominantly due to age of onset. All gene-positive patients in the DCM subgroup not meeting current NGTD criteria for testing had evidence of myocardial fibrosis.
A significant minority of patients (1 in 7) with cardiomyopathy and a pathogenic genotype did not meet current UK testing criteria; each patient has an average of 4 first-degree relatives at risk who will benefit from predictive GT. We propose the adoption of the wider ESC guidance, removing the strict age-related cut-offs and being guided more by the severity of the phenotype, particularly involving myocardial scarring."

Case reports,"Prosthetic aortic valve thrombosis is an extremely rare cause of ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI). This case highlights the diagnostic challenge of this clinical entity.
A 71-year-old man with bioprosthetic aortic and mitral valve replacement 15 years prior presented with recurrent inferior wall STEMI. Coronary angiography showed no significant stenosis, consistent with myocardial infarction with nonobstructive coronary arteries (MINOCA). Transesophageal echocardiogram revealed a 2-cm mobile thrombus on the right coronary cusp of the prosthetic aortic valve, intermittently occluding the right coronary artery ostium.
Bioprosthetic valve thrombosis typically occurs early postimplantation; this case is notable for its 15-year latency. It underscores the need to consider valve thrombosis in patients with bioprosthetic valves presenting with embolic phenomena or MINOCA, even long after surgery.
Clinicians should maintain a high suspicion for prosthetic valve thrombosis as a cause of MINOCA. Early diagnosis using comprehensive imaging, particularly transesophageal echocardiography, is critical to prevent complications."

Case reports,"Coronary artery reimplantation during aortic root replacement can be complicated by coronary ostial stenosis. Although an uncommon complication, it can cause serious sequelae including acute coronary syndrome, ventricular failure, or ventricular arrhythmias, leading to sudden cardiac death.
We present the case of a 39-year-old man with previously normal coronary arteries who underwent aortic root replacement with a mechanical valve and conduit for severe aortic regurgitation secondary to Takayasu arteritis-induced aortopathy. Coronary angiography performed 5 months after surgery for new inferior regional wall motion abnormalities showed proximal right coronary artery (RCA) stenosis. Optical coherence tomography (OCT) identified a suture through the lumen of the RCA as the cause of the stenosis. This was treated with cutting balloon dilatation followed by drug-eluting stent placement.
This is to our knowledge the first reported case of proximal RCA stenosis secondary to a suture visualized by OCT in a reimplanted coronary artery.
OCT, a high-resolution intracoronary imaging modality, can help elucidate the etiology of stenosis of a reimplanted coronary artery."
PubMed,aortic stenosis,Predicting Suboptimal Outcomes After Initially Acceptable Aortic Valve Repair in Children.,Wen Zhang; Qi Jiang; Yifan Zhu; Dian Chen; Renjie Hu; Wei Dong; Haibo Zhang,10.1016/j.athoracsur.2025.12.006,2026-01-09,The Annals of thoracic surgery,"Aortic valve repair is preferred for congenital aortic valve disease in children, but its durability is limited. Although acceptable immediate repair results improve outcomes, late failures still occur. This study aimed to identify risk factors for suboptimal outcomes after an initially acceptable repair.
We retrospectively reviewed 287 patients undergoing primary aortic valve repair (2014-2023). Acceptable repair was defined as less than moderate aortic stenosis (AS) and mild or less aortic insufficiency (AI) after bypass. Suboptimal outcomes were defined as more than moderate AS/AI or reintervention after discharge. Cox analysis identified predictors among patients with acceptable repair, with a nomogram developed for pure AS patients.
Median age at repair was 3.5 years (interquartile range, 1.0-8.1 years). Acceptable repair was achieved in 183 of 287 (64%). Median follow-up was 2.5 years (interquartile range, 0.7-4.7 years). Acceptable repair yielded superior 4-year freedom from suboptimal outcomes vs residual lesions (75% vs 51%, P < .001). Among 121 pure AS patients with acceptable repair, independent predictors for suboptimal outcomes were smaller preoperative annulus z-score (hazard ratio [HR], 0.69; P = .007), higher preoperative peak gradient (HR, 1.02; P = .034), and prior balloon aortic valvuloplasty (HR, 5.92, P < .001). The nomogram showed good discrimination (C index = 0.78). For mixed/pure AI patients, leaflet extension/augmentation was associated with suboptimal outcomes on univariate but not multivariable analysis.
Acceptable initial repair is crucial but does not guarantee long-term success. Smaller annulus z-score, higher gradient, and prior balloon aortic valvuloplasty in pure AS independently predict subsequent valve failure despite adequate initial repair. These factors may aid risk stratification and inform surveillance intensity."

The procedure was technically challenging due to complex thoracic anatomy, small aortic annulus, and intermediate-risk of coronary obstruction. A self-expanding Evolut FX + valve were successfully implanted with favourable haemodynamic outcomes and no major complications.
This case highlights the feasibility and importance of individualized planning in complex redo-TAVI interventions in patients with rare congenital disorders."

Current evidence suggests that while routine PCI in TAVR candidates for stable CAD may offer limited benefit, revascularization in patients with complex CAD or high anatomical burden may improve outcomes. This review further characterizes the incidence, proposed mechanisms, and prognostic significance of post-TAVR coronary events and outlines emerging strategies to optimize ischemic and procedural outcomes in this high-risk cohort."

For chronic stable angina, this involves facilitating decision-making between percutaneous coronary intervention and guideline-directed medical therapy according to personalized risks and benefits associated with these 2 treatment options. In severe aortic valve stenosis, SDM again comes to play, this time to select between transcatheter aortic valve implantation and surgical aortic valve replacement. The implementation of SDM in South Korea faces challenges, including limited patient involvement and preference for physician-driven decisions. Structural improvements cover multidisciplinary heart team discussion and patient education tools which integrate SDM well into enhancing patient-centered care by addressing these barriers to improve treatment accessibility and outcome in the South Korean healthcare system."

Although international guidelines increasingly recognize Lp(a) as a risk-enhancing factor, in many Asian populations thresholds for high Lp(a) and treatment strategies remain undefined. This Korean position paper, developed by the Lp(a) Task Force of the Korean Society of Lipid and Atherosclerosis, presents an evidence-based summary of the pathophysiology, clinical relevance, and therapeutic landscape surrounding Lp(a), with a focus on Korean-specific data. It reviews the genetic architecture of Lp(a), ethnic variability in concentrations, and its mechanistic roles in inflammation, thrombosis, and calcification. Based on large Korean cohorts, a 3-tiered classification is proposed of normal (<30 mg/dL), borderline high (30-49 mg/dL), and high (≥50 mg/dL), harmonizing global thresholds with local data. The document also highlights the limitations of current Lp(a) assays in Korea, and calls for standardized, isoform-insensitive testing. Novel therapeutics, including antisense oligonucleotides, small interfering RNAs, and small molecular inhibitors, have shown promising Lp(a)-lowering effects, with multiple phase 3 trials currently ongoing, or in planning. Given the unmet clinical need, the paper recommends incorporating Lp(a) into cardiovascular risk assessment, and calls for Korean-specific longitudinal studies, national screening strategies, and participation in clinical trials. These efforts will help clarify Lp(a)-associated risk in Korean patients and guide the adoption of future targeted therapies."
PubMed,aortic stenosis,Evolution of the Aorta After Valve Replacement in Bicuspid Aortic Valves: Results at Mid-Term Follow-Up.,Raffaele Giordano; Shadi Hamameh; Vincenzo Speranza; Concetta Calanni; Emanuele Pilato; Luigi Di Tommaso,10.1016/j.hlc.2025.09.009,2026-01-19,"Heart, lung & circulation","Bicuspid aortic valve (BAV) is a common congenital heart defect often associated with ascending aorta dilation. Current guidelines suggest surgical intervention for diameters ≥45 mm in conjunction with surgical aortic valve replacement (SAVR). However, the optimal management of ascending aortas measuring 40-44 mm remains under debate. This study aims to evaluate the evolution of aortic diameter in patients with BAV and ascending aorta diameters between 40 and 44 mm undergoing aortic valve replacement, assessing whether a conservative approach is justified.
We conducted a retrospective observational study, analysing 88 patients with BAV who underwent SAVR between January 2012 and December 2018. Patients were divided into two groups based on preoperative ascending aorta diameters: <40 mm (Group 1, n=15) and the ≥40 and <45 mm (Group 2, n=11). Follow-up of at least 5 years included aortic dilation rates, survival, and reoperation rates.
No significant differences were observed in aortic dilation between the two groups during follow-up, with overall annual dilation rates of 0.2±0.07 mm/year. Survival rates were 86.3% for Group 1 and 81.9% for Group 2, with no reoperations required in either group.
Patients with BAV and ascending aorta diameters of 40-44 mm do not require prophylactic aortic replacement during AVR, provided they undergo regular follow-up. These findings support current guidelines advocating conservative management for ascending aorta diameters in this range. However, in younger patients or those nearing the 45 mm threshold, surgical replacement may still be considered to pre-empt future complications."

Our study aims to describe and compare the clinical, biochemical, and genetic profiles of pediatric patients diagnosed with FH based on LDL-C levels exceeding 400 mg/dL (10.4 mmol/L) and confirmed by biallelic pathogenic variants in low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR) or low-density lipoprotein receptor adapter protein-1 (LDLRAP1) genes.
This retrospective cohort study included 39 pediatric patients diagnosed with FH at a tertiary care center. Clinical data were analyzed, including age at diagnosis, family history, lipid profile, presence of xanthomas, and cardiovascular complications. Molecular analysis was conducted using next-generation sequencing (NGS) and Sanger sequencing to confirm pathogenic variants. Statistical comparisons were performed between the LDLR and LDLRAP1 variant groups regarding lipid profiles, treatment response, and cardiovascular outcomes.
Among 39 patients, 32 and 7 had pathogenic variants in LDLR and LDLRAP1 genes, respectively. Genetic analysis identified 27 unique pathogenic variants in LDLR (including 5 novel mutations) and 4 in LDLRAP1 causal for autosomal recessive hypercholesterolemia (ARH), highlighting the molecular diversity of FH. Compared to the LDLR variant group, LDLRAP1 variant patients had significantly lower untreated LDL-C levels (640.0 ± 155.6 mg/dL [16.6 ± 4.0 mmol/L] vs 506.9 ± 130.1 mg/dL [13.1 ± 3.4 mmol/L], P = .026] and showed a superior response to lipid-lowering therapy (LLT), with a greater percentage (70.6% ± 12.0%) reduction in LDL-C levels (P = .015). While xanthomas were present in 62.5% of LDLR variant patients, they were less frequent (42.9%) in the LDLRAP1 group (P = .107). Cardiovascular complications were observed exclusively in LDLR variant patients. Fourteen patients required lipoprotein apheresis (LA), and one underwent liver transplantation due to severe aortic stenosis.
This study highlights the importance of genetic testing in differentiating classical semidominant homozygous FH from ARH, given their phenotypic overlap but distinct treatment responses. LDLRAP1 variant patients with ARH exhibit better LDL-C reductions with conventional LLT, suggesting a milder phenotype. Early diagnosis, aggressive LLT, and novel treatments are essential to mitigate cardiovascular risk. Future studies with larger cohorts and long-term follow-ups are needed to refine treatment strategies for pediatric FH."

Beyond being an incidental finding, MAC contributes to mitral valve dysfunction, arrhythmias, systemic embolisation and elevated cardiovascular risk. In developed countries, it has now overtaken rheumatic disease as the leading cause of mitral stenosis.The pathophysiology of MAC involves chronic mechanical stress, pro-inflammatory activation and osteogenic differentiation of valvular cells. Progression is accelerated by age, chronic kidney disease and metabolic derangements. Diagnosing MAC-related valve dysfunction is challenging, as traditional echocardiographic measures often prove unreliable. Multimodality imaging-including 3D echocardiography and cardiac CT-is essential for assessing anatomy, function and procedural feasibility. Importantly, symptoms often reflect combined valvular (eg, aortic stenosis) and myocardial disease (eg, heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) phenocopy), necessitating careful haemodynamic evaluation to avoid futile interventions.Management should prioritise medical therapy for symptom control and comorbid HFpEF, reserving interventions for selected patients. Surgical and transcatheter approaches carry high risk and should be undertaken only in specialised centres. Future advances may include tailored devices and therapies targeting calcification pathways."

Advances,"The specific anatomy of bicuspid aortic valve (BAV) increases the incidence of ≥ mild paravalvular leakage (PVL) after transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR).
The purpose of this study was to develop and validate a model for predicting post-TAVR PVL in patients with BAV.
A total of 1,080 patients (373 cases with type 0 and 707 cases with type 1) undergoing TAVR were analyzed. The random forest (RF) model was established to predict PVL. Logistic regression analysis was used to investigate predictive differentiation and accuracy values based on the receiver-operating characteristic curve. Additionally, 109 cases further verified the reliability and stability of the model.
The RF model of the derivation data set produced 7 predictors, including the corrected calcification volume (Corr-CV) of leaflets, the Corr-CV of annular surroundings, the Corr-CV of the left ventricular outflow tract, the perimeter of the left ventricular outflow tract, the plane/perimeter of the supra-annular plane, horizontal aorta, annular ellipticity, and postdilation. The area under the curve (AUC), accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity of the RF and the logistic model were 0.982, 0.994, 0.997, 0.993, and 0.978, 0.951, 0.917, 0.957, respectively. The AUC of the RF model in the validation data set was 0.975, whereas the AUC of the logistic analysis model was 0.988. Furthermore, the decision curve analysis and clinical impact curve analysis verified the clinical applicability and net benefit.
The machine learning model with 7 predictors effectively identifies post-TAVR PVL risk in patients with BAV stenosis, aiding procedural planning and PVL prevention. (Study on Standard Evaluation System and Optimal Treatment Path of Senile Valvular Heart Disease; NCT05044338)."

We aimed to evaluate the association of SA with LV function, remodelling, and clinical outcomes in AF patients undergoing AVR.
We analyzed AF patients undergoing AVR between 2000 and 2023. Inverse-probability-of-treatment weighting (IPTW) was used to adjust for baseline differences. Temporal changes in LV ejection fraction (LVEF) and LV mass index (LVMI) were assessed using nonlinear mixed-effect models based on 1,974 echocardiographic measurements.
Among 389 patients (aged 68.8 ± 8.2 years), 258 (66.3%) underwent SA. In the IPTW-adjusted cohort, SA was not associated with increased operative mortality (P = 0.262). During a median follow-up of 5.2 years, all-cause mortality (P = 0.174) and stroke (P = 0.580) were similar between groups. In longitudinal analyses, SA showed a non-significant trend towards higher LVEF in the overall cohort (inter-group P = 0.055) and no significant differences in LVMI (P = 0.158). In patients with ≥3 echocardiograms (n = 248), between-group differences became significant, with higher LVEF (5-year difference +3.0%; 95% confidence interval [CI], +0.3 to + 5.4; P = 0.031, inter-group P = 0.003) and lower LVMI (1-year difference -13.0 g/m2; 95% CI, -20.4 to - 5.4; P = 0.003, inter-group P = 0.032). Associations were more pronounced in patients with aortic stenosis.
SA during AVR was associated with modestly more favorable LV remodelling without increasing operative or long-term clinical risks. Given small absolute differences, these findings should be interpreted cautiously, and further studies with longer follow-up are warranted."

In 2024, pembrolizumab was approved as a first-line treatment for unresectable or recurrent gastric cancer. Conversion surgery following ICI-based chemotherapy has been reported; however, cases involving pembrolizumab-based first-line therapy remain rare. Here, we report a case of conversion surgery after treatment with capecitabine plus oxaliplatin (CAPOX), combined with pembrolizumab for unresectable advanced gastric cancer.
An 82-year-old man presented with anorexia and was referred to our department for surgical evaluation. Upper gastrointestinal endoscopy revealed circumferential type 3 gastric cancer extending from the lower gastric body to the antrum with pyloric stenosis. Contrast-enhanced CT showed para-aortic lymph node metastases, resulting in a diagnosis of stage IVB gastric cancer (cT4aN2M1, 15th edition of the Japanese Classification of Gastric Carcinoma [JGCA]). First, we performed a laparoscopic gastrojejunal bypass to treat anorexia and oral intake difficulties due to pyloric stenosis. The patient then received 5 cycles of CAPOX plus pembrolizumab. Subsequent upper gastrointestinal endoscopy revealed significant scarring with residual cancer cells, and contrast-enhanced CT showed significant shrinkage of the primary tumor lesion and para-aortic lymph nodes. Because R0 resection was achievable, we performed conversion surgery involving open distal gastrectomy with D2 and para-aortic lymphadenectomy. Postoperative pathological findings revealed a small number of residual cancer cells in the submucosa, with no viable cancer cells detected in the para-aortic lymph nodes (ypT1bN0M0, ypStage IA). The pathological response grade was 2b according to the 15th edition of the JGCA. At 6 months postoperatively, the patient remains alive and recurrence-free.
Conversion surgery after CAPOX plus pembrolizumab chemotherapy is a potential therapeutic strategy for unresectable advanced gastric cancer."

Patients were divided in two groups: patients occurred major vascular complications (MVC group) and those who did not present the complication (No-MVC group). The primary end-point was the 30-day mortality. A 1:1 propensity score matching was performed, and clinical outcomes were compared at 30 days and up to 2 years.
Between 2012 to 2023, a total of 2,296 underwent a percutaneous-transfemoral approach. Major vascular complications occurred in 6.6% (n = 151) and were associated with increased transfusion requirement, major bleeding, reinterventions, and longer hospital stays. Female sex, obesity, higher STS score, use of the Manta closure device, and post-implantation balloon valvuloplasty were independently associated with major vascular complications. The 30-day mortality was similar between groups (p = 0.723). The long-term survival was lower in the MVC group (p = 0.016). Two-year survival after propensity score matching did not differ between groups (p = 0.08).
Major vascular complications after transfemoral transcatheter valve implantation are associated with worse clinical outcomes and reduced long-term survival despite similar at 30-day mortality. Recognizing high-risk patients, optimizing procedural planning, and considering alternative access routes may help reduce vascular complications."

With a focus on the prevalent psychological complications following the onset of this condition, this study aimed to explore the correlation between antenatal depression and Corona disease anxiety, personality traits, and postpartum depression during the COVID-19 pandemic.                                                           Materials and Methods:                     This cross-sectional descriptive-analytical study investigated women receiving care at health centers affiliated with Kerman University of Medical Sciences during the last month of their pregnancy and the postpartum period in 2022. Following the acquisition of informed consent, participants were assessed using various measures, including demographic and obstetric information, the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale, the Corona Disease Anxiety Scale (CDAS), and the NEO Personality Inventory-Revised during their third trimester of pregnancy. The same group of participants completed the Edinburgh Depression Scale and the Corona Disease Anxiety Scale (CDAS) 4-6 weeks after childbirth.                                                           Results and Discussion:                     There was a significant correlation between family income, unwanted pregnancy as perceived by both the mother and father, and antenatal depression. Additionally, marital satisfaction played a significant role in postpartum depression. Furthermore, antenatal depression was significantly associated with neuroticism, agreeableness, and physical symptoms related to Corona disease anxiety. Personality traits, with the exception of extroversion and conscientiousness, and various domains of Corona disease anxiety, excluding psychological symptoms, were also significantly associated with postpartum depression.                                                           Conclusion:                     During pandemics or epidemics, such as the COVID-19 outbreak, experiencing mental distress during pregnancy can contribute to mental health issues during the postpartum period. This risk is particularly true in individuals with unique personality traits, emphasizing the need for increased focus on mental health within prenatal care during these crises."

Mixed effect linear regression was used to check the relationship between the variables and the length of stay in the hospital.                                                           Results:                     The findings indicated that the most important risk factors for the severity of COVID-19 were heart diseases (OR=1.67,95%CI:1.20-2.30), increasing age (OR=2.23 for age&gt;54, 95%CI:1.70- 2.90), male gender (OR=1.47,95%CI:1.10-1.96), respiratory diseases other than asthma, and frequency of admission (OR=1.60,95%CI:1.20-2.15). All patients who underwent readmission experienced a shorter duration of hospitalization during their subsequent admission (OR=0.94,95%CI:0.91,0.96) and had a higher mortality rate (30% within 14 days, 26.6% between 14-90 days). Patients readmitted at intervals of 14-90 days and greater than 90 days exhibited lower disease severity compared to those readmitted within the 0-14 day period.                                                           Conclusion:                     Examining readmissions, the severity of COVID-19, and the length of hospital stay in affected patients are important factors for planning and allocating resources for COVID-19 management and treatment. These factors can help policymakers develop effective clinical guidelines for hospitalization or outpatient treatment of COVID-19 patients and contribute to reducing the burden of disease in the community."

Kinovea, as an accessible motion-analysis software, provides both visual and quantitative feedback. However, its application in supporting technique development among beginner athletes remains insufficiently explored. Aim: This study aims to describe the use of Kinovea in biomechanics training and examine its contribution to the awareness of kinematic characteristics and movement techniques among beginner athletes. Methods: A descriptive qualitative design involved 72 beginner athletes aged 18–25 years selected through purposive sampling. Data were collected over 16 weeks through interviews, field observations, and motion video recordings analyzed using Kinovea. Kinematic data focused on joint angles, stride behavior, and movement phases during walking, running, and the flight phase. Qualitative data were analyzed using content analysis with NVivo 12, while kinematic results were interpreted descriptively to identify performance patterns and areas for technical refinement. Result: Kinematic analysis showed coordinated joint-angle patterns across all phases. Walking analysis identified arm swing angles of 50.9°–58.8° and leg separation angles of 64.3°–67.2°, indicating a stable gait rhythm. The running analysis revealed knee angles of 68.8°–69.8° and elbow angles of 87.6°–89.1°, indicating efficient propulsive mechanics. The flight phase demonstrated knee angles of 81.2°–87.8° and elbow angles of 80.4°–88.3°, suggesting effective momentum use and postural stability. These measurements supported stride-efficiency assessment and technique evaluation. Qualitative findings revealed that Kinovea enabled athletes to interpret movement phases and identify technical inefficiencies through slow-motion and frame-by-frame visualization. Conclusion: Kinovea supports basic motion analysis by providing clear kinematic information and helping beginner athletes observe and refine their movement techniques. The findings also offer practical value for coaches by enabling more precise identification of inefficient patterns and guiding targeted corrections during early-stage training."

OpenAlex,aortic stenosis,Patch plasty of the left anterior descending artery as a practical option for a myocardial bridge: A case report,Hiroyuki Nakajima; Daich Takagi; Itaru Igarashi; Takeshi Arai; Gembu Yamaura,10.1093/ehjcr/ytag021,2026-01-20,European Heart Journal - Case Reports,"Abstract Background A myocardial bridge causes a specific intraluminal flow pattern and can affect endothelial function, response to vasoactive agents, development of atherosclerosis and a patient’s prognosis. Additionally, the reliability of preoperative functional assessment, including fractional flow reserve (FFR) and reasonable patient’s selection for myotomy or coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) may be controversial. Case summary A 63-year-old man presented with shortness of breath. Echocardiography revealed severe aortic regurgitation and left ventricular dilatation. Coronary angiography revealed a myocardial bridge in the anterior descending artery (LAD) without atherosclerosis. The myocardial bridge caused 75% stenosis in systole due to compression and kinking, and 25% stenosis in diastole by visual assessment, with a FFR of 0.80 and instantaneous wave-free ratio of 0.88. Quantitative assessment showed a minimal luminal diameter of 0.79 mm in systole, corresponding to 72.7% stenosis. A median sternotomy was performed. Following aortic cross-clamping and aortic valve replacement, the myocardial bridge was completely divided. However, the unroofed segment appeared thin and diffusely spastic. The unroofed segment of the LAD was longitudinally incised and enlarged using a free right internal thoracic artery (ITA) patch, which was approximately 25 x 12 mm. There were no postoperative complications. Postoperative coronary angiography confirmed the enlargement of the unroofed segment. Vascular remodeling caused normalisation of the diameter 6 months later. Discussion Myotomy concomitant with patch plasty using the ITA can be effective and durable option for myocardial bridges, particularly when expected CABG patency may be suboptimal because of moderate diastolic stenosis or a distal myocardial bridge location."

However, there is little information on its impact on long-term prognosis in a population without valvular disease. To examine the impact of LFS on all-cause mortality in multi-ethnic population we analyzed 4398 asymptomatic participants without clinical cardiovascular disease undergoing cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) in the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis. LV stroke volume index (SVi), LVEF and myocardial contraction fraction (MCF) were measured. LV flow states were classified as normal flow state (NFS, SVi &gt;35 ml/m 2 ), low-flow state (LFS, 30-34 ml/m 2 ) and very low-flow state (VLFS: SVi &lt;30 ml/m 2 ). Clinical data were collected at enrollment. Participants were followed up for a median of 14.2 years. All-cause and cardiovascular disease mortalities were used as primary endpoints. All-cause mortality was 16.2% and cardiovascular disease mortality 3.5%. VLFS and LFS groups had more cardiovascular risk factors and lower cardiac performance than NFS. The relationship between all-cause mortality and SVi was “L-shape with the “breakpoint” at 33.5ml/m2 for a statistical significance (p=0.009). All-cause mortality was significantly associated with LFS after adjusted for age, sex, LVEF, and LV mass index with hazard ratio (HR) 1.81, 95% CI: 1.31-2.49 for VLF and HR: 1.21, 95% CI: 0.95-1.54 for LFS with overall p value 0.001). The highest cardiovascular disease mortality was seen in VLFS."

It is also indicated for younger patients with significant comorbidities, for valve-in-valve interventions, and in selected patients with severe aortic insufficiency. We aimed to evaluate procedural and clinical outcomes of transfemoral TAVI performed over the course of 12 years by the same operators using different bioprosthetic valves. Materials and Methods: Between 2012 and 2023, 375 patients underwent TAVI in our clinic, with six types of bioprosthetic valves (Edwards Sapien XT, Medtronic Valves [CoreValve and Evolut R], Portico, Myval, Acurate Neo, and Direct Flow Medical). A transfemoral approach was used in all patients. The procedural and clinical outcomes were defined according to Valve Academic Research Consortium-3 (VARC-3) criteria. Results: The mean age of the patients was 78.4 ± 7.3, and their median STS score was 4.2 (2.9–5.9). Of the 375 patients, 361 had severe AS, 4 had severe aortic insufficiency, 5 were valve-in-valve, and 5 were valve-in-TAVI. Seven patients required a second valve implantation: four due to embolization of the prosthetic valve and three due to deep implantation of the prosthetic valve. Based on the VARC-3 criteria, the rates of technical success and device success were 90.4% and 85.3%, respectively. Major vascular complications were observed in 18 (4.8%) patients. Also, 42 (11.2%) patients required permanent pacemaker implantation. The incidence of moderate or worse paravalvular leak was 2.9%. The peri-procedural, 30-day, 1-year, and 5-year mortality rates were 5.1%, 4.3%, 15.2%, and 45.6%, respectively. STS scores (HR:1.129, 95%CI: 1.068–1.192, p &lt; 0.001) and post-TAVI acute kidney injury (HR:3.993, 95%CI:1.629–9.785, p = 0.002) were detected as independent predictors of mortality in Cox regression analysis. Conclusions: This registry demonstrated the evolution of TAVI procedures at a single center over 12 years. A high level of collaboration between experienced operators and innovations in devices seem to be the key features for achieving high procedural success and low complication rates."

Derisheva; V. L. Lukinov,10.15829/1560-4071-2025-6568,2026-01-18,Russian Journal of Cardiology,"Aim . To optimize the risk assessment of hemodynamically significant coronary artery (CA) stenosis in COVID-19 survivors with chronic coronary syndrome (CCS) based on a comprehensive analysis of anamnestic, clinical and paraclinical parameters. Material and methods. The study included 431 patients with CCS and positive SARS-CoV-2 serological tests for &gt;12 weeks prior to enrollment (203 with mild and 228 with moderate COVID-19). The examination included clinical and laboratory parameters (including apolipoprotein A1 and B, lipoprotein(a)), systemic inflammation biomarkers, echocardiography, coronary angiography, and residual risk assessment. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was performed to identify independent predictors of hemodynamically significant coronary artery stenosis. Statistical processing was performed using RStudio 2025.05.0 (R 4.4.2), with p&lt;0,05 considered statistically significant. R e sults . Patients with moderate COVID-19 were more likely to have class II obesity (p=0,004), type 2 diabetes (p=0,007), C3-C4 chronic kidney disease (p&lt;0,001), functional class III angina (p&lt;0,001), heart failure with mildly reduced ejection fraction (p=0,003), as well as more pronounced metabolic disorders and inflammatory shifts. In this group, GZSCA (86,4% vs, 68,0%; p&lt;0,001), multivessel disease (p=0,046), and coronary artery restenosis (p=0,042) were diagnosed significantly more often. Multivariate logistic regression analysis identified the following predictors for hemodynamically significant CA stenosis: moderate COVID-19 (odds ratio (OR) 1,84 [1,02; 3,39], p=0,047), aortic diameter &gt;3,28 cm (OR 2,52 [1,42; 4,55], p=0,002), segmental myocardial contractility disorders (OR 3,72 [1,71; 9,06], p=0,002), extracranial artery atherosclerosis (OR 2,56 [1,37; 4,78], p=0,003), hyperuricemia &gt;308,5 μmol/L (OR 2,22 [1,25; 3,95], p=0,006), high-density lipoprotein &lt;1,27 mmol/L (OR 1,99 [1,11; 3,62], p=0,021), high residual risk for low density lipoprotein (OR 2,48 [1,31; 4,7], p=0,005), triglyceride-glucose index &gt;9,46 (OR 1,89 [0,91; 4,22], p=0,102), fibrinogen &gt;3,25 g/L (OR 1,62 [0,83; 3,12], p=0,149), history of hypertension &gt;16 years (OR 1,85 [0,98; 3,6], p=0,064) and age &gt;56 years (OR 1,65 [0,88; 3,09], p=0,116). Based on the resulting multifactorial model, an online risk prediction calculator for hemodynamically significant CA stenosis in COVID-19 survivors with CCS. Conclusion . Previous COVID-19, especially with moderate course, is associated with a more unfavorable clinical and angiographic phenotype of CCS. The developed risk prediction algorithm for hemodynamically significant CA stenosis can serve as a practical tool for early risk stratification and optimization of patient management in the post-COVID period."

While transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) is established for symptomatic AS, its objective functional benefits in asymptomatic individuals are not well‐defined. Aims To evaluate the safety and hemodynamic efficacy of TAVR in asymptomatic patients with severe aortic stenosis and to objectively quantify their functional recovery using cardiopulmonary exercise testing (CPET). Methods In this single‐center retrospective study, 156 asymptomatic patients with severe AS undergoing TAVR with the VitaFlow valve were enrolled. Safety endpoints were adjudicated per Valve Academic Research Consortium (VARC‐3) criteria. Efficacy was assessed via serial echocardiography and brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) levels at baseline, 1 day, 7 days, 3 months, and 12 months. Functional capacity was objectively quantified using CPET at baseline, 1 month, and 12 months. Results Procedural success was 100% with no mortality, stroke, or major complications. Hemodynamics improved immediately (mean gradient: 51.6 ± 11.7 to 13.7 ± 7.2 mmHg, p &lt; 0.001) and remained stable at 12 months. BNP levels decreased significantly from 7 days onward ( p &lt; 0.05). CPET revealed substantial improvements in functional capacity: peak oxygen uptake (VO₂) increased from 15.6 ± 3.6 to 19.8 ± 4.0 mL/kg/min ( p &lt; 0.001), anaerobic threshold (AT) increased, and ventilatory efficiency (VE/VCO₂ slope) decreased (all p &lt; 0.001). The incidence of exercise‐induced adverse events also significantly declined. Conclusions TAVR is a safe and highly effective intervention for asymptomatic severe AS, resulting in immediate hemodynamic improvement and sustained, objective enhancement of functional capacity, as rigorously quantified by CPET."

Integrated care pathways (ICPs) supported by structured data systems may improve safety and outcomes, but real-world evidence in AS remains limited. We aimed to characterize a contemporary cohort of patients with severe AS managed within an ICP at a tertiary hospital, comparing profiles and outcomes by treatment strategy, and to describe diagnostic procedures and the implementation of cardiac rehabilitation (CR) interventions embedded in the pathway. Methods Prospective observational study of all consecutive patients with AS evaluated by a multidisciplinary heart team between 2018 and 2022. Baseline characteristics and frailty, diagnostic tests, CR interventions, procedural details, and outcomes were collected via an interoperable data management platform and compared across treatment groups: surgical (SAVR) or transcatheter (TAVR) valve replacement, or conservative management. Early survival was assessed using Kaplan–Meier analysis with log-rank testing. Results Among 984 patients (median age 78 years, 42% women), 43.9% underwent SAVR, 49.8% TAVR, and 6.3% were managed conservatively. TAVR and conservative groups were older, frailer, and had higher comorbidity. Device success at 30 days was high (≈91%), with periprocedural death at 2.5% for interventions, vs. 9.7% early mortality for conservative management ( p &amp;lt; 0.001). Early survival differed significantly (log-rank p = 0.004). TAVR had higher permanent pacemaker implantation (21.7% vs. 7.4% for SAVR, p &amp;lt; 0.001) and major vascular complications (4.1% vs. 0.2%, p &amp;lt; 0.001), while SAVR had more reoperations (8.3% vs. 0.2%, p &amp;lt; 0.001) and atrial fibrillation (18.9% vs. 10.1%, p = 0.001). Prehabilitation was implemented in 64.6% of candidates, while postprocedural CR remained underutilized (11.3%). Conclusions Integrated care for a cohort of patients with AS, supported by structured data management, enabled comprehensive profiling, systematic outcome monitoring, and identification of improvement areas. Both SAVR and TAVR achieved high success with low early mortality, while conservative management had poor survival."

The in vitro experiments include a mock-loop circulatory system with rubber valve models derived from patient CT images, both with and without calcifications. Experiments were conducted under varying flow conditions simulating rest and exercise, based on clinical measurements during dobutamine stress testing, with dobutamine infusion rates of 0, 5, 10, and 20 microg/kg/min. During the experiments pressures were measured proximally and distally to the rubber valve with 10EZ pressure sensors. Flow was measured distally to the valve using an ultrasonic flow probe. Valve movement was recorded with an endoscope connected to a camera. The experiment was replicated in the FSI model, implemented in LS-DYNA R16. Flow and valve dynamics of the in vitro experiments and the FSI model were compared. This data set contains:1) Matlab scripts to reproduce figures of manuscript.2) Post-processed simulation and experimental data needed to reproduce figures of manuscript.3) LS-DYNA input files for the simulations (.k files)."
OpenAlex,aortic stenosis,Assessing Potential Valve-Preserving Effects of SGLT2 Inhibitors in Degenerative Aortic Stenosis: A Propensity-Matched Study,Olivier Morel; Michael Guglieri; Guillaume Viboud; Benjamin Marchandot; A. Bisson; Amandine Granier; Mélanie Burban; Anne Bernard; Laurent Fauchier,10.3390/jcm15020714,2026-01-15,Journal of Clinical Medicine,"Background: Sodium–glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors (SGLT2 inhibitors), initially developed for glycemic control in type 2 diabetes, have demonstrated robust cardiovascular and renal benefits. Emerging evidence suggests that these agents may also affect valvular pathobiology, particularly in degenerative aortic stenosis (AS), through anti-inflammatory and antifibrotic mechanisms. Objectives: This study evaluated whether SGLT2 inhibitor use is associated with improved clinical outcomes in degenerative AS, including all-cause mortality and the need for SAVR or TAVR, recognizing that these endpoints represent surrogate rather than direct measures of valve hemodynamic progression. Methods: A retrospective cohort analysis was conducted using TriNetX, a federated electronic medical record-based research network. Diagnoses are captured using ICD-9/ICD-10-CM codes and medications using ATC codes. Adults with non-rheumatic AS were stratified by SGLT2 inhibitors use. Propensity score matching (1:1) was performed to balance baseline characteristics between treated and untreated groups (n = 10,912 per group). Primary outcomes included all-cause mortality, TAVR, and SAVR during follow-up. Echocardiographic parameters (AVA, Vmax, mean gradient) were not systematically available. Results: After adjustment for comorbidities, SGLT2 inhibitor use was independently associated with lower all-cause mortality (6.15% vs. 9.34% HR 0.595; 95% CI 0.552–0.641; p &lt; 0.001), TAVR (2.81% vs. 2.89% HR 0.835; 95% CI 0.746–0.934; p = 0.002), SAVR (1.28% vs. 1.90% HR 0.514; 95% CI 0.442–0.599; p &lt; 0.001), cardiac arrest (0.82% vs. 1.21% HR 0.71; 95% CI 0.582–0.867; p &lt; 0.001), and end-stage kidney disease (0.40% vs. 1.0% HR 0.292; 95% CI 0.222–0.384; p &lt; 0.001). Although these associations may suggest slower disease progression, interpretation is limited by the lack of systematic echocardiographic follow-up. Conclusions: In addition to their established benefits in heart failure and renal protection, SGLT2 inhibitors may have valve-preserving effects in degenerative AS. Because true hemodynamic progression could not be evaluated, these results should be viewed as associations with surrogate clinical endpoints. Prospective studies with standardized imaging are required to determine whether SGLT2 inhibition can directly alter the course of this currently untreatable disease"
OpenAlex,aortic stenosis,The Value of HALP Score in Predicting Adverse In-Hospital Clinical Outcomes in Patients Undergoing Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement,Ömer Faruk Çiçek; Mustafa Çetin; Ali Palice,10.3390/diagnostics16020276,2026-01-15,Diagnostics,"Background: Transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) is widely used in patients with severe aortic stenosis. The HALP (hemoglobin, albumin, lymphocyte, and platelet) score is an easily obtainable composite index that reflects nutritional status and systemic inflammation. Methods: In this single-center retrospective study, 140 patients who underwent TAVR between 1 April 2021, and 31 October 2024, were included. Patients were stratified according to the median HALP score (32.65) into low (&lt;32.65)- and high (≥32.65)-HALP groups. In-hospital outcomes were mortality, bleeding requiring transfusion of &gt;5 units of red blood cells, acute kidney injury (AKI), need for mechanical ventilation &gt;24 h, and length of hospital stay. Associations between the HALP score and clinical outcomes were evaluated using multivariable regression analyses, and the discriminatory performance of HALP was assessed using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves. Results: Patients with low HALP scores had higher rates of in-hospital mortality (11.4% vs. 4.2%; p = 0.002), bleeding (28.6% vs. 5.7%; p &lt; 0.001), AKI (11.4% vs. 2.9%; p &lt; 0.001), and need for mechanical ventilation &gt;24 h (25.7% vs. 14.4%; p = 0.002), as well as longer hospital stay (4.82 ± 1.50 vs. 3.62 ± 1.94 days; p = 0.001) compared with the high-HALP group. In multivariable models, a lower HALP score remained independently associated with all adverse in-hospital outcomes. ROC analysis showed good discriminatory ability of the HALP score for mortality (area under the curve [AUC] = 0.816; cut-off = 20.16), bleeding (AUC = 0.798; cut-off = 24.94), AKI (AUC = 0.737; cut-off = 26.21), and need for mechanical ventilation (AUC = 0.735; cut-off = 27.36). Conclusions: The HALP score is independently associated with adverse in-hospital clinical outcomes in patients undergoing TAVR and may serve as a simple and practical tool for early risk stratification in this population."
OpenAlex,aortic stenosis,Mid-Term Results of the Multicenter CAMPARI Registry Using the E-Liac Iliac Branch Device for Aorto-Iliac Aneurysms,Francesca Noce; Giulio Accarino; Domenico Angiletta; Del Guercio L; Sergio Zacá; Mafalda Massara; Pietro Volpe; Antonio Peluso; Loris Flora; Nicola De Rosi; Umberto Marcello Bracale,10.3390/jcdd13010048,2026-01-15,Journal of Cardiovascular Development and Disease,"Background: Intentional occlusion of the internal iliac artery (IIA) during endovascular repair of aorto-iliac aneurysms may predispose patients to pelvic ischemic complications such as gluteal claudication, erectile dysfunction, and bowel ischemia. Iliac branch devices (IBDs) have been developed to preserve hypogastric perfusion. E-Liac (Artivion/Jotec) is one of the latest modular IBDs yet reports on mid-term performance are limited to small single-center cohorts with short follow-up. The CAMpania PugliA bRanch IliaC (CAMPARI) study is a multicenter investigation of E-Liac outcomes. Methods: A retrospective observational cohort study was conducted across five Italian vascular centers. All consecutive patients undergoing E-Liac implantation for aorto-iliac or isolated iliac aneurysms between January 2015 and December 2024 were identified from prospectively maintained registries. Inclusion criteria comprised elective or urgent endovascular repair of aorto-iliac aneurysms in which an adequate distal sealing zone was not available without covering the IIA and suitability for the E-Liac device according to its instructions for use (IFU). Patients with a life expectancy &lt; 1 year or hostile anatomy incompatible with the IFU were excluded. The primary end point was freedom from branch instability (occlusion/stenosis, kinking, or detachment of the bridging stent). Secondary end points included freedom from any endoleak, freedom from device-related reintervention, freedom from gluteal claudication, aneurysm-related and all-cause mortality, acute renal failure, and sac regression &gt; 5 mm. Results: A total of 69 consecutive patients (68 male, 1 female, median age 72.0 years) received 74 E-Liac devices, including 5 bilateral implantations. The mean infrarenal aortic diameter was 45 mm and the mean CIA diameter 34 mm; 14 patients (20.0%) had a concomitant IIA aneurysm (&gt;20 mm). Concomitant fenestrated or branched aortic repair was performed in 23% of procedures. Two patients received a standalone IBD without implantation of a proximal aortic endograft. Technical success was achieved in 71/74 cases (96.0%); three failures occurred due to inability to catheterize the IIA. Distal landing was in the main IIA trunk in 58 cases and in the posterior branch in 13 cases. Over a median follow-up of 18 (6; 36) months, there were four branch instability events (5.4%): three occlusions and one bridging stent detachment. Seven patients (9.5%) developed endoleaks (one type Ib, two type II, two type IIIa, and two type IIIc). Five patients (6.8%) required reintervention, and five (6.8%) reported gluteal claudication. There were seven all-cause deaths (10%), none within 30 days or related to aneurysm rupture; causes included COVID-19 pneumonia, acute coronary syndrome, melanoma, gastric cancer, and stroke. No acute renal or respiratory failure occurred. Kaplan–Meier analysis showed 92% (95% CI 77–100) freedom from branch instability in the main-trunk group and 89% (60–100) in the posterior-branch group (log-rank p = 0.69). Freedom from any endoleak at 48 months was 87% (95% CI 75–95), and freedom from reintervention was 93% (95% CI 83–98). Conclusions: In this multicenter cohort, the E-Liac branched endograft demonstrated high technical success and favorable early–mid-term outcomes. Preservation of hypogastric perfusion using E-Liac was associated with low rates of branch instability, endoleak, and reintervention, with no 30-day mortality or aneurysm-related deaths. These findings support the safety and efficacy of E-Liac for aorto-iliac aneurysm management, although larger prospective studies with longer follow-up are needed."
OpenAlex,aortic stenosis,Anesthetic and procedural strategy for coexisting severe aortic stenosis and carotid artery stenosis: A case report,Yuri Okada; Rio Oishi; Satoshi Kimura; Moritoki Egi,10.5412/wjsp.v16.i1.115792,2026-01-15,World Journal of Surgical Procedures,"BACKGROUND Aortic stenosis (AS) often coexists with carotid artery stenosis. However, clear guidelines for the optimal treatment strategy and sequencing of interventions in patients with both conditions are lacking. CASE SUMMARY A 79-year-old man with a history of hypertension presented with right-sided paralysis and pain. Magnetic resonance imaging revealed multiple infarctions in the left cerebral hemisphere and severe stenosis of the left carotid artery. Transthoracic echocardiography also identified coexisting severe AS. Carotid artery stenosis increases the risk of stroke during aortic valve manipulation; therefore, carotid intervention may be recommended prior to aortic valve treatment. However, perioperative hypotension and bradycardia associated with carotid intervention can precipitate circulatory collapse in patients with severe AS. After a multidisciplinary conference, the decision was made to first perform transcatheter aortic valve implantation under general anesthesia, followed by carotid endarterectomy 4 months later. Both procedures were completed successfully without complications. CONCLUSION Treatment strategy should be individualized, balancing perioperative risks and benefits in patients with severe AS and carotid artery stenosis."
OpenAlex,aortic stenosis,[Analysis of optimizing indications for fetal pulmonary valvuloplasty based on a multi-parameter scoring system].,Y Wang; Y Sun; G Luo; S L Pan,,2026-01-15,PubMed,"<b>Objective:</b> To establish a multi-parametric scoring system for predicting postnatal circulatory outcomes in fetuses with critical pulmonary stenosis (CPS) and pulmonary atresia (PA) with intact ventricular septum (IVS), in order to optimize the indications for fetal pulmonary valvuloplasty (FPV). <b>Methods:</b> This was a retrospective cohort study. A total of 96 fetuses diagnosed with CPS-IVS or PA-IVS at the Women and Children's Hospital, Qingdao University between July 2018 and June 2021 were included. Fetuses who did not undergo FPV constituted the modeling cohort, while those who underwent FPV constituted the validation cohort. Fetuses were classified into biventricular and non-biventricular circulation groups based on postnatal circulatory outcomes, and prenatal fetal echocardiographic parameters were compared. Inter-group comparisons were performed using the <i>t</i> test, Mann-Whitney <i>U</i> test, <i>χ</i><sup>2</sup> test or Fisher exact test. Based on inter-group differences, parameters associated with postnatal circulatory outcomes were screened in the modeling cohort. For continuous variables, optimal cut-off values were determined using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves and the Youden index and then dichotomized. Right ventricular endocardial fibroelastosis (EFE) was graded as 0, 1 or 2 according to severity. <i>OR</i> of each parameter were calculated, and a multiparametric scoring system was constructed. ROC curves were used to evaluate its predictive performance. Post-FPV outcome improvement was assessed in the validation cohort. <b>Results:</b> Among the 96 fetuses, 78 were assigned to the modeling cohort and 18 to the validation cohort. Postnatally, biventricular circulation was achieved in 56 cases (72%) in the modeling cohort and 13 cases in the validation cohort. In the modeling cohort, the right ventricular long-axis/left ventricular long-axis (RV/LV), tricuspid annulus diameter/mitral annulus diameter (TV/MV) and pulmonary valve annulus/aortic valve annulus (PV/AV) in the non-biventricular group were lower than that in the biventricular group (all <i>P</i><0.05). The optimal cut-off values for predicting postnatal circulatory outcomes were 0.65, 0.82 and 0.78, respectively. There was statistically significant difference in the distribution of circulatory outcomes between fetuses with grade 2 EFE and those with no or grade 1 EFE (<i>χ</i><sup>2</sup>=21.28, <i>P</i><0.001). Therefore, right ventricular EFE was dichotomized in the model as ""none or grade 1"" versus ""grade 2"". Each parameter was assigned a corresponding weight based on its <i>OR</i> value, and an integer score was obtained to construct the scoring system: grade 2 right ventricular EFE was assigned 5 points, RV/LV≤0.65 was assigned 2 points, TV/MV≤0.82 was assigned 2 points, and PV/AV≤0.78 was assigned 1 point, with a maximum total score of 10 points. At cut-off scores of 3, 4, and 5 points, the areas under the curve were 0.88, 0.91, and 0.88, respectively, with the highest specificity (0.95, 95% <i>CI</i> 0.84-0.99) observed at a score threshold of 5 points. In the validation cohort, 15 fetuses had scores ≥5 points, among whom 10 fetuses achieved biventricular circulation after birth, whereas in the modeling cohort, only 1 of 18 fetuses (scores≥5 points) achieved biventricular circulation. <b>Conclusions:</b> A multiparametric scoring system based on prenatal fetal echocardiographic parameters can effectively predict non-biventricular postnatal outcomes in fetuses with CPS-IVS and PA-IVS. By identifying high-risk patients, the indications for FPV can be optimized."
