We analyzed retrospectively collected real-world data from the South Korean cohort with embolic stroke of undetermined source to examine trends in baseline characteristics, diagnostic practices, and secondary prevention strategies and to identify cardioembolic factors and supracardiac atherosclerotic lesions associated with stroke recurrence.
We analyzed 5787 patients from the Real-World Study of Embolic Stroke of Undetermined Source cohort from 19 South Korean stroke centers (2014-2019). Baseline characteristics, diagnostic and secondary prevention trends were evaluated. Factors associated with 1-year stroke recurrence were identified using multivariable Cox regression analysis in 4036 patients with follow-up data.
Over 6 years, vascular risk factors and cardioembolic evaluations significantly increased. Stroke recurrence was strongly associated with intracranial nonrelevant stenosis involving ≥2 vessels (hazard ratio [HR], 2.756, P<0.001), paroxysmal atrial fibrillation (HR, 5.590, P=0.033), atrial septal aneurysm (HR, 4.741, P=0.005), and serum creatinine levels (HR, 1.166, P=0.008). In patients without moderate-risk cardioembolic sources, a single intracranial nonrelevant stenosis and complex aortic atheroma were also linked to stroke recurrence.
Intracranial nonrelevant stenosis and complex aortic atheroma, along with cardioembolic factors like paroxysmal atrial fibrillation and atrial septal aneurysm, are key predictors of stroke recurrence in embolic stroke of undetermined source, especially those without moderate-risk cardioembolic sources. These findings emphasize the need to consider both supracardiac atherosclerotic and cardioembolic mechanisms in embolic stroke of undetermined source and to develop tailored secondary prevention strategies for atherosclerotic stroke, particularly in cases with supracardiac atherosclerotic lesions to reduce stroke recurrence."

In addition, changes in valve geometry may have haemodynamic consequences that extend beyond the narrowed orifice, influencing the overall clinical presentation of MS. The aim of this study was to develop an index to assess the haemodynamic severity of the stenosis.
A total of 186 patients with rheumatic MS who underwent comprehensive three-dimensional (3D) transoesophageal echocardiographic assessment were included. Dedicated software was used to extract a range of morphological variables to evaluate mitral valve geometry, including diameter, area, height, volume, and the aortic-mitral angle. To quantify the volume enclosed within the stenotic structure, we developed the 3D Doming Index (DI), calculated by dividing the valvular volume (tenting volume) by the theoretical volume of a cylinder generated by the mitral annulus and valvular height (tenting height). Linear regression models were employed to identify determinants of the mean pressure gradient.
The 3D Doming Index demonstrated a significant association with the transmitral pressure gradient in the multivariate model, after adjusting for confounders including age, sex, heart rate, pulmonary artery systolic pressure, net atrioventricular compliance (Cn), and left atrial volume. Incorporation of the 3D Doming Index into the model improved overall performance.
The geometric configuration of the mitral valve contributes to the haemodynamic burden of obstruction in rheumatic MS. The 3D Doming Index offers valuable insight into the relationship between valve anatomy and the resultant haemodynamic impact of the stenosis."

Valve-in-valve (ViV) TAVI has emerged as a valid treatment option in patients with failed aortic bioprosthetic valves, especially in those with intermediate, high or prohibitive risk of surgery.ViV TAVI in patients with prior surgical bioprosthesis presents significant challenges, particularly in cases with stentless valves or radiolucent posts. Therefore, adequate pre-procedural planning is of utmost importance to its success. However, our case had multiple challenges that had to be overcome, including radiolucent posts, residual chronic type A aortic dissection flap in the non-coronary cusp and large body habitus with Killip class IV. Having successfully navigated the above challenges, we report this interesting and complex case of ViV TAVI which was a procedural success associated with significant improvement and recovery."

However, data on the prevalence of PH-LHD analyzed systematically using a contemporary diagnostic framework are lacking.
We performed a systematic literature search including patients with heart failure with preserved or reduced ejection fraction (HFpEF, HFrEF), mitral regurgitation (MR) or aortic stenosis (AS) in three Western European countries (Austria, Germany, Switzerland; total population ∼102 Million in 2024). Studies reporting peak tricuspid regurgitation velocity (TRV) from echocardiography or mean pulmonary arterial pressure (mPAP) from right heart catheterization were included. We used a two-strata system to classify PH-LHD: 'at-risk' (TRV >2.8m/s) or 'manifest' (TRV >3.4m/s in combination with mPAP >20mmHg, to account for RHC referral bias). Meta-analysis was performed using a generalized linear mixed model.From N=123 reports including 51,333 patients, there were N=34, N=17, N=39, and N=37 studies focusing on HFpEF, HFrEF, aortic stenosis and mitral regurgitation, respectively. PH prevalence estimates based on TRV >2.8 m/s for patients with established HFpEF, HFrEF, aortic stenosis and mitral regurgitation were 62% (95%CI: 49-74%), 66% (95%CI: 57-74%), 73% (95%CI: 68-78%) and 80% (95%CI: 76-83%), respectively, and 20% (95%CI: 7-33%), 34% (95%CI: 24-43%), 38% (95%CI: 31-45%) and 54% (95%CI: 49-59%) when using TRV >3.4m/s in combination with mPAP >20mmHg, respectively. Extrapolation resulted in 2,287 (95%CI:1,770-2,804)/100,000 individuals 'at risk' and 805 (95%CI:325-1,285)/100,000 individuals with 'manifest' PH associated with heart failure (HFpEF and HFrEF combined). In addition, 712 (95%CI:637-787)/100,000 individuals and 413 (95%CI:347-480)/100,000 individuals had 'at risk' and 'manifest' PH associated with AS or MR, respectively. These collective data suggest that ∼2.7% of the population have 'at risk' and ∼1.0% 'manifest' PH-LHD in Austria, Germany and Switzerland in 2024.
The prevalence of PH in patients with from LHD is considerable, although estimates vary by cardiac subtype and specificity of diagnostic criteria. These data warrant prospective studies emphasizing focus on PH detection and management for people with LHD, particularly heart failure."

Despite its potential, evidence on long-term outcomes and prognostic factors remains limited.
Forty-six patients underwent single-staged LT+CS (2005-2023) and had a minimum 1-year follow-up. Univariate and multivariate Cox proportional hazards models assessed independent predictors of long-term survival (one and five years) and a machine learning- based Leave- One- Out Cross Validation (LOOCV) technique was used to validate and refine the LT-CS-2.0 risk score.
Actuarial one- and five-year survival rates were 74.2% and 50%, respectively. Negative predictors of 5-year OS were GFR (OR=1.02, p=0.031), CKD (OR=0.13, p=0.026) and valve surgery (OR=6.67, P=0.045). The largest effect in multivariate analysis was CKD (HR=12.28, 95%CI=1.01-152.43). Since implementation of the LT+CS-1.0 score in 2022, there has been an improvement in patient survival (log-rank p<0.001). LOOCV analysis identified the most influential variables for the LT-CS-2.0 risk score: MASH had a relative weighted impact of 2.66 versus all-cause renal dysfunction (2.63), and aortic stenosis (2.20). The modified LT-CS-2.0 risk score was associated with an increased mortality with an AUC=0.683 (p=0.03) for overall 5-year OS and AUC=0.863 (p<0.0001) specifically in valve surgery patients. Kaplan-Meier analysis showed 1-year, 3-year, and 5-year survival of 95.7%, 95.7%, and 87.7% (low-risk) vs. 61.9%, 61.9%, and 49.5% (high-risk), with a log-rank p = 0.001.
Combined LT and CS provides acceptable survival in this challenging population. Centers should pursue this approach in selected patients. The LT-CS-1.0 score risk has helped our center improve survival, and the refined LT-CS-2.0 score may further help risk stratify patients."

Although previous studies have reported that the incidence of HALT after TAVR in patients with bicuspid aortic valve (BAV) is comparable to that in patients with tricuspid aortic valve (TAV), the specific contributing factors remain incompletely understood. This study aimed to investigate the incidence, predictors, and prognosis of HALT in a TAVR cohort of young patients with 50-50% bicuspid-TAV anatomy.
We retrospectively analyzed consecutive patients with severe symptomatic aortic stenosis who underwent the TAVR procedure between May 2012 and January 2021 in West China Hospital, Sichuan University. Multislice computed tomography (MSCT) was employed to evaluate the early HALT post-TAVR at discharge. Echocardiograms were conducted at baseline, upon discharge, 30 days after the procedure, and at 1-year follow-up. Patients were grouped according to the presence of HALT at discharge. The baseline data, procedural details, and clinical outcomes of the patients were compared, and then multivariate regression analysis was performed.
We ultimately enrolled 605 patients undergoing TAVR for severe symptomatic aortic stenosis, of whom 79 (13.1%) developed HALT during hospitalization. The incidence of HALT was significantly higher in patients with BAV than in those with TAV (15.9% vs. 10.2%; P=0.04). In the multivariate analysis, BAV was identified as an independent predictor of HALT [odds ratio (OR) =2.148; 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.283-3.596; P=0.004]. The other independent predictors included coronary artery disease (OR =1.810; 95% CI: 1.091-2.768; P=0.02), higher body mass index (OR =0.912; 95% CI: 0.846-0.982; P=0.02), postdilation (OR =0.552; 95% CI: 0.327-0.934; P=0.03), bioprosthetic valve size >23 mm (OR =1.965; 95% CI: 1.013-3.813; P=0.05), and the presence of a greater-than-mild paravalvular leak (OR =0.28; 95% CI: 0.13-0.62; P=0.001). In terms of clinical outcomes, there were no significant differences in stroke or death between the HALT group or the non-HALT group at 30 days or 1 year.
BAV was associated with higher risk of early HALT after TAVR, whereas the presence of HALT was not associated with stroke or death at 1 year. The underlying mechanisms and long-term prognosis of HALT after TAVR in patients with BAV remain to be further investigated."
PubMed,aortic stenosis,Early Outcomes of Transcatheter Aortic Valve Implantation for Severe Aortic Stenosis With Myval Versus Edwards Sapien 3 Valve: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.,Dinkar Bhasin; Ankita Bhasin; Tsering Sangdup; Arun Sharma; Prashant Panda; Yash Paul Sharma,10.7759/cureus.96410,2025-11,Cureus,"The Edwards Sapien (Edwards Lifesciences, Irvine, CA, USA) transcatheter heart valves (THVs) and the Myval THVs (Meril Life Sciences, Vapi, Gujarat, India) are two balloon-expandable valve systems used for transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI). This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to compare the clinical and hemodynamic outcomes at 30 days after TAVI using the Myval versus the Edwards Sapien 3 valve in patients with severe aortic stenosis (AS). We conducted a systematic search of PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library, and clinicaltrials.gov up to June 21, 2025. The inclusion criteria were observational studies or interventional trials comparing Myval or Myval Octacor with Edwards Sapien 3 or Sapien 3 Ultra in patients with severe AS undergoing TAVI. The risk of bias was assessed using the Cochrane Risk of Bias Tool 2 for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale for observational studies. Pooled estimates were derived using a random-effects model. The primary outcomes were all-cause mortality, new permanent pacemaker implantation (PPI), and major vascular complications assessed at 30 days. A predefined subgroup analysis was performed based on the study design. The study protocol was registered on the INPLASY database (INPLASY202560110). Four studies (two retrospective cohort and two RCTs) with 1973 patients (18.6% in observational and 81.4% in RCTs) met the inclusion criteria. Out of the total, 1081 (54.8%) patients received Myval and 892 (45.2%) received Sapien 3 valves. No significant difference was observed in all-cause mortality (risk ratio (RR): 1.14, 95% CI: 0.55-2.37; p = 0.73; I2 = 0), rate of new PPI (RR: 0.92, 95% CI: 0.49-1.74; p = 0.81; I2 = 82%), or major vascular complications (RR: 0.70, 95% CI: 0.19-2.52; p = 0.58; I2 = 33%) at 30 days. The findings were consistent in the subgroup analysis among observational studies and RCTs. Moderate to severe aortic regurgitation (AR) (RR: 2.58, 95% CI: 1.14-5.84; p = 0.02; I² = 0%) and new-onset atrial fibrillation (AF) (RR: 2.0, 95% CI: 1.10-3.63; p = 0.02; I² = 0%) were higher with Myval. Mean gradient was lower (mean difference: -2.85 mmHg, 95% CI: -3.88 to -1.82 mmHg; p < 0.001; I² = 82%) and effective orifice area was larger (mean difference: 0.28 cm2, 95% CI: 0.16-0.40 cm2; p < 0.001; I² = 84%) with Myval. Other secondary outcomes and procedural outcomes were comparable. To conclude, primary outcomes were comparable between the two THVs. The Myval had better hemodynamic parameters at 30 days but a higher rate of moderate to severe AR and new-onset AF. Further studies are needed to assess medium- and long-term outcomes between the two valves."
PubMed,aortic stenosis,Relationship of resting echocardiography combined with serum micronutrients to the severity of low-gradient severe aortic stenosis.,Zhangxin Fan; Fang Lin,10.1515/med-2024-1128,2025,"Open medicine (Warsaw, Poland)","This study investigated the relationship between serum magnesium, phosphorus, and calcium and low-gradient severe aortic stenosis (LG-AS).
Dobutamine stress echocardiography (DSE) and resting echocardiography were performed on 73 patients with LG-AS. A projected aortic valve area (AVAproj) ≤ 1 cm2 or indexed AVAIproj < 0.60 cm2/m2 was defined as true-severe AS. Serum magnesium, phosphorus, and calcium were compared. The correlation between serum micronutrients and resting echocardiographic parameters was analyzed. The efficacy of serum micronutrients and resting echocardiographic parameters in predicting true-severe AS in LG-AS was assessed.
DSE diagnosed true-severe AS in 43 patients and pseudo-severe AS in 30 patients. AVA and AVAI were smaller, and the mean pressure gradient (PG) was higher in patients with true-severe AS. Serum calcium and phosphorus were higher, and serum magnesium was lower in patients with true-severe AS. Serum calcium was positively correlated with AVA and AVAI. Serum magnesium had a moderately strong correlation with mean PG. Serum micronutrients had good predictive value for true-severe AS and AVAI, and mean PG improved the predictive value of serum micronutrients.
Serum micronutrients have diagnostic values for true-severe AS in patients with LG-AS."
PubMed,aortic stenosis,Dynamic improvement of tricuspid valve leaflets coaptation and tricuspid regurgitation without surgical treatment: a case report.,Haruka Minami; Ayano Yoshida; Kyohei Onishi; Kosuke Fujita; Gaku Nakazawa,10.1093/ehjcr/ytaf552,2025-11,European heart journal. Case reports,"Tricuspid regurgitation is a prevalent condition among patients with heart failure. Functional tricuspid regurgitation arises from multiple contributing factors, and tricuspid regurgitation severity is sensitive to changes in volume status. Importantly, significant tricuspid regurgitation is associated with adverse outcomes; therefore, tricuspid regurgitation management is crucial.
We describe the case of a 92-year-old man was diagnosed with decompensated heart failure with underlying reduced ejection fraction, multivessel coronary artery disease, low-flow low-gradient aortic stenosis, atrial flutter, and severe tricuspid regurgitation without leaflet coaptation. Owing to the high surgical risk, a minimally invasive treatment strategy was adopted. The patient underwent percutaneous coronary intervention of the left coronary artery, including the left main coronary artery, after which sinus rhythm was spontaneously restored. However, the severity of tricuspid regurgitation remained unchanged posttreatment. Thus, transcatheter aortic valve implantation was subsequently performed. Remarkably, echocardiography on the day after transcatheter aortic valve implantation revealed an improvement in tricuspid regurgitation severity from severe to moderate, with leaflet coaptation and size reduction of the right atrium and right ventricle.
This case highlights that severe tricuspid regurgitation, even without leaflet coaptation, can be improved through comprehensive management of ischaemia, valvular heart disease, and arrhythmia in the absence of surgical treatment. This treatment approach may offer clinical benefits to patients at high surgical risk."

However, the need for unplanned conversion to cardiac surgery (CS) during TAVI remains an infrequent but critical event. It is unclear whether this risk is higher in patients undergoing urgent procedures. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to compare the incidence of unplanned conversion to CS between patients undergoing urgent versus elective TAVI. A systematic search of PubMed, SCOPUS, and Cochrane databases was performed to identify eligible studies. The primary outcome was the rate of unplanned conversion to CS. Secondary outcomes included mortality, device success, vascular complications, device embolization, acute kidney injury (AKI), stroke, permanent pacemaker implantation (PPI), moderate-or-severe paravalvular regurgitation (PVL), need for second valve implantation, bleeding, and duration of hospitalization. Seven studies comprising 71,909 patients were analyzed; 5108 underwent urgent TAVI and 66,801 underwent elective TAVI. No significant difference in conversion to CS was observed between the groups (RR: 0.89; 95% CI: 0.65-1.22). Device success rates were similar (RR: 0.99; 95% CI: 0.97-1.00). Urgent TAVI was associated with prolonged hospitalization (mean difference: 7.75 days; 95% CI: 4.06-11.45) and increased AKI risk (RR: 2.20; 95% CI: 1.53-3.16). Vascular complications, device embolization, stroke, PPI, PVL, second valve implantation, and major bleeding rates were comparable between the groups. Urgent TAVI is not associated with an increased risk of unplanned conversion to surgery. The observed higher AKI rates and longer hospital stay suggest that patient-related factors beyond procedural urgency may contribute to adverse outcomes."

The present study describes the genotype data of a Swedish cohort of patients with HCM, the largest genetics study on Swedish HCM patients to date. The primary aims of this study were to unravel the main genetic findings and explore genotype-phenotype associations in this HCM cohort. Longitudinal data on 225 unrelated HCM index patients from the Southeast health care region in Sweden from 2010 until 2021 were assessed retrospectively. Patients were 46 ± 15.5 years-old, 67.6% males. In the cohort, 172/225 (76.4%) had genetic testing, of whom, 65/172 (38%) were considered genotype positive (G +) for a pathogenic/ likely pathogenic variant, mainly in the two most common sarcomeric genes: MYBPC3 (57%) and MYH7 (34%). In 43% (74/172) of patients, no reportable variants were detected, classified as genotype negative (G-). In the remaining 33 patients (19%), variants of uncertain significance (VUS) were identified; this group was not included in the comparative analyses. Genotype positive patients (G +) were characterized by younger age (p = 0.010), higher prevalence of family history of HCM (p < 0.001), greater maximum left ventricle wall thickness (p = 0.03) and an increased incidence of sudden cardiac death (SCD) (p = 0.045). At first clinical screening, HCM was diagnosed in 28/65(43%) in the G + families and in 2/74 (2.7%) G-families (p < 0.001). Genotype-positive HCM patients differ with respect to age at presentation, family history of the disease, morphology, incidence of SCD and presence of HCM in their family members at first clinical assessment from genotype-negative patients. Genotype negative status in this HCM cohort, though, did not confer immunity from adverse complications."

To develop and evaluate an artificial intelligence (AI)-augmented clinical program for ATTR-CM detection.
This nonrandomized clinical trial involved constructing an AI model, ATTRACTnet, using electrocardiogram waveforms, echocardiographic measurements, demographics, and diagnosis codes for orthopedic manifestations of amyloidosis. A single-system, multisite, single-arm, open-label trial was conducted to evaluate its real-world performance. The model was trained and validated at a large academic referral site for ATTR-CM with external validation at an academic site. The trial was conducted as a single-system, multisite trial. Patients with left ventricular (LV) wall thickness 12 mm or more and an ATTRACTnet score 0.5 or higher were eligible. Exclusions included prior ATTR-CM testing, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, expected life span less than 1 year, nursing home residence, advanced dementia, or LV wall thickness less than 14 mm explained by uncontrolled hypertension or moderate/severe aortic stenosis.
Eligible patients were notified and offered nuclear scintigraphy testing, monoclonal protein testing, and follow-up care on agreement from the treating physician.
The primary outcome was a diagnosis of ATTR-CM by consensus criteria. ATTR-CM testing positivity was compared with historical and contemporary controls.
ATTRACTnet was developed in an internal test set of 799 patients (mean [SD] age, 75.1 [11.1] years; 516 [64.7%] male and 283 [35.3%] female) using 5-fold cross-validation with an additional external test set of 422 patients. It had good discrimination for ATTR-CM detection with an area under the receiver operator characteristic curve of 0.85 (5-fold cross-validation, 0.77-0.85) in the internal set and 0.82 (95% CI, .81-0.83) in the external test set with similar performance in Hispanic, non-Hispanic Black, and non-Hispanic White patients. A total of 1471 patients were identified with positive AI model scores 0.5 or more during the study period, with 256 eligible patients who met study criteria. Of these patients, 50 underwent amyloidosis testing after physician and patient approval; 24 (48%) were diagnosed with ATTR-CM, and 21 (88%) initiated treatment within 3 months. The positivity rate was more than 2.8 times higher than historical controls (15.3%; 95% CI, 13.1%-17.9%; P < .001), with an 18% relative increase in new diagnoses vs the prior year.
AI-augmented screening may improve ATTR-CM detection and identify patients who are missed by usual care. Prospective randomized trials are needed to determine if outcomes are improved.

A retrospective analysis was performed on 16 cases diagnosed with 1q21.1 deletions and 13 cases with 1q21.1 duplications, employing single nucleotide polymorphism arrays (SNP arrays). This study encompassed an examination of ultrasound abnormalities, parental verification, pregnancy outcomes, and postnatal follow-up data.
The deletions fragment sizes of the 16 deletion cases ranged from 1.30 Mb to 2.18 Mb, with the overlapping region located at 146.5 Mb to 147.5 Mb. The fragment sizes of the 13 duplication cases ranged from 0.87 Mb to 3.87 Mb, with the overlapping region located at 146.5 Mb to 147.0 Mb.  Among the 16 fetuses with deletions, eight exhibited ultrasound-detected abnormalities. Specifically, three fetuses had urinary tract malformations, four were diagnosed with fetal growth retardation, three displayed lateral ventricle enlargement, and one had aortic stenosis. Notably, Case 12 demonstrated a unique presentation of complex multi-organ malformations, including fetal growth retardation, absence of the right kidney, micrognathia, and lateral ventricle enlargement. Of the 13 fetuses with duplication, six were found to have ultrasound abnormalities, including four fetuses with cardiovascular malformations, one fetus with fetal growth retardation, one fetus with widened posterior fossa, and one fetus with widened lateral ventricle. Case 22 is particularly special, as the fetus has complex cardiac malformations, including pulmonary stenosis, aorta displacement, and ventricular septal defect.
This study suggests that fetuses with prenatal 1q21.1 deletions may be associated with malformations of the urinary system, whereas those with 1q21.1 duplications are likely associated with cardiac malformations. Nonetheless, both genetic conditions demonstrate a lack of phenotypic specificity. For fetuses diagnosed with 1q21.1 deletions or duplications who present with a normal phenotype prenatally, it is essential to conduct close monitoring of their neurodevelopmental trajectory postnatally."
PubMed,aortic stenosis,Late Coronary Ostial Stenosis After Complicated Bentall-De Bono Procedure: Multimodal Imaging Assessment.,José Martín Alanís-Naranjo; Daniel Campuzano-González; Omar Antonio Gamboa-Abundis; Ana María Rosas-Vázquez; Francisco Castillo-Castellón; Javier De la Cruz-Pelayo; Gennaro Basso-Barba; María Mónica De Ávila-Gómez; Gabriela Meléndez-Ramírez; Aloha Meave-González,10.1016/j.jaccas.2025.105946,2025-11-10,JACC. Case reports,"Coronary ostial stenosis (COS) is a rare but potentially fatal complication following the Bentall-De Bono procedure.
A 59-year-old man with prior Bentall-De Bono surgery along with venous graft reconstruction presented 8 years later with heart failure. Coronary computed tomography angiography demonstrated venous graft ostial stenosis, and cardiac magnetic resonance confirmed a transmural infarction with impaired ventricular function. Given the complex coronary anatomy and limitations to percutaneous treatment, the Heart Team opted for urgent surgical revascularization.
COS after aortic root replacement results from multifactorial mechanisms, including surgical trauma, excessive tension, kinking, or fibrosis related to adhesives, whereas venous graft stenosis adds further complexity. Diagnosis is often challenging because coronary angiography may underestimate the disease while coronary computed tomography angiography and cardiac magnetic resonance offer superior anatomical and functional assessments, enabling accurate detection and guiding timely revascularization.
COS represents an uncommon yet life-threatening complication of aortic root replacement. Advanced multimodal imaging is pivotal to precise diagnosis and therapeutic guidance. Prompt, tailored revascularization strategies are essential to improving clinical outcomes."
PubMed,aortic stenosis,Your CT scans are hiding crucial TAVI survival data: Are you looking?,Marek Kantor; Otakar Jiravsky; Matej Pekar,10.1016/j.ahjo.2025.100649,2025-12,American heart journal plus : cardiology research and practice,"Transcatheter Aortic Valve Implantation (TAVI) has revolutionized treatment for severe aortic stenosis, but optimal patient selection remains challenging. This commentary highlights findings from our recent systematic review of 14 studies comprising 9692 TAVI patients, which revealed that CT-derived adipose tissue parameters provide valuable prognostic information often overlooked during procedural planning. We found that higher subcutaneous adipose tissue consistently associated with better survival, while adipose tissue quality, measured by CT attenuation, proved equally important. The relationship between adiposity and outcomes appears U-shaped rather than linear, with both extremely low and high adiposity quartiles correlating with worse outcomes, while moderate subcutaneous adiposity provides optimal outcomes by offering metabolic reserves without pathological complications. Notably, fat distribution patterns (VAT:SAT ratio < 1) were associated with better cardiovascular outcomes, underscoring that where fat is stored matters more than total quantity. The obesity-dependent effects of visceral adipose tissue reflect fundamental differences in metabolic physiology: in non-obese patients, modest VAT represents protective energy reserves, while in obese patients, lower VAT indicates relatively better metabolic health within the context of existing obesity. These adipose tissue characteristics are readily available in pre-procedural CT scans already used for anatomical assessment, requiring minimal additional resources while potentially enhancing risk stratification. We present a novel decision algorithm with sex-specific thresholds that enables immediate clinical implementation of these measurements for patient risk stratification. As TAVI indications expand to include both increasingly frail elderly patients and those at intermediate surgical risk, integrating these overlooked adipose tissue parameters into clinical decision-making could improve patient selection and outcomes."
PubMed,aortic stenosis,Unilateral pulmonary edema after minimally-invasive redo-double valve replacement procedure-case report.,Dan Wang; Jia Yang; Haibo Ren,10.3389/fcvm.2025.1662660,2025,Frontiers in cardiovascular medicine,"This case report describes a patient with a history of mechanical aortic and mitral valve replacements who developed prosthetic valve stenosis years later and underwent a minimally invasive, thoracoscopic-assisted double valve re-replacement. Postoperatively, the patient developed a rare but life-threatening re-expansion pulmonary edema (RPE), which led to severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), with rapid deterioration into refractory hypoxemia. Despite comprehensive conventional supportive management-including lung-protective ventilation, diuresis, anti-inflammatory therapy, and other measures-adequate oxygenation could not be maintained. Venovenous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (VV-ECMO) was emergently initiated. With ECMO support, the patient's lungs were able to rest and recover. After 10 days of support, ECMO was successfully discontinued, and the patient eventually recovered and was discharged. This case aims to explore the pathophysiological mechanisms of RPE, management strategies for complications following minimally invasive cardiac surgery, and to emphasize the critical role of VV-ECMO in treating refractory respiratory failure, as well as the importance of multidisciplinary team (MDT) collaboration."
PubMed,aortic stenosis,A Case of Severe Aortic Stenosis Mimicking Acute Coronary Syndrome: Diagnostic Challenges and Surgical Management.,Waleed Abdelraheim; Mohamed Ghonem; Atef Ghoneim; Mohamed Abdelaal,10.7759/cureus.94040,2025-10,Cureus,"Chest pain with elevated troponin and ECG changes often prompts a diagnosis of acute coronary syndrome (ACS). However, this presentation can mask other critical pathologies. We report a case of a 52-year-old male who presented with exertional chest discomfort and progressive dyspnea. Initial workup, including troponin elevation and lateral ST-segment depression, led to a presumptive diagnosis of ACS. However, further imaging revealed severe aortic stenosis (AS) secondary to a bicuspid aortic valve (BAV), with a significantly dilated ascending aorta. Intraoperatively, an annular abscess was discovered beneath the right coronary cusp, confirming a missed diagnosis of infective endocarditis (IE). The patient underwent a successful Bentall procedure with aortic root and valve replacement. This case illustrates the diagnostic challenge posed by overlapping cardiovascular pathologies and emphasizes the importance of thorough evaluation in patients with atypical ACS presentations, particularly when structural heart disease is suspected."
PubMed,aortic stenosis,Profound Hypokalaemia and Functional Weakness Secondary to Gastric Outlet Obstruction: A Rare Case.,Abimbola Aduroja; Kwerinuchi T Kejeh,10.7759/cureus.94015,2025-10,Cureus,"We present the case of a 44-year-old male patient with a known history of pyloric stricture secondary to peptic ulcer disease who was admitted with quadriparesis, vomiting, and chest pain. He had a background of multiple endoscopic dilatations for gastric outlet obstruction and was severely malnourished at presentation. Clinical findings included markedly low serum potassium, phosphate, and magnesium, elevated creatine kinase, and ECG changes suggestive of myocardial strain. High-sensitivity troponin was also elevated, prompting evaluation for acute coronary syndrome and aortic dissection. Imaging ruled out structural cardiovascular pathology, and a diagnosis of type 2 myocardial infarction was made, likely secondary to electrolyte imbalance and volume depletion. Despite correction of electrolyte abnormalities, the patient's neuromuscular weakness persisted, prompting neurologic evaluation and spinal imaging to exclude Guillain-Barré Syndrome and compressive pathology. MRI spine was unremarkable. Over the course of his intensive care admission, the patient received central electrolyte replacement, cautious nutritional rehabilitation, and multidisciplinary input from neurology, cardiology, gastroenterology, and dietetics. As electrolyte levels improved, so did his neurological function, and he regained significant muscle strength. He was subsequently transferred to the gastroenterology ward, where further endoscopic assessment confirmed ongoing pyloric narrowing. Given his history of multiple unsuccessful dilatations and persistent symptoms, he was referred to surgical services for consideration of a definitive gastrojejunostomy. This case highlights the importance of considering gastrointestinal causes of profound electrolyte disturbances and the potential for these metabolic abnormalities to mimic primary neuromuscular or cardiac pathologies. It also underscores the critical role of multidisciplinary collaboration in managing complex cases involving metabolic, nutritional, and functional decline. Early recognition and a systematic approach to diagnosis and treatment can prevent complications, improve outcomes, and avoid unnecessary interventions."

Objectives Iliofemoral calcium modification by intravascular lithotripsy (IVL) may enable transfemoral access in PAD patients. Methods Between June 2022 and February 2024, all consecutive TAVR patients at our institution were prospectively screened for use of IVL according to the predefined TREATABLE classification, involving parameters such as calcification, vessel kinking and stenosis. Endpoints comprised successful TAVR, safety, and three-month outcomes (DRKS00034681). In an independent retrospective approach, all TAVR patients treated between February 2020 and June 2022 were evaluated with the TREATABLE classification towards complication rates without use of IVL (DRKS00029242). Results Two hundred twenty-nine prospective patients were included and after application of the TREATABLE classification, 26 patients (11.4%) received IVL-supported transfemoral TAVR. According to the TREATABLE classification, there was a similar extent of kinking ( p = 0.468), but a significantly higher severity of calcification in the IVL-treated group ( p &lt; 0.001). In the retrospective analysis of the additional 1000 patients, 966 (96.6%) received transfemoral and 34 alternative access TAVR. 154 transfemoral and all alternative access TAVR were identified as high-risk according to the TREATABLE classification. Comparing the retrospective and prospective TREATABEL cohorts, transfemoral high-risk patients in the retrospective cohort without IVL showed a higher rate of post-interventional stenosis or occlusion (12.3% vs. 0%, p = 0.049). Conclusion This observational study shows a favourable success and safety level of IVL-supported transfemoral TAVR despite severe PAD, based on the TREATABLE classification. Therefore, the newly developed classification provides a suitable tool for identifying patients who would benefit from facilitating transfemoral TAVR by IVL. Graphical Abstract"

This article aims to present our institutional approach, supported by the current literature, in managing several challenging anatomical scenarios. We focus on seven high-impact scenarios—bicuspid aortic valve (BAV), hostile transfemoral access, iliofemoral/aortic tortuosity, adverse aortic angulation, heavy annulus/Left Ventricular Outflow Tract (LVOT) calcification, small annulus, and risk of coronary obstruction—and propose a practical approach to minimize the risk of complications. In BAV, current generation transcatheter heart valves (THV) achieve favorable early outcomes when sizing accounts for supra-annular constraints and implantation depth is tailored. Transfemoral access remains dominant in contemporary registries, yet a meaningful minority of cases require adjunctive peripheral vascular intervention to enable THV delivery-system passage. In case of annulus or LVOT calcification, small annuli, complex aortic anatomy, high risk for coronary obstruction, and pre-procedural Computed Tomography (CT) allow for an accurate sizing of THV and tailored procedural planning. A structured, CT-driven pathway that links anatomic findings to specific facilitation and bailout steps can standardize decision-making and improve safety across these challenging scenarios. We strongly highlight the importance to build a network where most complex procedures are carried out in Valve Centers where expert operators are trained to manage high volume, high complexity, and difficult complications."

Oikonomou; Rohan Khera,10.1101/2025.11.04.25339526,2025-11-06,bioRxiv (Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory),"ABSTRACT Background The scientific literature on artificial intelligence-enabled electrocardiography (AI-ECG) has defined a robust performance of AI models in detecting and predicting several structural heart disorders (SHDs) using ECGs. However, as a diagnostic test, the real-world clinical utility of AI-ECG reliability requires the consistency of its results when repeated under similar conditions. Aim To evaluate the reliability of AI-ECG models for different ECGs for the same person, across different diagnostic labels, and using varied modeling approaches. Methods We used ECG images (2000-2024) from 5 hospitals and an outpatient network within a large, integrated US health system. For each individual, we identified multiple ECGs recorded within a 30-day period. We evaluated 7 models: 6 convolutional neural networks (CNNs) trained to detect individual SHDs, including LV systolic dysfunction, left valve diseases and severe LVH; an ensemble XGBoost integrating individual CNNs as a composite screen for multiple SHDs. We used concordance correlation coefficient (CCC), Spearman correlation, Cohen’s kappa, and percent agreement in binary screen status to test model reliability. We evaluated factors associated with different AI-ECG outputs (Δ probability&gt; 0.5) and assessed stability across ECG layouts (digital, printed, photo). Results Across sites, we identified 1,118,263 ECG pairs, with a median 1 (1-3) days between ECGs. The ensemble XGBoost had the higher test-retest correlation (CCC: 0.89-0.92) and agreement (kappa: 0.75-0.82) between pairs compared with CNNs (CCC: 0.78-0.88; kappa: 0.57-0.72). After adjusting for demographics, ECG pairs that included one or both inpatient ECG were significantly more likely to yield unstable predictions (ORs: 1.60 [1.50-1.70] and 1.91 [1.78-2.05], respectively) compared with pairs with both ECGs obtained in outpatient settings. Among outpatient pairs across sites, the XGBoost model had a CCC of 0.89-0.94, a Spearman correlation of 0.90-0.94, and a kappa of 0.78-0.84, with concordance rates of 89-92%. Notably, ensemble model predictions were also stable across different ECG layouts. Conclusion An ensemble AI-ECG model integrating multiple CNN predictions had higher reliability compared with models for individual disorders. Discordance was more common in inpatient ECGs, suggesting instability in high-acuity settings. Reliable ensemble AI-ECG model outputs support readiness for clinical implementation for SHD screening.

Surgical aortic valve replacement (SAVR) remains the standard therapy, while transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) is increasingly adopted across a broader range of risk profiles due to accumulating evidence and advancements in device technology. Observational registries and early trial data indicate that TAVI is technically feasible in selected BAV anatomies, with device-success rates exceeding 90%. Nonetheless, bicuspid morphology is still technically demanding, with several possible pitfalls during transcatheter procedure and pre-procedural planning compared with tricuspid valve. The rates of moderate-to-severe paravalvular leak (PVL), permanent pacemaker implantation (PPI), and annular complications remain high, especially in the presence of extensive calcifications with raphe or tapered roots, underscoring the importance of meticulous multimodality imaging, dedicated sizing algorithms, and device-specific strategies. Long-term durability signals are encouraging but remain limited, underlining the need for prospective trials with extended follow-up. This review summarizes current knowledge on BAV anatomy and its management, exploring the available evidence supporting the role of transcatheter approach in this challenging and unique scenario."

Understanding the natural history and predictors of disease progression is critical for optimizing timing of intervention and patient follow-up. Objective: The main objective of this systematic review was to evaluate the natural course of degenerative AS and identify clinical, echocardiographic, and biochemical predictors of progression. Secondary objectives included assessing annual changes in hemodynamic parameters, incidence of adverse cardiac outcomes, and impact of comorbidities on disease acceleration. Methods: A systematic search was performed in PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, Cochrane Library, LILACS, ClinicalTrials.gov, and ICTRP. Observational and interventional studies published in the last 5 years were included, with extension to 10 years if fewer than 10 eligible studies were available. Two independent reviewers screened titles and abstracts, extracted data, and assessed bias using RoB 2, ROBINS-I, or QUADAS-2 as appropriate. Certainty of evidence was graded using GRADE. Results and Discussion: 27 studies met inclusion criteria. Most cohorts demonstrated a nonlinear yet measurable progression of valve calcification and gradient increase over time. Elevated baseline aortic jet velocity, lipoprotein(a), and valvular calcium scores were consistent predictors of faster progression. The pooled annual increase in mean gradient ranged between 4–8 mmHg, and event-free survival declined significantly once peak velocity exceeded 4.0 m/s. Conclusion: Degenerative AS is a dynamic and heterogeneous condition influenced by metabolic, inflammatory, and structural mechanisms. Early identification of high-risk phenotypes may guide timely valve replacement and improve outcomes."

OpenAlex,aortic stenosis,Study on the Correlation Between Ventricular Function Evaluated by <i>Z</i> ‐Score of Atrioventricular Annular Plane Systolic Excursion and Pulmonary Artery Abnormality and Retrograde Ductus Arteriosus Flow in Fetuses With Ebstein Anomaly,Xianfeng Guo; Bowen Zhao; Yilin Li; Xinyu Zhou,10.1002/jcu.70122,2025-11-04,Journal of Clinical Ultrasound,"ABSTRACT Purpose Ebstein anomaly (EA) is a congenital heart disease that can cause intrauterine fetal death. Pulmonary valve stenosis or atresia (PS/PA) and retrograde ductus arteriosus flow (RDAF) are important factors leading to a poor prognosis, but the causes of its formation are still unclear. This study aimed to assess the correlation between left and right ventricular function and PS/PA and RDAF in fetuses with EA using MAPSE and TAPSE Z ‐score values measured by free angle M‐mode (FAM) echocardiography. Methods This retrospective cohort study of 34 EA and 68 normal fetuses was enrolled. Differences in Z ‐score values were compared between the control, EA with and without PS/PA groups, and between EA‐PS/PA with and without RDAF group. Correlation analysis was performed between Z ‐score values with the ratio of inner diameter of the pulmonary to the aortic valve annulus (PA/AO) and RDAF. Results The differences in Z ‐score values were significant ( p &lt; 0.001) between three groups. Z ‐score values were lower in EA‐PS/PA with RDAF compared to the without RDAF group ( p &lt; 0.05). Z ‐scores were all positively correlated with PA/AO in the EA group ( p &lt; 0.05), and negatively correlated with RDAF in the EA‐PS/PA group ( p &lt; 0.05). Conclusion Decreased ventricular function of EA fetus is related to the formation of PS/PA. After the formation of PS/PA, the degree of damage to ventricular function is not related to the diameter of the pulmonary artery; it is related to the formation of RDAF."

Results Among 131 included patients (median age 81 years; 64% male) pathological HDP uptake was found in 21 (16%), and 11 (8.4%) were diagnosed with ATTR-CM. A RAISE Score ≥ 2 demonstrated 76% sensitivity and 56% specificity for pathological bone scintigraphy, while a Score ≥ 3 showed 62% sensitivity and 78% specificity. The parameters age ≥ 83 years and the combination of carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS) and/or N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) ≥ 1,400 pg/mL performed similarly to the RAISE Score. Cardiac HDP uptake showed a strong trend toward HF hospitalization (HR [95%-CI]: 5.81 [0.93–36.20]; p = 0.060) and all-cause mortality (HR [95%-CI]: 3.27 [0.95–11.24]; p = 0.060). CTS and/or NT-proBNP ≥ 1,400 pg/mL was significantly associated with higher all-cause mortality (HR [95%-CI]: 3.92 [1.04–14.84]; p = 0.044), whereas the RAISE Score was not. Conclusion After AVR, the complex RAISE Score showed lower sensitivity than originally reported, while simpler parameters demonstrated comparable predictive value for ATTR-CM screening. Advanced age, CTS history and elevated NT-proBNP levels seem most valuable for identifying candidates for bone scintigraphy. Graphical Abstract A total of 131 patients aged ≥ 60 years, with an IVSd ≥ 12 mm and an AVR between March 2021 and July 2024, underwent standard diagnostic evaluation for ATTR-CM, including HDP bone scintigraphy. Pathological findings on bone scintigraphy (Perugini Score 1–3) were observed in 16% of the patients and were associated with worse clinical outcomes. The performance of the proposed RAISE Score [11], along with simplified or modified screening parameters, was evaluated in predicting both pathological scintigraphy results and clinical outcomes. ATTR-CM = transthyretin amyloidosis cardiomyopathy; AVR = aortic valve replacement; CTS = carpal tunnel syndrome; HDP = hydroxydiphosphonate; IVSd = interventricular septum thickness at end-diastole; NT-proBNP = N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide."

Levine; Judy Hung,10.1161/circ.152.suppl_3.4360927,2025-11-03,Circulation,"Background: Paradoxical low-flow, low-gradient (PLFLG) severe aortic stenosis (AS) is a high-risk phenotype characterized by low transvalvular gradients despite preserved left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF). While stroke volume index is conventionally used to define flow state, transvalvular flow rate (Q)—a measure incorporating both volume and ejection duration— offers a more physiologic assessment of forward flow. Given known sex-based differences in flow dynamics, we aimed to evaluate whether sex-specific Q thresholds are associated with adverse outcomes in PLFLG severe AS. Methods: We included 1,189 patients with adjudicated PLFLG severe AS (aortic valve area &lt;1.0 cm2, mean gradient &lt;40 mmHg, LVEF ≥50%, and Q ≤210 mL/sec) from an institutional echocardiographic database. Sex-specific Q thresholds were derived using the maximally selected rank statistic (≤150 mL/sec in males, ≤180 mL/sec in females). The primary outcome was a composite of all-cause mortality and aortic valve replacement (SAVR/TAVR). Results: In both sexes, lower Q was associated with a smaller aortic valve area, lower stroke volume index and reduced transvalvular gradients. Patients with low Q had significantly lower event-free survival, particularly among females, for both all-cause mortality and the composite outcome (log-rank p&lt;0.001)(Figure). In a multivariable analysis, low Q independently predicted adverse composite outcome in both males (HR 1.54, 95% CI: 1.10–2.16) and females (HR 1.39, 95% CI: 1.16–1.65). Conclusion: Sex-specific transvalvular flow rate thresholds are independently associated with adverse outcomes in paradoxical low-flow low-gradient severe aortic stenosis. These findings support the clinical utility of sex-specific Q, particularly in women, for refining risk stratification and guiding timely intervention."

Rigsby; Joshua D. Robinson; Bradley D. Allen; Michael Markl,10.1161/circ.152.suppl_3.4365172,2025-11-03,Circulation,"Introduction: Patients with aortic valve disease, such as bicuspid aortic valve (BAV), require regular echocardiography or cardiovascular (CV) MRI to monitor for complications such as valve stenosis (AS) and aortic dilation. However, repeated imaging can be burdensome and incur substantial cost. Seismocardiogram (SCG) chest acceleration measurements recorded by inexpensive wearable devices can give indicators of valve-mediated hemodynamic changes, and as such may have supplemental value for such patients. This study investigated using SCG recordings coupled with a novel machine-learned (ML) classifier for SCG signals to identify patient valve type and presence/absence of aortic valve stenosis (AS). Hypothesis: We hypothesize that accurate classification of aortic valve type and AS can be made from SCG recordings with ML analysis compared to those from standard-of-care imaging (ground truth: cardiac MRI or echo). Methods: Healthy controls (no known CV disease) and aortic valve disease patients with tricuspid (TAV), BAV, or post-repair mechanical valve who received echo or MRI (clinical CV protocol) were enrolled for same-day 2-minute wearable SCG measurement (fig. A). Standard clinical assessment of valve/flow function was used (fig. B). Informed consent was given with IRB oversight. Clinical imaging used 4D flow MRI (1.5T,1-3mm3/30-40ms) or 2D Doppler echo (1.7-3.3MHz,12-40FPS). From clinical read of valve type/function, subjects were grouped in four classes: AS (any degree), BAV no-AS, TAV no-AS, mechanical. A hybrid network with convolutional neural network and multi-layer perceptron was trained (80/20 train/test) to classify patient valve status from SCG wavelet coefficients and demographics (age/sex/height/weight). Performance was evaluated by 20-fold cross-validation. Results: Enrolment was 129 subjects (97 MRI/32 echo): 46 controls (45.9±17.4y/20F) and 83 patients (22.4±15.8y/20F; 67 BAV/6 TAV/10 mech.). Classification area-under-curve (AUC) was high for all classes (AUC≥0.79). Across all ML validations, correct classification was achieved for ≥75% of subjects. Conclusion: This evaluation of a machine-learned classifier for SCG indicate potential utility in screening for valve-mediated hemodynamic changes, which reverberate through the chest and cause altered vibrations. The low cost and ease of acquisition for SCG would make it an appealing complement to imaging as the current standard for aortic valve abnormality screening and management."
OpenAlex,aortic stenosis,Abstract 4367976: Aortic Tortuosity Predicts Conduction Disturbances After TAVR via Aortic Angle and Membranous Septum Length: A Structural Equation Modeling Approach,Takamitsu Nakamura; Takeo Horikoshi; Miu Eguchi; Tsuyoshi Kobayashi; Manabu Uematsu; Toru Yoshizaki; Akira Sato,10.1161/circ.152.suppl_3.4367976,2025-11-03,Circulation,"Background: Transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) has broadened treatment options for elderly patients with severe aortic valve stenosis (AVS), including those with challenging vascular anatomy such as increased aortic tortuosity. We previously demonstrated that a higher aortic tortuosity index (ATI), defined as the ratio of aortic length (from the sinotubular junction to the terminal aorta) to body height measured by 3D-computed tomography, was associated with complete atrioventricular block (CAVB). However, the anatomical mechanisms linking ATI to conduction disturbances (CD) requiring pacemaker implantation (PMI) remain unclear. Purpose: To investigate whether anatomical variations—specifically, aortic angle and membranous septum (MS) length—mediate the association between ATI and CD requiring PMI after TAVR. Methods: We analyzed 198 consecutive patients with severe AVS who underwent TAVR. ATI, aortic angle, and MS length were quantified using pre-procedural 3D-CT imaging. CD requiring PMI within 30 days post-TAVR was observed in 20 patients (10.2%). Patients were stratified by median ATI (3.24), aortic angle (49°), and MS length (3.3 mm). Structural equation modeling (SEM) was applied to evaluate both direct and indirect effects of ATI on CD through aortic angle and MS length. Results: Patients with higher ATI (&gt;3.24) had a significantly greater incidence of CD requiring PMI than those with lower ATI (18.2% vs. 3.0%, p = 0.001). SEM demonstrated a significant direct effect of higher ATI on CD (path coefficient = 0.26, p &lt; 0.01), along with a significant indirect effect mediated by aortic angle and MS length (path coefficient = 0.15, p &lt; 0.05). Conclusion: Higher ATI is associated with increased risk of CD requiring PMI after TAVR, and this relationship is mediated by steeper aortic angle and shorter MS length. Aortic tortuosity may reflect age-related anatomical remodeling that predisposes patients to conduction injury during TAVR."

He became unresponsive at home, prompting ED evaluation. Initial ECG was unremarkable with no ischemic changes. Troponins peaked at 100 ng/L. A transthoracic echocardiogram showed a normal left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) of 60–65% with no wall motion abnormalities. Elective cardiac catheterization was pursued to evaluate for coronary artery disease. Differential Diagnosis: Acute coronary syndrome (ACS), stroke, transient ischemic attack, seizure, GERD, and anxiety were considered. The normal ECG and preserved ejection fraction initially lowered suspicion for ACS, though rising troponins remained concerning. Treatment and Management: Coronary angiography revealed severe multivessel disease including diffuse left main coronary artery (LMCA) stenosis. Midway through the procedure, the patient developed chest pain and cardiac arrest due to pulseless electrical activity and received 25 minutes of cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) before acheiving return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC). Emergent veno-arterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (VA-ECMO) was initiated. A non-selective aortic root angiogram showed 100% LMCA occlusion and the patient underwent salvage percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) to the LMCA. A micro-axial pump was placed. He underwent rescue three-vessel coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) after stabilization. Outcome and Follow-Up: Despite aggressive intervention, the patient’s LVEF dropped to 14% with persistent cardiogenic shock. Serial echocardiograms showed no improvement. He was transitioned to comfort care and passed away 10 days after admission. Teaching Points: Total LMCA occlusion is a rare but catastrophic event, especially when iatrogenically precipitated during elective procedures. Non-invasive cardiac imaging (e.g., coronary CTA, calcium scoring) may help stratify risk before elective catheterization in patients with significant risk factors prior to initiating invasive procedures. Early recognition, effective CPR, mechanical circulatory support including ECMO and micro-axial pumps, and coordinated multi-disciplinary revascularization strategies are critical in such high-risk presentations."

However, its narrow therapeutic index and susceptibility to drug interactions demand careful monitoring. We present a case of subacute mechanical aortic valve thrombosis likely precipitated by a warfarin–trazodone interaction. Case Presentation: A 58-year-old man with a history of bicuspid aortic stenosis requiring mechanical valve replacement—previously stable on chronic warfarin therapy (5 mg daily)—presented to the ED with three days of worsening dyspnea, cough, and upper back pain. Upon arrival, he was hypertensive, hypoxic, and in respiratory distress, exhibiting cold extremities, bilateral crackles, and an audible mechanical valve click. Labs revealed an INR of 1.3 (previously therapeutic), lactate 9.0 mmol/L, troponin 233 ng/L, and BNP 6812 pg/mL. CTA showed possible multifocal pneumonia. Initially, he was diagnosed with septic shock and ARDS, requiring vasopressors and BiPAP. Shortly after, he suffered a cardiac arrest, requiring intubation and vasopressor escalation. Transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) revealed a peak gradient of 3.7 m/s and mean gradient of 28 mmHg across the prosthetic valve. Urgent transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) showed severely restricted leaflet motion with torrential aortic regurgitation—highly suggestive of valve thrombosis. Due to prohibitive surgical risk, thrombolysis with alteplase (25 mg over 6 hours) was administered. Repeat TEE demonstrated improved leaflet motion (velocity 2.2 m/s, mean gradient 17.6 mmHg), LVEF of 25%, and new severe mitral regurgitation. He was stabilized on milrinone and extubated by hospital day five. Despite restarting warfarin—at doses up to 30 mg daily (three times his prior regimen)—therapeutic INR was not achieved until 10 days later. Further interrogation revealed, thirteen days prior to ED visit, he was started on trazodone 50 mg. No other interacting medications or hepatic dysfunction were identified. Trazodone was identified as the likely culprit and had been discontinued. His INR subsequently normalized. Discussion: Trazodone may reduce warfarin efficacy, leading to subtherapeutic INR and valve thrombosis in mechanical valve patients. While the exact mechanism is unclear, proposed theories include CYP2C9 induction, increased warfarin clearance, or protein-binding displacement. This case highlights the need for close INR monitoring when initiating trazodone in patients on warfarin."

Sehnert; Saumya Das,10.1161/circ.152.suppl_3.4369991,2025-11-03,Circulation,"Introduction: Heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) remains a leading cause of morbidity and mortality despite current therapies. The transverse aortic constriction (TAC) model in rodent mimics conditions such as hypertension and aortic stenosis and is widely used to study HFrEF. SGK1, a stress activated kinase, plays a key role in cardiac remodeling, fibrosis, and inflammation, critical in HF progression. Genetic inhibition of SGK1 by cardiac-specific expression of dominant-negative SGK1 in a TAC model is shown to be cardioprotective. Small molecule inhibitors of SGK1 (SGK1i) have not previously been evaluated in the TAC model. Research Questions: To evaluate the efficacy of novel, potent and selective SGK1i in a TAC model. Methods: Male, Sprague Dawley Rats, that had undergone TAC (20G suture) or sham surgery were dosed once a day via oral gavage from Day 3 until the end of the study on Day 56 with vehicle, SGK1i A, or SGK1i B. All animals had echocardiography on Days 21, 28, 42 and 56 to monitor disease progression. Tissues were stained by picrosirius red, and collagen was quantified using ImageJ software. Results: SGK1i ameliorated the progression to heart failure following TAC compared to the vehicle treated group, noted by a higher ejection fraction in the SGK1i groups compared to the vehicle group that is apparent even at day 21 (EF%: Sham 71.93, Vehicle 59.27, SGK1i A 70.66, SGK1i B 72.20) and is sustained through day 56 (EF%: Sham 70.50, Vehicle 49.87, SGK1i A 65.28, SGK1i B 64.22). In addition, parameters of LV structure were preserved in the SGK1i groups through the course of the study (LVESV mL Day 56: Sham 0.11, Vehicle 0.23, SGK1i A 0.13, SGK1i B 0.13). Morphometric measurements confirmed a significant increase in HW/BW in vehicle treated animals, which was mitigated by SGK1i. Hemodynamic studies confirmed the beneficial effects of SGK1i compared to vehicle treated animals (LVEDP, stroke work preserved, LV elastance better), with SGK1i groups not significantly different from sham animals. Finally, histological analysis demonstrated significantly less fibrosis and myofibrillar disarray in similar sections of SGK1i treated versus vehicle groups. Conclusions: SGK1i prevented the development of TAC pressure overload-induced decline in systolic function, had beneficial effects on cardiac hypertrophy, and reduced fibrosis. These data support the continued development of SGK1 inhibitors as promising novel therapeutics for HF."

However, the long-term effects of functional tricuspid regurgitation (FTR) on AF recurrence and the improvement of TR after radiofrequency catheter ablation (RFCA) remain unclear. Methods This retrospective, single-center observational study involved 1,690 patients with persistent atrial fibrillation (PsAF) who underwent AF ablation between January 2012 and June 2022. 153 paients with significant FTR were propensity matching 153 patients with no or mild FTR based on age, body mass index, and mitral regurgitation (MR) severity. Patients were followed up for at least 1 year. Procedural success was defined as freedom from any atrial tachyarrhythmia (&amp;gt;30 s) after the 3-month blanking period, off antiarrhythmic drugs. Significant FTR was defined as moderate to severe TR. Significant TR improvement was defined as a reduction in TR severity by ≥2 grades from pre- to post-ablation. Results Among the observational cohort, 153 patients (9.1%) had significant FTR, the severity of which correlated with female sex, AF duration, atrial/ventricular remodeling, and NT-proBNP levels. During the 12-month follow-up, the procedural success rate was 67.6% (207/306). RFCA significantly reduced the proportion of RA and RV enlargement ( P &amp;lt; 0.001), and improved the severity of FTR ( P &amp;lt; 0.001). Logistic regression analyses showed that AF recurrence [odds ratio (OR) 18.244, 95% CI 7.500–52.427, P &amp;lt; 0.001]) was the strongest independent risk factor for non-significant TR improvement after ablation. After a mean follow-up of 5.3 ± 3.7 years, the overall procedural success rate was 47.4% (145/306). The overall success rate was significantly lower in patients with significant FTR compared to those with no or mild FTR (37.3% VS 57.5%, P &amp;lt; 0.001). A comparable difference was observed between ventricular FTR and no or atrial FTR (27.1% VS 53.4%, P &amp;lt; 0.001). Conclusions Significant FTR was an independent predictor of AF recurrence in patients with PsAF undergoing RFCA. The long-term success was poor in the subgroups of significant FTR and those with ventricular FTR. Furthermore, successful RFCA was associated with significantly improved FTR in patients with PsAF."

The condition remains diagnostically challenging due to overlapping features with other autoimmune and psychiatric disorders, absence of definitive biomarkers, and variable infectious histories. Objective To describe a diagnostically complex case of PANDAS in a preadolescent girl presenting with concurrent choreiform movements, acute psychosis, and subclinical valvular changes. Case A 12-year-6-month-old previously healthy girl developed sudden-onset involuntary dance-like movements and acute psychiatric symptoms, including auditory hallucinations and bizarre delusions. Neurological examination revealed chorea without focal deficits. Echocardiography showed mild mitral and tricuspid regurgitation. Anti Streptolysin O (ASTO) test was positive, but other Laboratory markers of inflammation were normal. The temporal clustering of symptoms, subtle cardiac findings, positive ASTO test and exclusion of alternative diagnoses supported a working diagnosis of PANDAS. Management included antipsychotic, benzodiazepine, and anticonvulsant therapy, with referral for tertiary evaluation and potential immunomodulation. Conclusion This case emphasizes the importance of early recognition of PANDAS in children with abrupt neuropsychiatric and motor symptom onset, the necessity of thorough differential diagnosis, and the value of multidisciplinary care in optimizing outcomes."

Mitral Annular Calcification (MAC) may adversely affect procedural success and increase post-procedural mitral regurgitation (MR). Objective: To evaluate the impact of Mitral Annular Calcification on post-PTMC outcomes. Methodology: This mixed retrospective and prospective study was conducted at Peshawar Institute of Cardiology from April 2021 to December 2024. A total of 303 patients with severe MS (MVA ≤1.0 cm², mean gradient &gt;10 mmHg) were included. Echocardiographic parameters including Wilkins and commissural scores were assessed. Procedural success was defined as post-PTMC MVA &gt;1.5 cm², ≥50% increase in MVA, and absence of severe MR or major complications. Data were analyzed using SPSS 26. Results: Mean age was 38.88±11.38 years; 80.9% were females. Wilkins score ≤8 was observed in 82.8%, and 63% had no commissural calcium. Mean MVA increased from 0.92±0.16 cm² to 1.8±0.31 cm²; 91.7% achieved procedural success. Severe MR occurred in 11.2%, with one mortality. Commissural score correlated positively with MR (r=0.475, p&lt;0.001) and negatively with MVA (r=–0.398, p&lt;0.001). Patients with commissural score 2 had a 5.24-fold higher risk of severe MR (p=0.027). Conclusion: PTMC is a safe and effective intervention for severe MS; however, Mitral Annular Calcification significantly reduces procedural success and increases MR risk. Pre-procedural commissural scoring enhances patient selection and outcome prediction. Keywords: Commissural Score, Mitral Annular Calcification, Mitral Regurgitation, Mitral Valve Area, PTMC."

Transcatheter edge-to-edge repair (TEER) is a viable treatment, but its long-term survival impact, particularly across sexes, remains underexplored. We aimed to assess relative survival (RS) and excess mortality (EM) in patients undergoing TEER for significant MR, with a focus on sex-based differences. Methods: We analyzed 253 patients treated with TEER between October 2015 and August 2024, stratified by sex. Observed survival (OS) was calculated using the actuarial life table method; expected survival (ES) was estimated via the Ederer II method using matched population data. Primary endpoints were RS and EM; secondary endpoints included mortality differences by MR subtype. Results: OS at 1, 2, and 3 years was 88.9%, 87.4%, and 78.9%, respectively. EM peaked in the first year (7.8%) and declined thereafter. RS was lower than in the general population, primarily due to persistently reduced RS and elevated EM in men. Women achieved RS comparable to matched peers from year one. Sex was not an independent predictor of mortality (HR 0.88, 95% CI 0.38–2.03, p = 0.771). Conclusions: In patients with significant MR undergoing TEER, EM was concentrated in the first year. Women reached RS comparable to the general population, while men showed persistent excess mortality. Sex was not independently associated with survival after adjustment."

Individual patient and procedural factors such as age, comorbidities, and aortic manipulation influence stroke risk. This meta-analysis aims to evaluate predictors of stroke risk in patients undergoing CABG. Methods: A comprehensive search was conducted across major databases to identify studies assessing the predictive factors for stroke risk in patients undergoing CABG. Odds ratios (OR) with 95% CIs were pooled using a random effects model, and all analyses were performed using R studio version 4.4.3. Results: A total of 16 studies comprising 123,535 patients were included. Atrial fibrillation, female sex, diabetes mellitus, heart failure, hypertension, cardiovascular disease, peripheral arterial disease, renal failure, carotid bruits, and previous stroke were all significantly associated with an increased risk of stroke, with odds ratios (ORs) ranging from 1.33 to 4.94. Previous strokes (OR: 3.08; 95% CI: 1.98, 4.80) and carotid bruits (OR: 4.94; 95% CI: 2.49, 9.85) showed the strongest associations. However, no significant associations were observed for angina (OR: 1.19; 95% CI: 0.59,2.39), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (OR: 1.41; 95% CI: 0.75, 2.63), myocardial infarction (OR: 1.19; 95% CI: 0.76, 1.87), mitral regurgitation (OR: 1.18; 95% CI: 0.76, 1.84), or previous thoracic surgery (OR: 1.26; 95% CI: 0.59, 2.69). Despite varying degrees of heterogeneity across outcomes, leave-one-out analyses consistently confirmed the robustness of these results, indicating that no individual study significantly altered the overall findings. Conclusion: This meta-analysis identifies key predictors of stroke following CABG, with previous strokes and carotid bruits showing the strongest associations. Recognizing these risk factors enables targeted prevention and management strategies, potentially reducing stroke incidence and improving patient outcomes."
OpenAlex,mitral regurgitation,Abstract 4371805: False-Positive Aortic Intimal Flap on Echocardiography in an Asymptomatic Adolescent: Clinical Correlation Prevents Misdiagnosis,Tapendra Koirala; Siddharth Mahajan; Ryan Jones,10.1161/circ.152.suppl_3.4371805,2025-11-03,Circulation,"Background: Echocardiography is frequently used as a first-line imaging tool for aortic evaluation, but its susceptibility to artifacts can lead to false-positive findings. Aortic dissection is a critical diagnosis that requires confirmation with advanced imaging before initiating treatment. This case report highlights the clinical importance of clinical correlation and confirmatory imaging when echocardiographic findings suggest aortic dissection in the absence of symptoms. Case presentation: A 12-year-old male with a remote history of self-resolving dyspnea and previously noted trivial mitral regurgitation presented for routine follow-up. He was clinically well with no cardiac symptoms, normal vital signs, and an unremarkable physical exam. Echocardiography revealed an apparent intimal flap (Figure 1-3) in the proximal ascending aorta, raising concern for aortic dissection. There was no associated turbulent flow, pericardial effusion, or signs of hemodynamic compromise. Due to the gravity of potential dissection, a contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) aortogram was performed. CT imaging showed normal aortic anatomy with no evidence of dissection, intimal flap, aneurysm, or other structural abnormalities. Retrospective echocardiographic image review suggested the finding was likely an artifact, possibly due to reverberation or suboptimal transducer angulation. A repeat echocardiogram three months later showed a persistent but less prominent artifact. No intervention was required, and the patient remained asymptomatic. Conclusion: This case demonstrates that echocardiographic artifacts can mimic life-threatening conditions such as aortic dissection. CT aortography remains the gold standard in confirming aortic pathology, particularly in cases where echocardiographic findings are incongruent with the clinical presentation. Incorporating clinical judgment and confirmatory imaging prevents unnecessary anxiety, testing, and interventions, especially in pediatric patients."
OpenAlex,mitral regurgitation,Abstract 4343741: Massive Aortic Root Thrombus and Coronary Embolization in a Heart Transplant Recipient on Venoarterial Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation (VA-ECMO) for Graft Dysfunction: An Imaging Case Report,Chun Kit Wong; Kent H. Rehfeldt,10.1161/circ.152.suppl_3.4343741,2025-11-03,Circulation,"A 44-year-old recent heart transplant recipient supported by VA-ECMO presented to the operating room (OR) for left ventricular (LV) vent removal. She had a history of double-inlet LV with right atrioventricular valve atresia and transposition of great arteries, status post fenestrated Fontan complicated by end-stage heart failure. Three days ago, she underwent a fourth sternotomy and orthotopic heart transplant complicated by coagulopathy and severe bi-ventricular dysfunction necessitating initiation of central VA-ECMO. Due to massive blood product transfusion and ventricular dilatation, an apical LV vent was inserted. Postoperatively the arterial line waveform remained non-pulsatile. The patient was brought to the OR for mediastinal debridement and removal of the LV vent for the purpose of assessing ventricular function and improving arterial pulsatility. Pulse pressure remained negligible at an ECMO flow of 4.5 L/min. Transeosphageal echocardiography (TEE) demonstrated extensive thrombosis of the aortic root, particularly involving the right and non-coronary sinuses (Fig 1a). The aortic valve (AV) did not open. Patency of the left main coronary ostium was evident by color Doppler (Fig 1b) although no right coronary artery (RCA) flow could be visualized. The tip of LV vent was seen tenting the anterior leaflet of mitral valve (MV) causing significant regurgitation. (Fig. 2a-d) After vent removal, LV contraction gradually increased and the AV began to open. This progressively dislodged thrombus from the aortic root. At the conclusion of imaging, there was a highly mobile, bi-lobed thrombus attached to the sinotubular junction (Fig 1c-d). Right ventricular (RV) function remained severely reduced. Moderate mitral regurgitation persisted, arising from A2 leaflet prolapse. This patient subsequently underwent transcatheter thrombectomy and aspiration of the aortic root with cerebral protection device. Coronary angiogram confirmed proximal RCA occlusion (Fig. 3). Attempts to remove RCA thrombus were only partially successful. She eventually required a second heart transplant due to RV infarction. Discussion: This case illustrates a TEE-detected complication of excessive LV venting during VA-ECMO support, namely aortic root thrombosis associated with lack of AV opening. TEE also demonstrated the associated complications of RCA occlusion and iatrogenic mitral valve injury. Unfortunately, these complications were not detected soon enough to avoid RV infarction."

Kevin Heist; Dan Blendea,10.1161/circ.152.suppl_3.4367285,2025-11-03,Circulation,"Background: Functional mitral regurgitation (FMR), both atrial (AFMR) and ventricular (VFMR), results from multiple interacting mechanisms including atrial and ventricular remodeling, changes in mitral annular geometry, leaflet tethering, and heart rate variability. The relative contribution of each factor to FMR severity remains unclear. Purpose: We aimed to assess the short-term effect of a one-time change (shock) in each FMR determinant on the evolution of MR severity and other variables. Additionally, we quantified how much of the variance in MR severity is explained by shocks to its known etiological factors. Methods: Transthoracic echocardiography was used to evaluate FMR in 26 patients, yielding 810 systolic timestamps (583 for the AFMR group and 227 for the VFMR group, 30 fps). For each frame, we recorded RR interval, MR jet area, LA and LV volumes, MV annular diameter, and tenting height. We estimated vector autoregression (VAR) models separately in AFMR and VFMR groups, followed by Forecast Error Variance Decomposition (FEVD) up to step 8 (~264 msec). The FEVD at step 8 quantified the percent of MR variance attributable to each variable. To assess statistical significance, we repeated VARs for each variable pair and visually evaluated impulse response function (IRF) plots: a variable was considered significant if its IRF 95% CI excluded 0. Results: FEVD revealed high self-persistence: most variables primarily explained their own future values. LV volume emerged as a key upstream influencer across the network, while MR area had limited predictive power (Figure 1A, C). In AFMR, MR area was largely self-driven (92.7%) with modest contributions from LV volume (3.2%) and tenting height (2.4%) (Figure 1B). IRF plots showed that only MR area, LA volume, and LV volume had statistically significant effects on MR area (Figure 2). In VFMR, MR area remained self-driven (83.9%), but external contributions were stronger: RR (6.3%), tenting height (3.6%), and MV annulus (3.1%) (Figure 1D). Only MR area, tenting height, and LV volume showed significant IRF effects (Figure 3). Conclusions: In AFMR, short-term MR variability appears driven by LA and LV volume, though LV volume shows a stronger effect, possibly due to transient ventricular changes being more detectable than slow atrial remodeling. In VFMR, MR variability is shaped primarily by tenting height and LV volume, reinforcing the role of subvalvular tethering and dynamic loading in VFMR pathophysiology."

Leonardo Rodriguez; Anand Mehta; Shinya Unai; Ben Alencherry,10.1161/circ.152.suppl_3.4369952,2025-11-03,Circulation,"A 56-year-old woman presented to her primary care physician with a 1-year history of facial flushing and short-lived paroxysms of chest pain. An electrocardiogram was performed which showed normal sinus rhythm and p-mitrale. Transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) revealed normal left ventricle (LV) size and function, moderate to severe aortic regurgitation, moderate mitral regurgitation (MR), moderate tricuspid regurgitation (TR), and mild pulmonic regurgitation. An agitated saline study suggested an intrapulmonary shunt (positive after &gt;10 beats). Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (CMR) confirmed these findings but reclassified the TR and MR as severe and the LV as dilated. CMR also incidentally noted numerous complex hepatic masses, largest measuring 6cm. Dedicated liver MRI confirmed this, and biopsy showed strong, diffusely positive staining for neuroendocrine markers, consistent with a well-differentiated neuroendocrine tumor (carcinoid). Positron Emission Tomography/Computed Tomography (PET/CT) revealed high uptake in the pancreatic head, cecum, and right scapula in addition to known liver lesions. Treatment with octreotide was initiated after obtaining a baseline serum serotonin level 1489 ng/mL (normal 50-220 ng/mL). The patient reported mild symptoms and NT Pro BNP was elevated at 265 pg/mL (normal &lt;125 pg/mL). Given LV dilation, severe valve disease, and likely concealed symptoms, cardiac surgery consultation was pursued. Transesophageal echocardiogram with moderate sedation was deferred due to risk of carcinoid crisis. In coordination with oncology, surgery was scheduled after initiating octreotide. Preoperative octreotide infusion was administered, and she underwent four-valve replacement with bioprostheses. Intraoperatively, all four valves had thickened, retracted leaflets; a 7 mm patent foramen ovale (PFO) was also identified and closed. Pathology of valve specimens showed extracellular plaque deposition and bland spindle cells, consistent with carcinoid valve disease. The patient had an uneventful postoperative course. Carcinoid heart disease is a rare, morbid manifestation of neuroendocrine tumors, mediated by elevated serotonin and other vasoactive substances causing fibrotic valve dysfunction. It usually affects right-sided valves, but left-sided involvement may occur with intracardiac shunt or pulmonary metastases. This case illustrates the multidisciplinary diagnosis and management of an exceedingly rare form of carcinoid heart disease."

Lund; Frieder Braunschweig; Peter Svenarud; Magnus Dalén; Bahira Shahim,10.1161/circ.152.suppl_3.4368255,2025-11-03,Circulation,"Background: New-onset postoperative atrial fibrillation or flutter (POAF) is a known complication following mitral valve surgery in patients with mitral valve prolapse (MVP) and mitral regurgitation (MR). Aim: To characterize the types, clinical correlates, and long-term outcomes of POAF in patients undergoing mitral valve surgery for degenerative MR. Methods: Patients with MVP and moderate or severe degenerative MR who underwent mitral valve surgery between 2010-2024 at Karolinska University Hospital were included. Data were extracted from electronic medical records, ECGs, and echocardiograms. Comprehensive outcome tracking was performed with no patients lost to follow-up. Patients were excluded if they had prior atrial fibrillation/flutter, mitral stenosis, rheumatic mitral valve disease, endocarditis, or prior mitral valve surgery. Cox regression was adjusted for age, sex, BMI, hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, diabetes, hemoglobin, prior PCI or CABG, eGFR, NYHA class, pulmonary hypertension, LVEF, and mitral valve repair vs replacement. Results: Among 786 patients, 49.7% developed POAF, 82.4% during the index hospitalization. Most events were paroxysmal 89.5%, persistent 6.1%, and permanent 4.3%. Patients with POAF were older, more often in NYHA class III-IV, had lower LVEF and elevated pulmonary artery systolic pressures compared to those without POAF. No differences were observed in preoperative left atrial volume index, MR severity, MVP etiology or anticoagulation use between the groups. Patients with POAF were less likely to have undergone mitral valve repair, had longer cardiopulmonary bypass and cross-clamp time, and more frequently underwent concomitant CABG or tricuspid valve intervention. During a median follow-up time of 4.4 years, POAF was independently associated with increased risk of heart failure hospitalization, permanent pacemaker implantation and mitral valve reoperation, Figure. There were no significant associations with endocarditis, stroke or all-cause mortality. Conclusions: POAF occurred in nearly half of all patients undergoing mitral valve surgery for degenerative MR, most commonly in paroxysmal form during the index hospitalization. POAF was associated with worse preoperative status, more complex surgical procedures, and significantly increased long-term risk of heart failure, pacemaker implantation and reoperation. These findings highlight the need for strategies to prevent and manage POAF in this high-risk population."

Pressman,10.1161/circ.152.suppl_3.4362147,2025-11-03,Circulation,"Background: Mitral annular calcification (MAC) is a chronic inflammatory condition that is associated with future cardiovascular events. There is limited data that explores how MAC impacts outcomes in patients with pre-existing mitral regurgitation (MR). Methods: This is a retrospective analysis using the TriNetX US Collaborative Network database. A database of hospitalized patients ≥50 years was queried using ICD-10 and TriNetX curated codes. We identified those given a discharge diagnosis of MR between 2020-2023, excluding patients with rheumatic mitral valve disease or ESRD. We then stratified by presence/absence of a new diagnosis of MAC (occurring after MR diagnosis). Cohorts were balanced for socio-demographics, body mass index, and common comorbidities including hypertension, hyperlipidemia, diabetes, and tobacco use, with a standard difference of &lt;0.1 considered to indicate adequate balancing. Hazard ratios were calculated for outcomes, with a P&lt;0.05 considered significant. Results: Our query yielded 11,462 patients in the MAC group and 450,474 patients in the no MAC group. Following propensity matching, each group had 11,462 patients. All targeted variables were adequately balanced. Average age was similar in both the MAC and no MAC groups (76 years vs 75.8 years). The populations were majority white (80.3% vs 81.2%) and female (56.8% vs 57.0%). BMI was also similar (29.2 vs 28.7). Among patients with pre-existing MR, subsequently diagnosed MAC was associated with increased 1-year risk of hospitalization (HR 1.22, 95%CI 1.180-1.262, p&lt;0.0001), ICU admission (HR 1.38, 95%CI 1.250-1.524, p&lt;0.0001), ischemic heart disease (HR 1.446, 95%CI 1.289-1.622, p&lt;0.0001), new onset HFpEF (HR 1.286, 95%CI 1.160-1.425, p&lt;0.0001), cerebrovascular disease (HR 1.341, 95%CI 1.190-1.512, p&lt;0.0001), prosthetic valve replacement (HR 2.126, 95%CI 1.786-2.530, p&lt;0.0001), and mitral stenosis (HR 3.16, 95%CI 2.490-5.234, p&lt;0.0001). There was not a significant difference between groups for HFrEF (HR 0.955, p=0.4377), cardiogenic shock (HR 1.188, p=0.1098), or cardiac arrest (HR 1.155, p=0.1979). Conclusions: In patients with previously diagnosed MR, a subsequent diagnosis of MAC was associated with increased 1-year risk of hospitalization, new onset ischemic heart disease or HFpEF, and a variety of other adverse cardiovascular outcomes."

Mensch; Malte Kuniss; Thomas Neumann; Andreas Rieth; Julia Treiber; Samuel Sossalla; Andreas Hain,10.1161/circ.152.suppl_3.4357473,2025-11-03,Circulation,"Background: Arrhythmia-induced cardiomyopathy (AIC) is a potentially reversible cause of heart failure triggered by sustained arrhythmias. Its true real-world prevalence and clinical recognition remain limited. This study aimed to assess the frequency, predictors, and outcomes of AIC in patients with newly diagnosed left ventricular systolic dysfunction (LVSD) and concurrent arrhythmia, undergoing rhythm control while protected by a wearable cardioverter-defibrillator (WCD). Methods: We analyzed 780 patients treated with a WCD between 2017 and 2023. Among them, patients with newly diagnosed idiopathic LVSD (LVEF &lt;35%) and arrhythmias (atrial fibrillation, flutter, or ventricular ectopy &gt;20%) were identified. Diagnostic workup included echocardiography, cardiac MRI, and ischemia testing or coronary angiography. Patients underwent rhythm control (cardioversion, antiarrhythmic drugs, and/or catheter ablation) and were followed up to 6 months. AIC was defined as LVEF improvement &gt;15% in patients with restored sinus rhythm. Results: Among 780 patients treated with a WCD, 142 (18.2%) had first diagnosis of LVSD in the presence of arrhythmia (Figure 1). Of these, 68 (47.9%) had an identifiable etiology (Figure 2). The remaining 74 (52.1%) with idiopathic LVSD were analyzed. At mean follow-up of 133 days (4.5 months), 20 (27%) of 74 patients remained in arrhythmia (non-responders). Among 54 responders with restored sinus rhythm, 32 (59.3%) fulfilled AIC criteria; 22 (40.7%) were non-AIC. LVEF improved from 28% to 43% in AIC vs. 24% to 32% in non-AIC. Full recovery (LVEF &gt;50%) was achieved in 56.3% of AIC patients during follow-up. Atrial fibrillation was most common (81.3% AIC vs. 95.5% non-AIC), followed by flutter; ventricular ectopy occurred in 9.4% of AIC cases. Heart failure therapy was comparable. Non-AIC patients showed larger LVEDD/LVESD, lower heart rates, more mitral regurgitation, and more frequent late gadolinium enhancement on MRI. No appropriate WCD shocks occurred. ICDs were implanted in 36.4% of non-AIC vs. 3.1% of AIC patients (p=0.001). No deaths were reported. LVEF &lt;25% predicted lack of full recovery (p=0.04). Conclusions: AIC is a common and reversible form of LVSD in patients with arrhythmia and newly diagnosed idiopathic cardiomyopathy. Early rhythm control supported by WCD, combined with detailed diagnostics including cardiac MRI and ischemia testing, enables identification of reversible dysfunction and may reduce unnecessary ICD implantation."

Transcatheter mitral valve-in-valve (ViV) implantation is a challenging but increasingly viable option, especially in high-risk patients. We report a complex mitral ViV procedure in a 78-year-old woman with multiple comorbidities and severe mitral bioprosthetic valve failure. Case Report: A 78-year-old woman with a history of RHD and surgical MVR 12 years prior was readmitted for progressive dyspnea (NYHA III) and pulmonary edema despite high-dose diuretics. Past history included hypertension, atrial fibrillation, chronic kidney disease (Cr=3.0 mg/dL), and VVi pacemaker. Catheterization revealed severe pulmonary venocapillary hypertension (27 mmHg), moderate pulmonary artery hypertension (59×22 [35] mmHg), and elevated right atrial pressure (19 mmHg). Transesophageal echo showed severe regurgitation of a severely calcified mitral bioprosthesis (external effective annulus=26 mm). Left ventricle (LV) outflow tract obstruction risk was low (area: 292 mm 2 ). STS-PROM mortality for surgical reintervention was 8.2%. The heart team opted for mitral ViV with a Sapien Ultra 29mm valve. Using a Swartz 8F sheath and BRK needle, a posteroinferior transseptal puncture was performed, and a 0.035"" guidewire was advanced to the LV and exchanged for a pigtail catheter. A Safari extra-support guide was then positioned in the LV, and a second stiff wire was placed in the superior left pulmonary vein. Due to difficulty advancing the prosthesis, sequential septal dilations were performed with 8.0 mm and 10.0 mm balloons. The Sapien Ultra was then advanced across the septum but could not cross the stenotic surgical valve. The wire was repositioned from the pulmonary vein to the LV, and valvuloplasty was done with a 20×30 mm AltoSa balloon. The valve was then successfully navigated and implanted under rapid pacing with nominal deployment. Post-procedure 3D echo confirmed good valve dynamics with a mean gradient of 2 mmHg and visualization of a ruptured surgical leaflet. At 4-month follow-up, the patient remains in NYHA class I, with no adverse events. Conclusion: This case illustrates the feasibility of mitral ViV in RHD with severe prosthetic calcification. Preprocedural planning, balloon preparation, and wire strategy were critical for success. The Sapien Ultra prosthesis provided excellent hemodynamic results in a high-risk patient."

While intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP) therapy is recommended as a bridge to surgery in select cases, evidence supporting its clinical utility in this setting remains limited. Methods: We conducted a retrospective cohort study using the Nationwide Readmissions Database (NRD) from 2016 to 2020. Adult patients undergoing surgical correction for acute MR were identified using ICD-10-CM/PCS codes. Propensity score matching was performed to compare outcomes between patients who received preoperative IABP and those who did not. The primary outcome was in-hospital mortality. Secondary outcomes included in-hospital complications, 30- , 90-, and 180-day readmissions, and resource utilization. Results: Of 33,644 hospitalizations for surgical repair of acute MR, 1,691 (5.0%) received preoperative IABP. After 1:1 matching, 918 patient pairs were analyzed. IABP use was associated with significantly lower in-hospital mortality (2.8% vs. 6.0%, p &lt; 0.001), cardiogenic shock (12.9% vs. 18%, p &lt; 0.001), myocardial infarction (1.7% vs. 9.9%, p &lt; 0.001), MACCE (16.4% vs. 22.4%, p &lt; 0.001), acute kidney injury (28.5% vs. 51.0%, p &lt; 0.001), stroke (0.2% vs. 2.6%, p &lt; 0.001), and need for endotracheal intubation (5.5% vs. 20.2%, p &lt; 0.001). The IABP group had a shorter median hospital stay (10 vs. 13 days, p &lt; 0.001), but higher hospitalization costs ($83,118 vs. $49,343, p &lt; 0.001). Thirty-day readmission was significantly lower in the IABP group (8.3% vs. 11.7%, p = 0.02), with no differences at 90 or 180 days. Conclusion: In patients undergoing surgery for acute MR, preoperative IABP use was associated with improved in-hospital outcomes and lower 30-day readmission rates, despite higher resource utilization. These findings support a potential therapeutic role for IABP as a bridging strategy in this high-risk population and warrant validation through prospective studies."

Studies have showed trace element concentrations varied in patients with AF and may be involved in the pathogenesis of AF. However, no data is currently available for those with VHD. Methods Urine samples as well as clinical data were collected from 72 VHD patients with AF (VHDAF) and 72 VHD patients without AF (VHD) and further analyzed for a panel of trace elements: lithium, manganese, cobalt, copper, zinc, arsenic, selenium, strontium, Cadmium, mercury, thallium, lead. Quantile g-computation was adopted to explore the joint effect of the 12 trace elements on AF in this population, and internal validation was performed using 1,000 bootstrap re-samples. Results Compared with the VHD group, Sr levels were reduced, while Mn, Cu and Hg concentrations were increased in the VHDAF group. Quantile g-computation model indicated a significant association between the mixtures of the 12 urinary trace elements and AF in patients with heart valve disease (adjusted OR: 2.051; 95% CI: 1.180–3.565; p = 0.011). Positive partial effect was owing to Cu (weight: 0.43) and Hg (weight: 0.18), while negative partial effect mainly attributed to Sr (weight: 0.43) and Li (weight: 0.23). Conclusion VHDAF patients had higher Cu levels and lower Sr levels, and the two elements have been supposed to exert the largest influence on AF. Further research is needed to establish the causal relationships."

Although the initial insult is driven by autoimmune responses triggered by Group A Streptococcus infection, the sustained progression of valvular fibrosis involves a complex interplay of persistent immune activation, chronic inflammation, and, critically, long‐term mechanical stress. Mechanical forces arising from altered hemodynamics and structural valve deformation perpetuate valvular interstitial cell activation, endothelial‐to‐mesenchymal transition, and extracellular matrix remodeling, thereby driving fibrosis even after acute inflammation resolves. Current therapeutic options to halt or reverse mitral valve fibrosis are limited, with surgical repair or replacement remaining the primary interventions for advanced disease. Advancing mechanistic understanding through physiologically relevant models, coupled with early diagnostic strategies and multitargeted antifibrotic approaches, holds promise for preserving valve function. Integrating molecular insights with scalable public health measures may ultimately mitigate the global burden of rheumatic heart disease and improve outcomes for affected populations."

This pathology is the most prevalent valvular heart disease worldwide and is associated with a poor prognosis. Despite extensive research, no pharmacological treatments are available to slow or reverse valvular degeneration, making aortic valve replacement the only current therapeutic option. This lack of clinical success may stem from an incomplete understanding of the disease's mechanisms and the limitations of current preclinical models, which do not fully replicate the complexity of CAVD and its associated risk factors and comorbidities. Indeed, while existing models offer valuable insights, a deeper understanding of CAVD requires incorporating comorbidities, gender-specific mechanisms, and dynamic cellular and tissue-level changes. This review aims to provide the reader with an overview of preclinical models developed in recent years to study CAVD, assessing their strengths and limitations. We review how these models can be used to mimic and/or investigate the cellular and molecular mechanisms involved in CAVD development, and highlight how key risk factors and comorbidities can be incorporated to enhance the translational potential of research. We hope that this approach will help guide researchers in selecting the most appropriate model for their studies, with the goal of advancing the identification of effective therapeutic candidates."

OpenAlex,valvular heart disease,Abstract 4367684: The wandering stent: Tricuspid Valve Injury from a Migrated Endovascular Stent,Alfredo Mora Guevara; Jack A. Cannon; Daniel A. Ricketti; Ayobamidele Balogun,10.1161/circ.152.suppl_3.4367684,2025-11-03,Circulation,"Introduction: Endovascular stents are commonly used for vascular access in patients undergoing hemodialysis. While these devices are generally safe, rare but serious complications such as stent migration and associated endocarditis can occur. Migration into cardiac chambers has been reported, often requiring surgical intervention due to the high risk of valvular damage. Case presentation: A 71-year-old male with a medical history of end-stage kidney disease on dialysis and hyperlipidemia, presented with fevers and shortness of breath. On presentation vital signs were notable for tachycardia. Sepsis was suspected, and blood cultures grew Streptococcus gallolyticus, and subsequently started on Ceftriaxone. Echocardiogram revealed a large, migrated endovascular stent in the right atrium, measuring approximately 6 cm × 1.4 cm. Stent appeared to be attached to the anterior leaflet of the tricuspid valve. Left ventricular function ejection fraction was 55%. No vegetations or pericardial effusion were appreciated. Patient reported undergoing an uncomplicated creation of the left arm fistula with vascular stent approximately two years prior. Percutaneous retrieval was attempted twice unsuccessfully. Later, his course was complicated by cardiac tamponade requiring pericardiocentesis, with drainage of approximately 550 mL of sanguineous fluid. This complication was suspected due to myocardial microperforation during the attempted stent retrieval. Following hemodynamic stabilization, the patient underwent cardiac surgery with successful removal of the migrated stent and bioprosthetic tricuspid valve replacement. He then completed a full course of antibiotics for bacteremia and was discharged to a physical rehabilitation facility. Discussion: Stent migration into the heart is a rare but potentially life-threatening complication. It’s commonly associated with improper sizing, placement, or vessel wall degradation over time. Once in the cardiac chambers, stents can cause mechanical damage, serve as a nidus for infection, and impair valvular function. While percutaneous retrieval is typically the first-line approach, surgical intervention is often necessary when complications like tamponade or valve involvement occur. This case calls attention to the importance of long-term monitoring of intravascular devices, especially in patients with dialysis access, and highlights the need and importance for multidisciplinary management when complications arise."
OpenAlex,valvular heart disease,Abstract 4346565: The inhibition of ATP citrate lyase prevents pathological cardiac fibrosis via the regulation of de novo lipogenesis and histone acetylation,Naoya Kuwahara; Manabu Nagao; Masakazu Shinohara; Kenta Kaneshiro; Tatsuro Ishida; Hiromasa Otake,10.1161/circ.152.suppl_3.4346565,2025-11-03,Circulation,"Background: Cardiac fibrosis is characterized by excessive extracellular matrix deposition in heart tissue that occurs early in heart failure (HF) and is caused not only by cardiac diseases such as ischemic heart disease and valvular diseases but also by lifestyle diseases such as hypertension and diabetes. Therefore, the inhibition of cardiac fibrosis has been considered an important therapeutic approach for treating HF. ATP citrate lyase (ACLY) is a key metabolic enzyme that converts mitochondria-derived citrate into acetyl-CoA. ACLY is essential for de novo lipogenesis (DNL) and histone acetylation, needs for cellular growth and organ fibrosis. Although fatty acids are required for energy production and biomass synthesis in the heart, the biological roles and regulatory mechanisms of ACLY-mediated DNL in pathological cardiac fibrosis remain largely unknown. Hypothesis: The inhibition of ACLY reduces pathological cardiac fibrosis by suppress DNL and histone acetylation. Methods: Adeno-associated virus serotype 9 (AAV9)-mediated shRNA targeting Acly was intravenously injected into C57BL/6J male mice from the retro-orbital sinus. The mice were subsequently continuously infused with a mixture of angiotensin II (AngII) and phenylephrine (PE) for two weeks. Cardiac phenotypes were evaluated via histological staining. Cell migration assays, stable isotope tracing with 13C-labeled glucose, and chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays were performed using human cardiac fibroblasts (HCFs). Results: ACLY expression was upregulated in the heart sections of mice treated with AngII/PE, especially in fibrotic areas. Masson’s trichrome staining and immunoblots revealed that gene silencing of Acly significantly reduced cardiac fibrosis and the expression of fibrous proteins in these mice. And gene silencing of Acly improves prognosis. SiRNA-mediated ACLY knockdown suppressed the proliferation and expression of fibrous proteins in cultured HCFs stimulated with transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β). Mechanistically, ACLY inhibition reduced DNL, limiting the fatty acid supply essential for cellular growth and proliferation; it also decreased H3K9 and H3K27 acetylation, in addition to the presence of acetylated H3K9 and H3K27 at the promoter regions of fibrotic genes. Conclusion: Our findings demonstrated that ACLY plays pivotal roles in promoting pathological cardiac fibrosis. Targeting ACLY may emerge as a novel therapeutic strategy to prevent the progression of HF."
OpenAlex,valvular heart disease,Abstract 4360993: Phenotypic Sex-Based Differences in Left Ventricular Geometry in Chronic Aortic Regurgitation,Anika Sonig; Lydia DeAngelo; Richard H. Grimm; L. Leonardo Rodriguez; Brian P. Griffin; Zoran Popović; David Chen; Christopher Nguyen; Deborah Kwon,10.1161/circ.152.suppl_3.4360993,2025-11-03,Circulation,"Background: Chronic Aortic Regurgitation (AR), a prevalent form of valvular heart disease, is associated with significant mortality and morbidity if left untreated. Emerging studies demonstrate significant sex-specific differences in AR presentation and clinical outcomes, yet current management guidelines do not account for these sex differences. Additionally, females with AR tend to exhibit increased symptoms despite reduced ventricular volume and preserved function. Research Question: How do left ventricular structure and geometry differ between sexes across varying severities of AR? Methods: A single-center, retrospective cohort study was conducted and included patients with an aortic regurgitant fraction &gt;20% by cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) or ≥ moderate AR by echocardiography. AR severity was quantified using regurgitant fraction (ARFrac) thresholds, quantified by CMR (Mild: ARFrac &lt; 20, Moderate: 20 ≤ ARFrac ≤ 33, Severe: ARFrac &gt; 33). Cardiac geometry measured by CMR was determined using LV mass index (LVMassi), left ventricular end diastolic diameter indexed (LVEDDi), LV end systolic diameter index (LVESDi), interventricular septal thickness (IVS), posterior wall thickness (PWT), LV length, and derived indices including relative wall thickness (RWT) and sphericity. Volumetric measures included LVEDVi, LVESVi, and LVEF. Comparisons were stratified by sex, and significance was assessed using Wilcoxon rank-sum tests. Results: We evaluated 370 patients with AR, 63 female (17%), median age of 51 years. See Table 1 for the comparisons of age, hypertension, diabetes, ARFrac, and LV morphologic features stratified by sex. Radar plots significant sex differences in morphologic features across varying AR severity levels (mild, moderate, and severe). Opposite changes in RWT and sphericity were present in the setting of severe AR, based on sex. Conclusion: There are evident sex-specific differences in AR LV remodeling. Males exhibit more chamber dilation with increased sphericity and RWT with severe AR, while females maintain smaller, with decreased sphericity and increased RWT in the setting of severe AR. These differences may contribute to disparities in symptom presentation and AR severity. Recognizing sex-based remodeling patterns may inform the future development of more personalized clinical guidelines for AR management, including risk stratification and surgical referral thresholds."

Bohra; Aishwarya Yamparala; Kyle Gobeil,10.1161/circ.152.suppl_3.4361536,2025-11-03,Circulation,"Background: Understanding cardiovascular mortality is key for shaping public health priorities. Two major sources in the U.S.—CDC WONDER and the Global Burden of Disease (GBD) study—report mortality differently. While CDC WONDER reflects death certificate data, GBD employs modeling techniques and redistributes ill-defined (""garbage"") codes to improve cause of death attribution. Prior comparisons have focused on ischemic heart disease and stroke, but other cardiovascular conditions remain understudied. Methods: We examined trends in valvular heart disease (I34.0-I37.9), hypertensive heart disease (I11.0, I11.9), peripheral arterial disease (I70.2), infective endocarditis (I38), and aortic aneurysm (I71) using both databases from 1999–2020. Annual U.S. mortality data from GBD and CDC WONDER were analyzed. For each condition, absolute deaths and crude mortality rates (CMRs) per 100,000 population were extracted. Percent change from 1999 to 2020 was calculated. CMRs were reported with 95% uncertainty intervals (UI) for GBD and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for CDC WONDER. Results: Substantial differences were found between the databases. Valvular heart disease deaths rose by 38.8% (GBD) and 32.2% (CDC). CMRs increased from 7.15 (UI: 7.62–6.18) to 8.33 (9.12–6.74) in GBD and from 11.8 (CI: 11.7–11.9) to 13.2 (13.1–13.4) in CDC. Hypertensive heart disease exhibited the most pronounced increase where deaths rose by 147.2% (GBD) and 474.7% (CDC). GBD CMRs rose from 10.6 (11.2–9.46) to 22.0 (23.62–19.21); CDC from 8.9 (9.2–8.9) to 43.8 (44.3–43.8). Peripheral arterial disease deaths rose 20.9% (GBD) but fell 50.4% (CDC). CMRs changed from 3.21 (3.45–2.82) to 3.26 (3.55–2.78) in GBD and from 0.6 (0.6–0.7) to 0.3 (0.3–0.3) in CDC. Infective endocarditis deaths increased by 41.9% (GBD) and 36.4% (CDC). CMRs rose from 2.4 (2.53–2.17) to 2.86 (3.07–2.50) in GBD and from 3.3 (3.4–3.3) to 3.8 (3.9–3.8) in CDC. Aortic aneurysm deaths declined 31.6% (GBD) and 18.9% (CDC). GBD CMRs fell from 6.19 (6.45–5.63) to 3.55 (3.76–3.15); CDC from 7.9 (8.0–7.8) to 5.4 (5.5–5.3). Conclusion: Cardiovascular mortality trends varied significantly between GBD and CDC WONDER. Differences were especially striking in hypertensive heart disease and peripheral arterial disease, likely due to methodological variation in death coding and redistribution. Awareness of these discrepancies is crucial for interpreting national mortality data and informing policy."

Marchlinski,10.1161/circ.152.suppl_3.4337942,2025-11-03,Circulation,"Background: Non-ischemic cardiomyopathy (NICM) patients with heart failure (HF) undergoing ventricular tachycardia (VT) ablation are at risk for long-term HF events. Left ventricular (LV) endocardial unipolar (Uni) and/or bipolar (Bi) low voltage areas (LVA) at ablation indicate abnormal myocardium, and their extent may predict HF events. Objective: To evaluate and compare the prognostic ability of endocardial Uni-LVA and Bi-LVA for the prediction of HF outcomes in NICM patients undergoing VT ablation. Methods: NICM and HF patients undergoing VT ablation between Jan 2020 and Dec 2023 at the Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania were included. Exclusions were ARVC, HCM, valvular disease, prior cardiac surgery. Uni-LVA was defined as &lt;8.27mV and Bi-LVA &lt;1.5mV during sinus/paced rhythm. Patients were followed at 6 weeks post-ablation, then at 6-month intervals. The HF outcomes included death, LVAD implant, heart transplant, or HF hospitalization. Patients were grouped into mild, moderate, and severe tertiles based on the extent of Uni-LVA and Bi-LVA. The association between tertiles and HF outcome was assessed by Cox regression, adjusted for age, sex, CKD, and LVEF. Results: A total of 137 patients with NICM and HF (mean age 62±12 years; 22.6% women) underwent VT ablation and LV endocardial voltage mapping. Of those, 129 had HFrEF (LVEF 30.5±10.8) and 8 had HFpEF (LVEF 56.5±4.4). Median Bi-LVA was 12.9% [IQR 5.4, 22.5] of the total LV endocardial surface. Bi-LVA tertiles were &lt;8% (mild), 8-18.5% (moderate), &gt;18.5% (severe). Median Uni-LVA was 50.1% [IQR 27.8, 76.5] of the total endocardial LV surface. Uni-LVA tertiles were &lt;35% (mild), 35–68% (moderate), &gt;68% (severe). HF outcomes occurred in 51 (37.2%) patients over a median follow-up of 2.6 years [IQR 1.8, 4.6]. HF outcome incidence was similar between mild Bi-LVA (24.4%, reference) and moderate Bi-LVA (30.4%, HR=0.77, 95%CI: 0.34–1.74, p=0.5), but significantly higher in severe Bi-LVA (56.5%, HR=2.8, 95%CI: 1.3–5.7, p=0.005). HF outcome incidence was 13.3% in mild Uni-LVA (reference), and significantly increased in moderate Uni-LVA (41.3%, HR=2.96, 95%CI: 1.1–7.6, p=0.02) and severe Uni-LVA (56.5%, HR=4.4, 95%CI: 1.7–10.9, p&lt;0.001). Conclusions: The extent of endocardial LVA, particularly unipolar abnormalities, noted during VT ablation in NICM patients is a prognostic indicator for late HF outcomes. Even moderate degrees of Uni-LVA are associated with a threefold increase in the risk of late HF outcomes."

McKindley; Jennifer Ken-Opurum; Ron Preblick; Omar M. Aldaas; Sujatha Sistla; April Slee; Jonathan C. Hsu,10.1161/circ.152.suppl_3.4367249,2025-11-03,Circulation,"Background: Rhythm control with catheter ablation (CA) of atrial fibrillation (AF) leads to reverse remodeling of AF substrate. Comorbidities may impact this process and outcomes. Sparse cardiovascular (CV) guidelines address comorbidities and rhythm control practices after CA. We characterized incident comorbidities after index CA that may impact outcomes, reablation, or antiarrhythmic drug (AAD) practices after CA in the ARRC-AF study. Methods: 2,429,863 patients in Optum’s deidentified Market Clarity Data (Market Clarity ® ) newly diagnosed with AF (2007–2021) were followed until disenrollment, death, or study end; 23,323 patients underwent index CA. Comorbidity status before CA and comorbidity event rates after CA were analyzed. We examined these before and during intervening periods between CAs and while receiving medical therapy. Results: Among the 23,323 patients who underwent index CA (median follow-up: 3.2 years; 44.6% prescribed AADs), baseline comorbidities included hypertension (51.8%), coronary artery disease (17.9%), obstructive sleep apnea (14.4%), diabetes (11.7%), heart failure (10.5%), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (8.9%), peripheral vascular disease (5.4%), valvular heart disease (4.9%), and chronic kidney disease (1.1%). During follow up, 19,461 patients (83.4%) had no further CA; 3,862 patients (46.7% prescribed AADs) had ≥1 reablation (1 reablation, 14.2%; 2 reablations, 2.0%; ≥3 reablations, 0.4%; interval between Cas of 539, 536, and 458 days, respectively). Individual comorbidity event rates after CA ranged from 0 to 4.7% in the 3 cohorts with ≥1 comorbidity/patient ( Table ). Conclusion: After CA, new comorbidities continue to emerge at a modest rate. In general, comorbidity event rates increased as the number of reablations increased. Both CV and non-CV comorbidities need to be assessed before reablation (with and without long-term AAD therapy) for potential impact on endpoints and need best practice management. Co-morbidities can impact outcomes and need to be considered for their impact on sample sizes, study endpoints, morbidity, and mortality in AF ablation trials. Optimizing management of comorbidities could potentially improve results of AF interventions"

Research Question/Hypothesis: We hypothesised that unsupervised machine learning (ML) applied to routinely collected variables could yield a more informative HF stratification than the conventional LVEF-based framework. Goals/Aims: To develop an ML-derived multidimensional HF classification, test its prognostic performance, and compare it with existing LVEF categories. Methods/Approach: We analysed 13,238 patients in the nationwide JROAD-HF registry in Japan. Forty-six clinical, laboratory, and echocardiographic variables entered a latent-class model; the cohort was randomly split 1:1 into discovery and internal-validation sets to assess robustness. (Figure 1) Clinical endpoint defined as a composite of 5-year cardiovascular death and heart failure readmission. Results: The model identified three phenogroups by minimum Bayesian Information Criteria. Phenogroup 1 “Advanced Low-Output HF” (predominantly male, age 73.6 ± 12 years) showed severe systolic dysfunction (LVEF 35.5 %), renal impairment, and heavy burdens of ischemic heart disease (52 %) and cardiomyopathy (29%). Phenogroup 2 “Early Afterload-Mismatch HF” (predominantly male, age 68.8 ± 12 years) was the youngest, markedly hypertensive, with intermediate LVEF (41.9%) and diverse etiologies. Phenogroup 3 “Elderly HFpEF-like HF” (predominantly female, age 84.5 ± 7 years) was lean and anemic, with preserved LVEF 53.5%, atrial fibrillation (45%), and valvular disease (42%). The four most discriminative variables were age, total bilirubin, LV diastolic diameter, and serum hemoglobin rather than LVEF and yielded an adjusted Rand index of 0.94 in the validation set, indicating excellent reproducibility. Five-year Kaplan–Meier curves showed the lowest mortality in Phenogroup 2 and the highest in Phenogroup 1 (log-rank p &lt; 0.001), whereas LVEF categories showed no significant separation (p = 0.267) (Figure 2 A and B). Conclusions: ML-driven phenomapping of routine hospital data delineated three distinct HF groups that outperformed the traditional LVEF classification in prognostic discrimination."

Emerging evidence indicates that oxidative stress plays a significant role in the pathophysiology of CAVD by promoting damage to the endothelium lining the aortic valve. Our previous data provided evidence that sortilin orchestrates a complex intracellular signaling pathway culminating in endothelial dysfunction in mice through increased ROS production. Research Questions: To unveil the potential involvement of sortilin in the molecular mechanisms linking endothelial injury and oxidative stress in the progression of CAVD. Methods: Isolated human valve endothelial cells were used to identify the molecular mechanisms in vitro. Göttingen minipigs were randomly assigned to either a standard diet (SD) or a diet high in fat and cholesterol (HF) for 20 weeks. During this period, they received oral administration of either a placebo or the sortilin inhibitor AF38469. Blood samples were collected at baseline, during, and at the end of treatment for biochemical and oxidative stress marker analyses. Aortic cusps were analyzed histologically for cellularity, collagen, fibrosis, and calcification. Immunohistochemistry and Western blot assessed oxidative stress and osteoblast markers. Vascular reactivity studies evaluated endothelial function in isolated resistance vessels. Results: Immunohistochemistry revealed that the HF diet compromised endothelial integrity on the aortic valve surface, while sortilin inhibition preserved it. Furthermore, the HF diet group exhibited increased oxidative stress, activation of myofibroblast/osteoblast phenotypes, and mineralization in the valve, all of which were reduced by the sortilin inhibitor. Moreover, AF38469 significantly prevented the increased plasma cholesterol ( p&lt; 0.0001) and triglyceride ( p&lt; 0.0001) levels as well as the endothelial dysfunction observed in the placebo-treated HF diet group. Conclusions: Our data suggest that sortilin negatively regulates valvular degeneration by influencing the destruction of endothelial integrity, the increase in inflammation and oxidative stress, thereby highlighting its therapeutic potential in CAVD."

McNamara; Evangelos K. Oikonomou; Aline F Pedroso; Rohan Khera,10.1161/circ.152.suppl_3.4369348,2025-11-03,Circulation,"Background: Wearable devices can capture 1-lead ECGs but are primarily used for detecting rhythm disorders. AI deployed on these ECGs could enable scalable detection of structural heart diseases (SHDs). However, wearable ECGs are noisier than clinical ECGs, and it is essential to develop and validate noise-resilient models that reliably detect SHD on real-world wearable devices. Aim: We first developed and externally validated a noise-adapted AI-ECG model to detect SHD from lead I of clinical ECGs. In the prospective WATCH-SHD study, we then assessed its performance in detecting SHD from an Apple Watch-acquired 1-lead ECG. Methods: Using 266,054 ECGs from 110,006 patients at Yale (2015–23), we developed an AI-ECG algorithm to detect SHD from lead I ECGs (resembling Apple Watch 1-lead ECGs) paired with echocardiograms within 30 days. SHD was defined as a composite of LVEF &lt;40%, severe left-sided valvular disease, or severe LVH (IVSd &gt;15 mm + LV diastolic dysfunction). ECGs were augmented with random Gaussian noise during training to improve the model’s robustness against noisy signal acquisition. The model was then externally validated in 44,591 patients across 4 community hospitals and 3,014 participants from the population-based ELSA-Brasil. Subsequently, we prospectively enrolled 600 participants undergoing an outpatient echocardiogram at Yale and obtained a 30-s, 1-lead ECG with an Apple Watch to assess the AI tool’s performance in detecting SHD. ECG acquisition and inference were conducted in real-time using the CarDS-Plus app. Results: The AI model had an AUROC of 0.92 (95% CI, 0.91-0.93) for detecting SHD from lead I of clinical ECGs in the Yale test set and generalized well to the external cohorts, with AUROCs ranging from 0.89 to 0.92. In the prospective WATCH-SHD, 596 of 600 participants (99.3%; median age 62 years [IQR, 46–71]; 52% women) successfully obtained a 1-lead ECG on the Apple Watch, of whom 21 (5.3%) had SHD. This included 15 with LVEF &lt;40%, 5 with severe valvular disease, and 1 with severe LVH. The AI model had an AUROC of 0.88 (0.78–0.98) for detecting SHD from Apple Watch-acquired 1-lead ECG. At the threshold for optimizing Youden’s index, the model’s sensitivity was 86%, specificity 87%, NPV 99%, and PPV 27% for detecting SHD. Conclusions: A noise-adapted AI tool integrated with an automated platform can detect SHD from a 30-s, 1-lead ECG acquired with an Apple Watch. This has the potential to transform SHD screening in communities."
OpenAlex,valvular heart disease,Abstract 4367966: Clinical and Demographic Predictors of Rapid Aortic Stenosis Progression: Moving Toward Individualized Surveillance Strategies,P. Michael Ho; Yi-Lin Wu; Fagen Xie; Wansu Chen; Ming‐Sum Lee,10.1161/circ.152.suppl_3.4367966,2025-11-03,Circulation,"Introduction: Aortic stenosis (AS) is the most common valvular heart disease requiring intervention in the US. Untreated symptomatic AS carries a one-year mortality rate of up to 50%, while timely diagnosis allows for effective treatment. AS progresses gradually over years and is typically monitored with surveillance echocardiography. AS progression rates vary significantly between individuals. Current guidelines recommend uniform surveillance intervals, which may result in unnecessary imaging for slow progressors and delayed diagnosis for rapid progressors. This study aims to analyze a large echocardiographic dataset with longitudinal follow-up to identify risk factors for rapid AS progression, ultimately supporting individualized surveillance strategies based on patient-specific risk profiles. Methods: This retrospective study included patients with serial echocardiograms between 2011 and 2021. A natural language processing algorithm was developed to extract AS severity from each report. Rapid AS progression was defined as an increase in Vmax of ≥0.3 m/s per year, and severe AS was defined as Vmax ≥4.0 m/s. Multivariable logistic regression models were constructed to evaluate clinical factors associated with rapid progression. Results: The study included 24,821 patients with borderline, mild, or moderate AS. Mean follow-up was 4.1 years. 2,492 patients experienced rapid AS progression and 1,998 progressed to severe AS. Factors associated with rapid progression included older age (OR 1.12, 95% CI 1.07–1.18), male sex (OR 1.18, 95% CI 1.08–1.29), renal disease (OR 1.13, 95% CI 1.03–1.24), liver disease (OR 1.25, 95% CI 1.06–1.47), and anemia (OR 1.19, 95% CI 1.02–1.38) while coronary artery disease was associated with a lower risk (OR 0.76, 95% CI 0.68–0.84). Among racial and ethnic groups, white patients had the highest risk of rapid AS progression. Conclusion: Approximately 10% of patients studied experienced rapid disease progression. Older age, male sex, white race, and clinical factors such as renal disease, liver disease, and anemia were associated with rapid AS progression. These patients may benefit from closer follow-up and shorter echocardiographic surveillance intervals. This work lays the foundation for developing a personalized risk score to inform patient-specific surveillance intervals based on individual risk profiles."

In younger patients, it often reflects complex systemic pathology. Case Presentation: A 44-year-old male presented with central, burning chest pain that worsened when lying flat and improved when upright, shortly after a dialysate adjustment and suspected leakage. His relevant history included cocaine-associated NSTEMI at age 22, non-ischemic cardiomyopathy with LVEF 30% diagnosed at age 39, and ESRD secondary to proliferative glomerulonephritis with monoclonal deposits. He underwent kidney transplant at age 27 but resumed peritoneal dialysis by age 29. Investigations: Coronary angiography revealed new triple-vessel CAD. Echocardiography showed LVEF 35%, moderately reduced RV function, low-flow low-gradient aortic stenosis, moderate-to-severe mitral annular calcification (MAC), mild mitral stenosis, and pulmonary hypertension. Non-contrast ECG-gated cardiac CT showed a 25 × 62 mm calcified apical mass, diffuse coronary and vascular calcifications, pleural calcifications, calcified pulmonary nodules, and dramatic “toothpaste-like” MAC suggestive of caseous transformation. Management: Despite extensive structural disease, the patient remained hemodynamically stable. A multidisciplinary heart team—including general cardiology, heart failure, and cardiothoracic surgery—guided evaluation. CT surgery was consulted for CABG consideration; further workup included a PET-FDG scan for myocardial viability. Pericardiectomy was discussed due to concern for constrictive pericarditis in the setting of pericardial calcifications, though right heart catheterization did not show hemodynamic findings of constriction. Ultimately, CABG was deferred due to patient stability and preference to delay intervention. Medical therapy included heparin, dual antiplatelet therapy, statin initiation, and renal-adjusted guideline-directed heart failure treatment. Conclusion: This case highlights extreme cardiovascular and extraosseous calcification in a young patient with ESRD and chronic heart failure. The “toothpaste” appearance of the mitral annulus suggests caseous transformation, a rare MAC variant. While vascular calcification is common in ESRD, this represents a severe form of CKD–mineral bone disorder. Multidisciplinary care is essential in managing overlapping cardiac, renal, and metabolic conditions, and in guiding personalized risk stratification."
OpenAlex,valvular heart disease,Abstract 4366354: Unmasking Risk: Clinical Outcomes of Moderate Aortic Stenosis with Concomitant Mitral Regurgitation—A Cardiac MRI-Based Evaluation,El‐Moatasem Gabr; Mianli Xiao; Mujtaba Saeed; Amr Darwish; Akila Bersali; Aneesh Dhore; Edward A. Graviss; Maan Malahfji; Dipan J. Shah,10.1161/circ.152.suppl_3.4366354,2025-11-03,Circulation,"Objective: The clinical trajectory of patients with moderate aortic stenosis (AS) complicated by concomitant mitral regurgitation (MR) remains poorly defined. While management strategies in severe AS are well established, patients with moderate AS and MR often fall below guideline-based thresholds for intervention despite symptoms and remodeling. We used cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR)—a robust modality for accurate valve quantification, particularly in mixed valvular disease— to assess the prognostic impact of MR in moderate AS and to compare the outcomes to patients with severe AS. Methods: We analyzed consecutive patients from the DeBakey CMR Registry (2008–2023) with ≥moderate AS on clinically indicated CMR. Exclusions included &gt;mild aortic regurgitation or mitral stenosis, subaortic obstruction, infiltrative cardiomyopathies, pre-capillary pulmonary hypertension, advanced malignancy, or unavailable follow-up. Patients were stratified by AS severity (moderate vs. severe) and MR grade (&lt;moderate vs. ≥moderate), with valve severity assessed per current CMR guidelines. The primary outcome was a composite of cardiovascular death or heart failure hospitalization. Statistical analysis was performed in R (Vienna, Austria), with significance defined as p&lt;0.05. Results: In a multivariate Cox regression analysis of 422 patients with moderate AS, both mitral regurgitant (MR) fraction on CMR (hazard ratio [HR] per 5% increase: 1.10; 95% CI: 1.04–1.16; P &lt; 0.001) and the presence of ≥ moderate MR (HR: 1.86; 95% CI: 1.31–2.65; P &lt; 0.001) were independently associated with the composite outcome (Table 1). In moderate AS, penalized spline regression analysis showed a statistically significant increase in risk with increasing MR fraction (P&lt;0.001 for linearity; P=0.028 for non-linearity; Figure 1). Kaplan-Meier curves demonstrated poorer 3-year event-free survival in patients with moderate AS and concomitant ≥moderate MR (33%) compared with both isolated severe AS (71%) and severe AS with ≥moderate MR (49%) (Figure 2). Conclusion: In moderate AS, concomitant MR is an independent predictor of adverse clinical composite outcomes. Patients with moderate AS and ≥moderate MR had worse composite outcomes than those with isolated severe AS, underscoring the additive risk of dual-valve pathology. These findings support more vigilant monitoring and may justify re-evaluation of treatment thresholds in this mixed valvular disease subgroup."
OpenAlex,valvular heart disease,Abstract 4370895: Combined left- and right-sided native valve infective endocarditis with no predisposing risk factors or intracardiac shunt,Diana Inshyna; Abdul Hakim Almakadma; Farzane Saeidifard,10.1161/circ.152.suppl_3.4370895,2025-11-03,Circulation,"Combined left and right-sided Infective Endocarditis (IE) is rare and typically occurs with underlying predisposing factors such as intravenous drug use, presence of hemodialysis catheters, congenital defects, and intracardiac devices. We present a 62-year-old woman with diabetes, hypertension, and severe peripheral vascular disease, diagnosed with combined left- and right-sided native valve IE despite lack of typical underlying risk factors. She presented with altered mental status and sepsis; blood cultures were positive for Streptococcus group G . Initial transthoracic echocardiogram revealed an 8 mm echogenicity on the atrial aspect of the mitral valve. Subsequently, a transesophageal echocardiogram was performed, revealing a large (2 x 0.9 cm) highly mobile mass on the anterior leaflet of the mitral valve with mild to moderate mitral regurgitation (Figures 1,2) ; additionally, a small size (0.9 x 0.7 cm) highly mobile mass was seen on the tricuspid valve with mild tricuspid regurgitation ( Figures 1,3 ), meeting criteria for combined left- and right-sided infective endocarditis. The patient was assessed by the cardiothoracic team, and due to presence of multiple comorbidities the risk of surgery was deemed to outweigh the benefits for valve replacement or repair. Therefore, she was treated medically with broad-spectrum antibiotics with subsequent significant improvement and did not develop any complications throughout her hospital stay. IE has an incidence of 3–10 cases per 100,000 annually in developed countries, with Staphylococcus aureus as the most common pathogen. Tricuspid valve IE accounts for 5–10% of cases. Although rare, combined left and right-sided IE can develop without underlying risk factors as in our clinical case. Multivalvular IE also poses greater risk for severe complications, including valvular dysfunction, heart failure, abscess formation, and conduction abnormalities, as well as systemic and pulmonary embolization, contributing to high morbidity. This case illustrates the importance of early diagnosis and individualized treatment in rare presentations of combined IE. It highlights that conservative, non-surgical management can be effective in select patients and supports the need for further research to guide treatment strategies in complex IE cases."
