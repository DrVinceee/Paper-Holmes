PubMed,aortic stenosis,FlowVN Trained on a Single Dataset Enables Rapid Reconstruction of Highly Accelerated 4D Flow MRI Across Multiple Sites.,Sohaib Ayaz Qazi; Tamara Bianchessi; Federica Viola; Chiara Trenti; Erik Ylipää; Tino Ebbers; Petter Dyverfeldt,10.1002/mrm.70317,2026-02-26,Magnetic resonance in medicine,"The aim of this study is to evaluate a deep variational network, FlowVN, for the reconstruction of heavily undersampled 4D Flow MRI across multiple sites.
FlowVN was trained on fully sampled 4D Flow MRI datasets of healthy volunteers from one site. The model was tested on retrospective undersampled data (R = 6-22) of six normal volunteers from the same site and six from another site, prospectively undersampled data (R = 12.4-13.8) of six healthy volunteers from the second site and six patients with aortic stenosis from first Site. Performance was evaluated using nRMSE, relative and angular error, average and maximum velocity, flow rate, volumetric flow, and turbulent kinetic energy (TKE), with a Wilcoxon signed-rank test to assess the difference from ground truth.
FlowVN showed minimal sensitivity to the number of training datasets and performed well even when trained on a single dataset. FlowVN also demonstrated good generalizability across sites. No significant difference in average and maximum velocity was observed up to R = 16. Total TKE was preserved up to R = 10 in the normal volunteers, but was well preserved even at higher acceleration factors in the aortic stenosis patients. Flow volumes through the ascending and descending aorta were well preserved for all acceleration factors, although ascending aorta flow volumes for data from one site were significantly different from ground truth for AF > 16.
FlowVN accurately reconstructs highly undersampled 4D Flow MRI from multiple sites using a model trained on a single dataset, maintaining excellent quantitative image quality even at very high acceleration factors."

While hypertension often coexists with aortic stenosis, the long-term effects of transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) on blood pressure (BP), the predictors of BP changes, and their prognostic significance remain incompletely understood.
We conducted a retrospective cohort study of 1333 patients who underwent TAVI at Sheba Medical Centre between 2008 and 2023. Changes in SBP and DBP were divided into quintiles (lowest, intermediate, and highest) and assessed for associations with all-cause mortality using Kaplan-Meier survival curves and Cox proportional hazards models, adjusted for clinical and echocardiographic variables. Multinomial logistic regression identified predictors of BP changes.
The mean age was 81 years; 50% were men, and 73% had preexisting hypertension. Mean baseline SBP and DBP were 135 and 69 mmHg, respectively. Post-TAVI, SBP increased in 53% of patients, and DBP in 47%. Over a median follow-up of 4.6 years, higher post-TAVI SBP and DBP were independently associated with improved survival, after adjustment for clinical and echocardiographic confounders. Lower baseline left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) predicted increased SBP (P < 0.001), and female sex predicted increased DBP (P < 0.001). Preexisting hypertension did not predict BP changes.
Post-TAVI BP elevation is linked to better long-term survival, especially among patients with reduced baseline LVEF, and may reflect a beneficial hemodynamic response rather than comorbidity. Lower baseline LVEF and female sex are independent predictors of this response. These findings support permissive management of BP changes post-TAVI to improve patient outcomes."

Their effect in patients undergoing transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) for severe aortic stenosis (AS), however, remains unclear. This study evaluated whether SGLT2 inhibitors reduce all-cause mortality and HF hospitalisations after TAVR.
A systematic search of PubMed, ScienceDirect, Cochrane (CENTRAL), Scopus and Embase was performed through April 2025 for studies comparing post-TAVR outcomes between SGLT2 inhibitor users and non-users. Outcomes of interest included a composite of all-cause mortality or heart failure (HF) hospitalisation, along with the individual components of all-cause mortality and HF hospitalisation. All outcomes were extracted at 1 year. Pooled hazard ratios (HRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated using a random-effects model. Heterogeneity was quantified using I2 statistics. Analyses were conducted in R (version 4.4.2).
Three studies (1 RCT, 2 Observational) comprising 3187 patients met inclusion criteria. SGLT2 inhibitor use was associated with a reduced risk of the composite outcome (HR: 0.75; 95% CI: 0.65, 0.86; p < 0.01). Individually, therapy lowered all-cause mortality (HR: 0.72; 95% CI: 0.53, 0.96; p = 0.03) and HF hospitalisations (HR: 0.74; 95% CI: 0.61, 0.90; p < 0.01).
In patients with severe AS undergoing TAVR, SGLT2 inhibitors were associated with significant reductions in all-cause mortality and HF hospitalisations. These findings suggest a promising role for SGLT2 inhibitors in improving post-TAVR outcomes. However, given the limited data, larger randomised clinical trials are necessary to consolidate these findings.

PubMed,aortic stenosis,Cardiopulmonary bypass is safe and effective support for concomitant high-risk percutaneous coronary intervention and transcatheter aortic valve replacement.,Axel Gomez; Madison E Matthews; Aaron Grober; Ryan Ferreira; Kendrick A Shunk; Jeffrey Zimmet; Elaine E Tseng; Marko T Boskovski,10.25270/jic/25.00352,2026-02-23,The Journal of invasive cardiology,"Patients with coexisting severe aortic stenosis (AS) and critical coronary artery disease (CAD) face high procedural risk when treated percutaneously. Although mechanical circulatory support (MCS) can mitigate hemodynamic instability, evidence guiding the use of cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) during concomitant transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) and percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) is lacking.
The authors retrospectively reviewed 6 high-risk patients who underwent concomitant TAVR and PCI with planned MCS using CPB or venoarterial (VA)-ECMO between 2015 and 2023. Outcomes were classified according to VARC-3 criteria.
Six male patients (mean age 77.3 ± 8.3 years) underwent concomitant TAVR and PCI with planned MCS using CPB (n = 4, 2015-2020) or VA-ECMO (n = 2, 2022-2023). Complete coronary revascularization was achieved in 4 cases (66.7%). Implanted valves included 2 self-expanding and 4 balloon-expandable prostheses. The mean catheter-measured transaortic gradient decreased from 37.2 ± 17.6 mm Hg to 3.9 ± 2.1 mm Hg (P = .006). Trace (1+) paravalvular leak occurred in 4 patients (66.7%), with none 2+ or higher. There were no intraprocedural complications, neurologic events, major bleeding, vascular complications, or 30-day deaths. Three patients (50%) developed new conduction abnormalities, all without pacemaker requirement. Acute kidney injury occurred in 3 (Stage I, 50%). The mean intensive care and total hospital stays were 5.5 ± 3.5 and 8.3 ± 6.0 days, respectively.
Planned CPB or VA-ECMO support enabled safe performance of concomitant TAVR and PCI in non-surgical, high-risk patients, representing a feasible approach for selected complex cases."

Aortic valve replacement (AVR) with a biological prosthesis has become highly popular and commonly used. This study aims to assess long-term outcomes after biological AVR with regard to structural and non-structural deterioration.
In this single-centre retrospective study, 918 patients undergoing surgical AVR with a biological prosthesis at the University Hospital Frankfurt from January 2006 to July 2009 were included. The primary endpoints were freedom from reoperation and from structural and non-structural deterioration, and the secondary was long-term survival. Follow-up was completed in 95.6% with a median of 7.6 years, accounting 6610 patient-years. The mean age was 74.9 years and a median EuroSCORE II (range) was 3.34 (0.77-62.4). Twenty-two percent of surgeries were either emergent or urgent. Many patients had concomitant surgery, while coronary artery bypass grafting in 45.3% of patients was the most common. Three prosthetic valve models were used in our patient population: Carpentier Edwards Perimount (CEP) Model 2900, Model 3000 and Medtronic Mosaic (MM).
Reoperation occurred in 36 patients (3.9%) due to endocarditis (2.0%), aortic root aneurysm (0.1%), isolated or combined aortic stenosis or aortic regurgitation (1.9%). Freedom from reoperation at 5, 10 and 15 years was 97 ± 0.6%, 95.6 ± 0.8% and 90.3 ± 2.3%, respectively. Freedom from major stroke at 5, 10 and 15 years was 97.9 ± 0.0%, 96.4 ± 0.8%, and 96.1 ± 0.08%, and freedom from major bleeding event at 5, 10 and 15 years was 98.5 ± 0.4%, 95.7 ± 0.9% and 92.7 ± 2.2%, respectively. A subgroup analysis of the Carpentier Edwards (CEP) valves and the Medtronic Mosaic (MM) valves showed no significant differences regarding the primary endpoints. The overall survival at 5, 10 and 15 years was 67 ± 1.7%, 39.8 ± 1.8%, and 15.1 ± 2.2% respectively. The Kaplan-Meier survival estimator was 96 ± 2.2 months.
This study showed a good long-term survival of surgical AVR with biological prostheses in relatively high-risk and elderly patient population. All biological prosthetic valves showed good long-term durability with low levels of complications and reoperations. The different models did not show any significant differences. Surgical AVR remains a valuable therapeutic option even though transcatheter aortic valve implantation has been greatly expanded since its introduction."
PubMed,aortic stenosis,Sex-Related Differences in Prosthesis-Patient Mismatch Following Aortic Valve Replacement with Perceval Sutureless Valve.,Ali Aljalloud; Yusuf Shieba; Rashad Zayat; Ajay Moza; Ahmed Farghal Ahmed Mohammed,10.3390/jcdd13020071,2026-01-31,Journal of cardiovascular development and disease,"(1) Background: Prosthesis-patient mismatch (PPM) after aortic valve replacement (AVR) impairs left ventricular (LV) recovery and is more common in women due to smaller aortic dimensions. Although the Perceval sutureless valve provides larger effective orifice areas, sex-specific PPM outcomes remain unclear. This study evaluated sex-related differences in PPM incidence, severity, and early impact after Perceval AVR. (2) Methods: We retrospectively analyzed 139 patients (68 males, 71 females) who underwent Perceval AVR between 2016 and 2020. PPM was defined per Valve Academic Research Consortium-3 (VARC-3) criteria using indexed effective orifice area (EOAi) and stratified by body-mass-index (BMI) (<30 vs. ≥30 kg/m2). Echocardiography assessed hemodynamic performance. (3) Results: PPM was markedly more frequent in women than men (74.6% vs. 22.1%, p < 0.001). Among non-obese patients, 47.9% of females versus 16.2% of males developed PPM (p < 0.001). Women received smaller valves and consistently exhibited lower EOAi despite similar gradients. Postoperatively, females had reduced EOAi (0.8 vs. 0.9 cm2/m2, p < 0.001) but higher LV ejection fraction (55.8% vs. 49.5%, p = 0.004). Early clinical outcomes were comparable between sexes. (4) Conclusions: Despite favorable hemodynamics of sutureless AVR, anatomical sex differences result in persistently higher PPM rates in women, predominantly of moderate severity. Tailored strategies-including aortic root enlargement and sex-specific EOAi thresholds-may improve prosthesis selection and outcomes in female patients."

This review synthesizes current understanding of Lp(a) molecular architecture, genetics, and metabolism, and integrates mechanistic evidence linking Lp(a) to pro-atherogenic, pro-inflammatory, and pro-thrombotic pathways. We summarize epidemiological and genetic data associating Lp(a) with a broad spectrum of cardiovascular outcomes and discuss current clinical guidelines on screening and risk stratification. Furthermore, we provide an up-to-date overview of the emerging therapeutic landscape, including RNA-targeted therapies and novel oral small molecules. With pivotal phase 3 outcome trials nearing completion, the field is transitioning from viewing Lp(a) as an untreatable biomarker to an actionable therapeutic target, with important implications for precision cardiovascular prevention."

Case reports,"An 86-year-old woman with a history of hypertension, atrial fibrillation, and lacunar cerebral infarction underwent transcatheter aortic valve implantation for symptomatic severe aortic stenosis using a 23-mm SAPIEN 3 Ultra RESILIA valve (Edwards Lifesciences). As the prosthetic valve traversed a 14-F Edwards eSheath+, it sheared off the distal tip of the sheath, which became affixed to the valve. The adherent tip remained attached throughout balloon expansion and deployment, thereby impeding full expansion and producing an atypical funnel-shaped configuration. With continued balloon inflation and sustained pressure, complete expansion was achieved, and the prosthetic valve was deployed without incident. TAKE-HOME MESSAGE: If the SAPIEN 3 Ultra RESILIA traverses the eSheath+ into the aorta with marked resistance, promptly confirm that the sheath's distal tip component has not remained affixed to the distal end of the prosthesis."

With the 2025 ESC/EACTS Guidelines lowering the age threshold for TAVI to 70 years, the focus has shifted from short-term survival to lifetime management, necessitating rigorous evaluation of device durability, coronary access, and biological valve degeneration. This review synthesizes the latest evidence-based strategies for TAVI, contrasting randomized trial data with long-term registry findings. We critically analyze the hemodynamic trade-offs between self-expandable valves and balloon-expandable valves, particularly in patients with small aortic annuli, where SEVs demonstrate superior indexed effective orifice areas and reduced rates of patient-prosthesis mismatch (SMALL-TAVI registry). We further examine the expansion of indications into complex anatomical subsets, including bicuspid aortic valves (BIVOLUTX, STABILITY) and pure aortic regurgitation, where dedicated anchoring mechanisms are required to mitigate the risk of valve migration. Procedural optimization is addressed through the ""minimalist"" TAVI pathway (BENCHMARK registry), which emphasizes conscious sedation and ultrasound-guided vascular access to reduce length of stay without compromising safety. Finally, we discuss emerging biomarkers (MMP-3, osteopontin) and the role of epicardial adipose tissue as novel predictors of structural valve deterioration, signaling a potential shift toward biological modulation of valvular disease."

This study aims to evaluate the effects of concomitant mitral regurgitation (MR) on myocardial work parameters in patients with severe aortic stenosis (AS) undergoing transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI).
A prospective registry study was conducted on 95 consecutive patients with severe AS, 28% of whom had moderate to severe MR. Echocardiographic data, including GLS and myocardial work parameters (global constructive work [GCW], global wasted work [GWW], and global work efficiency [GWE]), were collected prior to TAVI.
While GLS values did not significantly differ between MR severity groups, GCW and GWE showed significant variation. The lowest GCW values were observed in patients with severe MR (1483.3 ±282.7 mm Hg%) and the highest in those with moderate MR (2114.9 ±534.6 mm Hg%) (p = 0.01). Similarly, lower GWE values were observed in patients with severe MR compared to the other groups (p = 0.02). No significant differences were found for GWW (p = 0.21).
The findings suggest that while GLS remains relatively consistent across different MR severity groups, GCW and GWE tend to decrease in patients with severe MR. This observation may indicate that GCW is a more responsive marker of myocardial function in the presence of concomitant MR."

However, transcatheter closure is rare in adults, especially in developed countries, as most ducts are typically closed in childhood. PDA in adults poses unique challenges due to age-related comorbidities and some morphological changes in PDA that occur with advanced age. This study analyzes the safety and procedural success of adult PDA transcatheter closure.
A retrospective single-center study analyzed 184 adult PDA device closures between July 2015 and July 2024. The study examined patient demographics, clinical aspects, procedural details, and immediate hospital outcomes. Outcome parameters focused on procedural success, complications, residual shunt, and improvement in symptoms.
Out of 184 patients, 183 adults with a mean age of 27 ± 13 years and a mean weight of 52 ± 16.5 kg underwent PDA device occlusion. Most patients were referred for evaluation of a murmur (n = 116, 63.3%). The most common comorbidity was type 2 diabetes mellitus (n = 20, 10.9%). The mean PDA diameter at its narrowest end was 6.17 ± 4.56 mm (1.2-17 mm). In total, 6.55% of patients exhibited duct calcification, and 2.73% presented with a PDA aneurysm. Severe pulmonary hypertension was present in 24 patients. Transcatheter intervention achieved a 100% success rate at 24 h postprocedure, with no residual flows at the 6-month follow-up. There was no mortality, device embolization, or aortic/pulmonary artery stenosis.
Percutaneous device closure is a safe and successful treatment option for PDA in adults."

Cardiovascular interventions,"Valve underexpansion and foreshortening play an important role in hemodynamic performance and durability after transcatheter aortic valve replacement. The effect of routine postdilatation of balloon-expandable valves is controversial and unknown with the latest generation SAPIEN 3 Ultra RESILIA (S3UR).
The aim of this study was to report the impact of routine postdilatation of the S3UR on frame expansion, foreshortening and short-term outcomes.
From January 2024 to March 2025, 206 consecutive patients undergoing S3UR transcatheter aortic valve replacement for native aortic stenosis were screened, and 200 patients with routine postdilatation were included, with a median follow-up of 30 days. The valve was predilated in 23% of patients (46 of 200) and postdilated for frame optimization in 100% (200 of 200). Frame dimensions were measured on fluoroscopy at different levels after deployment and after postdilatation. Valve expansion and foreshortening were calculated by comparing observed measurements with expected nominal measurements validated from previous studies.
Routine postdilatation was safe and effective, with no in-hospital adverse events. All S3UR valves were significantly underexpanded, especially at midframe, irrespective of size, and had significant expansion and foreshortening after postdilatation. At 30 days, the rate of all-cause mortality was 1.5% (3 of 200), the rate of stroke was 3.0% (6 of 200), the mean valve gradient was 10.7 ± 4.2 mm Hg, and no patients had greater than mild paravalvular leak.
Routine postdilatation of the latest generation balloon-expandable valve, when clinically and anatomically feasible, appeared safe and improved frame expansion and foreshortening. Larger studies are needed to validate this finding and determine the longer term impact of routine postdilatation, despite acceptable short-term hemodynamic performance."

We developed a county-level mismatch score measuring the gap between actual TAVR procedures performed and expected need based on population differences. Counties were classified as metropolitan, semi-urban, or rural. Factors associated with larger mismatches were identified, and mortality rates among AS patients were examined in relation to mismatch scores.
We analyzed Medicare data from 2016-2022 across 3,129 US counties. The mismatch score was developed to account for population differences and county urbanicity classification. Statistical analyses identified factors associated with TAVR mismatch and its relationship to mortality outcomes.
We found substantial geographic variation in TAVR delivery. Counties with higher TAVR mismatch scores showed associations with fewer TAVR-providing hospitals, less market concentration, higher AS prevalence, and lower household incomes. Counties with greater gaps between needed and actual TAVR procedures were also associated with higher mortality rates. This relationship between mismatch and mortality was particularly strong in semi-urban counties.
Our findings identify associations between TAVR access gaps and patient outcomes, as well as factors linked to these access patterns. Counties with higher TAVR mismatch scores showed correlations with healthcare capacity constraints, geographic location, and socioeconomic factors. These associations suggest that mismatches may be addressed through targeted approaches based on local needs to improve care delivery for patients with AS in regions currently experiencing access challenges."

We aimed to identify risk factors, clinical and imaging features of spontaneous IAD (sIAD) using a case-control design.
We collected data on sIAD patients admitted to Tongji Hospital in Wuhan, China from June 2017 to June 2024. Non-IAD ischemic stroke (IS) and non-IAD intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) patients served as control groups. Logistic regression models analyzed the three data sets, with results expressed as odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence interval (CI).
After screening, 71 patients with sIAD, 84 patients with non-IAD IS and 102 patients with non-IAD ICH were included in this study. The findings showed that the participants with diabetes had a lower likelihood of sIAD than non-IAD IS (OR = 0.145, 95%CI = 0.030-0.702). Compared with non-IAD ICH patients, individuals with sIAD had lower systolic blood pressure on admission (OR = 0.941, 95%CI = 0.900-0.983) and less likely to be young (OR = 0.911, 95%CI = 0.855-0.970). Serological data showed that compared with non-IAD ICH patients, elevated triglyceride (OR = 0.326, 95%CI = 0.179-0.594) were associated with the reduced likelihood of sIAD, whereas the opposite was true for uric acid levels (OR = 1.007, 95%CI = 1.000-1.014). In imaging, sIAD patients showed the largest number of arterial lumen dilatation, followed by stenosis with dilatation.
Diabetes may be associated with a reduced likelihood of sIAD. Differences in serologic markers may help in the differential diagnosis of sIAD from other cerebrovascular events."

Currently, there are no effective treatments to prevent or reverse calcification, emphasizing the urgent need for robust preclinical models to help identify therapeutic targets and strategies.
Preclinical models for vascular and valvular calcification should accurately reflect human disease pathology and progression, ideally including the influence of key underlying conditions and diseases (age, diabetes, renal disease, and hyperlipidemia), as well as sexual dimorphism, each of which may require a different model. Standardized and reproducible end points are essential, with preference for assessments that align with clinically utilized modalities (eg, computed tomography and echocardiography).
Murine models of cardiovascular calcification described herein have contributed substantially to our understanding of cardiovascular calcification though the translation toward clinically impactful therapies has, thus far, been limited. Improving clinical translation demands the use of models that replicate human comorbidities, disease progression, and outcomes. Further development of improved models, particularly those that demonstrate clinically important features such as plaque rupture, will facilitate effective translation of therapeutic strategies to clinical practice."

Short membranous septal length (MSL) has been linked to post-TAVR conduction abnormalities, but its prognostic significance is unclear. We retrospectively analyzed 258 patients who underwent transfemoral TAVR. MSL was measured on contrast-enhanced CT, and left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) was assessed at baseline, 1 week, and 1 year. The primary endpoint was all-cause mortality; secondary was a composite of mortality or heart failure hospitalization. Patients were classified by MSL ≤ 6 mm or > 6 mm. The short MSL group had higher rates of new-onset LBBB (p = 0.047), mortality (p = 0.046), and the composite endpoint (p = 0.039).

LVEF recovery at 1 year was significantly impaired (p = 0.035), and these findings persisted after excluding patients with LBBB or pacemaker implantation. Incorporating MSL ≤ 6 mm into a model with established risk factors improved discrimination for mortality (AUC 0.72 vs 0.67, p = 0.042; cfNRI 0.33). Short MSL was associated with impaired LVEF recovery and adverse outcomes after TAVR. MSL may serve as a simple CT-based marker for preprocedural risk stratification."

Advances,"The incidence of transthyretin wild-type amyloid cardiomyopathy (ATTRwt-CM) is increasing. Previous findings suggest an association between mechanical stress and ATTRwt-CM.
This study aimed to assess differences in employment history, occupational mechanical exposures, comorbidity, and mortality between patients with ATTRwt-CM compared with a matched general population cohort.
Patients diagnosed with ATTRwt-CM between 2016 and 2023 were matched 1:5 by age and sex with controls randomly selected from the Danish general population. Outcomes were minimum 3 years of previous agricultural or other general physical demanding employment, predicted median upper and lower body mechanical exposures, and cardiovascular and all-cause mortality. Conditional Poisson regression was used to estimate incidence rate ratios (IRRs).
A total of 258 patients with ATTRwt-CM were matched with 1,290 controls. ATTRwt-CM patients had a higher prevalence of cardiovascular comorbidities (atrial fibrillation and aortic stenosis) and orthopedic conditions (carpal tunnel syndrome, lumbar spinal stenosis, and lower limb arthrosis). Agricultural employment (28% vs 8%; IRR: 3.35; 95% CI: 2.55-4.39) and greater upper body mechanical workload exposures were more common among patients with ATTRwt-CM than among controls. Three-year cardiovascular mortality (13% vs 5%; IRR: 3.38; 95% CI: 1.97-5.83) and all-cause mortality (33% vs 21%; IRR: 1.93; 95% CI: 1.48-2.50) were higher in patients with ATTRwt-CM.
ATTRwt-CM was associated with greater occupational upper-body mechanical stress. While a causal relationship cannot be established due to study design, the results are hypothesis generating for the development of ATTRwt-CM. Additionally, ATTRwt-CM patients had a greater burden of orthopedic and cardiovascular comorbidities including increased cardiovascular mortality."

The diagnosis of an inherited cardiomyopathy has major implications for medical care of patients and relatives. We report the results of a genotype-phenotype analysis of DCM investigated in Austria.
194 patients with DCM underwent genetic testing over a period of 6 years. We analyzed the clinical and genetic characteristics of 105 DCM patients who showed a genetic variant, and compared the genetic findings and outcome measures of patients with inflammation on endomyocardial biopsy and those without.
In 51.4% (54/105) patients at least one likely pathogenic or pathogenic genetic variant (LP/P) was detected. 51 of 105 patients (48.6%) showed only variants of unknown significance (VUS). Most LP/P variants (34,3%) were detected in the TTN gene. Clinical characteristics of the most prevalent genetic subgroups (TTN, LMNA, MYH7, MYH6, DMD, SCN5A) were not significantly different. DCM patients with inflammation had significantly higher frequency of memory of infection, left bundle branch block, mitral valve insufficiency, but normal CK-MB levels. We added a case report where two family members initially were considered to have an inflammatory cardiomyopathy before a pathogenic variant in LMNA was found.
Cardiac features of DCM were not predictive of a specific genetic subgroup. We recommend applying multigene panels extensively, since a large proportion of patients without a family history or evidence of inflammation showed a genetic predisposition for DCM. However, the large number of VUS remains a challenge."

This review aims to evaluate how BA dysmetabolism acts as a central pathogenic factor in canine and feline disease. We analyze the BA pool's integrity, which depends on a specialized functional guild, primarily Peptacetobacter hiranonis, responsible for 7α-dehydroxylation. We delineate two principal pathological profiles: (1) microbial collapse, characterized by secondary bile acid (SBA) depletion and compromised farnesoid X receptor (FXR) and Takeda G protein-coupled receptor 5 (TGR5) signaling, which exacerbates inflammation in chronic enteropathy (CE), protein-losing enteropathy (PLE), and exocrine pancreatic insufficiency (EPI); and (2) hepato-biliary spillover, wherein host-induced dysfunction results in primary bile acid (PBA) excess. Recent data have linked these disruptions to skeletal health, feline renal fibrosis, cardiac remodeling in myxomatous mitral valve disease (MMVD), and neuroinflammation in epilepsy and hepatic encephalopathy. The discovery of microbially conjugated bile acids (MCBAs) and microbial extracellular vesicles (MEVs) reveals highly specific, vesicle-mediated communication pathways impacting systemic health. Diagnostic protocols should prioritize functional profiling, including the dysbiosis index (DI), serum conjugated BA analysis, and SBA/PBA ratios. Clinical management is moving beyond empirical fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT), towards precision synthetic microbial consortia (SynComs), neuroprotective BAs like tauroursodeoxycholic acid (TUDCA), and molecular postbiotics to restore the collaborative metabolome."

This study evaluated quantitative MR parameters individually and within a multiparametric framework using three-dimensional (3D) vena contracta area (VCA) as an intraoperative reference. In this single-center retrospective analysis, intraoperative echocardiographic data from 85 patients undergoing mitral valve intervention between July 2024 and June 2025 were analyzed. Regurgitant volume (RVol) and regurgitant fraction (RF) were quantified using two-dimensional proximal isovelocity surface area (PISA), a 3D volumetric method, and a Doppler-based continuity equation. Agreement was assessed by Bland-Altman analysis, and categorical concordance was assessed by Cohen's kappa for individual and multiparametric grading strategies. Agreement between individual quantitative methods was limited, with substantial bias and wide limits of agreement for both RVol and RF, resulting in poor-to-fair concordance for MR severity classification. Incorporation of RVol and RF into multiparametric grading strategies improved concordance. Compared with 3D VCA, multiparametric integration incorporating PISA-derived measures showed the best overall performance, with high accuracy and sensitivity and moderate specificity. These findings indicate limited interchangeability of standalone quantitative echocardiographic methods and support reporting the applied technique and using a multiparametric approach anchored to 3D VCA when cardiac magnetic resonance imaging is unavailable."

The C-reactive protein-albumin-lymphocyte (CALLY) index is a novel immunonutritional biomarker that integrates these pathophysiological domains; however, its prognostic value in TAVI patients has not yet been investigated. This study aimed to evaluate the association between the CALLY index and 1-year mortality after TAVI.
This retrospective observational study included 532 consecutive patients who underwent TAVI at a tertiary-care center between 2014 and 2023. Baseline laboratory parameters were obtained before the procedure, and the CALLY index was calculated as (albumin × lymphocyte count)/(C-reactive protein × 10). The primary endpoint was 1-year mortality. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis was performed to assess the discriminative ability of the CALLY index and conventional surgical risk scores. Multivariable regression analyses were used to identify independent predictors of mortality.
During the 1-year follow-up period, 85 patients (15.9%) died. Patients who died had significantly lower baseline CALLY index values compared to survivors (p < 0.001). The CALLY index demonstrated good discriminative performance for 1-year mortality (AUC: 0.797), outperforming EuroSCORE II (AUC: 0.705) and the Society of Thoracic Surgeons (STS) score (AUC: 0.619). A CALLY cut-off value of 0.45, derived using Youden's index, was associated with a more than threefold increased risk of mortality. In multivariable analysis, the CALLY index remained independently associated with 1-year mortality, along with EuroSCORE II and more than mild mitral regurgitation.
The CALLY index is a strong and independent predictor of 1-year mortality after TAVI and provides incremental prognostic value beyond conventional surgical risk scores. Given its simplicity and reliance on routinely available laboratory parameters, the CALLY index may serve as a practical tool for long-term risk stratification in patients undergoing TAVI."

Emerging evidence now implicates valvular leaflets as active contributors rather than passive bystanders in FVR pathogenesis. Systematic investigations into leaflet-specific pathomechanisms remain absent for major FVR subtypes, particularly functional mitral regurgitation (FMR) and functional tricuspid regurgitation (FTR).
The association of FVR with clinical parameters was analyzed in a heart transplantation cohort. Comprehensive microscopic pathology evaluated fibrotic remodeling in mild, moderate, and severe FMR/FTR leaflets, validated in an independent bulk RNA sequencing cohort (FMR/FTR: n=41 each). Single-cell RNA sequencing was performed on 19 FVR leaflets (FMR: 3 mild/2 moderate/3 severe; FTR: 5 mild/3 moderate/3 severe). Subsequent analyses (cluster annotation, cellular proportions, trajectory inference, and cell-cell communication) explored cellular mechanisms of fibrotic remodeling in FVR, focusing on unique and shared changes between FMR and FTR. Histopathology and bulk transcriptomics validated single-cell RNA sequencing findings. Primary valvular endothelial cells and valvular interstitial cells from FVR patients underwent pharmacological intervention. A monocrotaline-induced rat pulmonary hypertension model established FTR, followed by pharmacological treatment to assess leaflet-directed therapy efficacy.
Fibrotic leaflet remodeling scores independently predicted FMR/FTR severity with high precision and significantly improved prediction beyond anatomic anomalies. Fibrotic remodeling showed divergent mechanisms between FMR and FTR. In FMR, suppressed retinoic acid metabolism drove antifibrotic-to-neutral valvular interstitial cell transition. In FTR, impaired IFN (interferon) signaling promoted antifibrotic-to-profibrotic valvular interstitial cell transdifferentiation, worsened by endothelial-to-mesenchymal transition-derived profibrotic valvular endothelial cells. Targeted PDK4 (pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 4) upregulation or IFN signaling activation reduced FTR severity in vitro and in vivo.
Leaflet-specific organic fibrotic remodeling actively involves FVR beyond functional adaptation, with distinct fibrotic mechanisms in FMR versus FTR. PDK4 and IFN modulation demonstrate therapeutic potential for FTR."

Serial echocardiographic assessments were performed at baseline, 30 min, and 2, 4, and 8 weeks post-procedure, with histological validation of myocardial fibrosis. The technique achieved 100% success with no acute mortality and enabled precise titration of regurgitation severity. Both MR groups exhibited progressive, body size-independent cardiac remodeling. Speckle-tracking revealed basal-segment-predominant longitudinal strain reduction, correlating with histologically confirmed peri-annular fibrosis. Survival was significantly lower in massive MR (40% vs. 90%, p = 0.006). This minimally invasive model reliably replicates human MR pathophysiology with high reproducibility and precise severity control, providing a robust platform for mechanistic investigation."

Propensity score matching (PSM) balanced demographics, comorbidities, and medications. The primary outcome was all-cause mortality; the secondary outcomes included cardiovascular events.
After exclusions, 35,753 patients with mitral regurgitation were identified, including 2,165 TEER and 33,588 surgical cases; 2,029 matched pairs were analyzed. At 1 year, surgery showed lower mortality (hazard ratio [HR]: 0.78; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.64-0.96), primarily between 2 months and 1 year. Surgery was associated with higher rates of early dyspnea, atrial fibrillation, and heart failure, though heart failure could be reversed later. No significant differences were found in major adverse cardiovascular events (MACEs), stroke, acute myocardial infarction (AMI), cardiac arrest, or emergency department (ED) visits. A subgroup analysis of patients with mitral valve prolapse showed consistent results, with atrial fibrillation and heart failure occurring more frequently after surgery.
In this large cohort, surgery and TEER produced different outcomes. Early mortality was similar, but surgery improved survival after 2 months. TEER had fewer early dyspnea, atrial fibrillation, and heart failure events. No differences were observed in MACE, stroke, AMI, or ED visits, supporting individualized MR treatment."

Pediatric patients with mitral regurgitation (MR) grade ≥ 2 who received MV repair between January 2019 and July 2024 were retrospectively reviewed. MV repair failure was defined as a composite of postoperative functional MV failure, heart transplantation, or death. MV morphology and related parameters were assessed using two- and three-dimensional echocardiography. A total of 309 pediatric patients were included, with a median age of 15.50 (6.00, 52.30) months; 164 (53.1%) were male. During a follow-up of 6.93 (1.37, 14.67) months, 11.97% cases experienced MV repair failure.

The significantly dilated mitral annulus, measured with MVAI exceeding 8.73 cm2/m2, was established as the clinically significant threshold for predicting MV repair failure. Sensitivity analyses revealed a more pronounced predictive effect of MVAI in the isolated MR group (HR = 1.84, 95% CI = 1.19 to 2.85; P = 0.006).
For pediatric patients with MR grade ≥ 2, echocardiography identified underdeveloped chordae tendineae and significantly dilated mitral annulus may serve as crucial preoperative predictors for risk stratification of MV repair failure.
• In pediatric populations with mitral regurgitation, MV repair is generally preferred, yet it remains one of the most technically demanding and less predictable congenital cardiac surgeries.
• Preoperative underdeveloped chordae tendineae and enlarged annulus (MVAI > 8.73 cm2/m2) are strong predictors of MV repair failure in pediatric patients, particularly those with isolated MR. These findings support performing repair early, before substantial annular remodeling occurs."

Computed tomography (CT) enables Mitral Valve Calcium Scoring (MVCS), but its prognostic value in rheumatic MS has not been prospectively evaluated. The CALCIMIT study assessed the reproducibility and prognostic value of the MVCS by CT on immediate and long-term outcomes after PMC.
In this prospective multicenter study, patients underwent non-contrast cardiac CT before PMC. MVCS was quantified using Agatston's method. The primary endpoint was good immediate result (GIR), defined as final mitral valve area ≥1.5 cm² with ≥50% increase and ≤2/4 mitral regurgitation (MR). The secondary endpoint was long-term event-free survival (death or mitral reintervention). Between 2016 and 2019, 172 consecutive patients (mean age 56±15 years; 78% women) were included. According to CT, 113 patients (66%) had mitral calcification. GIR of PMC was achieved in 54.7% of patients. Independent predictors of GIR included lower CT-based MVCS, lower NYHA class, and lower baseline MR grade. MVCS was also independently associated with long-term survival free of mitral reintervention (HR 1.54, 95% CI 1.07-2.21; p=0.019). A threshold of 385.5 Agatston Units predicted both immediate and late outcomes. Interobserver reproducibility was excellent (calcification detection: Kappa 0.987; MVCS correlation: r=0.999).
CT-derived MVCS provides independent, reproducible prognostic information for immediate and long-term outcomes after PMC, beyond conventional echocardiographic scores. Integrating MVCS into preprocedural assessment may improve patient selection for PMC."

Sacubitril-valsartan (S/V), an angiotensin receptor-neprilysin inhibitor (ARNI), has demonstrated superiority over enalapril in reducing morbidity and mortality in HFrEF. Its mechanism of action includes promoting LV reverse remodeling (LVRR), but the comprehensive effect on both LVRR and secondary MR, particularly using advanced three-dimensional (3D) echocardiography, requires further elucidation.

This prospective, single-center study included 80 patients with HFrEF (LVEF ≤ 40%) initiated on S/V. Comprehensive 2D and 3D transthoracic echocardiography was performed at baseline 6 months, and 1 year of treatment. LVRR was assessed by changes in LV volumes (EDVI, ESVI), LVEF, and LV mass index (LVMI). MR severity was quantified using the effective regurgitant orifice area (EROA). Paired statistical tests (t-test or Wilcoxon signed-rank test) were used for pre- and posttreatment comparisons. Correlation and multivariable linear regression analyses were performed to identify predictors of LVRR.
After 1 year of S/V therapy, patients with HFrEF demonstrated marked and consistent improvements in both MR and (LV) structure and function. EROA decreased from 0.36 ± 0.08 cm2 to 0.24 ± 0.09 cm2 (-34.6%, p < 0.001), accompanied by reductions in regurgitant volume (RV) (-32.6%, p < 0.001) and regurgitant fraction (-30.8%, p < 0.001). LVRR was evidenced by significant increases in LVEF (3D: +42.1%, p < 0.001, Cohen's d = 2.63) and reductions in LVEDV (-18.0%, p < 0.001) and LVESV (-31.8%, p < 0.001), as well as a 14.7% decrease in LVMI (p < 0.001). Correlation analysis revealed that MR improvement closely paralleled LV remodeling, with ΔEROA strongly associated with reductions in LVESVI (r = 0.774, p < 0.001), LVEDVI (r = 0.558, p < 0.001), and LVEF improvement (r = -0.781, p < 0.001). Multivariable regression identified lower baseline LVEF (3D) as the strongest independent predictor of LVRR (β = -2.304, p < 0.001) CONCLUSIONS: S/V therapy induces significant and comprehensive LVRR and a marked reduction in secondary MR severity in HFrEF patients. The strong correlation between these two effects suggests that MR improvement is primarily driven by LVRR. Lower baseline LVEF is a powerful predictor of the magnitude of LVRR."

Disease primers,"Acute rheumatic fever (ARF), the acute autoimmune sequela of group A Streptococcus infection, and its chronic life-threatening manifestation, rheumatic heart disease (RHD), which causes permanent heart valve damage, remain major drivers of preventable cardiovascular mortality and disability in low-income and middle-income countries. Since the mid-1990s, multidisciplinary and international collaborative research has yielded new insights into the role of superficial skin infections such as impetigo in ARF pathogenesis and the disease mechanisms that underlie the progression from ARF to RHD, and has explored novel treatments and delivery mechanisms in clinical trials and progressed the development of Strep A vaccines. Early detection and patient care have advanced, with revised echocardiographic screening criteria and the 2024 WHO guidelines, which provide a framework for evidence-based management and therapeutic strategies. Notwithstanding these advancements, considerable disparity persists in the care, control and treatment of advanced disease, necessitating coordinated programmes, prioritization by global agencies and local governments, and substantial involvement of those with RHD. Of note, few to no cardiac surgery programmes exist in some countries most burdened by RHD. Future research must encompass implementation studies for validated evidence-based therapies, translational technologies and applications, together with a definitive pathway to direct patient effect, to achieve the WHO target of eliminating RHD as a public health problem."

It has also been linked to shear stress-induced von Willebrand factor abnormalities that prolong closure time with adenosine diphosphate (CT-ADP). The aim of this study was to assess whether CT-ADP serves as a biomarker for mitral PVL diagnosis, follow-up, and prognosis after repair.
In this prospective study, 89 patients (27 with moderate-to-severe mitral PVL referred for closure, group 1; 31 with prosthetic mitral valves without PVL, group 2; and 31 controls without valvular disease, group 3) underwent laboratory assessment including hemolysis markers, congestion markers, and CT-ADP. Patients with PVL underwent percutaneous or surgical repair and were followed up at 3 and 12 months. ROC analysis, linear regression, and Cox models were used to evaluate the diagnostic and prognostic value of CT-ADP.
CT-ADP was prolonged in PVL patients (median, 214 seconds) vs control groups (86 seconds in group 2 and 74 seconds in group 3; P < .001). A cutoff of > 135 seconds showed excellent diagnostic accuracy (AUROC, 0.96; sensitivity 89%, specificity 97%). Postprocedural CT-ADP decreased significantly after successful repair (median decrease of 79 seconds) but remained unchanged in those with residual leaks. Elevated postprocedural CT-ADP (>155 s) identified persistent PVL and was associated with worse 1-year outcomes (HR, 21.37; P = .004), including death, heart failure or hemolysis-related readmission, and reintervention.
CT-ADP appears to be a promising biomarker for diagnosing and monitoring mitral PVL. It may add value to conventional markers by reflecting shear stress-related platelet dysfunction and predicting outcomes following PVL closure."
PubMed,valvular heart disease,Prehabilitation in frail patients undergoing cardiac valve intervention.,Luigi Cutore; Davide Capodanno,10.1016/j.pcad.2026.02.007,2026-02-24,Progress in cardiovascular diseases,"Management of valvular heart disease (VHD) has shifted from predominantly surgical approaches to widespread use of transcatheter interventions, including transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR), mitral transcatheter edge-to-edge repair (M-TEER), transcatheter mitral valve replacement (TMVR), and emerging tricuspid transcatheter valve intervention (TTVI). Although ESC/EACTS and ACC/AHA guidelines recognize frailty as a major determinant of mortality, complications, and recovery, they offer limited guidance on how to modify frailty before intervention.
Frailty is highly prevalent in VHD, particularly among transcatheter candidates, and represents a dynamic, potentially reversible syndrome driven by sarcopenia, deconditioning, malnutrition, inflammation, and psychological vulnerability. It influences symptoms, procedural selection, and recovery, exerting prognostic effects beyond valve anatomy. Prehabilitation offers a strategy to convert the preprocedural interval from passive waiting into a therapeutic opportunity. Evidence from cardiac surgery and hemodynamic interventions shows that multimodal prehabilitation (including aerobic and resistance exercise, respiratory training, nutritional optimization and psychological support) can improve functional capacity, reduce pulmonary complications, and shorten hospitalization. In TAVR candidates, early data suggest that even short programs may enhance functional performance, mitigate frailty and reduce major adverse cardiovascular events. In contrast, dedicated trials for M-TEER, TMVR and TTVI remain limited, and current practice depends on evidence from other procedural settings. Ongoing studies are testing exercise-based, nutritional, and psychological interventions, including telemedicine-supported and home-based models, while incorporating objective measures of frailty reversal.
As procedural risk declines, patients' physiological reserve becomes the principal barrier to long-term benefit. Prehabilitation may provide a scalable strategy to bridge anatomical correction with meaningful functional recovery."

This study sought to investigate the role of SPP1+ macrophages in the development and progression of AF and further elucidate the underlying mechanisms. Single-nucleus RNA sequencing was performed on right atrial tissues from 3 patients with persistent AF and 3 with sinus rhythm (all with rheumatic valvular heart disease). The results revealed significant immune cell infiltration in AF atrial tissues, with a marked increase in the proportion of SPP1+ macrophages, which exhibited the strongest intercellular communication with cardiomyocytes. Phenotypic scoring indicated that apoptosis was the dominant mode of cardiomyocyte death in AF. Immunohistochemical and Western blot analyses confirmed elevated levels of pro-apoptotic proteins (Bax, Cleaved-Caspase3) and reduced levels of the anti-apoptotic protein Bcl2 in AF tissues. In a mouse model with macrophage-specific SPP1 overexpression, increased AF inducibility and duration were observed, accompanied by enhanced cardiomyocyte apoptosis. In vitro co-culture experiments using SPP1-overexpressing RAW264.7 macrophages and HL-1 cardiomyocytes confirmed that SPP1+ macrophages could induce cardiomyocyte apoptosis. Mechanistically, KEGG and GSEA analyses identified downregulation of the PI3K/AKT pathway in AF. Treatment with the PI3K/AKT activator Recilisib reversed apoptosis and restored p-PI3K/p-AKT levels in HL-1 cells co-cultured with SPP1-overexpressing RAW264.7 macrophages. These findings demonstrate that SPP1+ macrophages accumulate in atrial tissues of AF patients and induce cardiomyocyte apoptosis by downregulating the PI3K/AKT pathway, thereby increasing AF susceptibility."

Due to its rarity, only individual case reports and a limited number of case series have been published to date. This study constitutes the most extensive comprehensive review conducted in this area. Eight factors were evaluated: age at diagnosis, sex, clinical presentation, electrocardiographic findings, imaging (ultrasound, CT, or MRI), associated cardiac anomalies, and patient outcomes.
The electronic databases PubMed and Scopus were searched from their inception until 30 October 2025. Only case reports and case series were considered for inclusion. Studies involving foetuses, autopsies, and animals were excluded. The collected data were primarily presented as percentages.
One hundred fourteen studies were found encompassing 124 patients. The mean age at diagnosis was 33.3 ± 9.4 years The most common clinical presentations were dyspnoea (44.3%) and cyanosis (29.5%). The most commonly encountered ECG changes were supraventricular tachycardia/atrial flutter/atrial fibrillation (33.3%) and right bundle branch block (22.6%). On chest X-ray, cardiomegaly was noted in 46.5%. CTD was suspected or diagnosed by echocardiography in 95.2% of cases. The diagnosis was confirmed by CT and/or MRI in 34.1% of cases. A concomitant congenital heart defect was found in 67.7%, especially in the form of all kinds of atrial septal defect (38.1%) and of right valvular and right ventricular involvement (20.1%). An outcome was reported in 97/124. Surgical correction was the treatment of choice in 51.6%. Since 1991, a percutaneous approach has been employed in selected cases (5.1%). Conservative management was the treatment of choice in 43.3%. The mortality rate was 8.2%.
The principal limitation of this systematic review lies in its reliance solely on case reports and small case series, reflecting the absence of large-scale studies on CTD. Nonetheless, it constitutes the most comprehensive analysis available to date."

In this population, frailty, comorbidity, and functional variability significantly influence prognosis. This study evaluated short-term (30-day) and long-term (1-year) mortality predictors in elderly patients with AHF treated in the emergency department (HED), considering clinical variables, comorbidities, and precipitating factors (PFs). Materials and Methods: An observational cohort study was conducted based on a secondary analysis of older patients with AHF included in the Epidemiology of Acute Heart Failure in Emergency Departments (EAHFE) registry, treated at Hospital Universitario Marqués de Valdecilla (HUMV) between 2007 and 2022. Clinical, laboratory, and PF-related variables were collected. The primary outcome was all-cause mortality at 30 days and 1 year. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were performed. Results: A total of 548 patients were included (mean age: 80.7 years), of whom 78.6% required hospitalization, mainly in the Internal Medicine department. Mortality was 11.1% at 30 days and 29.9% at 1 year. Age, valvular heart disease, dementia, and elevated creatinine levels were independently associated with higher mortality. Hypoxemia and low-output symptoms were linked to short-term mortality, while NYHA class III and anemia were associated with long-term mortality. Among PFs, acute coronary syndrome (ACS) was related to worse short-term outcomes, whereas rapid atrial fibrillation (AF) was inversely associated with long-term mortality. Conclusions: The prognostic relevance of risk factors differs between short- and long-term outcomes in older patients with AHF. Incorporating clinical characteristics and PFs into risk stratification models may support individualized management and guide follow-up strategies tailored to the geriatric profile. This multidimensional approach is essential to improve clinical decision-making and outcomes in a highly vulnerable population."

This study aimed to determine the clinical and echocardiographic factors of complications in patients with MS. Methodology This retrospective cross-sectional study was conducted at the Cardiology Department of Northwest General Hospital and Research Centre, Peshawar, including 121 patients diagnosed with MS using echocardiography. Patients of either gender, aged ≥18 years, and diagnosed with MS confirmed by transthoracic echocardiography (either rheumatic or non-rheumatic) with complete clinical and echocardiographic data were included in the study. Complications were assessed at the time of initial hospital evaluation and defined as the presence of one or more disease-related adverse conditions attributable to MS, including atrial fibrillation or other clinically significant arrhythmias, heart failure, pulmonary hypertension, thromboembolic events (ischemic stroke or systemic embolism), left atrial thrombus, and respiratory complications secondary to pulmonary congestion or hypertension. Information regarding demographics, pre-existing comorbid conditions, New York Heart Association (NYHA) functional class, and multiple echocardiographic parameters was recorded. Data were analyzed using SPSS Statistics version 27 (IBM Corp., Armonk, NY, USA). Associations were assessed using chi-square and independent t-tests. Multivariate logistic regression identified independent factors. A p <0.05 was considered significant. Results The mean age was 57.4±16.8 years, with female predominance (63.6%). Diabetes mellitus and hypertension were present in 34.3% and 27.8% patients, respectively. Overall, 38 patients (31.4%) developed complications; arrhythmias (10.7%) and heart failure (9.3%) were most frequent, while stroke occurred in 1.7%. On univariate analysis, female sex (odds ratio (OR) 1.91, p=0.048), diabetes mellitus (OR 2.31, p=0.032), hypertension (OR 2.11, p=0.041), NYHA class III-IV (OR 3.18, p=0.003), severe MS (OR 5.38, p<0.001), pulmonary artery systolic pressure (PASP) >50 mmHg (OR 3.57, p=0.002), and left atrial diameter ≥50 mm (OR 3.44, p = 0.001) were significantly associated with complications. Multivariate analysis identified severe MS (adjusted OR (AOR) 3.58, CI 1.62-7.89, p=0.002), PASP >50 mmHg (AOR 3.12, CI 1.41-6.91, p=0.005), left atrial diameter ≥50 mm (AOR 2.74, CI 1.21-6.20, p=0.016), diabetes mellitus (AOR 2.29, CI 1.03-5.10, p=0.041), and NYHA class III-IV (AOR 2.88, CI 1.29-6.45, p=0.010) as independent factors.

Many patients are ineligible for surgical aortic valve replacement (SAVR) due to high risk. While transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) is an alternative, its application in PNAR is challenged by anatomical factors like the absence of calcification for anchoring. Dedicated transcatheter devices are not widely available, leading to the off-label use of self-expanding valves, though robust comparative evidence is lacking. The TRAMPERS trial is a prospective, multicenter, controlled, open-label clinical trial that aims to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of transfemoral TAVR using the VitaFlow™ Liberty self-expanding valve system compared to the J-Valve system in patients with severe PNAR. A total of 180 patients with severe PNAR will be enrolled across four centers in China and evaluated by a heart team. Patients will be allocated in a 1:1 ratio to the VitaFlow™ group (n = 90) or the J-Valve control group (n = 90). The primary endpoint is a composite of all-cause mortality, disabling stroke and rehospitalization for heart failure at 12 months post-procedure, assessed for non-inferiority. Secondary endpoints include procedural complications, clinical events, health status and cost-effectiveness. All endpoints are adjudicated according to VARC-3 criteria.Clinical Trial Registration:NCT06818084 (ClinicalTrials.gov)."

We aimed to explore the relationships between comorbidity groups and dynamic changes in health-related quality of life (HRQoL) in patients with chronic heart failure (CHF).
A total of 1533 patients with CHF were included. Demographic and clinical variables were recorded during hospitalization. HRQoL was assessed using the Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire (KCCQ) at baseline and at 3 and 12 months. Latent class analysis was used to identify comorbidity groups among patients with CHF. This method identifies latent subgroups by analyzing patterns in their comorbidities. Repeated-measures analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used to assess the relationships between comorbidity groups and dynamic changes in KCCQ scores.
Three comorbidity clusters were identified: the young/valvular heart disease (VHD) group, the elderly/coronary heart disease (CHD) group, and the high-comorbidity burden group. The young group had a relatively lower comorbidity burden and the best HRQoL, followed by the elderly/CHD group, while the high-comorbidity burden group showed the worst HRQoL. The overall summary scores, clinical summary scores, social limitations, physical limitations, and self-efficacy were significantly highest in the high-comorbidity burden group. In addition, at 3 months the symptom scores had decreased in all three groups. Repeated-measures ANOVA showed that the comorbidity groups were significantly associated with dynamic changes in HRQoL through time and group effects.
There were significant differences in the baseline characteristics and dynamic changes of HRQoL among different comorbidity clusters. Patients in the high-comorbidity burden group performed the worst in terms of quality of life, but the improvement was the most significant."

We aimed to evaluate the relationships between smoking (status, pack-years, and years since cessation) and CAC and ECC among older adults.
In 1901 Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC) Study (United States) participants (mean age 81 ± 4 years, 62% female, 20% Black) without a clinical history of coronary heart disease at visit 7 (2018-19), we quantified the associations of key smoking parameters (status, pack-years, and years since cessation) with CAC and ECC (thoracic aorta and aortic/mitral valve calcification) using multivariable logistic regression models adjusted for other risk factors. Smoking parameters were lagged by 5 years. High CAC and ECC were defined as sex-race specific >75th percentile of Agatston score.
Current and former smoking were significantly associated with high CAC (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 2.57 [95%CI 1.58-4.19] and 1.66 [1.30-2.12], respectively) and ECC except for the aortic valve. Pack-years demonstrated a robust dose-response relationship with CAC and ECC, but less so for the aortic and mitral valves. The association was particularly strong for calcification at aortic valve ring, ascending aorta, and descending aorta (e.g., aOR 4.10 [2.57- 6.55], 4.07 [2.56, 6.46], and 3.97 [2.45, 6.43], respectively, for current vs. never smokers). The odds of high vascular calcification declined with progressively longer years of smoking cessation.
Cigarette smoking was strongly associated with vascular calcification, especially calcification in the aorta, but less so for valvular calcification. These findings reinforce the harm of smoking on broad ranges of vascular beds and simultaneously support unique pathophysiology across different vascular beds and cardiac valves."

Malnutrition prevalence estimates range from 20% to 60% for hospitalized patients. Use of Global Leadership Initiative on Malnutrition criteria for malnutrition diagnosis for patients with cardiovascular disease has confirmed prognostic value, correlating with poorer physical function and higher mortality. Nutritional support plays a key role for inpatients, particularly in the cardiac intensive care unit, and includes initiation of feeding within 48 hours of hospitalization, preferably through enteral nutrition. Enteral nutrition is more cost-effective compared with parenteral nutrition and can decrease mortality and shorten lengths of stay. Parenteral nutrition is reserved for patients with severe gastrointestinal dysfunction or to supplement nutrition when enteral nutrition is contraindicated, for example, during high pressor doses that preclude adequate intestinal perfusion or when achieving <70% of nutritional targets after the first week.

Existing risk stratification models predominantly derive from Western populations, with the Framingham Risk Equation systematically overestimating cardiovascular risk by 276% in Chinese men and 102% in Chinese women, underscoring the critical imperative for population-specific predictive instruments. Although machine learning methodologies demonstrate considerable promise in cardiovascular risk prognostication, their inherent ""black-box"" characteristics substantially impede clinical translational implementation.
Leveraging longitudinal cohort data from the China Health and Retirement Longitudinal Study (CHARLS) and integrating machine learning with explainable artificial intelligence techniques, we sought to develop and validate a cardiovascular disease long-term risk prediction model tailored to the Chinese middle-aged and elderly population, achieving optimal synthesis of predictive accuracy and clinical interpretability through quantitative risk factor contribution analysis.
We incorporated four waves of CHARLS surveillance data spanning 2011-2020, with 8,080 participants aged ≥ 45 years completing 9-year follow-up after rigorous inclusion criteria application. Recursive feature elimination was employed to identify optimal predictors from 90 candidate variables. We systematically evaluated 12 machine learning algorithms encompassing linear, non-linear, ensemble learning, and deep learning methodologies, utilizing stratified random 7:3 partitioning for training and validation cohorts. SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) methodology facilitated comprehensive global and local interpretability analyses, with decision curve analysis assessing clinical net benefit.
Among 5,699 training cohort participants, 1,248 (21.9%) experienced cardiovascular events during follow-up. Recursive feature elimination identified 18 pivotal predictive factors spanning lipid metabolism, anthropometric parameters, renal function, and glucose homeostasis domains. The gradient boosting machine demonstrated superior comprehensive performance, achieving validation cohort AUC of 0.798 (95% CI: 0.776-0.820), specificity of 98%, and positive predictive value of 78%. SHAP analysis revealed waist circumference, triglycerides, and hypertension history as the three predominant predictive factors, with mean absolute SHAP values significantly exceeding other variables. Individual risk attribution analysis demonstrated substantial heterogeneity: extremely high-risk specimens (predicted probability 0.991) exhibited synergistic multi-factorial risk amplification, with standardized waist circumference contributing + 0.0778 SHAP value and triglycerides (477 mg/dL) contributing + 0.0729; conversely, low-risk specimens (predicted probability - 0.0393) demonstrated triglycerides (45.1 mg/dL) providing the maximal singular protective contribution of -0.166. Decision curve analysis confirmed positive net benefit across the 0-0.95 threshold probability spectrum, systematically surpassing conventional strategies.
The gradient boosting machine model achieved superior discrimination (AUC 0.798, 95% CI 0.785-0.825) compared to Framingham (0.638) and China-PAR (0.654) scores for 9-year cardiovascular disease prediction in Chinese adults aged ≥ 45 years. Waist circumference, triglycerides, and hypertension emerged as principal predictive features, though SHAP-derived importance reflects statistical contribution rather than causal effects. Decision curve analysis demonstrated clinical utility across threshold probabilities 0.05-0.95, enabling flexible deployment from population screening (98.3% sensitivity) to targeted intervention (98.7% specificity). External validation in independent cohorts is essential to establish generalizability before clinical implementation.

This design enables effective modeling of cross-modal interactions and residue-level dependencies critical for neurotoxicity prediction. BiToxNet was evaluated on three datasets of different sequence lengths, namely Protein, Peptide, and Combined datasets, achieving accuracies of 92.3%, 96.0%, and 92.7%, respectively, and consistently outperforming existing state-of-the-art methods. Ablation studies confirmed the importance of both evolutionary embeddings and handcrafted features, as well as the critical role of BAN in feature fusion. Visualization analyses using t-SNE and hierarchical clustering further demonstrated that BiToxNet learns highly discriminative representations without reliance on domain-specific prior knowledge. Additional evaluation on an external imbalanced dataset validated the robustness and strong generalization capability of the proposed framework.
Overall, BiToxNet provides a powerful and generalizable computational framework for the accurate identification of neurotoxic peptides and proteins. By effectively integrating evolutionary and biochemical information through bilinear attention, BiToxNet offers a valuable tool for neurotoxin screening and protein drug safety assessment, and presents a distinctive modeling strategy applicable to a wide range of biological sequence analysis tasks."
PubMed,deep learning,An Effective Breast Cancer Classification System Using Multiple Feature Extraction Techniques with Multi-scale Attention-Based Feature Fusion Model.,Atul Kumar Ramotra; Goldi Chandrapal Jarbais,10.1007/s10278-026-01876-5,2026-02-26,Journal of imaging informatics in medicine,"Breast cancer ranks as the second leading cause of death in women. Early identification of breast cancer can significantly reduce women's mortality rates. Due to the time-consuming nature of manual breast cancer diagnosis, an automated system is necessary for early cancer detection. This paper presents a novel framework that combines the most useful extracted features using feature fusion for the purpose of classifying breast cancer based on a variety of features. First, the input images were obtained from the publicly available CBIS-DDSM and MIAS databases. Then, an augmentation approach is used to increase the image count. The next stage is pre-processing, which involves the use of homomorphic filtering to improve image quality. After that, various types of features, such as handcrafted, statistical, texture, as well as deep features, were extracted from the pre-processed images using different approaches. Handcrafted features were created utilizing the Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG) and Local Binary Pattern (LBP) approaches. Textural features such as Contrast, Entropy, Correlation, as well as Homogeneity Energy were extracted from grey-tone spatial dependence. Statistical feature extraction is carried out using the Modified Principal Component Analysis (MPCA) technique. The Vision Transformer (ViT) is used for deep feature extraction. Finally, a multi-scale attention-based feature fusion model is introduced to combine different types of features, with softmax serving as the classifier for breast cancer classification. The experiment results for the CBIS-DDSM dataset achieved an accuracy of 99.45%. Also, the MIAS dataset attains an accuracy of 99.73% compared to existing techniques; the proposed framework demonstrates superior performance."

FALCON is an open-access fully automated deep learning model enabling large-scale intravenous contrast detection and body part classification for CT scans of the head and neck (HN), chest, abdomen, and pelvis (AP). This study used six independent datasets consisting of 3138 CT scans of the HN, chest, and AP of 3126 patients from five institutions between 1996 and 2023 to train and validate four CNN models for intravenous contrast detection and body part classification. The ground truth of intravenous contrast presence was verified by a radiologist. We used ResNet9 network architecture and integrated the four models into a graphical user interface. We assessed FALCON's performance with F1 scores and compared FALCON's annotation time to manual annotation by human experts. In the external test set containing 1348 scans, the F1 score for intravenous contrast detection was 99.4% (95%CI: 98.8, 99.9) for HN CT, 98.3% (95%CI: 96.9, 99.5) for chest CT, and 98.1% (95%CI: 96.9, 99.1) for AP CT. The F1 score for body part classification alone on unseen data was 100% for HN, chest, and AP CT. Compared to human experts, annotation of a single scan with FALCON required 1.3 s vs. 21 s for HN CT, 1.8 s vs. 33 s for chest CT, and 3.7 s vs. 1.6 s for AP CT. The open-access FALCON model ( https://github.com/FintelmannLabDevelopmentTeam/Falcon ) quickly and reliably detects intravenous contrast and classifies body part on CT scans."

Explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) methods have been proposed to enhance model transparency. However, most of current XAI methods applied in the medical field often ignore the interaction of features in complex environments and pose deviation from clinical domain knowledge.
Our study used two Electronic Health Record (EHR) cohorts of hospitalized patients with type 2 diabetes (T2DM), including an internal dataset of 1,275 inpatients (mean age 58.5 ± 14.3 years) and an external dataset of 292 patients (mean age 69.3 ± 14.5 years). We introduce an expert-guided XAI framework to improve the transparency and trustworthiness of deep learning models for insulin titration in diabetes management. The framework utilizes a post-hoc XAI model named Shapley Taylor Interaction Index (STII) to capture the impact of feature interactions. Additionally, the model is refined iteratively in a doctor-in-the-loop (DIL) process by encoding clinical constraints to align with medical expertise.
Here we show that our STII-DIL model could explore the interaction factors and reduce unreasonable explanations compared with other explanation models. The final XAI system explanations demonstrated strong alignment with experts' explanations and increased correctness by expert evaluation An AI-human collaboration study revealed that insulin titration accuracy significantly improved for junior clinicians with STII-DIL assistance, while senior clinicians showed minimal change. Both junior and senior clinicians reported increased confidence when using the STII-DIL system.
We present an explainable deep learning framework that combines post-hoc XAI and expert domain knowledge to provide transparent and expert-aligned explanations for insulin titration in type 2 diabetes management. This framework enhances decision-making accuracy and confidence, especially for junior clinicians, and may facilitate broader clinical adoption of AI-assisted decision-making tools."

We propose a device-invariant, multimodal deep learning framework that jointly models cough acoustics, demographic data, and symptom descriptions for multi-label classification of adult respiratory diseases. To address the issues of device effect, an adversarial branch is embedded in the audio encoder to enforce device-invariant feature learning, while an invariant risk minimization-augmented loss enhances robustness to non-structural shifts. To evaluate the effectiveness of our proposed method, a real-world, multi-center dataset containing over 10,000 cases spanning seven major respiratory conditions was curated. On the tasks of individual respiratory disease identification for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI) and pulmonary shadows (PS), our method achieves superior performance with the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) of 0.9698, 0.8483 and 0.8720, respectively. It also shows promising results in identifying the presence of comorbidities for 7 respiratory diseases with an overall AUROC of 0.8907.

This study introduces a hybrid framework that integrates the cognitively inspired iHow Optimization Algorithm (iHowOA) with Spatio-Temporal Graph Convolutional Networks (STGCN) to enhance predictive accuracy for concrete compressive strength estimation. A large language model (LLM)-driven preprocessing pipeline is employed to improve data quality through semantic validation, feature harmonization, and intelligent handling of inconsistencies, leading to robust input representations. The iHowOA optimizes the STGCN architecture by leveraging hierarchical knowledge acquisition, balanced exploration-exploitation, and adaptive decision-making mechanisms. The graph-based model captures spatial dependencies among compositional variables and temporal strength evolution during curing. Extensive benchmarking against ten established metaheuristic optimizers demonstrates that the proposed iHowOA-STGCN framework achieves superior predictive performance on the evaluated public dataset, yielding lower prediction errors and higher correlation coefficients compared to baseline models. Exploratory data analysis further highlights key cement-strength relationships, age-dependent strength gain patterns, and physicochemical interactions relevant to feature engineering.

Existing methods typically address imbalance and multi-scale fusion separately, leading to biased or redundant representations. We propose CMAF-Net, a theoretically grounded architecture that unifies information bottleneck principles with margin-based learning to jointly tackle these challenges. CMAF-Net employs a dual-branch CNN-Transformer backbone fused through a Cross-Modal Attention Fusion block, which implements temperature-controlled attention and redundancy minimization to preserve complementary local and global features. At the classification level, we introduce an Adaptive Class-Balanced Focal Loss that operationalizes margin theory under imbalance, enforcing larger margins for minority classes while dynamically adapting to feature distributions. Extensive experiments on the IDC dataset show that CMAF-Net achieves 94.92% sensitivity and 95.52% balanced accuracy, outperforming state-of-the-art baselines by up to 8.6% on malignant detection. Under extreme 99:1 imbalance, CMAF-Net maintains 76.45% sensitivity, demonstrating graceful degradation where competing methods fail catastrophically. Cross-dataset evaluation on BreakHis confirms robust zero-shot transfer across four magnifications with average sensitivity of 95.61%. Ablation studies and information-theoretic analyses validate the contributions of each component, while computational profiling shows CMAF-Net achieves superior accuracy-efficiency trade-offs compared to prior fusion networks. Beyond breast cancer, our framework establishes a principled template for information-theoretic fusion under class imbalance, with implications for rare disease detection, clinical decision support, and broader multi-modal learning tasks."

Early identification of high-risk individuals is critical for reducing AUD risk. Absolute risk prediction models can help by providing individualised, time-specific risk assessments for the target population of adolescents and young adults.
We developed a deep learning model to provide personalised absolute risk estimates of developing AUD among adolescents or young adults who use alcohol, using data from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent to Adult Health. Predictor importance was assessed using Shapley Additive Explanations (SHAP) values. Model performance was evaluated using five-fold cross-validation (CV) with the area under the curve (AUC) and the ratio of expected to observed cases (E/O). The model was validated on an independent test dataset.
Key predictors are biological sex, delinquency, and personality traits such as conscientiousness and extraversion. For predicting AUD risk within 6 years of first alcohol use, the model achieved AUCs of 0.72 in CV and 0.85 in independent validation, with E/O ratios of 1.03 and 1.28, respectively. In the test data, the weighted average AUC for 1- to 6-year prediction after first alcohol use was 0.86. These results indicate good discrimination and calibration performance.
To our knowledge, the proposed model is the first deep learning model for absolute risk prediction of AUD. It can help identify high-risk adolescents and young adults, who may be then provided with timely and clinically appropriate interventions."

Endovascular stents typically consist of a metal framework and a flexible membrane graft designed to reopen obstructed aortic segments and maintain blood flow through the true lumen. Consequently, stents are widely used to treat aortic expansion diseases and aortic occlusive stenosis. However, traditional stents have limitations in terms of adaptability to complex anatomical structures, long-term durability, biomechanical stability, and reliance on radial support force for fixation, lacking active fixation mechanisms. These shortcomings remain the primary causes of postoperative complications, significantly impacting the quality of life for patients with aortic dissection.                                                           Methods:                     The research status of the endovascular stent was discussed in depth, and the main factors for the optimal design of the stent (geometry, pattern configuration, additional fixtures, and optimization methods) were analyzed and summarized according to the complications targeted by the repair device.                                                           Results:                     The composition structure, working principle, and development status of the stent grafts under review are elaborated in detail. Stent grafts attempt to alleviate postoperative complications through three approaches: enhancing the flexibility of the stent framework, improving the fit between the vessel wall and the stent, and reducing vascular injury. Blood flow guiding channels are established to alleviate the obstruction of branch blood flow. Additional self-anchoring devices are added to adapt to the dynamic remodeling of blood vessels.                                                           Discussion:                     The effects of various factors, including geometric parameters, structural design, and parameter optimization techniques, on the optimization of stent primary mechanical performance are discussed. The current research status of functional improvement methods for stents is also summarized.                                                           Conclusion:                     Refining the quantitative relationship between stent structural parameters and mechanical performance, as well as exploring the balance criteria between flexibility and radial support force, represent promising directions for future development. These objectives necessitate further in-depth analysis and research."

With a focus on the prevalent psychological complications following the onset of this condition, this study aimed to explore the correlation between antenatal depression and Corona disease anxiety, personality traits, and postpartum depression during the COVID-19 pandemic.                                                           Materials and Methods:                     This cross-sectional descriptive-analytical study investigated women receiving care at health centers affiliated with Kerman University of Medical Sciences during the last month of their pregnancy and the postpartum period in 2022. Following the acquisition of informed consent, participants were assessed using various measures, including demographic and obstetric information, the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale, the Corona Disease Anxiety Scale (CDAS), and the NEO Personality Inventory-Revised during their third trimester of pregnancy. The same group of participants completed the Edinburgh Depression Scale and the Corona Disease Anxiety Scale (CDAS) 4-6 weeks after childbirth.                                                           Results and Discussion:                     There was a significant correlation between family income, unwanted pregnancy as perceived by both the mother and father, and antenatal depression. Additionally, marital satisfaction played a significant role in postpartum depression. Furthermore, antenatal depression was significantly associated with neuroticism, agreeableness, and physical symptoms related to Corona disease anxiety. Personality traits, with the exception of extroversion and conscientiousness, and various domains of Corona disease anxiety, excluding psychological symptoms, were also significantly associated with postpartum depression.                                                           Conclusion:                     During pandemics or epidemics, such as the COVID-19 outbreak, experiencing mental distress during pregnancy can contribute to mental health issues during the postpartum period. This risk is particularly true in individuals with unique personality traits, emphasizing the need for increased focus on mental health within prenatal care during these crises."

Kinovea, as an accessible motion-analysis software, provides both visual and quantitative feedback. However, its application in supporting technique development among beginner athletes remains insufficiently explored. Aim: This study aims to describe the use of Kinovea in biomechanics training and examine its contribution to the awareness of kinematic characteristics and movement techniques among beginner athletes. Methods: A descriptive qualitative design involved 72 beginner athletes aged 18–25 years selected through purposive sampling. Data were collected over 16 weeks through interviews, field observations, and motion video recordings analyzed using Kinovea. Kinematic data focused on joint angles, stride behavior, and movement phases during walking, running, and the flight phase. Qualitative data were analyzed using content analysis with NVivo 12, while kinematic results were interpreted descriptively to identify performance patterns and areas for technical refinement. Result: Kinematic analysis showed coordinated joint-angle patterns across all phases. Walking analysis identified arm swing angles of 50.9°–58.8° and leg separation angles of 64.3°–67.2°, indicating a stable gait rhythm. The running analysis revealed knee angles of 68.8°–69.8° and elbow angles of 87.6°–89.1°, indicating efficient propulsive mechanics. The flight phase demonstrated knee angles of 81.2°–87.8° and elbow angles of 80.4°–88.3°, suggesting effective momentum use and postural stability. These measurements supported stride-efficiency assessment and technique evaluation. Qualitative findings revealed that Kinovea enabled athletes to interpret movement phases and identify technical inefficiencies through slow-motion and frame-by-frame visualization. Conclusion: Kinovea supports basic motion analysis by providing clear kinematic information and helping beginner athletes observe and refine their movement techniques. The findings also offer practical value for coaches by enabling more precise identification of inefficient patterns and guiding targeted corrections during early-stage training."

OpenAlex,deep learning,Combating Data and Target Shifts in Visual Tasks,Zhaorui Tan,10.17638/03194353,2031-01-01,University of Liverpool,"The rapid advancement of deep learning models for visual tasks has led to significant progress in many domains. However, a key challenge remains: ensuring that models can generalize effectively to unseen samples or novel classes, especially in real-world scenarios where training data-target pairs are often limited or unavailable, and test data may exhibit shifts in both data and targets. This thesis addresses the problem of shifts across data and targets, proposing novel methods to improve model generalization and transferability in complex settings. The thesis identifies the different shift scenarios for visual tasks and presents their problem forms. The research first relaxes the static target distribution assumption in Multi-Domain Generalization (mDG) tasks, introducing the General Multi-Domain Generalization (GMDG) objective to improve generalization under varying data shifts. Specifically, Extensive experiments validate that GMDG is feasible for classification, segmentation, and regression tasks. Further considering extreme target distribution shifts where even unknown novel classes emerge, the study also explores logical regularization techniques for tasks such as Generalized Category Discovery (GCD), mDG+GCD, and Class Incremental Learning (CIL), proposing a sample-based logical regularization term (L-Reg) to enhance data-, target-, and all-shift generalization. Additionally, a partial logic framework is introduced to address challenges in CIL, enabling models to retain room for unknown classes during training. This is further extended by the Partial-Logic Regularization (PL-Reg), which improves generalization across GCD, mDG+GCD, and transferability for CIL tasks. Furthermore, the thesis proposes a novel Semantic-aware Data Augmentation (SADA) framework for cross-modality generalization in text-to-image synthesis (T2Isyn), text-image retrieval (TIR), and image-text retrieval (ITR) tasks. This framework ensures semantic preservation across text and image modalities, improving both semantic consistency and image quality in cross-modality tasks. The methods proposed in this thesis offer significant advancements in visual generalization and transfer scenarios, providing theoretical insights and practical solutions for handling data shifts, target shifts, and multi-modalities in complex scenarios. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of the proposed methods, demonstrating their superior performance across a range of tasks."
OpenAlex,deep learning,Antecedents and consequences of Green-tech FDI in emerging markets,Zhuoran Liu,10.17638/03195308,2031-01-01,University of Liverpool,"As environmental pressures intensify, attracting sustainable foreign direct investment (FDI), particularly green-tech FDI, has become a critical pathway for emerging markets to achieve environmental sustainability. However, existing research remains fragmented, offering limited insights into why green-tech FDI enters emerging markets and how it affects regional green innovation. This thesis addresses these gaps by systematically examining both the antecedents and consequences of green-tech FDI through three empirical studies using regional data from China. Study 1 and Study 2 focus on the antecedents of green-tech FDI. Study 1 examines how host-country conditions can attract green-tech FDI, highlighting the role of environmental management information disclosure (EMID) by domestic firms in reducing information gaps and strengthening green market–seeking motives. Study 2 shifts attention to the active decision-making of green-tech FDI, showing that under uncertainty, green-tech foreign investors engage in identity-based bandwagon learning by imitating peers with similar green identities, thereby mitigating investment risks. Study 3 turns to the consequences of green-tech FDI. It demonstrates that, due to the technological complexity of green innovation and limited absorptive capacity in emerging markets, green-tech FDI may generate crowding-out effects rather than purely positive spillovers. Adopting a network perspective, the study further finds that universities play a key moderating role: through broad linkages and deep collaborations, they help mitigate negative spillovers and facilitate the diffusion of green technologies. Together, the three studies advance the literature on sustainable FDI by differentiating green-tech FDI from general FDI and identifying the specific mechanisms that shape its entry decisions and local innovation outcomes. Practically, the findings provide guidance for emerging-market governments and firms on how to attract and manage sustainable investment, balance growth with environmental objectives, and strengthen local innovation ecosystems."
OpenAlex,deep learning,A UAV-Based Framework for Community-Scale Residential Building Energy Modelling in China,Mengfan Jin,10.17638/03195460,2029-01-01,University of Liverpool,"With increasing emphasis on energy efficiency and carbon emission reduction in the building sector, rapid and scalable energy modelling of existing buildings is critical for retrofit projects and policy development. Conventional surveys, data collection and energy modelling processes remain labour-intensive and impractical for large-scale applications, and energy modelling often dominates project time and cost. Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) equipped with high-resolution and infrared cameras now offer fast and safe exterior surveys, showing great potential in building energy assessments. Yet, a systematic framework for UAV integration, from image capture through processing to inputs for building energy simulation, has not been established. This research addresses these challenges by developing a structured framework for community-scale building energy modelling, which integrates UAV photogrammetry to accelerate data acquisition, reduce labour, and shorten energy modelling time for retrofit projects. The framework is designed to minimise prior data requirements while maximising automation and retaining sufficient accuracy and reliability. It also addressed systemic issues, such as the lack of data necessary to fully exploit the potential of available technologies in the context of this study. To achieve this research objective, a mixed-methodology approach, combining desk studies and fieldwork, was adopted. First, a comprehensive review of UAV-based building energy studies mapped the current applications and available tools, proposing a preliminary framework. Fieldwork then encompassed a pilot study and a detailed case study. In the pilot test, a single building was surveyed to identify an optimal toolchain for flight planning, image capture, photogrammetric reconstruction, model generation, and selection of a simulation platform. The resulting refined framework was applied to a case study of a 39-building community, and it was demonstrated that further automation was necessary. The potential for automation was then further explored. Geomatic algorithms, machine learning, and deep learning techniques were compared, and the combination that best balanced accuracy and processing time was selected for 3D model generation and window-to-wall ratio (WWR) extraction. In parallel, an archetype library of residential buildings in the Hot Summer Cold Winter (HSCW) zone in China was compiled to facilitate the assignment of thermal parameters. Finally, a reusable community-scale building energy modelling (CBEM) workflow was assembled in Grasshopper using Ladybug Tools components to process the aforementioned inputs. In conclusion, this study integrates UAV photogrammetry, GIS-based geomatic algorithms, machine learning, and graphical programming to develop an UAV-CBEM framework. The outcomes establish a foundation for scalable UAV-based building energy assessments, enhancing applicability in data-limited and large-scale settings worldwide."

OpenAlex,deep learning,Unsupervised Deep-learning Methods for Low-dose Computed Tomography Reconstruction,Ran An,10.17638/03194237,2027-01-01,University of Liverpool,"Computed tomography (CT) has become an indispensable imaging technique in medical diagnostics and industrial applications, owing to its non-invasive nature and high resolution in visualizing object internal structures. While X-ray CT (X-ray computed tomography) significantly enhances lesion detection capabilities, excessive exposure to X-ray radiation raises substantial health concerns, including elevated cancer risks and potential genetic damage. Although low-dose CT (LDCT) protocols reduce radiation safety concerns, they inevitably introduce severe noise and artifacts, which might compromise diagnostic accuracy. Recent advances in supervised deep learning approaches have demonstrated remarkable success in LDCT reconstruction. However, the reliance on paired training data severely limits their deployment in practical CT applications. This fundamental constraint highlights the critical importance of developing unsupervised reconstruction methods. Although existing unsupervised LDCT methods have made notable progress, they still face challenges requiring systematic solutions. This thesis makes three contributions to advance the field of unsupervised LDCT reconstruction: 1. Current dual-domain self-supervised LDCT denoising methods typically neglect the heterogeneity of the non-stationary Gaussian noise levels in low-dose sinograms and usually treat them as common images without appropriately controlling the denoising strength. The denoisers employed by them, which are based on classic convolutional neural networks (CNN), will lead to blurring artifacts in the reconstructed images if directly used for sinogram denoising. In addition, the denoising strength in the sinogram and image domains must be well-balanced to avoid introducing over-blurring or secondary artifacts in the reconstructed images, but existing approaches do not focus on this crucial point. To address these limitations, this thesis proposes a novel end-to-end dual-domain self-supervised framework for LDCT denoising. It employs Dropblock layers to adaptively localize the effect of convolution for sinogram denoising and sets a weighted average between the denoised sinograms and their noisy counterparts to better control the denoising strength, thus effectively reducing the blurring artifacts and leading to a well-balanced dual-domain denoising. Numerical experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and superior performance of the proposed method. 2. Existing normalizing flows (NFs)-based unsupervised LDCT reconstruction methods face challenges in both image quality and computational efficiency. On one hand, they typically utilize a two-way transformation strategy between noisy images and latent variables, which could easily lead to detail loss and secondary artifacts in the reconstructed images. On the other hand, training NFs on high-resolution CT images is computationally intensive. Although conditional normalizing flows (CNFs) can mitigate computational costs by learning conditional probabilities, existing approaches rely on labeled data for conditionalization, leaving unsupervised CNFs-based LDCT reconstruction a challenge. To tackle these issues, this thesis proposes a novel unsupervised LDCT iterative reconstruction algorithm based on CNFs. The proposed method employs a strict one-way transformation strategy during the alternating optimization in the dual spaces to prevent detail loss and secondary artifacts, and proposes a novel unsupervised conditionalization strategy for CNFs, thus achieving efficient training and inference on high-resolution images. The proposed method illustrates high-quality and relatively fast unsupervised reconstruction. Experiments across two datasets demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed method by rivaling several state-of-the-art methods. 3. Current diffusion model-based LDCT reconstruction methods solely employ the prior distributions learned from normal-dose CT data but neglect the valuable priors in low-dose data, which contain information about the characteristics of low-dose noise and artifacts. In addition, their reconstruction speed suffers from multiple sampling steps, presenting low efficiency. Breaking new ground in prior utilization, this thesis proposes a novel unsupervised LDCT iterative reconstruction algorithm based on dual denoising diffusion probabilistic models (DDPM), which leverages both normal-dose and low-dose priors. Specifically, the proposed method employs two DDPMs to learn the prior distributions from normal-dose and low-dose images, respectively, and incorporates them into a joint iterative reconstruction framework. To accelerate the reconstruction, partial diffusion sampling and single-pass deterministic reconstruction strategy are utilized in the proposed method, as well as the spaced OS-SART approaches. Experiments at different dose levels demonstrate the outstanding performance and fast speed of the proposed reconstruction algorithm. Through these innovations and contributions, this thesis addresses some significant challenges in current deep-learning-based unsupervised LDCT reconstruction methods, and proposes three novel unsupervised reconstruction algorithms. The proposed methods effectively improve the performance and efficiency of LDCT reconstruction under different unsupervised learning conditions, and provide some new perspectives and inspirations for future research."
OpenAlex,deep learning,From Sparse to Dense: Label-Efficient Weakly Supervised Segmentation for Images and Videos,Jian Wang,10.17638/03195330,2027-01-01,University of Liverpool,"Obtaining high-quality annotated data has become a primary bottleneck for training deep learning models, particularly for dense prediction tasks like semantic segmentation and video salient object segmentation. The demand for meticulous, pixel-level labeling makes fully-supervised approaches prohibitively expensive and limits their scalability. This thesis directly confronts this issue by proposing and systematically investigating a label-efficient ""sparse-to-dense'' paradigm. The core objective is to develop innovative frameworks that can learn from sparse, inexpensive weak supervision—such as image-level tags or scribbles—and intelligently propagate this minimal information to generate complete, pixel-accurate dense predictions. The major part of this thesis focuses on the ""sparse-to-dense'' challenge within Weakly Supervised Semantic Segmentation (WSSS) for images, where models learn from only image-level tags. Dominant approaches rely on Class Activation Maps (CAMs) as initial object seeds. However, CAMs inherently activate only the most discriminative object regions, leading to incomplete pseudo-labels. This gives rise to the central problem of activation densification: the critical process of expanding these sparse activations to cover the full extent of an object. Our research addresses this challenge through a progressive, multi-faceted strategy. Our exploration begins with a foundational framework (C3) designed to rectify the intrinsic flaws of initial CAMs. We propose a synergistic mutual calibration method. This method leverages the discrepancies between the two maps to generate local prototypes, which are simultaneously utilized to complete missing object parts and suppress background noise, yielding a significantly more accurate and complete initial seed. This foundational work immediately reveals the limitation of single-prototype instability and its inability to capture diverse features. Building on this foundation, we then develop architecture-specific strategies to address deeper limitations of the prototype-based approach. For Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) (C4), the use of a single prototype proves insufficient to capture significant intra-class variation. In response, we introduce an Optimal Transport (OT)-assisted framework that effectively mines multiple, diverse prototypes, thereby yielding more comprehensive activation maps. However, while C4 solves the intra-class diversity problem, the inherent local context constraint of the CNN architecture becomes the new bottleneck, fundamentally limiting the quality of globally-aware feature extraction needed for optimal multi-prototype assignment. This limitation necessitates a shift in architectural focus from CNNs to Vision Transformers. In the ViT architecture (C5), a new challenge arises where the token gap between the discriminative class token and varied patch tokens leads to incomplete activation. To bridge this gap, we leverage a tailored application of Optimal Transport, where the algorithm is tasked with learning a comprehensive proxy to ensure complete object activation. Despite these architectural advances (C3-C5), the overall WSSS performance hit a ceiling. This is fundamentally limited by the sparse supervision of class labels, which cannot provide precise boundary information. To break this ceiling, our WSSS exploration culminates in a universal enhancement strategy (C6) that transcends architecture-specific designs by leveraging Visual Foundation Models (VFMs). We resolve the conflict between the discriminative nature of initial CAMs and the VFM's need for holistic prompts. By modeling the CAM foreground as a graph and employing spectral analysis, our method intelligently selects a diverse set of prompt points that represent the overall structure of the foreground object. This guides the VFM to generate superior, boundary-aware supervision that can universally enhance any WSSS pipeline. Subsequently, the thesis extends the ""sparse-to-dense'' paradigm to the dynamic domain of video, addressing Weakly Supervised Video Salient Object Segmentation (WSVSOS) (C7) from sparse scribble annotations. In this specific context, the challenge evolves into spatio-temporal densification, which requires both full-object coverage within each frame and temporal consistency across the video sequences. To this end, we introduce the core CFMR framework, which utilizes Spatio-Temporal co-regulation. This framework is subsequently enhanced (CFMR+) by integrating the VFM guidance strategy from C6, which provides high-quality spatial priors essential for ensuring both high spatial detail and inter-frame consistency. By enforcing both intra-frame and cross-frame consistency between these two streams, our method effectively propagates the sparse initial signal to generate dense and temporally coherent saliency masks. In conclusion, this thesis presents a comprehensive and cohesive investigation into label-efficient segmentation tasks, offering a suite of innovative and effective strategies for the ""sparse-to-dense'' challenge. Our work establishes a progressive roadmap that systematically overcomes architectural and semantic limitations, culminating in highly robust and generalized densification pipelines. Our extensive experimental results on standard benchmarks validate the state-of-the-art performance of these methods, providing robust solutions to a long-standing problem in the computer vision field."

OpenAlex,deep learning,CCST-KFN: a novel unsupervised urban vegetation change detection approach for high-resolution RGB remote sensing imagery,Hong Fang; Jierui Yang; Jingxi Luo; Shanchuan Guo; Pengfei Tang; Peng Zhang; Yang Tao; Lin Cao,,2026-12-01,SHILAP Revista de lepidopterología,"Accurate detection of urban vegetation changes is essential for maintaining ecological balance and promoting sustainable urban development. Deep learning has become a leading technology for urban vegetation change detection, owing to its superior performance in feature representation and detection accuracy. High-resolution RGB remote sensing imagery has emerged as the key data source for deep learning-based urban vegetation change detection, due to its fine spatial detail and lower acquisition cost compared to high-resolution multispectral imagery. However, most of the existing urban vegetation change detection methods based on deep learning are supervised and require manually annotated training samples, limiting their automation and efficiency. In this study, we proposed a novel unsupervised urban vegetation change detection approach (CCST-KFN) for high-resolution RGB remote sensing imagery. Specifically, an advanced cross-scale change sample transfer (CCST) method was developed to automatically generate reliable high-resolution training samples. It first produces medium-resolution urban vegetation changed and unchanged samples by pre-detection, leveraging the more discriminative spectral features available in medium-resolution multispectral imagery. These samples are then mapped to the high-resolution domain guided by change information. In addition, a dedicated urban vegetation change detection network by fusing domain knowledge and change features (KFN) was designed for urban vegetation change mapping. It takes as input two high-resolution RGB images and two resampled enhanced normalized difference vegetation index images, which emphasize urban vegetation by combining near-infrared, red, and blue bands. This enables the network to effectively exploit the comprehensive features and domain knowledge of urban vegetation changes. Experiments on three typical urban datasets demonstrate that the proposed CCST-KFN identified urban vegetation changes more completely and with fewer errors compared to seven unsupervised change detection methods. Moreover, its application to a representative urban area in Nanjing City, China, further validates its practical effectiveness. Overall, the proposed CCST-KFN offers a reliable and automated solution for accurate urban vegetation change detection using high-resolution RGB remote sensing imagery, with the potential to further support urban ecological security and sustainable development."

OpenAlex,deep learning,Diseño y construcción de un sistema predictivo de congestión de tráfico basado en aprendizaje automático,Zehan Li,,2026-07-17,UPM Digital Archive (Technical University of Madrid),"Resumen: Este proyecto desarrolla un sistema de predicción de la intensidad del tráfico urbano mediante técnicas de aprendizaje profundo, con el objetivo de mejorar la toma de decisiones de movilidad. A diferencia de otras plataformas centradas en la visualización del estado actual, la solución propuesta busca anticipar comportamientos futuros, y se plantea como una alternativa abierta, replicable y específicamente orientada a la predicción. Para lograrlo, se ha diseñado una arquitectura modular basada en el lenguaje Python, capaz de integrar múltiples fuentes de datos abiertos: registros históricos del tráfico, datos históricos de situación meteorológica, y coordenadas espaciales de los sensores de medición. El sistema aplica un proceso de limpieza, interpolación temporal y transformación de variables, incluyendo la codificación cíclica del tiempo y la conversión espacial a coordenadas UTM, lo que permite una fusión precisa entre datos geográficos y meteorológicos mediante técnicas como la ponderación por distancia inversa (IDW). El modelo predictivo se basa en una red neuronal LSTM, especialmente adaptada para secuencias temporales multivariables. Se entrena utilizando una estrategia de ventana deslizante a 32 muestras (7 horas y 45 minutos) para predecir la intensidad de tráfico en el siguiente intervalo. El sistema incorpora además mecanismo de IterableDataset para manejar grandes volúmenes de datos de entrenamiento sin comprometer la estabilidad del entorno. Los resultados obtenidos muestran una precisión robusta en escenarios de validación, con errores de predicción (MAE y RMSE) aceptable. Además, se ha desarrollado una interfaz web interactiva, que permite el despliegue local del sistema, con capacidad de ingestión de datos en tiempo real y visualización directa de las predicciones.

Abstract This Project develops an urban traffic intensity prediction system using deep learning techniques, with the aim of improving mobility decision-making. Unlike other platforms focused on visualizing the current state, the proposed solution seeks to anticipate future behaviors, and is positioned as an open, replicable alternative specifically oriented towards prediction. To achieve this, a modular architecture based on the Python language has been designed, capable of integrating multiple open data sources: historical traffic records, historical weather situation data, and spatial coordinates of measurement sensors. The system applies a process of cleaning, temporal interpolation, and variable transformation, including cyclic encoding of time and spatial conversion to UTM coordinates, allowing for precise fusion between geographical and meteorological data through techniques such as inverse distance weighting (IDW). The predictive model is based on an LSTM neural network, especially adapted for multivariate time sequences. It is trained using a sliding window strategy of 32 samples (7 hours and 45 minutes) to predict traffic intensity in the next interval. The system additionally incorporates an IterableDataset mechanism to handle large volumes of training data without compromising the stability of the environment. The obtained results show robust accuracy in validation scenarios, with acceptable prediction errors (MAE and RMSE). Furthermore, an interactive web interface has been developed, allowing for the local deployment of the system, with the capacity for real-time data ingestion and direct visualization of predictions. This work demonstrates the technical and operational feasibility of applying deep learning to urban traffic analysis and lays the groundwork for its future evolution towards more generalizable, robust, and useful systems in real smart city contexts."
OpenAlex,deep learning,Deep Learning-Based Data Hiding Technique for Medical Images,Hadjer SAIDI,,2026-06-26,University of Biskra Theses Repository (University of Biskra),"This thesis introduces novel deep learning-based frameworks for secure medical image steganography, addressing the critical challenge of protecting sensitive patient information while preserving diagnostic quality. Medical images present unique security requirements due to their dual nature: containing both critical visual data for diagnosis and sensitive patient metadata, which conventional steganographic techniques do not adequately address. Our work presents two complementary approaches to this challenge. First, we develop a Mask-RCNN based framework that intelligently identifies diagnostically insignificant regions within medical images for strategic data embedding. By combining this regionaware detection with Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) embedding in the frequency domain, our method achieves remarkable imperceptibility with Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR) values exceeding 115 dB while maintaining high payload capacity. Second, we propose a clinical quality-aware convolutional neural network architecture that leverages an encoder-decoder framework for end-to-end steganography. This approach employs parallel processing paths with scaled residual learning to embed secret medical images within cover images while preserving diagnostic features. Extensive experimentation across multiple medical imaging modalities (CT, MRI) from datasets including MIDRC-RICORD-1B, and IQ-OTH/NCCD, demonstrates that our method achieves a good trade-off between payload and imperceptibility. The frameworks developed in this thesis achieve an optimal balance between embedding capacity, imperceptibility, and robust secret recovery, providing healthcare institutions with effective tools for safeguarding patient privacy while maintaining the integrity of medical diagnostics. This work significantly advances the field of medical image security and establishes a foundation for future innovations in secure healthcare information systems."
OpenAlex,deep learning,A Novel Deep-Learning-Based Approach for Estimating High-Resolution InSAR Parameters,"Dell Amore, Luca; Carcereri, Daniel; Demir, Begüm; Rizzoli, Paola",,2026-06-01,elib (German Aerospace Center),"Nowadays, SAR Interferometry (InSAR) represents one of the most powerful tools to perform complex tasks, such as retrieving Earth’s surface topography and monitoring its deformations. However, denoising strategies are crucial for the generation of reliable and high-quality InSAR products. In this framework, we propose a complete and generalized theoretical and statistical model to physically describe and simulate a noise-free interferogram, together with its corresponding noisy version, starting from the knowledge of the InSAR acquisition geometry and of the underlying topography. A deep-learning-based model is then trained in a fully-supervised manner to estimate high-resolution InSAR parameters, i.e. coherence and interferometric phase, leveraging the proposed statistical model. In particular, an accurate assessment of the network’s estimation performance is conducted by comparing it to state-of-the-art denoising filters, such as Boxcar and Phi-Net and showing the added value of the proposed theoretical modifications to the state-of-the-art literature."
