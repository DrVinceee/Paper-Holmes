PubMed,aortic stenosis,Evolution of the Aorta After Valve Replacement in Bicuspid Aortic Valves: Results at Mid-Term Follow-Up.,Raffaele Giordano; Shadi Hamameh; Vincenzo Speranza; Concetta Calanni; Emanuele Pilato; Luigi Di Tommaso,10.1016/j.hlc.2025.09.009,2026-01-19,"Heart, lung & circulation","Bicuspid aortic valve (BAV) is a common congenital heart defect often associated with ascending aorta dilation. Current guidelines suggest surgical intervention for diameters ≥45 mm in conjunction with surgical aortic valve replacement (SAVR). However, the optimal management of ascending aortas measuring 40-44 mm remains under debate. This study aims to evaluate the evolution of aortic diameter in patients with BAV and ascending aorta diameters between 40 and 44 mm undergoing aortic valve replacement, assessing whether a conservative approach is justified.
We conducted a retrospective observational study, analysing 88 patients with BAV who underwent SAVR between January 2012 and December 2018. Patients were divided into two groups based on preoperative ascending aorta diameters: <40 mm (Group 1, n=15) and the ≥40 and <45 mm (Group 2, n=11). Follow-up of at least 5 years included aortic dilation rates, survival, and reoperation rates.
No significant differences were observed in aortic dilation between the two groups during follow-up, with overall annual dilation rates of 0.2±0.07 mm/year. Survival rates were 86.3% for Group 1 and 81.9% for Group 2, with no reoperations required in either group.
Patients with BAV and ascending aorta diameters of 40-44 mm do not require prophylactic aortic replacement during AVR, provided they undergo regular follow-up. These findings support current guidelines advocating conservative management for ascending aorta diameters in this range. However, in younger patients or those nearing the 45 mm threshold, surgical replacement may still be considered to pre-empt future complications."

Our study aims to describe and compare the clinical, biochemical, and genetic profiles of pediatric patients diagnosed with FH based on LDL-C levels exceeding 400 mg/dL (10.4 mmol/L) and confirmed by biallelic pathogenic variants in low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR) or low-density lipoprotein receptor adapter protein-1 (LDLRAP1) genes.
This retrospective cohort study included 39 pediatric patients diagnosed with FH at a tertiary care center. Clinical data were analyzed, including age at diagnosis, family history, lipid profile, presence of xanthomas, and cardiovascular complications. Molecular analysis was conducted using next-generation sequencing (NGS) and Sanger sequencing to confirm pathogenic variants. Statistical comparisons were performed between the LDLR and LDLRAP1 variant groups regarding lipid profiles, treatment response, and cardiovascular outcomes.
Among 39 patients, 32 and 7 had pathogenic variants in LDLR and LDLRAP1 genes, respectively. Genetic analysis identified 27 unique pathogenic variants in LDLR (including 5 novel mutations) and 4 in LDLRAP1 causal for autosomal recessive hypercholesterolemia (ARH), highlighting the molecular diversity of FH. Compared to the LDLR variant group, LDLRAP1 variant patients had significantly lower untreated LDL-C levels (640.0 ± 155.6 mg/dL [16.6 ± 4.0 mmol/L] vs 506.9 ± 130.1 mg/dL [13.1 ± 3.4 mmol/L], P = .026] and showed a superior response to lipid-lowering therapy (LLT), with a greater percentage (70.6% ± 12.0%) reduction in LDL-C levels (P = .015). While xanthomas were present in 62.5% of LDLR variant patients, they were less frequent (42.9%) in the LDLRAP1 group (P = .107). Cardiovascular complications were observed exclusively in LDLR variant patients. Fourteen patients required lipoprotein apheresis (LA), and one underwent liver transplantation due to severe aortic stenosis.
This study highlights the importance of genetic testing in differentiating classical semidominant homozygous FH from ARH, given their phenotypic overlap but distinct treatment responses. LDLRAP1 variant patients with ARH exhibit better LDL-C reductions with conventional LLT, suggesting a milder phenotype. Early diagnosis, aggressive LLT, and novel treatments are essential to mitigate cardiovascular risk. Future studies with larger cohorts and long-term follow-ups are needed to refine treatment strategies for pediatric FH."

Beyond being an incidental finding, MAC contributes to mitral valve dysfunction, arrhythmias, systemic embolisation and elevated cardiovascular risk. In developed countries, it has now overtaken rheumatic disease as the leading cause of mitral stenosis.The pathophysiology of MAC involves chronic mechanical stress, pro-inflammatory activation and osteogenic differentiation of valvular cells. Progression is accelerated by age, chronic kidney disease and metabolic derangements. Diagnosing MAC-related valve dysfunction is challenging, as traditional echocardiographic measures often prove unreliable. Multimodality imaging-including 3D echocardiography and cardiac CT-is essential for assessing anatomy, function and procedural feasibility. Importantly, symptoms often reflect combined valvular (eg, aortic stenosis) and myocardial disease (eg, heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) phenocopy), necessitating careful haemodynamic evaluation to avoid futile interventions.Management should prioritise medical therapy for symptom control and comorbid HFpEF, reserving interventions for selected patients. Surgical and transcatheter approaches carry high risk and should be undertaken only in specialised centres. Future advances may include tailored devices and therapies targeting calcification pathways."

Advances,"The specific anatomy of bicuspid aortic valve (BAV) increases the incidence of ≥ mild paravalvular leakage (PVL) after transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR).
The purpose of this study was to develop and validate a model for predicting post-TAVR PVL in patients with BAV.
A total of 1,080 patients (373 cases with type 0 and 707 cases with type 1) undergoing TAVR were analyzed. The random forest (RF) model was established to predict PVL. Logistic regression analysis was used to investigate predictive differentiation and accuracy values based on the receiver-operating characteristic curve. Additionally, 109 cases further verified the reliability and stability of the model.
The RF model of the derivation data set produced 7 predictors, including the corrected calcification volume (Corr-CV) of leaflets, the Corr-CV of annular surroundings, the Corr-CV of the left ventricular outflow tract, the perimeter of the left ventricular outflow tract, the plane/perimeter of the supra-annular plane, horizontal aorta, annular ellipticity, and postdilation. The area under the curve (AUC), accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity of the RF and the logistic model were 0.982, 0.994, 0.997, 0.993, and 0.978, 0.951, 0.917, 0.957, respectively. The AUC of the RF model in the validation data set was 0.975, whereas the AUC of the logistic analysis model was 0.988. Furthermore, the decision curve analysis and clinical impact curve analysis verified the clinical applicability and net benefit.
The machine learning model with 7 predictors effectively identifies post-TAVR PVL risk in patients with BAV stenosis, aiding procedural planning and PVL prevention. (Study on Standard Evaluation System and Optimal Treatment Path of Senile Valvular Heart Disease; NCT05044338)."

We aimed to evaluate the association of SA with LV function, remodelling, and clinical outcomes in AF patients undergoing AVR.
We analyzed AF patients undergoing AVR between 2000 and 2023. Inverse-probability-of-treatment weighting (IPTW) was used to adjust for baseline differences. Temporal changes in LV ejection fraction (LVEF) and LV mass index (LVMI) were assessed using nonlinear mixed-effect models based on 1,974 echocardiographic measurements.
Among 389 patients (aged 68.8 ± 8.2 years), 258 (66.3%) underwent SA. In the IPTW-adjusted cohort, SA was not associated with increased operative mortality (P = 0.262). During a median follow-up of 5.2 years, all-cause mortality (P = 0.174) and stroke (P = 0.580) were similar between groups. In longitudinal analyses, SA showed a non-significant trend towards higher LVEF in the overall cohort (inter-group P = 0.055) and no significant differences in LVMI (P = 0.158). In patients with ≥3 echocardiograms (n = 248), between-group differences became significant, with higher LVEF (5-year difference +3.0%; 95% confidence interval [CI], +0.3 to + 5.4; P = 0.031, inter-group P = 0.003) and lower LVMI (1-year difference -13.0 g/m2; 95% CI, -20.4 to - 5.4; P = 0.003, inter-group P = 0.032). Associations were more pronounced in patients with aortic stenosis.
SA during AVR was associated with modestly more favorable LV remodelling without increasing operative or long-term clinical risks. Given small absolute differences, these findings should be interpreted cautiously, and further studies with longer follow-up are warranted."

In 2024, pembrolizumab was approved as a first-line treatment for unresectable or recurrent gastric cancer. Conversion surgery following ICI-based chemotherapy has been reported; however, cases involving pembrolizumab-based first-line therapy remain rare. Here, we report a case of conversion surgery after treatment with capecitabine plus oxaliplatin (CAPOX), combined with pembrolizumab for unresectable advanced gastric cancer.
An 82-year-old man presented with anorexia and was referred to our department for surgical evaluation. Upper gastrointestinal endoscopy revealed circumferential type 3 gastric cancer extending from the lower gastric body to the antrum with pyloric stenosis. Contrast-enhanced CT showed para-aortic lymph node metastases, resulting in a diagnosis of stage IVB gastric cancer (cT4aN2M1, 15th edition of the Japanese Classification of Gastric Carcinoma [JGCA]). First, we performed a laparoscopic gastrojejunal bypass to treat anorexia and oral intake difficulties due to pyloric stenosis. The patient then received 5 cycles of CAPOX plus pembrolizumab. Subsequent upper gastrointestinal endoscopy revealed significant scarring with residual cancer cells, and contrast-enhanced CT showed significant shrinkage of the primary tumor lesion and para-aortic lymph nodes. Because R0 resection was achievable, we performed conversion surgery involving open distal gastrectomy with D2 and para-aortic lymphadenectomy. Postoperative pathological findings revealed a small number of residual cancer cells in the submucosa, with no viable cancer cells detected in the para-aortic lymph nodes (ypT1bN0M0, ypStage IA). The pathological response grade was 2b according to the 15th edition of the JGCA. At 6 months postoperatively, the patient remains alive and recurrence-free.
Conversion surgery after CAPOX plus pembrolizumab chemotherapy is a potential therapeutic strategy for unresectable advanced gastric cancer."

Despite advancements in technology and operator experience, major vascular complications remain a concern, potentially affecting outcomes. This study aimed to assess the incidence, risk factors, and clinical impact of major vascular complications following transfemoral transcatheter aortic valve implantation using propensity score matching.
We retrospectively analyzed patients who underwent transfemoral transcatheter aortic valve implantation. Patients were divided in two groups: patients occurred major vascular complications (MVC group) and those who did not present the complication (No-MVC group). The primary end-point was the 30-day mortality. A 1:1 propensity score matching was performed, and clinical outcomes were compared at 30 days and up to 2 years.
Between 2012 to 2023, a total of 2,296 underwent a percutaneous-transfemoral approach. Major vascular complications occurred in 6.6% (n = 151) and were associated with increased transfusion requirement, major bleeding, reinterventions, and longer hospital stays. Female sex, obesity, higher STS score, use of the Manta closure device, and post-implantation balloon valvuloplasty were independently associated with major vascular complications. The 30-day mortality was similar between groups (p = 0.723). The long-term survival was lower in the MVC group (p = 0.016). Two-year survival after propensity score matching did not differ between groups (p = 0.08).
Major vascular complications after transfemoral transcatheter valve implantation are associated with worse clinical outcomes and reduced long-term survival despite similar at 30-day mortality. Recognizing high-risk patients, optimizing procedural planning, and considering alternative access routes may help reduce vascular complications."

This review aims to provide a look across the spectrum of understanding BVD, presenting insights from fundamental and translational science through to the clinic to give a comprehensive overview of the mechanisms underlying BVD in TAVI valves. This review highlights the pivotal role of multimodality imaging in detection, classification and monitoring of degeneration and discusses the emerging pharmacological and engineering innovations aimed at preventing degeneration. Finally, reintervention strategies, including redo-TAV and surgical explantation, are explored with an emphasis on CT-based planning and bench-testing insights that have enhanced our understanding of BVD and inform ongoing procedural refinement. These perspectives support a proactive and tailored approach to managing transcatheter aortic valve degeneration across the patient's lifetime."

However, there is little information on its impact on long-term prognosis in a population without valvular disease. To examine the impact of LFS on all-cause mortality in multi-ethnic population we analyzed 4398 asymptomatic participants without clinical cardiovascular disease undergoing cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) in the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis. LV stroke volume index (SVi), LVEF and myocardial contraction fraction (MCF) were measured. LV flow states were classified as normal flow state (NFS, SVi >35 ml/m2), low-flow state (LFS, 30-34 ml/m2) and very low-flow state (VLFS: SVi <30 ml/m2). Clinical data were collected at enrollment. Participants were followed up for a median of 14.2 years. All-cause and cardiovascular disease mortalities were used as primary endpoints. All-cause mortality was 16.2% and cardiovascular disease mortality 3.5%. VLFS and LFS groups had more cardiovascular risk factors and lower cardiac performance than NFS. The relationship between all-cause mortality and SVi was ""L-shape with the ""breakpoint"" at 33.5ml/m2 for a statistical significance (p=0.009). All-cause mortality was significantly associated with LFS after adjusted for age, sex, LVEF, and LV mass index with hazard ratio (HR) 1.81, 95% CI: 1.31-2.49 for VLF and HR: 1.21, 95% CI: 0.95-1.54 for LFS with overall p value 0.001).

A 74-year-old man with extensive comorbidities and prior TAVI-in-TAVI (Evolut and Sapien valves) presented with chest pain and troponin elevation. Angiography showed severe left main artery and left anterior descending artery stenoses, but selective coronary engagement was impossible given complete neoskirt obstruction. Using transcatheter electrosurgery, a Steelcore guidewire insulated in a microcatheter was energized to perforate the neoskirt. Percutaneous coronary intervention with drug-eluting stents was successfully completed, with an excellent final result.
To our knowledge, this is the first report of electrosurgical neoskirt perforation to enable coronary revascularization after TAVI-in-TAVI.
Electrosurgery can safely perforate a neoskirt, restoring coronary access. This novel strategy may become essential as TAVI-in-TAVI procedures increase."

We report two elderly females who developed thiamine deficiency-related high-output circulatory states, initially leading to an overestimation of AS severity. Case 1 was assessed as severe but was downgraded to moderate after thiamine replacement, and case 2 was initially assessed as moderate but was reclassified as mild after treatment. Case 1 had a history of gastrectomy, predisposing her to thiamine deficiency due to limited postoperative intake and a more alkaline gastric environment. Case 2 had liver cirrhosis and was on long-term spironolactone and loop diuretics, contributing to thiamine depletion via renal losses and impaired gastrointestinal utilization. Both patients exhibited refractory edema and hyperdynamic left ventricular wall motion. Thiamine deficiency impairs adenosine triphosphate production, reducing systemic vascular resistance and triggering compensatory high-output circulatory states. Prompt thiamine replacement improved symptoms and hemodynamic parameters. These cases highlight the importance of recognizing reversible high-flow states to avoid misinterpretation of AS severity and ensure accurate evaluation and management."

We describe the anesthetic management of a 37-year-old multiparous patient with severe multivalvular disease (severe mitral stenosis, severe aortic insufficiency, and severe tricuspid regurgitation with stenosis) and atrial fibrillation, presenting with signs of congestive heart failure, who was submitted to an elective cesarean section at 37 weeks of gestation. Following admission, she received targeted medical optimization in a cardiac intensive care setting, including rate control and diuretic therapy, with subsequent clinical improvement. Anticoagulation with low-molecular-weight heparin was suspended 24 hours before surgery. Considering her fixed cardiac output and the potential harm of abrupt hemodynamic shifts during surgery, a slow-onset epidural anesthesia under invasive monitoring was performed. Incremental boluses of 0.75% ropivacaine, combined with early vasopressor support, allowed for an adequate sensory block, maintaining hemodynamic stability throughout surgery. Intraoperative tachyarrhythmia was managed through cautious fluid administration and pharmacological treatment. Oxytocin was carefully and slowly administered to prevent sudden reductions in systemic vascular resistance. Since resumption of therapeutic anticoagulation was planned due to high thromboembolic risk, the epidural catheter was removed at the end of the surgery. A multimodal analgesic strategy was adopted, including a single epidural morphine bolus and bilateral transversus abdominis plane blocks. Both maternal and neonatal outcomes were favorable. This case highlights the importance of meticulous preoperative optimization and planning, the safety of graded neuraxial anesthesia, and the need for multidisciplinary discussion when managing parturients with advanced multivalvular heart disease."

We sought to develop and validate an algorithm-based rules engine to identify patients with untreated sAS and to evaluate differences between those who did and did not subsequently receive guideline-concordant treatment with aortic valve replacement (AVR).
We curated discrete and nondiscrete data from our echocardiography system, then created a rules engine to identify and grade aortic stenosis. We assessed sensitivity and specificity of the rules engine to identify sAS using manual adjudication. We additionally conducted a retrospective cohort analysis to identify demographic and socioeconomic factors associated with receipt of guideline-concordant AVR treatment for sAS.
The rules engine demonstrated 100% sensitivity and 95.4% specificity for identifying sAS across n ​= ​2162 echocardiographic studies from unique patients. Univariate analyses revealed patients with untreated sAS were more likely to be older and female, with no appreciated differences by race, ethnicity, insurance status, or neighborhood-level socioeconomic scores. In multivariable analyses, older individuals, women, and those with Medicare/Medicare advantage were less likely to undergo AVR. Among treated patients, those who underwent surgical AVR were more likely to be younger, male, and have lower socioeconomic neighborhood scores.
Untreated sAS is prevalent but can be accurately identified at scale using an echocardiogram report-based rules engine. Disparities in the receipt of AVR persist, particularly among women, older adults, and patients with nonprivate insurance coverage. The systematic use of automated algorithmic protocols may facilitate valvular heart disease identification and reduction of treatment disparities."

Timely transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) may reverse these processes. Transfemoral access remains the primary access method for TAVR, but the limited technique restricts early intervention in patients with narrow femoral arteries. This study aimed to evaluate the safety and feasibility of a novel balloon dilation in sheath (BinS) technique designed to facilitate transfemoral TAVR in such patients.
This multicenter, prospective, and first-in-human early feasibility study included patients with severe AS and challenging femoral anatomy who underwent TAVR using the BinS technique between February 2023 and August 2024. The primary endpoint was the 30-day rate of major adverse events. The secondary endpoint was the rate of major adverse events at 6 months. The clinical endpoints included major post-procedural complications.
Fifteen patients (mean age 73.5 ± 7.3 years; 66.7% male) were treated successfully with the BinS technique via transfemoral access. There were no cases of all-cause mortality, stroke/transient ischemic attack, or severe major vascular access site complications defined by Valve Academic Research Consortium (VARC)-3 at both 30 days and 6 months. No myocardial infarction or paravalvular leakage was observed. 12 patients obtained VARC-3 technical success. Two patients experienced postprocedural arterial dissection, and two developed new-onset conduction abnormalities (left bundle branch block or permanent pacemaker implantation). At 30 days, left ventricular ejection fraction improved significantly from 50.8 ± 17.0% pre-procedure to 59.9 ± 14.6% post-procedure (p < 0.001).
The BinS technique appears to be a safe and effective method for enlarging the narrow femoral lumens during TAVR. By broadening transfemoral TAVR eligibility, this approach may permit earlier hemodynamic unloading, thereby mitigating adverse cardiac remodeling and potentially improving long-term outcomes. Larger, longer-term studies are warranted to confirm these findings."

Case reports,"Suicide left ventricle (LV) is a rare, potentially fatal complication after transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI). It is typically caused by dynamic left ventricular outflow tract obstruction (LVOTO) following abrupt afterload reduction. Accelerated junctional rhythm (AJR) is an uncommon peri-procedural arrhythmia, and its role in precipitating suicide LV has not been reported.
An 87-year-old woman with extremely severe aortic stenosis was admitted for transfemoral TAVI. Concentric LV hypertrophy with a sigmoid septum and preserved systolic function was observed on baseline transthoracic echocardiography. She developed profound hypotension immediately after valve deployment. Transoesophageal echocardiography (TOE) revealed severe LVOTO and marked mitral regurgitation (MR) due to systolic anterior motion (SAM) of the mitral valve. The simultaneous appearance of AJR abolished atrial contraction, further reducing LV preload. Left ventricular outflow tract obstruction and SAM resolved during sinus rhythm, but recurred during AJR. Haemodynamics improved with rapid volume loading, vasoconstrictor administration and continuous right ventricular pacing, thereby reducing obstruction via induced ventricular dyssynchrony. Accelerated junctional rhythm resolved spontaneously following emergence from anaesthesia, and a stable sinus rhythm was maintained. The patient was discharged on postoperative Day 12 without recurrence.
This case reports AJR as a novel trigger for suicide LV after TAVI, leading to preload reduction and promoting SAM, LVOTO, and MR. Intraoperative TOE provided clear rhythm-dependent imaging of LVOT dynamics. Vigilant rhythm monitoring and prompt, targeted haemodynamic management, including pacing to induce ventricular dyssynchrony, are crucial for prevention and treatment in predisposed patients with small, hypertrophied ventricles with a sigmoid septum."

We retrospectively reviewed 4,567 transthoracic echocardiograms (TTEs) in adults between 18 and 65 years of age for tiger stripes on pulsed-wave (PW)/continuous-wave (CW) Doppler and correlated with valve pathology, presence of oscillating masses, and clinical findings.
Tiger stripes occurred in 5.4% of studies (95% CI 4.8-6.1%), predominantly with mitral and aortic regurgitation jets (MR/AR) and high-velocity tricuspid regurgitation (TR) jets. Stripes were not seen when oscillating masses were present, and were more conspicuous in mild-moderate jets and higher-velocity Doppler spectra. Audible Doppler cooing sound was common; no association with clinical musical murmurs.
Tiger stripes may represent a benign spectral Doppler artifact. In isolation, they should not prompt additional imaging for oscillating masses or be used to grade regurgitation severity."

A retrospective analysis was conducted over six years to identify patients with MVP and moderate mitral regurgitation who had undergone cardiac MRI. The study included 20 patients and 20 healthy controls. Functional and strain assessments of the left ventricle (LV), right ventricle (RV), and left atrium (LA) were performed and compared to those of healthy controls. LACI was determined by calculating the ratio of the LA end-diastolic volume indexed to the left ventricular end-diastolic volume indexed, and it was correlated with conventional CMR and strain parameters. Native T1 mapping was used as a non-contrast CMR technique to assess diffuse myocardial fibrosis in all patients. LACI revealed a negative correlation with left ventricular end-diastolic volume indexed to body surface area (LVEDVI) and total left atrial ejection fraction (LAEF) (r = -0.39, -0.65, P < 0.05, respectively). In addition, LACI showed a correlation with strain parameters, specifically with LA longitudinal peak positive strain rate and left ventricular global circumferential strain (LV GCS) (r = 0.35, -0.49, P < 0.05, respectively). The results from the multivariate regression analysis indicated that the left atrial longitudinal reservoir strain (ξs) was independently associated with left ventricular ejection fraction [β = 0.529; 95% confidence intervals (CI) = 0.192 to 0.866] and LV GRS [β = 0.229; 95% CI = 0.128 to 0.330]. There were statistically significant differences in LACI and LA ξs between patients who experienced clinical events such as arrhythmia and those who did not, with p-values of < 0.05. Strain parameters showed better results in evaluating LA and LV coupling in our patient group. Elevated native T1 values correlated with LACI, impaired LV, and LA strain parameters."

Advances,"Transcatheter tricuspid valve intervention (TTVI) has emerged as a valuable therapeutic option for patients with severe tricuspid regurgitation. However, the impact of TTVI on right ventricular (RV) function remains incompletely understood, partly due to the limitations of conventional echocardiographic parameters.
The purpose of this study was to evaluate RV functional trajectories in patients undergoing TTVI using a deep learning model that estimates RV ejection fraction (RVEF) from two-dimensional apical four-chamber view echocardiographic videos.
This single-center analysis included 373 patients undergoing TTVI for severe tricuspid regurgitation between 2018 and 2023. A previously published and thoroughly validated deep learning model was used to predict RVEF at baseline and 1 to 3 days after the procedure. The primary endpoint was 1-year all-cause mortality.
Although the median deep learning-predicted RVEFs were similar before and after TTVI at the cohort level, individual trajectories diverged. Using maximally selected log-rank statistics, an optimal prognostic threshold of 38% for postprocedural RVEF was identified. Patients below this threshold showed significantly worse 1-year survival compared to those above it (58.4% vs 85.1%; HR: 3.12; P < 0.001). RVEF in this high-risk group had declined from 41% (IQR: 38%-44%) at baseline to 36% (IQR: 35%-37%) postprocedurally (P < 0.001).
Deep learning enabled an unbiased echocardiographic assessment of RV function after TTVI and identified a high-risk group with poor outcomes. These findings are exploratory and require external validation; if confirmed, deep learning-enhanced echocardiography may improve risk stratification and guide personalized follow-up strategies in patients undergoing TTVI."

Eighty-eight patients under 18 years who underwent ALCAPA repair from 2003 to 2022 were included. Baseline clinical and echocardiographic data, including MR and left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF), were recorded pre-operatively and at multiple post-operative follow-ups (discharge, 1 month, 6 months, 1 year, and annually thereafter). Friedman's Test and correlation/regression analyses were used to assess the impact of pre-operative MR on ventricular function recovery. The median age at surgery was 6 months(range 1-197), and the median hospital stay was 17 days. 56.81% of patients had moderate to severe MR pre-operatively, while only 25% had moderate to severe MR at 1-year follow-up. Mitral valve repair was performed in 44% of cases with significant MR. Pre-operative MR grades positively correlated with post-operative MR (ρ = 0.574, p < 0.001) and pre-operative LVEF correlated with post-operative LVEF (ρ = 0.698, p < 0.001). Linear regression analysis showed that patients with lesser MR had more change in LVEF (38 to 63.66%) than the moderate to severe MR group (42.22% to 66.38%, odd's ratio=-3.073, p = 0.024). Irrespective of severity of pre-operative MR, left ventricular function improved significantly after the surgical repair. Patients with pre-operative mild MR tended to experience more pronounced gains in LVEF following repair."

From July 2022 to April 2025, a total of 50 video-assisted minimally invasive combined heart valve surgeries were performed in the Department of Cardiovascular Surgery of the First Affiliated Hospital of Anhui Medical University. Combined heart valve procedures include mitral and tricuspid valve surgery and mitral and aortic valve surgery, as well as large atrial septal defect repair combined with mitral and tricuspid valve surgery. The 4th right intercostal incision along the anterior axillary line was set as the primary access for the surgical procedure of combined mitral and tricuspid valves. The 3rd intercostal incision next to the sternum was set as the primary access for the surgical procedure of combined aortic and mitral valves. The 4th right intercostal incision along the midclavicular line was set as the primary access for the surgical procedure of combined mitral and tricuspid valves concomitant with a large defect of the atrial septal. The perioperative data of patients was collected.
All patients underwent the video-assisted minimally invasive surgery completely. A total of 49 patients were discharged as expected except for only 1 older patient who was transferred into a local medical institution for extended rehabilitation due to delayed postoperative awakening. Postoperatively, excellent function of replaced prosthetic valves without paravalvular leaking has been confirmed. Moreover, there was no or less than mild regurgitation for repaired mitral and tricuspid valves. Also, postoperative complications, including III atrioventricular block, renal failure, and severe hypoxaemia, have not been found.
Video-assisted minimally invasive surgery for combined heart valves is safe and effective with a short-term satisfactory outcome."

We conducted a meta-analysis of randomised trials comparing long-term outcomes between these treatment strategies.
We aimed to compare long-term clinical outcomes between TEER plus GDMT and GDMT alone in symptomatic moderate-to-severe FMR.
Major electronic databases were searched for randomised trials comparing TEER plus GDMT with GDMT alone in FMR. The primary outcome was death or first hospitalisation due to heart failure at 24 months. The key secondary outcome was first hospitalisation due to heart failure at 24 months. Summary hazard ratios (HRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were computed by mixed-effects Cox models based on reconstructed time-to-first event individual patient data and random-effects models based on study-level data.
Three randomised trials (MITRA-FR, COAPT, and RESHAPE-HF2) were included, for a total of 1,422 patients assigned to TEER plus GDMT (n=703) or GDMT alone (n=719). The primary outcome was significantly lower in the TEER plus GDMT group compared with the GDMT-alone group by one-stage analysis (HR 0.72, 95% CI: 0.56-0.92; p=0.010). However, the two-stage analysis marginally failed to confirm this result (HR 0.72, 95% CI: 0.51-1.00; p=0.052) and showed substantial heterogeneity (I²=80.3%; p=0.006). Hospitalisation due to heart failure was significantly lower in the TEER plus GDMT group, regardless of the statistical method used (one-stage: HR 0.65, 95% CI: 0.48-0.88; p=0.006; two-stage: HR 0.66, 95% CI: 0.45-0.96; p=0.031). However, heterogeneity was substantial (I²=81.2%; p=0.005). All-cause death and cardiovascular death at 24 months were not significantly different between treatment groups but became significant after excluding MITRA-FR in the leave-one-out analysis.
In symptomatic moderate-to-severe FMR, TEER plus GDMT significantly reduces death or hospitalisation due to heart failure and hospitalisation due to heart failure at 24 months."

This study aimed to assess medium-term outcomes and identify key predictive factors of mortality or surgical reintervention at 2 years after transcatheter PVL closure.
The prospective Fermeture de Fuite ParaProthétique (FFPP) Registry included consecutive symptomatic patients undergoing transcatheter PVL closure across 24 European centres between 2017 and 2019. Predictive factors for mortality and surgical reintervention were analysed over a 2-year follow-up.
A total of 213 symptomatic patients underwent 237 procedures. The mean age was 68±11 years, with a median European System for Cardiac Operative Risk Evaluation (EuroSCORE) II of 6 (interquartile range [IQR] 4-10). PVL involved the mitral valve in 64.6% of cases and mechanical prostheses in 53.3%. Heart failure and haemolytic anaemia were present in 89.5% and 49.8% of patients, respectively. The transapical approach was used in 6.8% of cases. Technical success was achieved in 87.3% of procedures, and clinical success at 1 month was achieved in 70.5% of patients. The median follow-up was 24.4 months (IQR 23.2-26.4). The survival rate at 2 years without the need for surgical reintervention was 66.1% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 60.1-72.7). Multivariate analysis identified mitral PVL, mechanical valves, and haemolytic anaemia as independent risk factors for adverse outcomes during follow-up. The absence of clinical success at 1 month was the strongest predictor of adverse outcomes (hazard ratio 5.00, 95% CI: 2.70-9.09; p=0.001).
Transcatheter PVL closure offers a durable therapeutic option for high-risk patients when early clinical success is achieved. Mitral valve involvement, mechanical prostheses, and haemolytic anaemia remain key predictors of poor outcomes over a 2-year follow-up."

Eighty-nine adult patients with unrepaired ASD underwent comprehensive echocardiography and right heart catheterization. ePLAR and additional echocardiographic parameters were measured, and their ability to identify elevated PVR (≥5 Wood Units, WU) was assessed through correlation and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis. PVR ≥ 5 group showed elevated ePLAR (0.41 vs. 0.29, p < 0.0001. ePLAR showed moderate ability to predict elevated PVR (AUC 0.754). The TR Vmax/ right ventricular outflow tract velocity-time integral (RVOT VTI) and TR Vmax²/RVOT VTI ratio demonstrated stronger discrimination (AUC 0.907 and 0.929).

LASr is typically assessed using speckle-tracking echocardiography (STE), which was developed to measure strain in the left ventricle. Despite its strength demonstrated in several clinical studies, the application of STE to the left atrium presents well-known limitations: thin walls, anatomical discontinuities, far-field location, and inter-vendor variability. The present study aims to evaluate the efficacy of an alternative method for assessing LASr, based on the percentage shortening of the atrial wall contour, by directly comparing it with STE-derived LASr values.
We retrospectively analyzed 246 patients in sinus rhythm with severe organic mitral regurgitation. The 2D contour strain method quantifies changes in the length of the two-dimensional (2D) endocardial atrial wall contour between end-systolic and end-diastolic frames. The peak strain value is calculated as: (maximum perimeter length-minimum perimeter length)/maximum perimeter length × 100.
2D contour strain measurements were feasible in all patients. A strong correlation was observed between STE-derived and 2D contour-derived LASr values, with an R-value of 0.93. On average, 2D contour strain measurements underestimated LA peak strain by approximately 1% compared to STE. The consistency of 2D contour LA strain measurements, as assessed by inter- and intra-observer reproducibility, was excellent.
These findings suggest that 2D contour LA strain is a feasible and reliable alternative to STE for assessing LASr. This approach is particularly valuable in echocardiography labs where STE software for LA is unavailable."

While mitral valve replacement (MVR) alone may improve left heart parameters, concomitant tricuspid ring annuloplasty (TRA) might prevent right-sided deterioration.
This retrospective study analyzed 129 patients undergoing MVR between 2016 and 2019. Patients were divided into two groups: isolated MVR (n = 71) and MVR+TRA (n = 58). Long-term echocardiographic outcomes were compared, including LVDD, LVSD, LVEF, LA diameter, IVS thickness, pulmonary flow rate, PAP, and TI degree.
Both groups showed regression in left heart dimensions postoperatively; however, left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) significantly decreased in the MVR-only group (p < 0.001) while it remained stable in the MVR + TRA group (p = 0.598). Severe tricuspid insufficiency occurred in 12 % (95 % CI 5-21 %) of patients undergoing isolated MVR and 0 % (95 % CI 0-6 %) of those undergoing MVR + TRA (p < 0.001).

Demographic characteristics, echocardiographic parameters, and clinical data were compared between groups. Major adverse cardiovascular and cerebrovascular event (MACCE) and circulating levels of brain natriuretic peptide, Apelin, and Galectin-3 were analyzed.
Patients with MAC were older and showed higher prevalence of aortic annular calcification, mitral leaflet thickening, and moderate-to-severe tricuspid regurgitation (P < 0.05). Multivariate analysis identified gender, age, aortic annular calcification, moderate-to-severe tricuspid regurgitation, and mitral leaflet thickening as independent risk factors for MAC. Patients with MAC showed larger left ventricular end-diastolic volume, reduced left ventricular ejection fraction, and greater left atrium mass, and a higher incidence of MACCE than those without MAC (P < 0.05).
In HOCM undergoing septal myectomy, MAC is associated with adverse cardiac remodeling and unfavorable clinical outcomes. Identification of related factors may aid risk stratification and perioperative management."

However, the prognostic relevance of left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) in this population remains unclear.
We analyzed data from 821 patients undergoing M-TEER at four German tertiary care centers between 2011 and 2022. Patients were stratified into heart failure subgroups based on LVEF: heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF, LVEF ≥50%), mildly reduced ejection fraction (HFmrEF, LVEF 41-49%), and reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF, LVEF ≤40%). Propensity score matching was used to balance baseline characteristics. The primary endpoint was all-cause mortality, with secondary endpoints including cardiovascular mortality and major adverse cardiac and cerebrovascular events (MACCE).
HFrEF patients exhibited greater comorbid burden, including higher rates of coronary artery disease and functional MR. Despite these differences, no significant association was observed between LVEF and long-term mortality, even after propensity score matching. Long-term survival rates at three years were similar across subgroups: 50.8% for HFrEF, 60.6% for HFmrEF, and 58.9% for HFpEF (p=0.2). Patients with HFrEF experienced higher in-hospital mortality (5.2%) than HFmrEF (0%) and HFpEF (2.5%), primarily due to non-cardiac causes. The overall rate of major adverse cardiac and cerebrovascular events (MACCE) was low at 3.8% (31/821) without significant difference between the respective subgroups. Multivariable analysis identified high-grade tricuspid regurgitation, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and impaired renal function as stronger predictors of mortality than LVEF.
LVEF demonstrated limited prognostic value for long-term outcomes following M-TEER, challenging its role as a standalone marker in this population. Procedural safety and efficacy were consistent across subgroups, underscoring the viability of M-TEER in surgically inoperable patients. Given the significant higher in-hospital mortality rate due to non-cardiac causes in the HFrEF subgroup, tailored therapeutic strategies addressing the underlying diseases should be pursued to optimize outcomes. Future studies should explore possible improvements in risk assessment and patient selection, for example by integrating emerging imaging modalities and accounting for comorbidities, to improve treatment outcomes."

Two- and three-dimensional Transesophageal echocardiography (2D and 3D TEE) can precisely diagnose the mechanisms, location and scallops causing MR, identify the mechanisms of repair failure, identify the predictors of SAM, and help decide when to return to bypass and address the residual lesion. The review comprehensively describes 2D and 3D TEE imaging methods relevant for evaluating the mechanisms of MR, identification of the location of MR, and the predictors of SAM prior to valve repair; and describes imaging methods to identify the presence of mitral stenosis and SAM post-repair. Further, the review discusses the importance of more-than-mild residual MR, describes the evaluation of residual MR and discusses pitfalls in differentiating mild and more- than-mild residual MR."

A total of 203,001 interventions were included, and 13.7% (27,832) of the patients died during the 5‑year follow-up. Of these, 45.1% (12,560) were CV, and 54.9% (15,272) were non-CV deaths. After coronary revascularization, valve intervention, and aortic valve intervention and coronary revascularization combined, respectively, non-CV mortality increased from 14.2%, 12.9% and 20.7% at 30 days to 44.5%, 47.0% and 44.5% after 2 years. Of all deaths up to 5 years, 54.7%, 54.3% and 55.3% were non-CV.
Initially main cause of death after cardiac intervention is CV-related. The proportion of non-CV deaths increases during follow-up, impacting survival for all patients up to 5 years after intervention. (Fig. 1)."

Despite favourable results, several peculiar and more frequent shortcomings than in surgical-based implantation have been reported. This review aims to provide the currently available information regarding transcatheter valve (THV) implantation and reoperation, focusing on recent available data about surgical management strategies for THV degeneration.
For this narrative review, we searched Medline through the end of March 2025 using medical subject headings and text words supplemented by scanning the bibliographies of recovered articles. The terms ""transcatheter valve degeneration"", ""TAVI degeneration"", ""surgical treatment"", ""surgical explant"" have been combined using the Boolean operator 'AND'.
Currently available literature specifically focuses on aortic THV explant. Peculiar intraoperative (like coronary ostium, aortic wall and annular injury due to THV explant) or short-term postoperative complications related to THV explant have been reported. Thirty-day mortality has been shown to range between 12 to 32.6%, and only short and heterogeneous follow-up periods are available to date. Careful work-up to indicate that valve-in-valve procedure is unfeasible or not appropriate when facing degenerated THV, and a cautious as well as detailed planning of surgical explant have been recently recommended.
THV explant due to valve degeneration is rapidly increasing, but, due to its related risk for intra and post-procedural complications, a careful pre-operative evaluation and intraoperative conduct are warranted."

Cardiovascular interventions,"Transcatheter edge-to-edge repair is an established treatment for tricuspid regurgitation (TR) in nonoptimal surgical candidates. Two techniques have been described: zipping (or bicuspidization) and clover (or triple-orifice). This study aimed to compare the echocardiographic and clinical outcomes of these 2 techniques.
This multicenter registry included 288 patients undergoing tricuspid transcatheter edge-to-edge repair from June 2020 to December 2024. Patients were categorized into 2 groups (zipping and clover repairs). The primary study end point was the TR reduction at follow-up. The secondary end point was the composite of all-cause mortality and heart failure hospitalization at follow-up.
The median age was 77 years (interquartile range, 73-82), with 203 females (70.5%) and a median TRISCORE of 4.1±1.8. Of these, 197 patients (68.4%) underwent zipping repair, while 91 (31.6%) received the clover repair technique. The median follow-up duration was 11.6 months (interquartile range, 4.5-21.2). Patients treated with the clover technique experienced lower rates of residual TR ≤2+ (76% versus 89%, P=0.006) and higher single-leaflet device attachment in the follow-up, attributed to a higher prevalence of complex tricuspid valve anatomy. Similar rates of the composite end point were observed among the groups without differences in New York Heart Association functional class (P=0.835) and TR reintervention at 1-year (P=0.196).
Residual TR was more common in patients treated with the clover technique, owing to the higher prevalence of complex tricuspid valve anatomy. Clinical outcomes were similar between the zipping and clover techniques. Both approaches represent viable and effective treatment options for managing TR."

Cardiovascular Imaging,"Cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) compliments transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) for heart valve evaluation, however TTE remains more widely available. We sought to optimize transthoracic echocardiographic (TTE) quantification of significant aortic regurgitation (AR) by developing TTE-based algorithms to identify CMR-defined severe AR.
Patients with ≥moderate-to-severe AR undergoing both TTE and CMR within 3-months were studied. A historical cohort 2006-2018 (n = 193) was used to derive TTE-based decision tree regression algorithms to best identify severe AR based on holodiastolic flow reversal (HDR) using CMR, then validated in a prospective AR cohort (n = 97) during 2019-2021.Mean AR regurgitant volumes, fractions and proportions with HDR by TTE/CMR were 48/31 mL, 41/25% and 43%/27% for the historical derivation cohort and 51/37 mL, 47/29% and 54%/41% for the prospective validation cohort. Decision-tree analyses found regurgitant volume≥45 mL and left ventricular end-diastolic volume index (LVEDVi) ≥ 93 mL/m2 by TTE to best identify CMR-derived severe AR. Areas under curves (95%CIs) of the novel algorithms (PISA and Doppler methods) compared with current guidelines criteria for detecting CMR-derived severe AR were 0.80 (0.71-0.88) and 0.74 (0.65-0.83) versus 0.72 (0.63-0.81) in the derivation cohort, and 0.76 (0.66-0.87) and 0.71 (0.61-0.82) versus 0.58 (0.46-0.70) in the validation cohort; and for predicting left ventricular remodeling where follow-up TTE wad available were 0.65 (0.58-0.73) and 0.62 (0.54-0.70) versus 0.53 (0.45-0.61) respectively.
Novel TTEs algorithm increased TTE accuracy of identifying significant AR defined by CMR especially in the prospective cohort, compared to the current guidelines criteria, and was able to modestly discriminate LV remodeling."

It accurately detects ischemia, scarring, edema and microvascular disorders, enables reliable risk stratification and supports treatment decisions such as revascularization or medication adjustments. Modern quantitative perfusion methods and artificial intelligence (AI)-based analyses further increase the diagnostic accuracy. In inflammatory myocardial and pericardial diseases, CMR using mapping techniques and late gadolinium enhancement (LGE) forms the basis for differentiated diagnostics and estimation of the prognosis. It also enables a precise etiological classification and provides prognostically relevant parameters in cases of hypertrophic, dilated, arrhythmogenic and restrictive cardiomyopathies. In the diagnostics of valvular diseases and the planning of interventional procedures and cardiac tumors, CMR provides essential additional information and demonstrates a high sensitivity and specificity. New techniques such as quantitative 4‑dimensional (4D) flow measurements, high-resolution 3D imaging and electrocardiograph (ECG)-independent scans will further increase its value. Due to the increasing number of CMR examinations, standardized procedures, qualified personnel and structured training programs are essential to ensure a high quality of care in the long term."

Cardiovascular risk and prevention,"Left atrial appendage closure (LAAC) effectively lowers stroke risk in atrial-fibrillation (AF) patients who cannot tolerate long-term anticoagulation. Device-related thrombosis (DRT), although infrequent, carries a threefold increase in subsequent embolic events and remains a therapeutic challenge, even with the newer Watchman FLX occluder.
A 72-year-old woman with paroxysmal AF (CHA2DS2-VASc = 5; HAS-BLED = 2) underwent LAAC with a 30 mm Watchman FLX after bleeding-limited warfarin use. She was prescribed dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) post-procedure. Eight weeks later, cardiac CT detected a device-surface thrombus; warfarin (INR 2.5-3.0) achieved complete resolution by 7 months. Despite continued anticoagulation, repeat CT at 22 months revealed a larger thrombus. Transesophageal echocardiography confirmed recurrent DRT.
This case underscores multifactorial DRT pathogenesis: patient-specific hypercoagulability (age, persistent AF, PAI-1 variant), anatomic factors (large LAA, 30 mm device), and premature INR reduction. Current evidence indicates that early hypoattenuation thickening on cardiac CT, peri-device leak, and suboptimal antithrombotic regimens are associated with DRT. Emerging data support CT-based surveillance, individualized anticoagulation-potentially favoring direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs)-and next-generation, endothelialization-oriented device designs.
Recurrent, large-burden DRT can occur late after Watchman FLX implantation despite initial thrombus resolution and guideline-directed therapy. Optimal management requires (1) vigilant, multimodality imaging follow-up; (2) stringent, patient-tailored anticoagulation with real-time INR or DOAC level assessment; (3) consideration of genetic or laboratory markers of thrombophilia; and (4) advances in device bioengineering to accelerate endothelial healing. Further studies should refine risk-stratified antithrombotic strategies and validate imaging biomarkers to pre-empt DRT in high-risk LAAC recipients."

We aimed to investigate the association between the early residual mean postprocedural gradient (ERMPG) after TAVI and long-term SVD rates as well as the association of SVD with bioprosthetic valve failure (BVF) and 10-year mortality rates.
Patients with severe aortic valve stenosis enrolled in the Medtronic One Hospital Clinical Service at 10 Italian centres were included in the study. ERMPG was measured with echo-Doppler at hospital discharge or within 3 months from TAVI.
Between September 2007 and December 2014, 1,291 patients undergoing TAVI with a CoreValve/Evolut valve met the enrolment criteria of the study. After a median follow-up of 59.4 months, there were 46 patients with SVD (cumulative incidence rate 3.6%). A significant stepwise increase in the risk of SVD was apparent across tertiles of ERMPG (p=0.009), and in the multivariable analysis, ERMPG was an independent predictor of SVD (adjusted subdistribution hazard ratio [sHR] 1.05, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.01-1.08; p=0.004). Among the 46 patients with SVD, 25 (54.3%) had or developed BVF. SVD was associated with increased 10-year rates of all-cause mortality (adjusted hazard ratio 2.12, 95% CI: 1.49-3.00; p<0.001) and cardiac mortality (adjusted sHR 5.78, 95% CI: 2.63-12.71; p<0.001) compared with no SVD.
Echo-Doppler-derived ERMPG measured within 90 days from TAVI is an independent predictor of SVD. SVD is associated with high rates of BVF, and it is an independent predictor of all-cause mortality and cardiovascular mortality."

Numerous research studies have been carried out over the past decade that have assessed the role of Machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence in dentistry. This study aims to evaluate dental residents' knowledge and perception regarding AI's application in dentistry.
A validated and reliable questionnaire was circulated online among 32 dental residents. The small sample size reflects the total number of dental residents available at the study site during the data-collection period. The questionnaire consisted of 20 components, which assessed knowledge and awareness of participants regarding artificial intelligence (AI) and its uses in dentistry. The Shapiro-Wilk test was applied to assess the normality of the data. For each categorical variable, frequencies and percentages were computed. For quantitative variables such as age, the arithmetic mean and standard deviation were computed.
Out of the 32 participants, 26 were female residents, and the remaining six were male residents. The majority of participants had no prior experience working on AI-related projects, and 97% had never received any training on AI applications. About 31% claimed to have a basic understanding of AI's working principles. Regarding the perceived diagnostic abilities of AI compared to humans, 15% believed AI was superior, while 65% were unsure. A significant 71% believed AI could assist in identifying minute details on radiographs often overlooked by human practitioners. Moreover, 72% expressed the possibility of using AI for diagnosis in the future, and 31% viewed AI as most helpful in making a diagnosis.
The majority of clinicians are aware of artificial intelligence and its significance. Clinicians harbor doubt regarding the diagnostic abilities of artificial intelligence and, hence, prefer their judgment. Despite the lack of confidence, the majority believes in AI´s ability to pinpoint minor details which helps in the accurate diagnosis of dental pathologies.

Interpretation relies on visual assessment supported by striatal image features such as striatal binding ratios (SBRs). Deep learning can aid this process but often underuses complementary data, lacks robustness to heterogeneous inputs, and offers limited interpretability. We built an end-to-end multimodal framework that encodes DAT images and scalar data (patient age and striatal image features) using, respectively, a vision transformer and a multilayer perceptron. A transformer-based fusion module then combined the encoded representations, while tackling possible missing inputs. Interpretability was provided through modality-level attention, spatial attention maps, occlusion analysis, and scalar feature saliency. Performance was evaluated on 664 Parkinson's Progression Markers Initiative (PPMI) cases and two local datasets A (N = 228) and B (N = 530) from different devices, including PD, atypical parkinsonisms, and non-degenerative subjects. Transfer learning involved pretraining on two datasets and finetuning on the third. On PPMI, the model reached 97.4% AUROC, 95.5% accuracy, 97.0% sensitivity, and 91.9% specificity, matching state-of-the-art performance. Results were similar on dataset B (98.6% AUROC) but lower on dataset A (92.6% AUROC), likely due to its smaller size and reduced image quality. Explainability analyses showed the model focused on clinically relevant striatal regions and identified key scalar features such as putamen SBR and asymmetry. The fusion module also supported stable predictions despite missing data. Our method efficiently combined multimodal data with heterogeneous datasets and partial multimodal data. Integrated explainability tools showed clinically meaningful attention that is expected to favor its adoption."

While pre-trained deep learning models such as ResNet, VGG, and MobileNet have achieved notable success in medical image classification, their generalized architectures often struggle to capture the intricate heterogeneity of brain tissues. This study introduces a customized Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) specifically designed for brain tumor classification, demonstrating superior performance over widely used pre-trained models. The primary objective of this research is to evaluate the diagnostic performance of the customized CNN and pre-trained models in real-world scenarios and establish benchmarks for their accuracy, reliability, and computational efficiency. Furthermore, this study aims to explore and implement optimization techniques that enhance the diagnostic capabilities of the models under investigation. The proposed CNN incorporates optimized convolutional blocks, adaptive fine-tuning, and an advanced data augmentation pipeline to enhance feature extraction and minimize overfitting.

During clinical follow-up, visual field (VF) tests (Humphrey Field Analyzer 30-2) assesses functional loss, while optical coherence tomography (OCT) and fundus imaging provide structural information. However, VF measurement can be subjective, exhibit test-retest variability, and sometimes exhibit structure-function discordance (SFD). Therefore, predicting VF values from structural images may support clinical decision-making. To estimate Humphrey 30-2 measures (mean deviation (MD), pattern standard deviation (PSD), and point-wise threshold sensitivity (TS)) in glaucoma/ocular hypertension (OHT) using a ViT-B/32-based feature-fusion approach on OCT and fundus images, and to examine the effect of SFD via sensitivity analysis. Visual features were extracted from color optic disc photographs, red-free fundus images, retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) thickness map, and circular RNFL plots using Vision Transformer (ViT-B/32)-based models. These features were combined with demographic and clinical data to form a multimodal artificial intelligence model. Global VF indices (MD, PSD) were estimated with probabilistic regression that accounts for uncertainty, and point-wise TS values were predicted using a location-aware network. In a separate analysis, eyes exhibiting SFD were identified and excluded to assess model performance under OCT-VF concordance. Mean absolute errors (MAE) were 2.26, 1.42, and 2.96 dB for MD, PSD, and mean TS, respectively, and the proportions within ± 2 dB were 59.65%, 75.44%, and 57.90%. After excluding SFD eyes, MAEs decreased to 1.82, 1.30, and 2.12 dB for MD, PSD, and mean TS, respectively; the proportions within ± 2 dB increased to 66.7%, 76.5% and 62.7%, respectively. These findings indicate that discordance affects performance and that predictions are more reliable in clinically concordant cases. ViT-B/32-based deep feature fusion offers clinically meaningful accuracy for predicting VF metrics from multimodal structural images. SFD was frequently detected among the lowest-performing cases, and this possibility should be considered when interpreting low-performing outputs."

Early detection is essential, yet identifying ILD on chest radiographs remains challenging. Recently, deep learning (DL) technologies have shown potential to improve diagnostic performance; however, their lack of transparency remains a major concern. This study employed a four-class classification scheme to develop a trustworthy and robust detection system for ILD. The explainability of three convolutional neural network (CNN) models and two transformer-based models was evaluated using Intersection over Union (IoU) scores and Dice coefficients, which quantified the consistency between actual lesion areas and the activation regions in heatmaps generated by five different visual explanation methods. The proposed four-class classification scheme yielded statistically significant increases in IoU scores and Dice coefficients for four visualization methods applied to the three CNN models, while maintaining equivalent classification performance compared with conventional binary classification. For the transformer-based models, the application of certain visualization methods to the four-class classification models also improved IoU scores and Dice coefficients, with the highest mean IoU and Dice coefficient reaching 0.356 and 0.483, although not across all combinations of visualization methods and DL models. These results demonstrate the utility of multi-class classification that leverages lesion area information to enhance model explainability. Furthermore, they underscore the importance of selecting suitable visualization methods for respective DL models. These findings may provide valuable insights to strengthen clinical decision-making, ultimately facilitating earlier detection and more reliable management of ILD."

This retrospective diagnostic accuracy study was conducted at the Ophthalmology Center of Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University from August 2021 to December 2023. A total of 293 patients (358 eyes) underwent IVCM, yielding 4,554 corneal images, which were divided into a training set (3,542 images) and an internal test set (1,012 images). For external validation, an independent cohort of 87 patients (103 eyes) contributed 506 IVCM images from Wuhan Aier Hankou Eye Hospital. All images underwent standardized quality control and graded annotation by three senior corneal specialists prior to model development. The modeling pipeline included automated image-quality assessment and non-target-layer filtering, microneuroma detection, and microneuroma subtype classification. Model generalizability and potential clinical applicability were evaluated using the independent external dataset. The diagnostic model achieved an overall accuracy of 0.975 in image-quality screening. For identifying the presence or absence of microneuromas, the overall accuracy was 0.837 on the internal test set and 0.812 on the external test set. The accuracy range for the three morphological subtypes was 0.798-0.886. In the image-reading experiment, assistance from the model significantly improved the junior physicians' accuracy from 0.687 to 0.875 (P < 0.001) and increased their reading efficiency 2.2-fold, reducing the average reading time from 63.4 ± 15.2 s to 28.5 ± 6.8 s (t = 19.3, P < 0.001).

PubMed,deep learning,Surface water quality prediction via an MLA-Mamba hybrid neural network with GRPO optimization.,Ronghao Wei; Hang Chen; Haihe Wang,10.1038/s41598-026-36229-3,2026-01-20,Scientific reports,"Surface water quality forecasting is crucial for pollution early warning and sustainable water resource management. However, accurate prediction of key water quality indicators remains challenging due to the highly nonlinear spatio-temporal dynamics and complex inter-variable relationships. Traditional statistical models and conventional machine learning approaches often struggle to effectively capture these couplings, leading to limited predictive performance. In this study, we propose a novel hybrid deep learning framework, termed MLA-Mamba, which integrates an improved Mamba-based sequence modeling network with a Multi-Head Local Attention (MLA) mechanism, optimized through a Gradient Reparameterization Optimization (GRPO) strategy. The Mamba module is designed to extract long-range temporal dependencies from water quality time series via a state-space modeling paradigm, while the MLA mechanism captures localized spatial correlations among multiple monitoring stations. To the best of our knowledge, this study represents one of the first explorations of applying Gradient Reparameterization Optimization (GRPO) to water quality prediction tasks. Furthermore, a multi-task learning scheme is incorporated to jointly predict multiple key indicators, including permanganate index (CODMn), ammonia nitrogen (NH3-N), total phosphorus (TP), and total nitrogen (TN), thereby exploiting inter-variable dependencies to enhance overall forecasting accuracy. The proposed GRPO strategy dynamically adjusts learning rates during training to accelerate convergence and improve model stability. Experimental evaluations on two real-world surface water datasets demonstrate that the proposed MLA-Mamba model achieves consistent performance improvements over the evaluated baseline methods across multiple error metrics. In addition, predictive uncertainty is quantified via Monte Carlo dropout, enabling the estimation of confidence intervals to support risk-aware water quality assessment. These results highlight the effectiveness of integrating advanced sequence modeling, attention-driven spatial feature extraction, and adaptive optimization for robust environmental time series forecasting."
PubMed,deep learning,Metalens-style image synthesis for metalens imaging via image-to-image translation.,Chanik Kang; Hyewon Suk; Joonhyuk Seo; Ikbeom Jang; Haejun Chung,10.1038/s41598-026-36150-9,2026-01-20,Scientific reports,"Metalenses offer wafer-scale, ultra-thin optics for compact cameras, but strong chromatic and field-dependent aberrations still limit their practical use. Deep learning-based aberration correction can restore high-quality images from metalens captures, but current pipelines typically require hundreds to thousands of paired images per device. We address this data bottleneck by formulating metalens aberration synthesis as a deterministic, metalens-conditioned image-to-image translation problem. A generator is trained on a dataset of paired metalens and conventional images from a mass-producible metalens, then used to transform photographs into metalens-style outputs that reproduce realistic chromatic aberration, field-dependent blur, and spatial distortion. On a test set, the proposed translator reduces LPIPS(VGG) from 0.305 to 0.117 (∼62%) compared with a state-of-the-art transformer-based restoration baseline. Once trained, the translator can generate 600 synthetic metalens-style images in roughly 30 s on a single GPU, versus about 30 min for real metalens acquisition, a [Formula: see text] reduction in data-collection time. These synthetic pairs alone suffice to train a metalens image restoration model, suggesting that our approach can help alleviate the data bottleneck in future metalens imaging research."
PubMed,deep learning,Integrative multimodal hybrid data fusion for mortality prediction.,Husam Abuhamad; Suhaila Zainudin; Azuraliza Abu Bakar,10.1038/s41598-026-36296-6,2026-01-20,Scientific reports,"Multimodal Machine Learning (MML) methods address various efficient ways of driving insights from various data modalities, e.g., in healthcare settings, tabular electronic health records along with other modalities, such as medical imaging, electrocardiogram data (ECG), and textual doctors' notes and reports. Using deep learning methods, we propose a novel MML approach for mortality prediction in healthcare settings that fuses tabular data, ECG, and written notes in various stages. To this end, this research addresses various challenges related to MML including (1) collecting and building comprehensive data representations from various modalities that may require different preprocessing steps to handle noise and distorted data, (2) ensuring data alignment across modalities, and (3) choosing the optimal fusion strategy (i.e., early, late, or hybrid). This study uses three distinct data modalities: tabular data (encompassing healthcare records, vital signs in real-time, laboratory test results, procedures, and diagnosis records), ECG data, and textual notes from doctors about patients. These modalities are obtained from the MIMIC-IV, MIMIC-ECG, and MIMIC-IV-Note datasets, which include comprehensive medical records, ECG reports, and textual doctors' notes to explore and evaluate methods in all MML stages. The methodology includes data preprocessing to address noise, outliers, and missing values. It involves comparing fusion strategies (early, late, hybrid) for integrating multimodal data. In addition, novel deep learning models that use attention mechanisms are implemented for better data interaction. Model performance is evaluated with metrics like AUC-ROC, precision, recall, and F-score. The results of our proposed multimodal neural network model using multimodal information showed a substantial increase in performance, with an AUC of 0.96, surpassing the performance of previous single modality literature models. Using multimodal data, the aim is to make the proposed model obtain a holistic view of patient health similar to that of domain experts, resulting in better informed clinical decisions and potentially better clinical outcomes. Our promising results suggest the need to examine biases in training data, such as mortality class imbalances, to improve model performance. Future work should also address the interpretability of complex deep learning models for clinical adoption."

This paper proposes a hybrid perception-and-control framework that integrates deep semantic segmentation with reinforcement learning to enable intelligent, vision-driven navigation in visually cluttered forest trails. The system combines Mask R-CNN for pixel-level trail segmentation with a Soft Actor-Critic (SAC) agent that learns adaptive navigation policies under continuous action spaces. A Pure Pursuit controller translates visual predictions into smooth motor commands, ensuring path adherence and stability. The model is trained and evaluated in a high-fidelity forest simulation environment featuring natural obstacles, variable lighting, and randomized trail geometries. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach achieves a high trail-following success rate (86.7%), low collision frequency, and precise path tracking in challenging navigation scenarios. Comparative and ablation studies further highlight the synergy between learning-based perception and control. The proposed framework offers a scalable and modular solution for deploying autonomous robots in natural terrains without relying on GPS or prior maps, paving the way for applications in environmental monitoring and field robotics."
PubMed,deep learning,Role of MRI radiomics in deep learning-based prediction of intestinal diseases.,Liwei Yan; Shanyu Gao; Chao Gu; Bengzheng Wei,10.1007/s00384-026-05083-0,2026-01-20,International journal of colorectal disease,"Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is widely used for the diagnosis, evaluation, and follow-up of intestinal diseases. With advances in artificial intelligence, MRI radiomics and deep learning have emerged as promising tools for prognostic assessment and treatment guidance. This review synthesizes current evidence on MRI radiomics and deep learning for prognostic assessment of intestinal diseases, with a focus on inflammatory bowel disease and colorectal cancer.
We conducted a narrative review of studies published between January 2005 and March 2025, retrieved from PubMed/MEDLINE, Web of Science, and Embase. Eligible studies applied deep learning or radiomics approaches to MRI data to predict treatment response, recurrence, metastasis, or survival outcomes. Methodological quality and clinical relevance were critically appraised with reference to established artificial intelligence-specific evaluation frameworks.
The reviewed studies indicate that deep learning models, including convolutional neural networks, vision transformers, and multimodal fusion approaches, can effectively exploit multiparametric MRI data to improve prognostic prediction across multiple clinical endpoints. These applications encompass image preprocessing, treatment planning, prediction of therapeutic response, disease relapse, and survival outcomes. MRI-based deep learning models generally outperform conventional imaging and traditional radiomics methods, particularly when integrated with clinical variables. However, most studies remain retrospective, with limited external validation and challenges related to interpretability and generalizability.
MRI-based radiomics and deep learning hold substantial potential for enhancing precision medicine in intestinal diseases. Future progress will depend on standardized imaging protocols, multicenter prospective validation, and the development of explainable and clinically trustworthy artificial intelligence models."
PubMed,deep learning,Cha-PO and CVNet: a hybrid approach for automated cataract detection using adaptive feature selection and deep learning for high accuracy and efficiency.,A Essaki Muthu; K Saravanan,10.1038/s41598-025-34889-1,2026-01-20,Scientific reports,"Early detection of cataract is crucial for thwarting visual impairment worldwide, and the utilization of automated cataract detection through medical images has shown increased growth for several years. The automated detection model comprises image processing, feature extraction and classification process to ensure accurate identification of infected cataract eye images. However, the recent detection model endures various challenges, including complex computing requirements, feature redundancy, inadequate precision, generalization and less data diversity. To overcome these challenges, a Chaotic Adaptive Poplar-Bacteria Optimization (Cha-PO) based Cataract VisionNet (CVNet) method is proposed to enhance diagnostic accuracy and operational efficiency. The Cha-PO model is specifically used for optimal feature selection of fundus images by reducing the dimension of the images, which ensures acute diagnostic data preservation. CVNet model used for classifying the cataract images by applying the deep hierarchical learning mechanisms alongside optimized network parameters to boost accuracy levels and operational reliability. The proposed approach is validated using the Eye Cataract Kaggle dataset, and it outperforms the traditional models with 99.10% accuracy, 99% precision, 99.21% recall and 99.10% of F1-Score. With a 99s execution time, it requires fewer computational resources than other baseline models, making it suitable for medical diagnosis."

Conventional deep learning models perform well on known classes but fail to recognize unseen or emerging disease patterns. To address this limitation, we propose a Zero-Shot Dual-Encoder Framework that integrates a Vision Transformer (ViT) and RoBERTa-based semantic encoder to identify unseen disease categories and estimate their severity using lesion area ratios. The proposed model was evaluated on a curated chilli leaf dataset under various environmental conditions, achieving 98.7% accuracy, 98.0% precision, and 98.0% recall, outperforming five existing state-of-the-art approaches. Experimental findings demonstrate that the framework not only enhances recognition accuracy but also ensures scalability for real-time agricultural disease monitoring without the need for retraining."
PubMed,deep learning,A study on the coupling mechanism between the urban environment and depression perception based on deep learning and street view image.,Haozun Sun; Nan Zhang; Yixin Jiang; Honglei Chen; Quanxu Shi; Junyi Fang,10.1038/s41598-026-36804-8,2026-01-20,Scientific reports,"With the accelerated urbanization process, the impact of the urban environment on the mental health of residents has attracted extensive attention. However, previous research has primarily focused on single environmental factors, lacking a systematic quantitative framework based on multi-dimensional urban elements, especially at the refined scale, resulting in dual bottlenecks in methodology and data. In this work, a novel deep learning (DL) approach, driven by SVI, is developed to quantify depression perception (DP) between residents in Wuhan and the urban environment. Specifically, a database containing 133,114 SVIs is constructed, extracting six visual elements of green view index (GVI), sky view factor (SVF), degree of enclosure (DOE), degree of motorization (DOM), degree of non-motorization (DON), and rate of sidewalk (ROS). Stepwise regression is applied to elucidate which urban elements exacerbate or mitigate DP. Results indicate that GVI, SVF, and DON are negatively correlated with DP. Moreover, the risk of negative emotions is increased due to the high DOE and DOM, presenting a clear coupling relationship. Meanwhile, spatially, the city exhibits a pattern of high DP along transport-industrial corridors and low DP across blue-green and cultural corridors. Additionally, historical districts such as Tanhualin display a cultural buffering effect of ""high-enclosure/low-DP"". This study establishes a deep connection between street-level urban environments and DP, expands the ""emotion-space"" mechanism framework in the design of healthy cities theoretically, and provides quantitative support and an emotion-oriented strategy for urban renewal, street development, and the planning of green infrastructure in practice."
PubMed,deep learning,A channel water temperature prediction method based on transfer learning and spatial-temporal graph neural networks.,Hankang Lu; Yu Tian; PeiYao Weng; Yu Qiao,10.1038/s41598-026-35408-6,2026-01-20,Scientific reports,"Accurate water temperature forecasting during winter operation periods is critical for the North Extension of the Eastern Route of the South-to-North Water Diversion Project, yet remains challenging due to limited historical data and sparse monitoring records. This study proposes a novel water temperature prediction model called Transfer-Learning Graph Temporal Convolutional Network(TF-GTCN) that integrates transfer learning with spatial-temporal graph neural networks. The model initially employs transfer learning techniques to capture the periodic variations in water temperature and its correlation with air temperature, leveraging ice-period scheduling data from the Central Route of the South-to-North Water Diversion Project. Subsequently, a spatial-temporal graph neural network is utilized to extract temporal features of water temperature, air temperature, and flow, alongside spatial dependencies across different cross-sections of the North Extension Project. By integrating the experiential knowledge obtained through transfer learning with the extracted spatial-temporal features, the proposed model effectively forecasts future water temperatures. The TF-GTCN model demonstrates significant improvements compared to traditional deep learning methods such as LSTM and GRU, achieving a mean absolute error (MAE) of [Formula: see text]C and reducing MAE by 0.72-3.29 at key monitoring stations. These advancements provide valuable insights for water transfer scheduling during ice-period operations."

This scheme employs Inception V3 for food classification with the benchmark datasets, Mask R-CNN for 2D area estimation, and MiDaS for single-view depth estimation. The proposed model secures an average classification accuracy of 98% and provides accurate nutrition information of food and volume. In addition, this research work addresses gaps in the current research by evaluating a range of deep learning models on a benchmark dataset of food items. It performs well and produces the good results on well-known datasets such as Food101 with 98% of accuracy, UEC-food256 with 97.25% of accuracy and Indian Food Images Dataset with 97.40% of accuracy.

PubMed,deep learning,Multi-scale EEG feature decoding with Swin Transformers for subject independent motor imagery BCIs.,Wasi Ur Rehman Qamar; Berdakh Abibullaev,10.1038/s41598-025-32207-3,2026-01-20,Scientific reports,"High inter-subject variability and the non-stationary nature of EEG signals pose significant challenges for subject-independent Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCIs) leading to poor model generalization. Differences in neural activity patterns, electrode placements, and external noise further degrade performance making it difficult to develop BCIs that remain reliable across users without extensive recalibration. This study presents a Compact Convolutional Swin Transformer (CCST) to address this issue by using hierarchical window based self-attention combined with convolutional feature extraction to efficiently capture both local electrode interactions and global temporal dependencies. This multi-scale feature representation enhances generalization across subjects, a critical factor for real world BCI deployment. We evaluated CCST on the BCI Competition IV (2a, 2b) and PhysioNet MI datasets using Leave-One-Subject-Out (LOSO) cross-validation achieving state-of-the-art classification accuracies of 68.27%, 76.61%, and 71.70% respectively. Our statistical analysis using the Wilcoxon signed-rank test with Bonferroni correction confirms significant performance improvements over benchmark models. Additionally, CCST achieves a reduction in parameters and a decrease in FLOPs compared to full self-attention models making it more efficient for real-time BCI applications. These results establish CCST as a scalable and efficient framework for adaptive subject-independent BCIs with promising applications in neurorehabilitation, assistive technology, and cognitive training."

In order to account for diverse and admixed populations, new algorithmic tools are needed in order to properly capture the genetic composition of populations. Here, we explore deep learning techniques, namely, variational autoencoders (VAEs), to process genomic data from a population perspective. We show the power of VAEs for a variety of tasks relating to the interpretation, compression, classification, and simulation of genomic data with several worldwide whole genome data sets from both humans and canids, and evaluate the performance of the proposed applications with and without ancestry conditioning. The unsupervised setting of autoencoders allows for the detection and learning of granular population structure and inferring of informative latent factors. The learned latent spaces of VAEs are able to capture and represent differentiated Gaussian-like clusters of samples with similar genetic composition on a fine scale from single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), enabling applications in dimensionality reduction and data simulation. These individual genotype sequences can then be decomposed into latent representations and reconstruction errors (residuals), which provide a sparse representation useful for lossless compression. We show that different populations have differentiated compression ratios and classification accuracies. Additionally, we analyze the entropy of the SNP data, its effect on compression across populations, and its relation to historical migrations, and we show how to introduce autoencoders into existing compression pipelines."

With a focus on the prevalent psychological complications following the onset of this condition, this study aimed to explore the correlation between antenatal depression and Corona disease anxiety, personality traits, and postpartum depression during the COVID-19 pandemic.                                                           Materials and Methods:                     This cross-sectional descriptive-analytical study investigated women receiving care at health centers affiliated with Kerman University of Medical Sciences during the last month of their pregnancy and the postpartum period in 2022. Following the acquisition of informed consent, participants were assessed using various measures, including demographic and obstetric information, the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale, the Corona Disease Anxiety Scale (CDAS), and the NEO Personality Inventory-Revised during their third trimester of pregnancy. The same group of participants completed the Edinburgh Depression Scale and the Corona Disease Anxiety Scale (CDAS) 4-6 weeks after childbirth.                                                           Results and Discussion:                     There was a significant correlation between family income, unwanted pregnancy as perceived by both the mother and father, and antenatal depression. Additionally, marital satisfaction played a significant role in postpartum depression. Furthermore, antenatal depression was significantly associated with neuroticism, agreeableness, and physical symptoms related to Corona disease anxiety. Personality traits, with the exception of extroversion and conscientiousness, and various domains of Corona disease anxiety, excluding psychological symptoms, were also significantly associated with postpartum depression.                                                           Conclusion:                     During pandemics or epidemics, such as the COVID-19 outbreak, experiencing mental distress during pregnancy can contribute to mental health issues during the postpartum period. This risk is particularly true in individuals with unique personality traits, emphasizing the need for increased focus on mental health within prenatal care during these crises."

Method:                     This cross-sectional study was conducted in Kerman, Iran. Data were collected from patients who visited Afzalipour Hospital in Kerman more than twice during the COVID-19 epidemic from the end of February 2020 to March 21, 2021. We conducted two key analyses: 1. Mixed effect logistic regression was used to check the relationship between the variables and COVID-19 severity. 2. Mixed effect linear regression was used to check the relationship between the variables and the length of stay in the hospital.                                                           Results:                     The findings indicated that the most important risk factors for the severity of COVID-19 were heart diseases (OR=1.67,95%CI:1.20-2.30), increasing age (OR=2.23 for age&gt;54, 95%CI:1.70- 2.90), male gender (OR=1.47,95%CI:1.10-1.96), respiratory diseases other than asthma, and frequency of admission (OR=1.60,95%CI:1.20-2.15). All patients who underwent readmission experienced a shorter duration of hospitalization during their subsequent admission (OR=0.94,95%CI:0.91,0.96) and had a higher mortality rate (30% within 14 days, 26.6% between 14-90 days). Patients readmitted at intervals of 14-90 days and greater than 90 days exhibited lower disease severity compared to those readmitted within the 0-14 day period.                                                           Conclusion:                     Examining readmissions, the severity of COVID-19, and the length of hospital stay in affected patients are important factors for planning and allocating resources for COVID-19 management and treatment. These factors can help policymakers develop effective clinical guidelines for hospitalization or outpatient treatment of COVID-19 patients and contribute to reducing the burden of disease in the community."

Kinovea, as an accessible motion-analysis software, provides both visual and quantitative feedback. However, its application in supporting technique development among beginner athletes remains insufficiently explored. Aim: This study aims to describe the use of Kinovea in biomechanics training and examine its contribution to the awareness of kinematic characteristics and movement techniques among beginner athletes. Methods: A descriptive qualitative design involved 72 beginner athletes aged 18–25 years selected through purposive sampling. Data were collected over 16 weeks through interviews, field observations, and motion video recordings analyzed using Kinovea. Kinematic data focused on joint angles, stride behavior, and movement phases during walking, running, and the flight phase. Qualitative data were analyzed using content analysis with NVivo 12, while kinematic results were interpreted descriptively to identify performance patterns and areas for technical refinement. Result: Kinematic analysis showed coordinated joint-angle patterns across all phases. Walking analysis identified arm swing angles of 50.9°–58.8° and leg separation angles of 64.3°–67.2°, indicating a stable gait rhythm. The running analysis revealed knee angles of 68.8°–69.8° and elbow angles of 87.6°–89.1°, indicating efficient propulsive mechanics. The flight phase demonstrated knee angles of 81.2°–87.8° and elbow angles of 80.4°–88.3°, suggesting effective momentum use and postural stability. These measurements supported stride-efficiency assessment and technique evaluation. Qualitative findings revealed that Kinovea enabled athletes to interpret movement phases and identify technical inefficiencies through slow-motion and frame-by-frame visualization. Conclusion: Kinovea supports basic motion analysis by providing clear kinematic information and helping beginner athletes observe and refine their movement techniques. The findings also offer practical value for coaches by enabling more precise identification of inefficient patterns and guiding targeted corrections during early-stage training."

It is also indicated for younger patients with significant comorbidities, for valve-in-valve interventions, and in selected patients with severe aortic insufficiency. We aimed to evaluate procedural and clinical outcomes of transfemoral TAVI performed over the course of 12 years by the same operators using different bioprosthetic valves. Materials and Methods: Between 2012 and 2023, 375 patients underwent TAVI in our clinic, with six types of bioprosthetic valves (Edwards Sapien XT, Medtronic Valves [CoreValve and Evolut R], Portico, Myval, Acurate Neo, and Direct Flow Medical). A transfemoral approach was used in all patients. The procedural and clinical outcomes were defined according to Valve Academic Research Consortium-3 (VARC-3) criteria. Results: The mean age of the patients was 78.4 ± 7.3, and their median STS score was 4.2 (2.9–5.9). Of the 375 patients, 361 had severe AS, 4 had severe aortic insufficiency, 5 were valve-in-valve, and 5 were valve-in-TAVI. Seven patients required a second valve implantation: four due to embolization of the prosthetic valve and three due to deep implantation of the prosthetic valve. Based on the VARC-3 criteria, the rates of technical success and device success were 90.4% and 85.3%, respectively. Major vascular complications were observed in 18 (4.8%) patients. Also, 42 (11.2%) patients required permanent pacemaker implantation. The incidence of moderate or worse paravalvular leak was 2.9%. The peri-procedural, 30-day, 1-year, and 5-year mortality rates were 5.1%, 4.3%, 15.2%, and 45.6%, respectively. STS scores (HR:1.129, 95%CI: 1.068–1.192, p &lt; 0.001) and post-TAVI acute kidney injury (HR:3.993, 95%CI:1.629–9.785, p = 0.002) were detected as independent predictors of mortality in Cox regression analysis. Conclusions: This registry demonstrated the evolution of TAVI procedures at a single center over 12 years. A high level of collaboration between experienced operators and innovations in devices seem to be the key features for achieving high procedural success and low complication rates."

While transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) is established for symptomatic AS, its objective functional benefits in asymptomatic individuals are not well‐defined. Aims To evaluate the safety and hemodynamic efficacy of TAVR in asymptomatic patients with severe aortic stenosis and to objectively quantify their functional recovery using cardiopulmonary exercise testing (CPET). Methods In this single‐center retrospective study, 156 asymptomatic patients with severe AS undergoing TAVR with the VitaFlow valve were enrolled. Safety endpoints were adjudicated per Valve Academic Research Consortium (VARC‐3) criteria. Efficacy was assessed via serial echocardiography and brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) levels at baseline, 1 day, 7 days, 3 months, and 12 months. Functional capacity was objectively quantified using CPET at baseline, 1 month, and 12 months. Results Procedural success was 100% with no mortality, stroke, or major complications. Hemodynamics improved immediately (mean gradient: 51.6 ± 11.7 to 13.7 ± 7.2 mmHg, p &lt; 0.001) and remained stable at 12 months. BNP levels decreased significantly from 7 days onward ( p &lt; 0.05). CPET revealed substantial improvements in functional capacity: peak oxygen uptake (VO₂) increased from 15.6 ± 3.6 to 19.8 ± 4.0 mL/kg/min ( p &lt; 0.001), anaerobic threshold (AT) increased, and ventilatory efficiency (VE/VCO₂ slope) decreased (all p &lt; 0.001). The incidence of exercise‐induced adverse events also significantly declined. Conclusions TAVR is a safe and highly effective intervention for asymptomatic severe AS, resulting in immediate hemodynamic improvement and sustained, objective enhancement of functional capacity, as rigorously quantified by CPET."

Integrated care pathways (ICPs) supported by structured data systems may improve safety and outcomes, but real-world evidence in AS remains limited. We aimed to characterize a contemporary cohort of patients with severe AS managed within an ICP at a tertiary hospital, comparing profiles and outcomes by treatment strategy, and to describe diagnostic procedures and the implementation of cardiac rehabilitation (CR) interventions embedded in the pathway. Methods Prospective observational study of all consecutive patients with AS evaluated by a multidisciplinary heart team between 2018 and 2022. Baseline characteristics and frailty, diagnostic tests, CR interventions, procedural details, and outcomes were collected via an interoperable data management platform and compared across treatment groups: surgical (SAVR) or transcatheter (TAVR) valve replacement, or conservative management. Early survival was assessed using Kaplan–Meier analysis with log-rank testing. Results Among 984 patients (median age 78 years, 42% women), 43.9% underwent SAVR, 49.8% TAVR, and 6.3% were managed conservatively. TAVR and conservative groups were older, frailer, and had higher comorbidity. Device success at 30 days was high (≈91%), with periprocedural death at 2.5% for interventions, vs. 9.7% early mortality for conservative management ( p &amp;lt; 0.001). Early survival differed significantly (log-rank p = 0.004). TAVR had higher permanent pacemaker implantation (21.7% vs. 7.4% for SAVR, p &amp;lt; 0.001) and major vascular complications (4.1% vs. 0.2%, p &amp;lt; 0.001), while SAVR had more reoperations (8.3% vs. 0.2%, p &amp;lt; 0.001) and atrial fibrillation (18.9% vs. 10.1%, p = 0.001). Prehabilitation was implemented in 64.6% of candidates, while postprocedural CR remained underutilized (11.3%). Conclusions Integrated care for a cohort of patients with AS, supported by structured data management, enabled comprehensive profiling, systematic outcome monitoring, and identification of improvement areas. Both SAVR and TAVR achieved high success with low early mortality, while conservative management had poor survival."

OpenAlex,aortic stenosis,Assessing Potential Valve-Preserving Effects of SGLT2 Inhibitors in Degenerative Aortic Stenosis: A Propensity-Matched Study,Olivier Morel; Michael Guglieri; Guillaume Viboud; Benjamin Marchandot; A. Bisson; Amandine Granier; Mélanie Burban; Anne Bernard; Laurent Fauchier,10.3390/jcm15020714,2026-01-15,Journal of Clinical Medicine,"Background: Sodium–glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors (SGLT2 inhibitors), initially developed for glycemic control in type 2 diabetes, have demonstrated robust cardiovascular and renal benefits. Emerging evidence suggests that these agents may also affect valvular pathobiology, particularly in degenerative aortic stenosis (AS), through anti-inflammatory and antifibrotic mechanisms. Objectives: This study evaluated whether SGLT2 inhibitor use is associated with improved clinical outcomes in degenerative AS, including all-cause mortality and the need for SAVR or TAVR, recognizing that these endpoints represent surrogate rather than direct measures of valve hemodynamic progression. Methods: A retrospective cohort analysis was conducted using TriNetX, a federated electronic medical record-based research network. Diagnoses are captured using ICD-9/ICD-10-CM codes and medications using ATC codes. Adults with non-rheumatic AS were stratified by SGLT2 inhibitors use. Propensity score matching (1:1) was performed to balance baseline characteristics between treated and untreated groups (n = 10,912 per group). Primary outcomes included all-cause mortality, TAVR, and SAVR during follow-up. Echocardiographic parameters (AVA, Vmax, mean gradient) were not systematically available. Results: After adjustment for comorbidities, SGLT2 inhibitor use was independently associated with lower all-cause mortality (6.15% vs. 9.34% HR 0.595; 95% CI 0.552–0.641; p &lt; 0.001), TAVR (2.81% vs. 2.89% HR 0.835; 95% CI 0.746–0.934; p = 0.002), SAVR (1.28% vs. 1.90% HR 0.514; 95% CI 0.442–0.599; p &lt; 0.001), cardiac arrest (0.82% vs. 1.21% HR 0.71; 95% CI 0.582–0.867; p &lt; 0.001), and end-stage kidney disease (0.40% vs. 1.0% HR 0.292; 95% CI 0.222–0.384; p &lt; 0.001). Although these associations may suggest slower disease progression, interpretation is limited by the lack of systematic echocardiographic follow-up. Conclusions: In addition to their established benefits in heart failure and renal protection, SGLT2 inhibitors may have valve-preserving effects in degenerative AS. Because true hemodynamic progression could not be evaluated, these results should be viewed as associations with surrogate clinical endpoints. Prospective studies with standardized imaging are required to determine whether SGLT2 inhibition can directly alter the course of this currently untreatable disease"
OpenAlex,aortic stenosis,The Value of HALP Score in Predicting Adverse In-Hospital Clinical Outcomes in Patients Undergoing Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement,Ömer Faruk Çiçek; Mustafa Çetin; Ali Palice,10.3390/diagnostics16020276,2026-01-15,Diagnostics,"Background: Transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) is widely used in patients with severe aortic stenosis. The HALP (hemoglobin, albumin, lymphocyte, and platelet) score is an easily obtainable composite index that reflects nutritional status and systemic inflammation. Methods: In this single-center retrospective study, 140 patients who underwent TAVR between 1 April 2021, and 31 October 2024, were included. Patients were stratified according to the median HALP score (32.65) into low (&lt;32.65)- and high (≥32.65)-HALP groups. In-hospital outcomes were mortality, bleeding requiring transfusion of &gt;5 units of red blood cells, acute kidney injury (AKI), need for mechanical ventilation &gt;24 h, and length of hospital stay. Associations between the HALP score and clinical outcomes were evaluated using multivariable regression analyses, and the discriminatory performance of HALP was assessed using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves. Results: Patients with low HALP scores had higher rates of in-hospital mortality (11.4% vs. 4.2%; p = 0.002), bleeding (28.6% vs. 5.7%; p &lt; 0.001), AKI (11.4% vs. 2.9%; p &lt; 0.001), and need for mechanical ventilation &gt;24 h (25.7% vs. 14.4%; p = 0.002), as well as longer hospital stay (4.82 ± 1.50 vs. 3.62 ± 1.94 days; p = 0.001) compared with the high-HALP group. In multivariable models, a lower HALP score remained independently associated with all adverse in-hospital outcomes. ROC analysis showed good discriminatory ability of the HALP score for mortality (area under the curve [AUC] = 0.816; cut-off = 20.16), bleeding (AUC = 0.798; cut-off = 24.94), AKI (AUC = 0.737; cut-off = 26.21), and need for mechanical ventilation (AUC = 0.735; cut-off = 27.36). Conclusions: The HALP score is independently associated with adverse in-hospital clinical outcomes in patients undergoing TAVR and may serve as a simple and practical tool for early risk stratification in this population."

Iliac branch devices (IBDs) have been developed to preserve hypogastric perfusion. E-Liac (Artivion/Jotec) is one of the latest modular IBDs yet reports on mid-term performance are limited to small single-center cohorts with short follow-up. The CAMpania PugliA bRanch IliaC (CAMPARI) study is a multicenter investigation of E-Liac outcomes. Methods: A retrospective observational cohort study was conducted across five Italian vascular centers. All consecutive patients undergoing E-Liac implantation for aorto-iliac or isolated iliac aneurysms between January 2015 and December 2024 were identified from prospectively maintained registries. Inclusion criteria comprised elective or urgent endovascular repair of aorto-iliac aneurysms in which an adequate distal sealing zone was not available without covering the IIA and suitability for the E-Liac device according to its instructions for use (IFU). Patients with a life expectancy &lt; 1 year or hostile anatomy incompatible with the IFU were excluded. The primary end point was freedom from branch instability (occlusion/stenosis, kinking, or detachment of the bridging stent). Secondary end points included freedom from any endoleak, freedom from device-related reintervention, freedom from gluteal claudication, aneurysm-related and all-cause mortality, acute renal failure, and sac regression &gt; 5 mm. Results: A total of 69 consecutive patients (68 male, 1 female, median age 72.0 years) received 74 E-Liac devices, including 5 bilateral implantations. The mean infrarenal aortic diameter was 45 mm and the mean CIA diameter 34 mm; 14 patients (20.0%) had a concomitant IIA aneurysm (&gt;20 mm). Concomitant fenestrated or branched aortic repair was performed in 23% of procedures. Two patients received a standalone IBD without implantation of a proximal aortic endograft. Technical success was achieved in 71/74 cases (96.0%); three failures occurred due to inability to catheterize the IIA. Distal landing was in the main IIA trunk in 58 cases and in the posterior branch in 13 cases. Over a median follow-up of 18 (6; 36) months, there were four branch instability events (5.4%): three occlusions and one bridging stent detachment. Seven patients (9.5%) developed endoleaks (one type Ib, two type II, two type IIIa, and two type IIIc). Five patients (6.8%) required reintervention, and five (6.8%) reported gluteal claudication. There were seven all-cause deaths (10%), none within 30 days or related to aneurysm rupture; causes included COVID-19 pneumonia, acute coronary syndrome, melanoma, gastric cancer, and stroke. No acute renal or respiratory failure occurred. Kaplan–Meier analysis showed 92% (95% CI 77–100) freedom from branch instability in the main-trunk group and 89% (60–100) in the posterior-branch group (log-rank p = 0.69). Freedom from any endoleak at 48 months was 87% (95% CI 75–95), and freedom from reintervention was 93% (95% CI 83–98). Conclusions: In this multicenter cohort, the E-Liac branched endograft demonstrated high technical success and favorable early–mid-term outcomes. Preservation of hypogastric perfusion using E-Liac was associated with low rates of branch instability, endoleak, and reintervention, with no 30-day mortality or aneurysm-related deaths. These findings support the safety and efficacy of E-Liac for aorto-iliac aneurysm management, although larger prospective studies with longer follow-up are needed."
OpenAlex,aortic stenosis,Anesthetic and procedural strategy for coexisting severe aortic stenosis and carotid artery stenosis: A case report,Yuri Okada; Rio Oishi; Satoshi Kimura; Moritoki Egi,10.5412/wjsp.v16.i1.115792,2026-01-15,World Journal of Surgical Procedures,"BACKGROUND Aortic stenosis (AS) often coexists with carotid artery stenosis. However, clear guidelines for the optimal treatment strategy and sequencing of interventions in patients with both conditions are lacking. CASE SUMMARY A 79-year-old man with a history of hypertension presented with right-sided paralysis and pain. Magnetic resonance imaging revealed multiple infarctions in the left cerebral hemisphere and severe stenosis of the left carotid artery. Transthoracic echocardiography also identified coexisting severe AS. Carotid artery stenosis increases the risk of stroke during aortic valve manipulation; therefore, carotid intervention may be recommended prior to aortic valve treatment. However, perioperative hypotension and bradycardia associated with carotid intervention can precipitate circulatory collapse in patients with severe AS. After a multidisciplinary conference, the decision was made to first perform transcatheter aortic valve implantation under general anesthesia, followed by carotid endarterectomy 4 months later. Both procedures were completed successfully without complications. CONCLUSION Treatment strategy should be individualized, balancing perioperative risks and benefits in patients with severe AS and carotid artery stenosis."

A total of 96 fetuses diagnosed with CPS-IVS or PA-IVS at the Women and Children's Hospital, Qingdao University between July 2018 and June 2021 were included. Fetuses who did not undergo FPV constituted the modeling cohort, while those who underwent FPV constituted the validation cohort. Fetuses were classified into biventricular and non-biventricular circulation groups based on postnatal circulatory outcomes, and prenatal fetal echocardiographic parameters were compared. Inter-group comparisons were performed using the <i>t</i> test, Mann-Whitney <i>U</i> test, <i>χ</i><sup>2</sup> test or Fisher exact test. Based on inter-group differences, parameters associated with postnatal circulatory outcomes were screened in the modeling cohort. For continuous variables, optimal cut-off values were determined using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves and the Youden index and then dichotomized. Right ventricular endocardial fibroelastosis (EFE) was graded as 0, 1 or 2 according to severity. <i>OR</i> of each parameter were calculated, and a multiparametric scoring system was constructed. ROC curves were used to evaluate its predictive performance. Post-FPV outcome improvement was assessed in the validation cohort. <b>Results:</b> Among the 96 fetuses, 78 were assigned to the modeling cohort and 18 to the validation cohort. Postnatally, biventricular circulation was achieved in 56 cases (72%) in the modeling cohort and 13 cases in the validation cohort. In the modeling cohort, the right ventricular long-axis/left ventricular long-axis (RV/LV), tricuspid annulus diameter/mitral annulus diameter (TV/MV) and pulmonary valve annulus/aortic valve annulus (PV/AV) in the non-biventricular group were lower than that in the biventricular group (all <i>P</i><0.05). The optimal cut-off values for predicting postnatal circulatory outcomes were 0.65, 0.82 and 0.78, respectively. There was statistically significant difference in the distribution of circulatory outcomes between fetuses with grade 2 EFE and those with no or grade 1 EFE (<i>χ</i><sup>2</sup>=21.28, <i>P</i><0.001). Therefore, right ventricular EFE was dichotomized in the model as ""none or grade 1"" versus ""grade 2"". Each parameter was assigned a corresponding weight based on its <i>OR</i> value, and an integer score was obtained to construct the scoring system: grade 2 right ventricular EFE was assigned 5 points, RV/LV≤0.65 was assigned 2 points, TV/MV≤0.82 was assigned 2 points, and PV/AV≤0.78 was assigned 1 point, with a maximum total score of 10 points. At cut-off scores of 3, 4, and 5 points, the areas under the curve were 0.88, 0.91, and 0.88, respectively, with the highest specificity (0.95, 95% <i>CI</i> 0.84-0.99) observed at a score threshold of 5 points. In the validation cohort, 15 fetuses had scores ≥5 points, among whom 10 fetuses achieved biventricular circulation after birth, whereas in the modeling cohort, only 1 of 18 fetuses (scores≥5 points) achieved biventricular circulation. <b>Conclusions:</b> A multiparametric scoring system based on prenatal fetal echocardiographic parameters can effectively predict non-biventricular postnatal outcomes in fetuses with CPS-IVS and PA-IVS. By identifying high-risk patients, the indications for FPV can be optimized."

It is the main basis of decision making for the patient. Transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) has been established as the standard treatment option for symptomatic aortic stenosis-patients. Current guidelines recommend transfemoral TAVI for patients aged 70 years or older, independently of the surgical risk and for patients below 70 years of age if they are at high surgical risk. AIM To evaluate beneficial aspects of an explanatory video in addition to conventional medical counseling. METHODS The study was conducted as a prospective, single-arm, monocentric cohort study. Eligible patients received conventional medical counseling, followed by an educational video. Evaluation of the conventional counseling and the educational video was obtained through a 32-item questionnaire. Two hypotheses were tested: Hypothesis 1: Showing an explanatory video in addition to the standard patient consent discussion improves the mediation of medical facts; and hypothesis 2: Showing an explanatory video in addition to the standard patient consent discussion improves patient satisfaction and confidence. RESULTS In total, 66 patients, scheduled for transfemoral TAVI were included, 59% of them were male and 41% female, averaging 81 ± 6.1 years old. Conventional medical counseling by the attending physician was the major criterium for overall patient satisfaction and had more influence on the absence of preprocedural tension than the transfer of additional factual knowledge through the video. Nearly two-thirds (61%) reported that the video enhanced their understanding of the procedure’s benefits, while 42% indicated a better understanding of the potential risks and 56% felt that watching the video contributed to decreased preprocedural tension. CONCLUSION Conventional medical counseling was most important for overall patient satisfaction. Educational videos aid in information transfer, in the reduction of preprocedural tension and were strongly sought after by the patients."
