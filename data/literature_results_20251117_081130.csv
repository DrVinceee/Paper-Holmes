Alternative imaging modalities are important for the confirmation of AS severity in patients with discordant AS or inadequate assessment by TTE. Multimodality imaging can inform prognosis in patients with AS. In this article, we discuss the role of multimodality imaging for accurate diagnosis of AS severity and assessment of prognosis to inform patient management. We provide an overview of the use of computed tomography for procedural planning for transcatheter aortic valve replacement."
PubMed,aortic stenosis,Fixing the rhythm in transcatheter aortic valve implantation patients: can we reduce the need for permanent pacemaker implantation?,Teodor Serban; Andrea Papa; Patrick Badertscher,10.1080/14779072.2025.2591793,2025-11-16,Expert review of cardiovascular therapy,"Transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) has revolutionized the treatment of severe aortic stenosis, yet conduction disturbances remain the most common complication. Permanent pacemaker implantation (PPI), while often necessary, may negatively impact long-term outcomes and increase healthcare burden. Identifying patients at risk of PPI and optimizing post-TAVI rhythm management is therefore of critical importance.
This Special Report reviews key predictors of conduction disturbances after TAVI, including baseline electrocardiographic features (e.g. right bundle branch block), anatomical parameters (e.g. short membranous septum), and procedural factors (e.g. valve type and implantation depth) identified by literature review. Dynamic post-procedural changes in PR interval and QRS duration are discussed as triggers for further monitoring or electrophysiological testing. The report synthesizes findings from recent multicenter studies, guideline recommendations, and emerging tools such as ECG ambulatory monitoring using artificial intelligence and the MIDAS implantation technique.
Reducing unnecessary PPI requires an individualized, risk-adapted approach that integrates imaging, ECG, and procedural planning. Dynamic post-TAVI monitoring and selective use of electrophysiological studies may help avoid overtreatment. As TAVI expands to younger and lower-risk populations, refining conduction management will be essential to optimize patient outcomes and healthcare resource utilization."

This study assessed HCRU and healthcare costs among patients with oHCM treated in real-world settings over 5 years of follow-up.
This retrospective cohort study used the Optum database (January 2013-December 2021) and included patients aged ≥18 years with ≥2 claims for oHCM and continuous health plan enrollment for ≥6 months pre-initial and post-initial oHCM claim (index date). Patients with ≥5 years of follow-up data were analyzed. All-cause and HCM-related HCRU (ambulatory visits [physician office visits and outpatient visits], emergency room [ER] visits, hospital admissions, length of stay [LOS], and pharmacy use) and healthcare costs were assessed in US dollars.
In total, 5,129 patients with oHCM were identified: 5,056 (98.6%) had an all-cause ambulatory visit and 4,669 (91.0%) had an HCM-related visit. 4,079 (79.5%) had an all-cause ER visit, and 1,499 (29.2%) an HCM-related ER visit. 2,949 (57.5%) reported an all-cause admission, and 2,232 (43.5%) an HCM-related admission. The mean (SD) per-person count of all-cause ambulatory visits was 101.0 (90.7) and 15.3 (18.7) for HCM-related ambulatory visits. Mean (SD) all-cause admissions per patient were 1.8 (3.8), and 0.9 (1.6) were HCM related. Mean (SD) all-cause LOS was 18.0 (54.7) days, and HCM-related LOS was 10.0 (39.6) days. Mean (SD) all-cause healthcare cost per patient was $181,968 (241,608), of which $67,531 (114,705) was HCM related. Hospital admissions were the largest proportion of medical costs: all-cause admissions cost $71,001 (149,533) during follow-up, of which $44,781 (99,431) was HCM-related.
Analyses were unadjusted for covariates or confounding factors.
Patients with oHCM experience substantial HCRU and costs over 5 years of follow-up. These results indicate a need for new treatment options which could decrease HCRU and improve patient outcomes."

Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement (TAVR) aims to immediately alleviate the aortic pressure gradient and thereby changing LV cardiac mechanics. The aim was to describe by in-vivo assessment of LV pressure-volume (PV) relationships how TAVR acutely affects LV cardiac mechanics.
In this prospective observational study in patients with severe AS, LV cardiac mechanics were evaluated with an LV conductance catheter before and after TAVR. The effects of transcatheter valve design, pre- and post-dilatation, use of rapid pacing (≥180 bpm) and LV ejection fraction (EF) were specifically addressed.
In-vivo LV PV reconstructions were obtained in 61 patients. Stroke work (SW) and pressure volume area (PVA) were significantly lower following TAVR (decrease from median (25th-75th percentile) of 10,935.6 (6,877.5-13,490.8) to 6,878.0 (4,870.8-8,613.8) mmHg/mL, p<0.001 and from 17,831.5 (12,414.9-22,416.8) to 11,024.9 (8,364.7-14,705.0) mmHg/mL, p<0.001, respectively) with stable SW/PVA ratios. Overall, end-systolic and end-diastolic pressures and volumes were significantly lower after TAVR. Arterial Elastance, as an index for LV afterload also decreased (2.66 (2.01-3.87) to 1.96 (1.25-2.72) mmHg/mL, p<0.001). LV contractility declined as illustrated by a reduction in End-systolic Elastance (2.22 (1.50-3.10) to 1.58 (1.08-2.43) mmHg/mL, p<0.001). The trends in changing LV cardiac mechanics were similar for balloon- and self-expanding valves and were not affected by pre/post dilatation, rapid pacing or LV EF.
TAVR for severe AS resulted in immediate LV unloading, lower myocardial metabolic demand and impaired contractility.

Advances,"Cardiac damage stage predicts clinical outcomes in severe aortic stenosis (AS), yet its validation in moderate AS and natural history preaortic valve replacement (AVR) and post-AVR is poorly understood.
This paper sought to: 1) determine whether index cardiac damage stage predicts cardiovascular outcomes in patients with moderate AS; and 2) describe the impact of AVR on cardiac damage stage over time.
This retrospective single-center cohort study stratified patients with moderate AS according to index cardiac damage stage. We assessed whether cardiac damage stage predicted a primary composite outcome of all-cause death and heart failure (HF) hospitalization and a secondary outcome of AVR. Changes in stage over time were also assessed.
Among 688 patients (median follow-up of 3.6 years), baseline cardiac damage stages 0, 1, 2, and 3 to 4 were evident in 25.1%, 24.1%, 41.6%, and 9.2%, respectively. Escalating baseline stage conferred an increased risk of the composite primary endpoint (incidence per 1,000 person years, stage 0: 52 [37, 72]; stage 1: 100 [77, 129], stage 2: 94 [77, 116]; stages 3 to 4: 255 [185, 352]; HR (95% CI); P < 0.001], which was mirrored in survival analyses (all-cause death and HF hospitalization: Plog-rank < 0.001). The net result of awaiting AVR (median time 3.1 years) was an accumulation of cardiac damage, which partially resolved at 1-year.
Cardiac damage stage is associated with an increasing risk of all-cause mortality and HF hospitalization in patients with moderate AS. The degree of damage accumulates as patients await AVR, which partially recovers post-AVR."

Without effective medical therapies, intervention mainly relies on timely valve replacement, although silent myocardial and valvular damage may progress before symptoms arise. Early, non-invasive detection of disease activity is a crucial unmet need.
To review circulating and mechanistic biomarkers reflecting the core pathogenic pathways of CAVD and asses their potential for early detection and patient-specific risk stratification.
Narrative review of literature focusing on traditional protein biomarkers, emerging non-coding RNAs, and extracellular vesicles (EVs) associated with lipid oxidation and inflammation, bone and mineral metabolism, extracellular matrix (ECM) remodelling, endothelial dysfunction and non-coding RNA regulation.
Traditional protein biomarkers-such as lipoprotein(a), osteopontin, fetuin-A, galectin-3 and matrix metalloproteinases-offer insights into the disease and correlate with disease burden but lack sensitivity for detecting early-stage CAVD. Emerging non-coding RNA markers, including long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) and microRNAs (like miR-30b and miR-125b), show promise as predictive and diagnostic tools by mediating key molecular pathways involved in calcification and inflammation. EVs, which carry proteins, lipids and nucleic acids across all pathogenic pathways, provide stable and comprehensive signatures that enhance risk stratification compared to conventional markers. Notably, no single biomarker has demonstrated sufficient sensitivity or specificity across all stages of the disease. Combining proteins, RNAs and EV cargo into integrative, multimodal panels-supported by proteomics and transcriptomics-provides the greatest potential for early detection and patient-specific management. However, further validation in prospective cohorts and standardization of assays are necessary before clinical implementation.
Biomarker-guided approaches could revolutionize CAVD management by enabling early detection and patient stratification before irreversible valvular damage occurs."

With recent clinical trials indicating that transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) is at least on par with surgical aortic valve replacement (SAVR) in treating lower risk patients, there has been a rise in TAVR uptake in younger, lower risk patients, leading to an increased likelihood of bioprosthetic valve degradation within a patient's lifetime. This shift in treatment has changed the landscape of interventional cardiology, incentivising the Heart Team to now plan for the initial procedure with subsequent interventions in mind. While traditional multi-slice computed tomography image-based risk assessments are sufficient for initial valve placement, they fall short in their ability to accurately predict post-procedural outcomes and future interventions. Therefore, the need to balance competing risks to optimise patient outcomes over multiple interventions requires innovation. CT-derived computational techniques are being developed to incorporate biomechanics and fluid dynamics into the risk assessment process to allow more comprehensive analysis of the risks associated with different procedures. The goal of this review is to provide an overview of computational techniques that are being developed for the purposes of optimising outcomes in both the index and valve-in-valve interventions and to give cardiologists an understanding of how they may use computational modelling as an additional tool in the lifetime management of aortic stenosis."

A multicentre cross-sectional study.
We analysed data from the Searching for Atrial Fibrillation and Early Recruitment of Heart Failure in HCM registry, collected between 2018 and 2023.
Patients with HCM (n=499) aged ≥18 years from 12 institutions (Shizuoka Prefecture, Japan) were consecutively enrolled.
Clinical parameters, along with data from a short form of the Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire (KCCQ-12), were collected. The association between each clinical parameter and the KCCQ-12 score was analysed. Clinical parameters with a significant univariable association (p<0.05) were used in a multiple regression model to investigate independent clinical parameters associated with the KCCQ-12 score. The coefficients and relative importance of each parameter included in the multiple regression model were also evaluated.
In the univariable analysis, KCCQ-12 scores exhibited significant associations with 21 clinical parameters, including sex, left ventricular morphology and the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI). The multiple regression model with 12 parameters that had a significant univariable association exhibited an adjusted R2 of 0.48. In this model, the PSQI (standardised coefficient -0.39; p<0.001), history of sustained ventricular tachycardia or fibrillation, history of atrial fibrillation (-0.23; p<0.001), female sex (-0.19; p=0.035), systolic blood pressure (0.17; p=0.040), lateral E/e prime (-0.17; p=0.049) and A wave (-0.14, p=0.049) were independently associated with the KCCQ-12 score with high relative importance.
In patients with HCM, we investigated the association between the KCCQ-12 score and various clinical parameters. PSQI, as well as known heart failure-related clinical parameters, was significantly associated with the KCCQ-12 score. Visualising the associations of various clinical parameters with the KCCQ-12 score will help physicians to consider factors linked to the decline in QOL in patients with HCM."

To explore what factors have led us to consider more than 50% of the global population special, we assessed access to transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) by sex on national and local levels and studied post-TAVI outcomes by sex within our centre.
Population statistics from census data were compared against British Cardiovascular Intervention Society (BCIS) audit and local data.Using the National Institute for Cardiovascular Outcomes Research TAVI database, a retrospective analysis of 1049 consecutive patients from 2013 to 2023 was conducted at our UK tertiary centre.Primary outcomes were all-cause death, a three-point composite of major adverse cardiac events (MACE) comprising death, non-fatal myocardial infarction and non-fatal stroke during TAVI admission, and post-TAVI survival.
Nationally, females comprise 60% of over 75-year-olds; however, TAVI was performed more frequently in males: nationally (55.2% vs 44.8%, p<0.01) and locally (53.2% vs 46.8%, p<0.01). Males were 1.82 times more likely to undergo TAVI.Locally, females undergoing TAVI were older and had worse renal function, higher frailty and greater transvalvular gradients. Males had more cardiovascular comorbidity.In-hospital mortality and MACE did not differ by sex. Median survival was longer in females (1350 days vs 1728 days, p=0.02). Regression analysis demonstrated female sex as a predictor of increased survival (HR 0.73, 95% CI 0.61 to 0.88, p<0.01). Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, atrial fibrillation, frailty and poor mobility were identified as predictors of reduced survival.
In this retrospective, observational study, we have demonstrated an under-representation of females undergoing TAVI. This observation is likely of multifactorial cause, including different disease recognition, referral, investigation and treatment practices.We observed no difference in procedural death or MACE, but longer female survival, despite higher baseline age, frailty and renal impairment."

Zeitschrift fur Gefasskrankheiten,"Background: Bilateral symptoms of peripheral artery disease may be rarely caused by isolated atherosclerotic aortic stenosis or short occlusion. Standard therapies have been open surgery, balloon angioplasty and implantation of selfexpanding stents and stentgrafts. Materials and methods: In this retrospective study 54 consecutive patients were treated under local anaesthesia with a balloon-expandable endograft. Endpoints were safety, ankle-brachial and toe-brachial index (ABI, TBI), walking distance, clinical stage and re-interventions at long-term. Results: There were 36 women and 18 men, mean age 68 years; 48 patients suffered from claudication, 6 patients had rest pain with skin lesions in 3 cases. The technical success rate was 100%. There was an immediate average improvement of ABI from 0.76 +/- 0.26 at rest before intervention to 0.88 +/- 0.31 at rest after stentgraft implantation into the aortic stenosis. TBI improved from 0.48 +/- 0.17 to 0.58 +/- 23 at rest. Mean follow-up was 1 to 8 years (mean 4.46) years. Average walking distance improved from 124 m to 612 m. Of the 6 patients with rest pain or skin lesions all except 1 patient improved to at least claudication stage with a painfree walking distance over 200 m. No complications such as aortic rupture, dissection or peripheral embolisation occurred, 2 patients needed surgical revision of their calcified common femoral arteries at the access sites. Three patients developed at long-term recurrent stenosis due to the compression of stentgrafts by the calcified plaque burden which was solved by balloon angioplasty or implantation of an additional aortic stentgraft.

While transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) has shown early advantages over surgical aortic valve replacement (SAVR) in women, long-term sex-specific outcomes remain unclear. To evaluate outcomes at 5 years comparing TAVR versus SAVR a systematic review and meta-analysis was performed.
A systematic literature review was conducted, identifying all randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing TAVR with SAVR which included women with completed 5-year follow-up. The primary outcome was the composite of all-cause mortality or disabling stroke. Meta-analysis was performed using both random-effects and fixed-effect models. The study protocol was registered in PROSPERO (CRD420251004394).
Six RCTs were included with a total of 3,094 women (1,587 TAVR and 1,507 SAVR). Overall, no significant difference was observed in the primary outcome between TAVR and SAVR (Incidence Rate Ratios [IRR] 1.00, 95% Confidence Interval [CI]: 0.88-1.13, p = 0.98). Meta-regression did not find any association between key clinical covariates and the primary outcome. Trial sequential analysis demonstrated that the extracted sample size met the required information size, but a definitive treatment effect was not confirmed.
While TAVR shows an advantage over SAVR at 1-year follow-up in women, all-cause mortality or disabling stroke are similar in TAVR and SAVR at 5 years. Future studies must include sex-disaggregated reporting of both primary and secondary outcomes in order to comprehensively weigh risks and benefits of each intervention and inform personalized treatment strategies.

This study evaluated outcomes of aortic root replacement (ARR) when valve preservation was initially intended, irrespective of the eventual procedural success.
We retrospectively reviewed patients who underwent ARR (VSRR or Bentall) between 2002 and 2023, excluding those with aortic stenosis, prior AVR, endocarditis, or partial root replacement. Patients were categorized as single-clamp VSRR (S-VSRR, n=251), multiple-clamp VSRR (M-VSRR, n=16), failed VSRR (F-VSRR, n=10), and primary Bentall (n=548).
VSRR was unsuccessful, or required multiple cross-clamp attempts in 9.4% of cases. Failure occurred in 1.0% of aneurysm and 2.5% of dissection cases (p=0.28). Bentall patients were older (58 ± 14 years) than S-VSRR (48.2 ± 14.2 years) and M-VSRR (48 ± 13 years; p < 0.01). Preoperative severe AR was most frequent in F-VSRR (70%). Preservation succeeded in 83% with moderate-to-severe AR versus 89% with none-to-mild AR. Leaflet repair was more common in M-VSRR (43.8%) than S-VSRR (19.5%; p=0.02). In unadjusted analysis, F-VSRR was associated with more bleeding-related reoperations and longer ICU and hospital stays. At follow-up, 85.6% of S-VSRR and 68.7% of M-VSRR had none-to-mild AR. Mortality and reoperation rates were low across groups.
VSRR was technically challenging or unsuccessful in about 10% of cases, especially with advanced AR. Although mid-term survival and valve durability were comparable, these patients may experience higher perioperative morbidity, underscoring the need for careful patient selection and intraoperative judgement."

However, catheter malposition and inadequate venting are not uncommon because of limited visibility. Although transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) can assist in catheter monitoring, TEE-guided management strategies remain underreported. This study aimed to characterize catheter-related issues and describe effective troubleshooting approaches.
We retrospectively analyzed intraoperative TEE findings in 304 patients who underwent open-heart surgery at Kochi University Hospital, including 200 with LV venting and 104 with LA venting. TEE records of catheter-related events and corrective maneuvers were reviewed, and challenges in TEE assessment were identified.
No catheter-related injuries were observed. In the LV group, TEE identified failure of ventricular entry (n = 5), impingement on papillary muscles or the apex (n = 18), and catheter-induced mitral regurgitation (n = 11). Residual air was frequently localized distant from the catheter tip. In the LA group, misplacement into pulmonary veins (n = 9) or the left atrial appendage (LAA) (n = 2) was noted. Venting was ineffective in cases of acute LV distension during antegrade cardioplegia or due to Thebesian venous return. In some cases, deep catheter placement resulted in incomplete drainage of the right-sided LA.
Both LA and LV venting have distinct pitfalls. TEE facilitates identification and correction of catheter-related problems, but structured training in TEE assessment is essential to optimize outcomes."

We evaluated the clinical utility of the 6MWD by quantifying the gap between the expected and observed physical performance and estimating its determinants.
Outpatients with wild-type (ATTRwt)-CM were investigated. Standardized echocardiographic, laboratory and clinical assessments were performed. A regression formula derived from a healthy local population sample was applied to predict the expected 6MWD. Associations with 6MWD were analyzed by linear regression, adjusted for age and height. Explanatory multivariable models using backward elimination, regularization and clinical reasoning were calculated.
100 patients were analyzed. Their mean age was 78.7 (6.3) years and 86% were men. The mean observed 6MWD was 310 (113) m, which corresponded to about 65% of the expected performance. Significant predictors of the 6MWD were (ordered by decreasing explanatory power): high-sensitivity Troponin T, NT-proBNP, NAC disease stage, estimated glomerular filtration rate, atrial fibrillation, hemoglobin, hepatic vein dilation, mitral E-wave maximum velocity, left ventricular ejection fraction, and the tricuspid valve maximal regurgitation pressure gradient. Multivariable models yielded an R² of up to 45.9% with a root mean squared error of 82.9 m.
Physical performance as measured by the 6MWD in patients with ATTRwt-CM was remarkably compromised. Laboratory and imaging markers indicative of disease severity and congestion predicted the 6MWD in these patients. Cardiovascular markers explained a fair amount of 6MWD variability."

However, other mechanisms contributing to mitral regurgitation may coexist as a result of further structural abnormalities. SAM might occur because of the increased septal thickness alone or due to simultaneous MV or subvalvular apparatus anomalies, such as mitral leaflet elongation, papillary muscle body anomalies, accessory papillary muscles or additional papillary muscle heads. Additionally, anomalous mitral chordae or the recently described mitral-aortic discontinuity (leading to a longer anterior mitral leaflet (AML)) can contribute to abnormal physiology. A closed aortomitral angle may also contribute. During intraoperative echocardiographic assessment, it is important to thoroughly evaluate the MV and the regurgitant jet to understand the mechanism(s) that cause MR in HCM patients. Although myectomy alone is frequently enough to correct SAM, concomitant MV procedures may be needed, especially when the septum is thin (<16-18 mm) and/or there is intrinsic MV disease. Detection of concomitant regurgitation mechanisms beyond SAM can eventually be identified preoperatively, either by direct structural detection (valve prolapse), by pharmacological palliation of SAM with vasopressors and negative inotropic agents or suspected by identification of anteriorly and centrally directed regurgitant mitral jets. Surgical techniques that can be employed to contribute to SAM elimination include plication/extension/retention plasty of the AML, resection/release/reorientation of papillary muscles, division of anomalous chordae, edge-to-edge repair, or, at times, prosthetic MV replacement. If there is structural MV disease concomitant to HCM, appropriately tailored techniques to address the MV may be used. Transoesophageal echocardiography at the end of the procedure should demonstrate elimination of SAM, resolution of LVOT obstruction, and appropriate coaptation of the MV leaflets and nearly resolution of MR. Provocation with inotropes can be used to ensure no latent obstruction persists."

Case reports,"Degenerative mitral regurgitation (DMR) is associated with substantial morbidity and mortality if left untreated. While surgical repair remains the gold standard, mitral transcatheter edge-to-edge repair (M-TEER) is an established alternative for patients at high surgical risk. However, recurrent MR after initial M-TEER remains a therapeutic challenge and is associated with poor outcomes.
A 77-year-old patient presented with recurrent heart failure symptoms due to MR after prior CARILLON® device implantation for secondary MR at an external hospital in September 2019. Transoesophageal echocardiography revealed degenerative mitral valve disease characterized by a complex combination of posterior leaflet prolapse and anterior leaflet flail, resulting in a severe eccentric regurgitant jet.The patient underwent successful M-TEER with the MitraClip® system in December 2021. In June 2023, the patient was re-hospitalized for recurrent heart failure symptoms. Imaging revealed severe recurrent MR originating lateral to the implanted device. A redo M-TEER was performed using the PASCAL® system, requiring careful navigation through a narrow residual lateral orifice. The procedure resulted in a durable reduction to mild MR with sustained clinical stability at 18-month follow-up.
This case illustrates the anatomical challenges of DMR and demonstrates the feasibility and durability of redo M-TEER in high surgical risk patients with recurrent MR. It emphasizes the importance of individualized anatomical assessment and tailored device selection in complex valve anatomies."

Transcatheter edge-to-edge repair (TEER) is a viable treatment, but its long-term survival impact, particularly across sexes, remains underexplored. We aimed to assess relative survival (RS) and excess mortality (EM) in patients undergoing TEER for significant MR, with a focus on sex-based differences. Methods: We analyzed 253 patients treated with TEER between October 2015 and August 2024, stratified by sex. Observed survival (OS) was calculated using the actuarial life table method; expected survival (ES) was estimated via the Ederer II method using matched population data. Primary endpoints were RS and EM; secondary endpoints included mortality differences by MR subtype. Results: OS at 1, 2, and 3 years was 88.9%, 87.4%, and 78.9%, respectively. EM peaked in the first year (7.8%) and declined thereafter. RS was lower than in the general population, primarily due to persistently reduced RS and elevated EM in men. Women achieved RS comparable to matched peers from year one. Sex was not an independent predictor of mortality (HR 0.88, 95% CI 0.38-2.03, p = 0.771). Conclusions: In patients with significant MR undergoing TEER, EM was concentrated in the first year. Women reached RS comparable to the general population, while men showed persistent excess mortality. Sex was not independently associated with survival after adjustment."

Its prevalence and prognostic significance in athletes remain uncertain, raising important questions for pre-participation screening, eligibility for competition, and long-term follow-up. Methods: We systematically searched PubMed, Scopus, and EMBASE databases from inception through August 2025 for original studies reporting MVP prevalence in athletes, diagnosed by echocardiography or pathological assessment. Data on study characteristics, diagnostic definitions, prevalence, arrhythmias, and outcomes were independently extracted by three reviewers. Methodological quality was appraised using the National Institutes of Health Quality Assessment Tool for Observational Cohort and Cross-Sectional Studies. Results: Twelve studies published between 1987 and 2024 met inclusion criteria, enrolling 19,463 athletes from diverse sports and competitive levels. A total of 407 MVP cases were identified, corresponding to a crude pooled prevalence of 2.4%. Prevalence estimates varied substantially (0.2-20%), reflecting heterogeneity in study populations and diagnostic definitions. When all studies were pooled using a random-effects model, the overall prevalence was 2.0% (95% CI 1.2-2.8%). A sensitivity analysis restricted to contemporary, unselected athletic cohorts yielded a prevalence of 1.1% (95% CI 0.4-1.9%), closely aligning with population-based estimates. Ventricular arrhythmias were more frequent than supraventricular arrhythmias, particularly in association with bileaflet prolapse, leaflet thickening, or significant mitral regurgitation. Most athletes were asymptomatic, and only one prospective study provided long-term follow-up, confirming a generally benign prognosis, though rare adverse events (atrial fibrillation, valve surgery) were documented. Conclusions: MVP is relatively uncommon in athletes and occurs at rates similar to the general population. In most cases, prognosis is favorable and should not preclude sports participation. Nonetheless, recognition of high-risk phenotypes with arrhythmogenic potential highlights the need for individualized evaluation and tailored surveillance strategies in sports cardiology practice."

She had experienced dyspnea, weight loss, recurrent abdominal pain, and chronic anemia over the past six months. Examination revealed congested lungs, sweating, tachycardia, and laboratory findings indicative of inflammation. Echocardiography identified multiple obstructing masses in the left atrium moving into the left ventricle during diastole, causing severe mitral regurgitation. Imaging revealed old infarcts in the brain, liver, and spleen. Blood cultures were positive for Enterococcus faecalis, and empirical antibiotics were initiated. Urgent surgery was performed, including left atrial myxoma resection, mitral valve replacement with a bioprosthetic valve, left atrial appendage closure, and closure of the interatrial septum. Postoperative echocardiography confirmed normal left ventricular function and a well-functioning bioprosthetic mitral valve. The patient tolerated the procedure well and was discharged on a regimen of oral antibiotics for six weeks.
Infected cardiac myxomas, though rare, pose significant risks due to their potential for systemic embolization and severe complications. This case emphasizes the necessity of comprehensive diagnostic evaluation and timely surgical intervention to prevent catastrophic outcomes.

Mitral Transcatheter edge-to-edge repair (M-TEER) has become a groundbreaking treatment option for high-risk patients ineligible for conventional surgery, with the MitraClip system standing as the most widely validated and utilized device in this field.
This study aimed to evaluate the immediate procedural outcomes and long-term clinical results of MitraClip interventions in Turkish patients with secondary mitral regurgitation. The primary objectives were to determine the rate of procedural success according to standardized Mitral Valve Academic Research Consortium (MVARC) criteria and to assess the proportion of patients achieving optimal mitral regurgitation reduction (MR ≤ 1+) at hospital discharge. The secondary objectives were to identify independent clinical, echocardiographic, and procedural predictors associated with rehospitalization for heart failure and all-cause mortality during follow-up, and to evaluate the durability of mitral regurgitation reduction and functional improvement over the medium-term follow-up period.
This retrospective study included 140 Turkish patients with moderate-to-severe (grade 3+) or severe (grade 4+) SMR who underwent MitraClip treatment between 2021 and 2024, with a median follow-up of 23.5 months (interquartile range [IQR]: 14.0–27.0). MR severity was assessed by comprehensive echocardiographic evaluation according to current guidelines, and post-procedure MR was classified as ≤ 1 + or > 1 + for outcome analyses.
The study population had a median age of 75.0 (IQR: 68.0–78.0) years, with 42.9% being female. Procedural success according to MVARC criteria was achieved in 137 patients (97.9%), while MR ≤ 1 + at discharge was observed in 95 patients (67.9%). During follow-up, 56.4% of patients required rehospitalization, and the mortality rate was 7.1%. Significant improvement in functional capacity was observed, with 88.6% of patients improving by at least one New York Heart Association (NYHA) functional class at 1-month follow-up (from 100% NYHA class III-IV at baseline to 11.4% class III, 70.0% class II, and 18.6% class I post-procedure). Multivariate analysis revealed that estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) (Hazard ratio [HR] 0.95, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.91–0.99, p = 0.03), atrial fibrillation (HR 1.62, 95% CI: 1.02–2.57, p = 0.04), and post-procedure MR severity (MR grade > 1 + vs. ≤1+) (HR 1.73, 95% CI: 1.13–2.65, p = 0.01) were associated with rehospitalization. Mortality risk was associated with lower hemoglobin (HR 0.92, 95% CI: 0.86–0.99, p = 0.04), and severe MR (HR 2.54, 95% CI: 1.09–5.92, p = 0.03).
MitraClip intervention demonstrated high procedural success rates in Turkish patients with SMR, leading to significant reduction in MR severity and improvement in NYHA functional class. While rehospitalization and mortality rates aligned with previous studies, specific clinical factors were identified as being associated with clinical outcomes.

The aim of this study was to understand M-TEER outcomes stratified by the extent of EMCD.
One-year outcomes from the randomized CLASP IID (Edwards PASCAL Transcatheter Valve Repair System Pivotal Clinical Trial) trial (NCT03706833) in prohibitive surgical risk patients with 3+ or 4+ DMR were analyzed by baseline EMCD stages (stage 0, no EMCD; stage 1, left ventricular remodeling; stage 2, left atrial remodeling; stage 3, pulmonary hypertension and/or tricuspid regurgitation; stage 4, right ventricular dysfunction).
The analysis included 211 patients: 53.1% in stages 0, 1, and 2 (n = 112), 13.3% in stage 3 (n = 28), and 33.6% in stage 4 (n = 71). Stages 0, 1, and 2 were combined because there were few patients in stage 0 (n = 3) and stage 1 (n = 1). At baseline, patients with more advanced cardiac damage had more comorbidities, lower functional and quality-of-life measures, and greater mitral regurgitation severity. One-year rates of clinical events among all stages were comparable for major adverse events (P = 0.343) and all-cause mortality (P = 0.644) and significantly different for heart failure hospitalization (P = 0.012). Patients in all stages achieved comparable echocardiographic and quality-of-life improvements at 1 year, including mitral regurgitation ≤1+ (P = 0.474), left ventricular diastolic (P = 0.619) and systolic (P = 0.676) volumes, and Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire score (P = 0.335), with significant improvements from baseline (P < 0.05 vs baseline for all).

To assess whether systemic inflammation, measured by high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP), elevates HF risk in patients with AF.
This prospective study included 32,502 AF participants from the UK Biobank without baseline HF, significant mitral valve disease, or inflammatory conditions. Hs-CRP was analyzed both as quartiles and using a clinical cut-off value of ≥2 mg/dL. The association with incident HF was evaluated using Cox models and Fine-Gray regression. Sensitivity analyses included sequential exclusion of comorbidities and early events, as well as propensity score matching (PSM).
Over a median follow-up of 13.3 years, 6,805 incident HF cases were documented. The cumulative incidence of HF increased significantly across hs-CRP quartiles, from 16.5% (1,386/8,419) in Q1 to 26.9% (2,096/7,786) in Q4 (Log-rank P < 0.001). In fully adjusted models, Q4 had 61% higher HF risk than Q1 (hazard ratio [HR] 1.61, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.51-1.73). Elevated hs-CRP (≥2 mg/dL) (HR 1.39, 95% CI 1.33-1.46) and per-standard-deviation increase (HR 1.12, 95% CI 1.10-1.15) were consistently associated with higher HF risk. These findings remained robust across all sensitivity analyses, subgroup comparisons, PSM cohorts, and competing risk models.
Elevated hs-CRP is an independent predictor of increased HF risk in patients with AF, supporting its potential role in improving HF risk stratification."

A 44-year-old man with severe pectus excavatum presented with SCD due to ventricular fibrillation. Evaluation revealed a previously undiagnosed myxomatous bicuspid aortic valve with severe regurgitation and a small right coronary ostium compressed by the chest wall. Other causes of ventricular fibrillation were excluded. The patient underwent combined aortic valve replacement and pectus excavatum repair. Genetic testing identified a novel filamin A (FLNA) variant of uncertain significance (c.6361C>T, p.Val2206Met), potentially affecting protein function.
To our knowledge, this is the first reported case suggesting a potential association between a FLNA gene variant and severe pectus excavatum with concomitant myxomatous valvular disease.
Severe pectus excavatum has been reported as a rare cause of SCD, but the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. A novel FLNA gene variant may provide additional insights in this case."

The structure of Lp(a) is similar to plasminogen and tissue plasminogen activator and it competes with plasminogen for its binding site, leading to reduced fibrinolysis. Furthermore, since Lp(a) stimulates the secretion of plasminogen activator inhibitor-1, it may lead to thrombogenesis. In this cross-sectional study, we aimed to investigate Lp(a) levels in patients with mechanical prosthetic valve thrombosis (MPVT). Blood samples for Lp(a) determination were obtained from 80 MPVT patients (median age: 48.5 (39-59.75) years; 47 male) and 75 age and sex matched controls (median age: 52 (39-63) years; 44 male) with normally functioning mechanical prosthetic valves. The Lp(a) levels in the PVT group were significantly higher than in the controls [22(16.2-39.4) vs. 6.9(2.9-24.6) mg/dL, p < 0.001]. Elevated Lp(a) levels, recent history of subtherapeutic anticoagulation, history of cerebrovascular accidents (CVA) and a low value of international normalized ratio on admission were found to be the independent predictors of PVT. Lp(a) levels above 19.6 mg/dL predicted PVT with a sensitivity of 65% and a specificity of 71% (AUC:0.767; 95%CI: 0.687 to 0.847; p < 0.001). Lp(a) levels were significantly higher in PVT patients with a history of CVA [42.0 (23.6-53.6) vs. 21.1 (16.1- 36.2) mg/dL, p = 0.012]. Elevated Lp(a) levels may be associated with MPVT. The assessment of plasma Lp(a) levels in patients with prosthetic heart valves may provide additive information regarding the risk of PVT and CVA."

To characterize the role of anti-RNA polymerase III (RNAPIII) antibody positivity in the pathophysiology of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)-related cardiac involvement in SSc patients.
We retrospectively analyzed four SSc patients with anti-RNAPIII antibodies who developed cardiac complications after COVID-19. This study was approved by the University of Osaka Clinical Research Review Board.
All patients were female and had been diagnosed within the past 3 years. Case 1 presented with elevated myocardial enzymes and severe cardiac injury requiring mechanical circulatory support. The diagnosis of COVID-19-related fulminant myocarditis was made. The other three patients did not have elevated myocardial enzymes but had elevated brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) or N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) and pericardial effusion or decreased LVEF and respiratory distress, suggesting the appearance of COVID-19-induced cardiac dysfunction.
Patients with anti-RNAPIII-positive SSc may have an increased risk of developing cardiac complications after COVID-19. The pathogenesis may involve angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2)-mediated mechanisms, which may include reducing ACE2 expression, leading to increased angiotensin II activity and induce cytokine storm. These results underline the importance of understanding the interplay between autoimmune diseases and infections in promoting immune-mediated cardiac injury. Further investigation is needed to characterize the role of anti-RNAPIII antibodies in the pathophysiology of COVID-19-related cardiac involvement."

This narrative (non-systematic) review synthesizes validated HRQoL instruments used in VHD, spanning generic tools - the Short Form-36 and derivatives (SF-12, SF-6D), EuroQol 5-Dimensions (EQ-5D), and World Health Organization Quality of Life - Brief (WHOQOL-BREF) - and disease-specific measures such as the Minnesota Living with Heart Failure Questionnaire (MLHFQ) and Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire (KCCQ). Instruments were included if (i) applied to adult VHD populations or valve interventions or (ii) demonstrated use in VHD cohorts; English-language sources (primarily 2015-2025) were prioritized, retaining seminal pre-2015 validation papers. Pediatric-only cohorts, non-validated tools, and case reports were excluded. MLHFQ and KCCQ were included on an evidence basis: both have been validated in valvular populations and used as key endpoints in pivotal interventional studies, demonstrating high reliability and sensitivity to change after surgical aortic valve replacement (SAVR), transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVI), and transcateter edge-to-edge repair (TEER). Their established minimal clinically important differences and the availability of a short form (KCCQ-12) further support feasibility and interpretability in practice. The review is descriptive and therefore psychometric properties (validity, reliability, responsiveness, minimal clinically important differences), covered domains, feasibility, and cultural/linguistic adaptation are summarized from existing studies. Emphasis is placed on domains most germane to VHD recovery - physical function, symptom burden, emotional well-being, and social/role participation - given their sensitivity to peri-interventional change. Recommendations for clinical integration (e.g., pairing a generic utility measure such as EQ-5D with a disease-specific tool such as KCCQ; standardized assessment at baseline, 30 days, six and 12 months) are evidence-informed (randomized trials, registries, guidelines). Key gaps include limited valve-specific content (e.g., prosthesis noise, anticoagulation burden), heterogeneity in instruments and time points, incomplete cultural validation, and scarce HRQoL data for emerging therapies (e.g. transcatheter mitral valve replacement, contemporary tricuspid interventions). As a narrative (non-systematic) purely descriptive synthesis, no formal risk-of-bias assessment or meta-analysis was conducted. The English-language restriction and heterogeneity across instruments and follow-up time points limit quantitative comparability and preclude definitive head-to-head conclusions. Future work should develop core outcome sets and VHD-specific modules, strengthen cross-cultural validation, and leverage digital patient-reported outcome platforms to improve comparability and clinical uptake."

Percutaneous device closure has become the preferred treatment because of its efficacy and lower complication rates. While right heart remodeling post-closure is well established, the effects on left atrial (LA) function, especially phasic components involving reservoir, conduit, and contraction strain, remain less understood. Two-dimensional speckle tracking echocardiography (2D STE) enables early and sensitive detection of LA functional changes.
This retrospective cohort study included adult patients (aged 18–65 years) with ASDs who underwent percutaneous device closure between December 2022 and October 2023 at Dr. Sardjito Hospital, Yogyakarta, Indonesia. Echocardiographic evaluations, including LA strain analysis (LASr, LAScd, LASc), were performed pre-closure, within 6 months (1st semester), and between ≥ 6–12 months (2nd semester) post-device closure. Patients with significant valvular disease, persistent arrhythmias, or suboptimal acoustic windows were excluded. Statistical analysis was conducted using repeated measures ANOVA or Friedman tests with Bonferroni correction.
A total of 21 patients (mean age 40.86 ± 14.74 years; 76% female) were included. LA reservoir strain (LASr) significantly declined in the 1st semester post-device closure compared to baseline (p = 0.003) and showed partial recovery by the 2nd semester (p = 0.016 vs. baseline). LA conduit strain (LAScd) and contraction strain (LASc) also significantly decreased in the 1st semester (p = 0.030 and p = 0.025, respectively), while LASc did not significantly improve at the 2nd semester follow-up. No significant changes were observed in LA geometry. Interobserver agreement for all strain measurements was excellent (ICC ≥ 0.99).
LA functional impairment was observed in the 1st semester after percutaneous device closure, marked by a noticeable decline in all strains of the LA (LASr, LAScd, and LASc). Partial recovery of LASr was observed at one year, whereas LASc did not show significant improvement after the initial reduction. These findings highlight that the LA strain may be a sensitive marker for predicting the development of LA dysfunction post-device closure follow-up."

A literature review reveals that the observed diversity in research methods course design and instruction stems from a lack of consensus about the essential foundations required to critically engage with, design, and execute research in education. This is further compounded by a limited pedagogical innovation. However, no study has yet investigated how research methodology is taught and perceived across European universities. The objective of this study is to examine practices and attitudes regarding teaching research methodology in different European countries, across different disciplines and different training stages to identify commonalities and discrepancies.
A cross-sectional survey was designed based on the Structure of Observed Learning Outcome (SOLO) taxonomy and further developed in several rounds of expert input and feedback, ensuring comprehensive inclusion of diverse teaching formats and assessment types. The survey was distributed to research methodology and non-research methodology higher education teachers across Europe through stratified and snowball sampling methods.
The survey was completed by 559 respondents across 24 countries and seven disciplinary categories. The findings identified a predominant reliance on traditional passive teaching formats, such as face-to-face or online lectures. Active methods such as flipped classroom (8.4% Bachelor, 4.8% Master, 2.3% PhD) and protocol writing (8.2% Bachelor, 6.6% Master, 3.9% PhD) were less frequently used. Written exams dominated assessment strategies at all levels. Across our stratification levels, all topics were rated very important, with hypothesis formulation, research integrity, and study design as the most necessary topics, while pre-registration, peer review, and data management plan were prioritized slightly less.
These findings reveal relative homogeneity in research methodology teaching across academic levels and disciplines in Europe. The persistence of passive teaching formats and the limited adoption of active methodologies reflects an untapped opportunity to improve the effectiveness of research methodology education in fostering critical thinking and ethical practices. Higher education institutions need to reevaluate research methodology curricula to better align with contemporary research demands."

The gold standard for diagnosis, overnight polysomnography, is highly accurate but labor-intensive, leading to delays and increased healthcare burden. Artificial intelligence (AI) models offer a promising alternative. This study pools existing evidence to evaluate AI-based OSA diagnostics.
A systematic search of PubMed, Embase, Scopus, Web of Science, and IEEE Xplore identified studies comparing AI models against the apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) for OSA diagnosis. Studies evaluating models using random-split test sets or k-fold cross-validation were included in a Bayesian bivariate meta-analysis and meta-regression. Risk of bias and evidence quality were assessed using QUADAS-2 and GRADE.
From 6,254 records, 7 studies with 19 AI models trained and tested on 7,547 and 7,471 participants were included. No study had a high risk of bias. AI achieved a pooled sensitivity of 89.2% (95% CrI: 81.5-94.3%) and specificity of 87.1% (95% CrI: 82.6-90.8%). Neural networks (NNs) were the best-performing AI model compared to the other subtypes, achieving a sensitivity of 92.8% (95% CrI: 84.8-96.6%) and specificity of 87.8% (95% CrI: 81.1-92.6%). Age and sex had no effect. No publication bias was detected, and the evidence was of high quality.
Neural Networks AI models trained on polysomnography demonstrated excellent diagnostic accuracy in diagnosing OSA as compared to traditional machine learning. There is a need for further exploration and external validation of AI models to support their integration into routine sleep medicine practice, hence improving access to efficient and accurate OSA diagnosis.

This study primarily aimed to develop a deep learning model trained on images from diverse clinical settings to distinguish dermatophytosis from non-dermatophytosis. A secondary objective was to compare its diagnostic performance with that of physicians.
This retrospective diagnostic study analyzed clinical images of dermatophytosis (tinea corporis/cruris) and non-dermatophytosis (eczema, psoriasis, and lichen planus). Dermatophytosis was confirmed by the presence of hyphae, whereas non-dermatophytosis was diagnosed based on clinical and histological findings. The deep learning model utilized a multitask learning approach, integrating classification and segmentation. Adaptive weighting facilitated area-of-interest segmentation, improving attention to relevant features. Model performance was compared with physicians using a 20-image quiz from the test dataset.
A total of 1400 images (600 dermatophytosis, 840 non-dermatophytosis) from 580 Thai patients, predominantly with Fitzpatrick skin types III and IV, were analyzed. In the test dataset, the model achieved an AUC of 0.84 (95% CI: 0.80-0.88), a sensitivity of 0.80 (95% CI: 0.74-0.85), a specificity of 0.71 (95% CI: 0.65-0.76), an accuracy of 0.74 (95% CI: 0.70-0.78), and an F1-score of 0.71 (95% CI: 0.66-0.76).

However, existing domain adaptation methods generally assume discrete domains, while real working conditions such as speed and load vary continuously, and this mismatch limits the effectiveness of domain adaptation. Meanwhile, for fault feature extraction in wavelet time-frequency diagrams, few studies consider the unique frequency distribution characteristics of different faults to design networks. Therefore, we propose a dual innovation fault diagnosis framework. Firstly, we introduce the Wavelet-Scale-Wise Convolution Network (WSWCN) to explicitly extract frequency-dependent fault features through a scale-wise convolution structure tailored for the directional sensitivity of wavelet time-frequency diagrams. Secondly, we propose a continuously indexed domain adaptation method based on Multi-Kernel Mutual Information Estimation (MKME), which leverages a variational form of mutual information and kernel-based function approximation to enable direct use of continuous working condition information for domain adaptation without adversarial training. To validate our approach, a series of experiments are conducted on gearbox and bearing fault datasets collected under time-varying working conditions to demonstrate the superiority of the proposed WSWCN and MKME."

Current risk stratification approaches based on high-resolution vessel wall imaging (HR-VWI) remain dependent on subjective human assessment, which limits their precision.
From June 2020 to December 2024, HR-VWI images were retrospectively collected from 363 patients with sICAS across 2 medical institutions. Among the 363 patients, there were 79 cases of stroke recurrence (21.76%) and 284 cases without recurrence (78.24%). The cohort was divided into a Training/Validation set (n=290) and a Test set (n=73). Using the T1-weighted contrast-enhanced sequence, we developed a Multi-View Deep Survival Combined Model. This model employs a Vision Transformer and radiomics to analyze MR images and uses DeepSurv to extend the modeling capacity of the traditional Cox proportional hazards model. It enables the prediction of stroke recurrence risk related to intracranial culprit plaques. Model performance was evaluated using time-dependent receiver operating characteristic curves and the C-index. Additionally, decision curve analysis and calibration curves were used to comprehensively validate the model's practical value and clinical application prospects.
The Combined Model exhibited superior predictive performance, achieving a C-index of 0.872 (95% CI: 0.785-0.958) in the internal validation set and 0.803 (95% CI: 0.711-0.895) in the external test set. This performance significantly outperformed that of clinical models, radiomics models, and standalone deep learning models. The model also demonstrated excellent time-dependent predictive accuracy for 1, 2, and 3-year recurrence (area under the curve: 0.841, 0.870, and 0.802, respectively). Calibration and decision curve analysis confirmed the model's clinical utility.
By integrating automated multi-view deep feature learning and DeepSurv-based survival analysis, the Combined Model provides a robust and objective tool for stratifying recurrence risk in patients with sICAS. It outperforms conventional methods and holds significant potential for guiding personalized secondary prevention strategies."

In this review manuscript we describe advanced PET methods to differentiate tumor progression (TP) from treatment related necrosis (TN) in post treated GBM patients. Dynamic FDG PET (dPET), an advance from traditional static FDG PET, may prove advantageous in clinical staging. Quantifying dPET data is however challenging. In this review we showcase new work for an end-to-end novel AI platform for automated blood input computation to quantify dPET data. Next, we review new work on a large AI model for multimodal brain tumor segmentation from post-treated BraTS2024 MRI datasets and finally a multi-modal AI platform including dPET and MRI for classification of TP vs TN."

For instance, traditional risk scoring systems, such as the Model for End-Stage Liver Disease, are not sufficient to predict complications after interventions such as transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS) insertion. Similarly, imaging via Doppler ultrasound, computed tomography, and magnetic resonance imaging provide valuable insights but suffer from operator dependence, inconsistent sensitivity, and accessibility constraints. This narrative review summarizes the current state of the art with regard to leveraging artificial intelligence (AI) to diagnose and predict outcomes in patients with cirrhosis or portal hypertension as well as to optimize outcomes in patients undergoing TIPS placement for the treatment of these conditions.

Assessment techniques have progressed from biochemical markers to advanced imaging techniques, particularly nuclear medicine imaging, to improve accuracy. The focus of assessment has also shifted from global hepatic function to precise segmental evaluation. This paradigm shift has greatly influenced liver-directed therapies such as hepatic resection, augmentation, transplantation, and interventional radiology. The aim of this review was to synthesize key developments in liver function assessment, including nuclear medicine techniques, hepatocyte-specific magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and emerging multimodal and artificial intelligence (AI)-driven approaches. Select literature from the past three decades was examined, with an emphasis on innovations, validation studies, and clinical applications. Incorporating Tc-99 m mebrofenin hepatobiliary scintigraphy (HBS) into liver function assessment allowed quantitative, regional mapping of hepatocellular function. Gadoxetate-enhanced dynamic magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has created an opportunity for high-contrast resolution images and noninvasive assessment of hepatocyte uptake and excretion. Novel positron emission tomography tracers such as C-11 acetate enabled the combined evaluation of parenchymal function and tumor biology. Studies exploring multimodal fusion, artificial intelligence (AI)-assisted image processing, and incorporating deep learning into predictive models for individualized risk assessment are underway. Overall, integrating anatomical and functional data has become increasingly widespread, allowing for a more precise evaluation of liver function and improvement of therapeutic outcomes. However, reproducibility, standardization, and accessibility remain potential impediments to broad implementation. Future directions for research include prospective validation studies, multimodal fusion, utilizing deep learning in risk stratification, and the development of individualized treatment strategies tailored to patient-specific risk profiles."

We propose TopicForest, a new embedding-driven hierarchical clustering and labeling framework that involves: (1) embedding biomedical abstracts within a high-dimensional semantic space using contrastively trained LLMs, (2) manifold learning to reduce dimensionality for visual interpretation, (3) hierarchical clustering via binary partitioning and multi-level dendrogram cutting, and (4) recursive LLM-based topic summarization to efficiently generate concise and coherent labels from the smallest clusters up to broad subjects covering thousands of publications. We construct a corpus comprising 24,366 biomedical abstracts from Scientific Reports, leveraging its human-curated topic hierarchy as gold-standard for evaluation. We evaluate clustering performance using Adjusted Mutual Information (AMI) and Dasgupta's cost, while labeling quality is evaluated based on diversity and hierarchical affinity.
TopicForest's dendrogram cutting achieves AMI scores comparable to or better than flat embedding-based clustering methods such as BERTopic (with K-means or HDBSCAN) across multiple dimension-reduction strategies (t-SNE and UMAP), while uniquely providing multi-scale topic granularity. It also outperforms the deep hierarchical topic model HyperMiner, yielding higher AMI scores and comparable Dasgupta's costs. For labeling, the proposed LLM recursive labeling method surpasses both c-TF-IDF and HyperMiner, achieving higher label diversity and hierarchical affinity, while maintaining efficient token usage. Furthermore, TopicForest maintains stable clustering quality across different embedding models, demonstrating robustness and generalizability in hierarchical topic discovery.
Through novel integration of LLMs, dimension reduction, and advanced hierarchical clustering techniques, TopicForest provides effective and interpretable hierarchical topic modeling for biomedical literature, facilitating multi-scale exploration and visualization of literature corpora."
PubMed,deep learning,Improved accuracy for myocardial blood flow mapping with deep learning-enabled CMR arterial spin labeling (DeepMASL): validation by microsphere in vivo.,Ran Li; Caleb Berberet; Qi Huang; Pamela K Woodard; Jie Zheng,10.1016/j.jocmr.2025.101989,2025-11-14,Journal of cardiovascular magnetic resonance : official journal of the Society for Cardiovascular Magnetic Resonance,"Current myocardial arterial spin labeling (ASL) methods are sensitive to noise (background and physiology), which limits the accuracy of myocardial blood flow (MBF) measurement. In this study, we demonstrated a new deep learning-enabled myocardial ASL approach (DeepMASL) and evaluated its accuracy to quantify MBF in a canine model of coronary arterial disease in vivo. The reference method was invasive microsphere measurements.
Eighteen mongrel dogs were divided into two groups: healthy (n = 9) and coronary stenosis (n = 9). The latter was induced in an open-chest model with 3 types of stenosis: 50% (n= 3), 70% (n = 3), and 90% (n = 3). Each dog received pharmaceutically induced hyperemia, by the infusion of either dipyridamole or dobutamine to induce different levels of MBF. Microsphere measurements were performed at rest and during the hyperemia. A cardiac ASL sequence was employed to acquire ASL signals at the mid-section of the heart, at rest and during the hyperemia. A physics-based deep learning network (DeepMASL) was developed using synthetic ASL signals with different levels of background noise. Segmented MBF values produced by both non-DeepMASL and DeepMASL methods were measured in all dogs to compare with segmented microsphere MBF values.
While the non-DeepMASL method severely underestimated hyperemic MBF by 33-49%, DeepMASL approach dramatically improved the accuracy to obtain error less than 10%. There are strong correlations (r = 0.85 - 0.86) in segmented MBF values between measurements by DeepMASL and microsphere methods in either normal or ischemic dogs with varying degrees of coronary artery stenosis. The Bland-Altman analysis reveals mild to moderate variations of DeepMASL (95% confident interval: -1.3 to 1.5ml/min/g in normal dogs and -1.8 to 1.3ml/min/g in stenotic dogs) and almost zero bias.
The novel DeepMASL demonstrates much improved accuracy in the quantification of regional MBF at varying levels of coronary artery stenosis, which is correlated strongly with microsphere MBF values. The validated data indicates the potential for this DeepMASL technique to be translated for noncontrast diagnosis of myocardial perfusion deficit in a clinical setting."

Besides its physiological functions, hemoglobin has broad potential applications in medicine and biotechnology. However, the widespread use of hemoglobin is constrained by limited natural sources, challenges in heterologous synthesis, and functional restrictions that hinder efficient application. In this review, we discuss the key challenges and solutions associated with microbial synthesis of hemoglobin. We systematically elucidate the engineering strategies to improve the stability, autoxidation rate, heme-binding capacity, oxygen transport efficiency, and nitric oxide scavenging rate of hemoglobin, with particular emphasis on the use of artificial intelligence algorithms to customize the function modification of hemoglobin. Also, we provide a comprehensive overview of the various applications of hemoglobin, including artificial oxygen carriers, medical treatments requiring enhanced oxygen supply, synthesis of high-value products, biocatalysis, artificial foods, agriculture, functional substance testing, and bioactive peptide production, with a special focus on the potential of hemoglobin mutants and derivatives in expanding its use across various fields. Finally, we explore the prospects for accelerating the resolution of hemoglobin synthesis and overcoming the application challenges by integrating Pareto-optimal and iterative bioengineering frameworks, deep learning, synthetic biology, and other advanced technologies."

This study introduces an AI-driven convolutional neural network (CNN)-based framework for assessing street-scale flood risks by integrating hydrometeorological, topographic, and urban morphological data. The CNN model, trained on Shenzhen data and applied to Hong Kong, demonstrates its strong spatial transferability and the potential of deep learning in urban flood risk assessment. In the application, the model predicts flood inundation under four design rainfall scenarios. Results show that under the extreme 100-year recurrence interval, 60-min rainfall scenario, the flood-prone area in Hong Kong expanded to 64.1 km2 (5.79 % of the urban area), with average inundation depths reaching 15.6 cm and a maximum depth of 68.6 cm. A road-level flood risk assessment identified 501 high-risk road segments (18.9 % of the total network), concentrated in southern Kowloon Peninsula and northern Hong Kong Island. This framework emphasizes the need for tailored flood mitigation strategies for different urban areas and highlights the model's cross-regional transferability as an innovation for flood risk assessment in cities with similar conditions."

However, existing numerical solvers and machine learning architectures exhibit inherent limitations in computational efficiency, generalizability, and predicting accuracy. To address these limitations, we present a diffusion-model-based deep learning framework. The target problem involves pollutant diffusion driven by coupled concentration and temperature gradients, examined in both two-dimensional transient and three-dimensional steady-state scenarios. Our approach integrates a physics-informed, equation-constrained scheme with a conditional diffusion model, enabling accurate recovery of high-dimensional spatiotemporal fields from limited observations. To validate the proposed method, we construct benchmark datasets using high-fidelity finite element simulations and double-color siren imaging under varied source distributions and boundary conditions. Quantitative evaluations demonstrate that our framework consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines-including ResNet, Transformer, and Fourier Neural Operator-in terms of super-resolution accuracy and robustness. These results suggest that the proposed approach offers a promising pathway toward real-time monitoring and analysis of pollutant transport in both environmental and industrial contexts."
PubMed,deep learning,A cross-cultivar hyperspectral framework for huanglongbing detection in citrus via wavelength optimization and deep learning.,Cheng Luo; Lu Yin; Yunfeng Li; Yuyan Liao; Zilong Wang; Xiaofeng Wang; Zhanxu Pu; Lianming Lu; Pei Liang,10.1016/j.saa.2025.127189,2025-11-13,"Spectrochimica acta. Part A, Molecular and biomolecular spectroscopy","Huanglongbing (HLB) is a devastating disease that poses a serious threat to the global citrus industry. Due to its rapid spread and significant destructiveness, coupled with the lack of effective treatment methods, early and accurate detection is crucial for controlling disease spread and mitigating economic losses. Different citrus varieties exhibit significant differences in peel morphology and structure, leading to distinct hyperspectral reflection characteristics. This limits the applicability of traditional hyperspectral HLB detection methods across different varieties. Even when leaves with similar disease severity are detected, differences in reflection at sensitive wavelengths still exist, further limiting the adaptability of traditional hyperspectral detection methods across different varieties. To address this challenge, we propose a robust method for multi-variety HLB detection based on hyperspectral imaging. After data acquisition and preprocessing, the Successive Projections Algorithm (SPA) was used to extract characteristic wavelengths, and the Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) algorithm was employed to identify wavelengths that remain consistent across different varieties. The statistical significance of these optimized wavelengths was verified using t-tests. The results showed that under specific conditions, there are significant differences in spectral responses among different varieties. This confirms that the selected wavelengths have cross-variety discrimination capability. Subsequently, the feature sets processed using SPA and PSO algorithms were used to train three classification models: Support Vector Machine (SVM), Multi-layer Perceptron (MLP), and a customized Convolutional Multi-scale Residual Network (CMR-CNN). The models were tested using the leave-one-out method. The PSO-optimized feature sets significantly improved model performance. In the setup where each variety was used as the test set in turn and the model was run ten times, model performance was expressed as the mean ± standard deviation (SD) of all variety test results. SVM accuracy increased from 89.38 % ± 0.81 % to 91.65 % ± 0.7 %; MLP accuracy increased from 89.58 % ± 1.19 % to 91.80 % ± 0.35 %; CMR-CNN accuracy increased from 90.83 % ± 0.43 % to 92.85 % ± 0.7 %. Due to its structural complexity and excellent feature extraction capability, the CMR-CNN model demonstrated the most outstanding diagnostic performance and showed great potential in plant disease diagnosis using hyperspectral imaging. This method establishes a universal HLB detection framework that does not require separate modeling for different citrus varieties."
PubMed,deep learning,The applicability of artificial intelligence in managing emergency patients: An umbrella review.,Wesam Taher Almagharbeh; Maryam Alharrasi; Moustaq Karim Khan Rony; Sarmin Kabir; Daifallah M Alrazeeni; Fazila Akter,10.1016/j.ienj.2025.101710,2025-11-15,International emergency nursing,"Artificial intelligence (AI) is increasingly reshaping emergency medicine and nursing by enabling faster, more accurate, and scalable decision-making. In high-pressure settings such as emergency departments (EDs), AI technologies have shown promise in improving triage, diagnostics, clinical decision-making, and operational efficiency. Despite this potential, the current body of evidence remains fragmented, with a lack of comprehensive synthesis across diverse AI applications.
This umbrella review aimed to synthesize existing review-level evidence on the applicability of artificial intelligence in managing emergency patients.
A systematic umbrella review was conducted following PRISMA guidelines. Systematic reviews, scoping reviews, and narrative syntheses focusing on AI in emergency settings were identified through comprehensive searches in five major databases. The search covered studies published between January 2013 and March 2025. Data were extracted on AI types, clinical focus areas, implementation strategies, outcomes, and barriers. The Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) checklist was used for quality assessment, and findings were synthesized thematically.
A total of 24 eligible reviews were included. The analysis revealed AI's significant impact across four major domains: triage and risk stratification, diagnostic support, clinical decision-making, and workflow optimization. Tools such as machine learning and deep learning improved diagnostic accuracy, decision consistency, and patient flow. However, barriers such as interoperability issues, lack of explainability, data privacy concerns, and legal ambiguity were consistently reported.
AI holds transformative potential in emergency patient management. While clinical benefits are clear, widespread adoption depends on addressing technical, ethical, and regulatory challenges. Future efforts should focus on explainable, validated, and user-integrated AI systems to ensure responsible and equitable implementation in emergency care."

Part A, Molecular and biomolecular spectroscopy","Articular cartilage (AC) plays a vital role in maintaining joint function, but it is highly vulnerable to degeneration due to the lack of mechanical loading under microgravity and hard to be detected in situ. Near-infrared (NIR) spectroscopy, known for its deep tissue penetration and rapid detection, has outstanding potential in cartilage assessment, but unexplored in evaluating cartilage degeneration under microgravity. In this study, a lab-made NIR probe was developed to acquire in situ NIR spectra of the control cartilage and the tail suspension (TS) cartilage for simulating microgravity 7, 14, and 21 days. The NIR spectral analysis indicated that regular main components (collagen and proteoglycans) fluctuation and degeneration of AC with the extending TS duration and the regional differences between different condyles. Then the NIR spectra were combined with support vector machine (SVM) and Residual Network (ResNet-18) models based on continuous wavelet transform for identifying the degeneration difference and multi-classifying. Binary classification between control and TS-21d samples achieved over 90 % accuracy with SVM or ResNet-18. In ternary classification task among the TS groups, ResNet-18 reached accuracies of 81.40 % (medial) and 81.82 % (lateral), which started to be better than SVM and demonstrated its superior robustness and generalization. In quaternary classification, only the ResNet-18 model was used achieving the accuracies of 87.76 % (medial) and 82.98 % (lateral) approaching the binary identification results. The experimental results demonstrate the potential of NIR spectroscopy with deep learning for in-situ cartilage degeneration study under different microgravity durations, offering a promising strategy for early diagnosis and fundamental research on joint tissue adaptation under aerospace microgravity."

Part A, Molecular and biomolecular spectroscopy","Celecoxib (CXB) is a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug used to prevent and treat arthritis. However, overdosing or improper use can cause adverse reactions. SERS is an important tool for therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM).The present study proposes an innovative detection scheme based on SERS deep learning, aiming to achieve qualitative identification and quantitative detection of CXB at the Raman spectrum level. In this paper, a composite SERS substrate consisting of silver (Ag)@ platinum (Pt)@ porous silicon Bragg mirror (PSB) was synthesized. Crystal violet (CV) was used as probe to characterize the substrate properties, and the substrate showed excellent SERS properties and long-term stability. The substrate significantly enhanced the SERS response capacity to CXB, showing excellent reproducibility and high sensitivity. The LOD and the recovery rate were both within the reasonable range when the substrate was used to detect CXB concentration in serum. Three deep learning models, GoogleNet, ResNet and VGG, were used to classify five kinds of blood drug concentrations. Among them, the GoogleNet model based on spectral dataset achieved the highest classification accuracy of 84.17 %.

Accurate segmentation of these tumors in whole-body magnetic resonance imaging (WB-MRI) is critical for quantifying tumor burden and clinical decision-making. This study aims to develop a pipeline for NF segmentation in fat-suppressed T2-weighted WB-MRI that incorporates anatomical context and radiomics to improve accuracy and specificity.
The proposed pipeline consists of three stages: (1) anatomy segmentation using MRSegmentator and refinement with a high-risk NF zone; (2) NF segmentation using an ensemble of 3D anisotropic anatomy-informed U-Nets; and (3) tumor candidate classification using radiomic features to filter false positives. The study used 109 WB-MRI scans from 74 NF1 patients, divided into training and three test sets representing in-domain (3T), domain-shifted (1.5T), and low tumor burden scenarios. Evaluation metrics included per-scan and per-tumor Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC), Volume Overlap Error (VOE), Absolute Relative Volume Difference (ARVD), and per-scan F1 score. Statistical significance was assessed using Wilcoxon signed-rank tests with Bonferroni correction.
On the in-domain test set, the proposed ensemble of 3D anisotropic anatomy-informed U-Nets with tumor candidate classification achieved a per-scan DSC of 0.64, outperforming 2D nnU-Net (DSC: 0.52) and 3D full-resolution nnU-Net (DSC: 0.54). Performance was maintained on the domain-shift test set (DSC: 0.51) but declined on low tumor burden cases (DSC: 0.23). Preliminary inter-reader variability analysis showed model-to-expert agreement (DSC: 0.67-0.69) comparable to inter-expert agreement (DSC: 0.69).
The proposed pipeline achieves the highest performance among established methods for automated NF segmentation in WB-MRI and approaches expert-level consistency. The integration of anatomical context and radiomics enhances robustness. Nonetheless, segmentation performance decreases in low tumor burden scenarios, indicating a key area for future methodological improvements. Additionally, the limited inter-reader agreement observed among experts underscores the inherent complexity and ambiguity of the NF segmentation task."

Current diagnostic methods rely on subjective observations and questionnaires, often resulting in underestimation of the condition and insufficient treatment. This study investigates voice-based markers for detecting depressive symptoms through a novel system of virtual humans (VHs) capable of engaging in open-ended talks, unlike previous research which relied primarily on structured clinical interview formats. A total of 101 participants (42 with depressive symptoms) engaged in six casual social interactions with VHs simulating basic emotions, forming the DEPTALK dataset. Speech recordings and their automatic transcriptions were processed using state-of-the-art pre-trained transformer-based models to generate embeddings. We first employed a conversation-level aggregation strategy, combining embeddings across each dialogue and classifying them with Extreme Gradient Boosting. A single model trained on all six conversations per participant outperformed emotion-specific models, achieving F1 scores of 0.566 for speech, 0.329 for text, and 0.648 for the multimodal fusion, indicating that aggregating emotionally diverse interactions exposes stronger depression cues. To capture temporal dynamics, we further implemented a turn-level aggregation strategy using Gated Recurrent Units and training on all conversations. This approach improved performance for text (F1 = 0.505) and maintained competitive results for speech (F1 = 0.541), although the multimodal GRU model (F1 = 0.556) did not surpass the best conversation-level model. Overall, findings suggest that in casual conversations, depressive symptoms are primarily conveyed through prosody, with the addition of semantic context further enhancing detection. This study advances the understanding of speech-based depression patterns in simulated social interactions and highlights the potential of using VHs for more objective depressive symptoms detection."

The coexistence of both conditions is not uncommon, and since they share overlapping symptoms, echocardiographic findings, and biomarkers of myocardial damage, the diagnosis of infiltrative cardiomyopathy often remains masked. This underdiagnosis of cardiac amyloidosis in patients with symptomatic aortic stenosis can result in untimely and insufficient treatment. The objectives of this monograph are to analyze the predictors of cardiac amyloidosis caused by senile or wild type transthyretin in patients with symptomatic aortic stenosis, determine whether they constitute a higher-risk population, and explore the available therapeutic alternatives."

Despite the identification of multiple predictors of both endpoints, prognostic algorithms in patients undergoing TAVR are not well defined. Aim: To explore factors determining the lack of significant improvement in exercise capacity after TAVR, and investigate whether the predictive profile for poor functional response to TAVR (PFR) could also predict mortality. Methods and results: We enrolled 220 patients (78.0±6.4 yrs) with severe aortic stenosis who underwent TAVR. Pre- and post-procedural (3 months) data were collected, including clinical information, echocardiography with myocardial work assessment, and 6-minute walk test (6MWT). PFR was defined as an increase in 6MWT distance &lt;40m. Only age and atrial fibrillation were independent predictors of both mortality and PFR. Mortality was associated with lower global work index (HR 0.99; p&lt;0.001) and shorter 6MWT distance (HR 0.99; p=0.008). PFR was associated with higher global wasted work (OR 1.003; p=0.026) and less impaired 6MWT relative to predicted values (OR 0.19; p&lt;0.001 for 6MWT &lt;80% predicted). Unsupervised machine learning-based analysis (Partition Around Medoids algorithm) identified clusters associated with mortality but not with PFR. Conclusions: The predictive profiles for PFR and mortality after TAVR show only limited overlap, indicating that these two outcomes warrant distinct prognostic evaluations. The 6MWT may be useful in predicting the likelihood of both outcomes, with lower absolute values being associated with mortality, while higher percentage predicted values with limited symptomatic benefit. Myocardial work analysis may further enhance prognostic assessment in this population."

Methods “edgeR” was used to calculate differentially expressed genes (DEGs) for bulk-RNAseq. GO, KEGG, and GSEA analyses were performed on the DEGs. Aortic valves from 8 AS patients and 8 non-AS patients were collected for proteomic sequencing. After DEG analysis, five algorithms were used to identify hub genes. ROC curves were constructed for the hub genes. Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNAseq) was applied to systematically elaborate the mechanism in AS pathogenesis. Results Transcriptome data showed that AS was accompanied by high expression of genes such as MMP9, CXCL8, and SPP1, with significant activation of hypoxia, inflammatory response, and fibrosis. Proteomic sequencing of calcified AS revealed significantly enhanced hypoxic response, TNF-α signaling, and extracellular matrix (ECM) formation. Sixteen hub genes, including ITGB3, ITGAV, and MMP9, were identified by five algorithms, all with high diagnostic efficacy (AUC &amp;gt; 0.75). PCR experiments confirmed that MMP9 and PLAU were highly expressed in calcified aortic valves ( P &amp;lt; 0.05). scRNAseq revealed that in highly calcified regions, MMP9 and PLAU were mainly distributed in endothelial cells, monocytes, and macrophages, participating in the differentiation of monocytes and macrophages and relating to lipid metabolism and proinflammatory responses. Conclusion The 16 hub genes can assist in the diagnosis of aortic stenosis, and MMP9 and PLAU may participate in AS development by regulating the proinflammatory effects of monocytes and macrophages."

Cardiopulmonary exercise testing (CPET) and myocardial mechanics analysis may identify subclinical dysfunction and impaired functional capacity. To evaluate the relationship between functional capacity (by % predicted peak VO2), ventilatory efficiency (VE/VCO2 slope), and myocardial mechanics (speckle tracking echocardiography—STE), and myocardial work (MW) indices) in moderate AS with preserved EF. Methods: We prospectively enrolled 107 patients with moderate AS (AVA 1.0–1.5 cm2; mean gradient 20–40 mmHg; EF ≥ 50%). Functional capacity was classified as preserved (≥83% predicted VO2) or reduced (&lt;83%). Ventilatory efficiency was defined as good (&lt;30) or poor (≥30) VE/VCO2 slope. STE assessed left ventricular (LV), left atrial (LA), and right ventricular (RV) strain, as well as myocardial work indices. Results: Patients with reduced % predicted VO2 had higher LV end-systolic volume (p = 0.035), lower stroke volume index (p = 0.020), and smaller indexed aortic valve area (p = 0.025), with trends toward lower GLS and myocardial work. In contrast, patients with poor ventilatory efficiency (VE/VCO2 ≥ 30) showed significant impairments in global longitudinal strain (GLS, p = 0.002), LA reservoir strain (PALS, p = 0.019) and LA conduit strain (LA Scd, p &lt; 0.001), RV free wall strain (RW FWS, p = 0.029), and myocardial work indices (lower GWI and GCW, higher GWW, reduced GWE; all p &lt; 0.05). LA Scd emerged as the strongest predictor of poor ventilatory efficiency. (receiver operating characteristic (ROC) area under the curve (AUC) 0.723, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.623–0.823, p &lt; 0.001). Conclusions: In moderate AS with preserved EF, impaired ventilatory efficiency is more strongly associated with subclinical LV, LA, and RV dysfunction than reduced % predicted VO2, highlighting the key role of RV impairment. Integrating CPET and STE improves phenotyping, identifying high-risk patients who may benefit from closer surveillance or early intervention. These findings are exploratory and hypothesis-generating; longitudinal data are needed to confirm prognostic implications."
OpenAlex,aortic stenosis,Estimating flow division in aortic branches of diseased aorta: a method for boundary condition specification in CFD analysis,Mengqiang Hu; Mengqiang Hu; Mengqiang Hu; Ming Yang; Ming Yang; Zhihao Ding; Zhihao Ding; Shu Chen; Xiaoyu Qi; Chuanzhi Zhu; Chuanzhi Zhu; Yining Zhang; Chao Yang; Luo Yuanming,10.3389/fbioe.2025.1640687,2025-11-13,Frontiers in Bioengineering and Biotechnology,"Hemodynamic predictions using computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations can provide valuable guidance assessing aortic disease risks. However, their reliability is hindered by the lack of patient-specific boundary conditions, particularly measured flow rates. This study addresses this knowledge gap by introducing a method for estimating flow division in aortic branches. The geometry of the lesional aorta was first repaired to obtain a near-healthy reference geometry. An iterative CFD simulation was then employed to estimate the flow division in the branches of the diseased aorta. Specifically, empirical boundary conditions from healthy individuals were used to predict the outlet pressures of reference geometry, which were subsequently converted into resistance models. These resistance models were then assigned to the outlets of the diseased aorta to predict the inlet pressure. The discrepancy between the predicted and target inlet pressures was iteratively minimized by adjusting the inlet pressure of the reference model until convergence was achieved. The final flow division in the branches of the diseased aorta was then obtained. The performance of the proposed method was investigated in three patients with aortic dissection or aneurysm. The proposed method predicted lower flow rates in branches with severe stenosis, which was more consistent with physiological expectations. Furthermore, the predicted blood pressure differed significantly from that obtained using the traditional method and was closer to the target values. The proposed method provides a practical solution for specifying boundary conditions in hemodynamic studies when clinically measured flow rates are unavailable."

With recent clinical trials indicating that transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) is at least on par with surgical aortic valve replacement (SAVR) in treating lower risk patients, there has been a rise in TAVR uptake in younger, lower risk patients, leading to an increased likelihood of bioprosthetic valve degradation within a patient's lifetime. This shift in treatment has changed the landscape of interventional cardiology, incentivising the Heart Team to now plan for the initial procedure with subsequent interventions in mind. While traditional multi-slice computed tomography image-based risk assessments are sufficient for initial valve placement, they fall short in their ability to accurately predict post-procedural outcomes and future interventions. Therefore, the need to balance competing risks to optimise patient outcomes over multiple interventions requires innovation. CT-derived computational techniques are being developed to incorporate biomechanics and fluid dynamics into the risk assessment process to allow more comprehensive analysis of the risks associated with different procedures. The goal of this review is to provide an overview of computational techniques that are being developed for the purposes of optimising outcomes in both the index and valve-in-valve interventions and to give cardiologists an understanding of how they may use computational modelling as an additional tool in the lifetime management of aortic stenosis."

Large language models (LLMs) could automate this process, yet LLMs are limited by their propensity for calculation errors and factual hallucinations. Pipelines that separate LLM-based data extraction from deterministic score computation may improve reliability and transparency. Methods We conducted a retrospective diagnostic study at a quaternary heart center in Germany (January 2020 – July 2023). Patients with atrial fibrillation (n=179) from an ablation registry and patients with severe aortic stenosis (n=76) evaluated by a heart team were included. Five LLMs (DeepSeek-R1, Qwen3, GPT-4 Turbo, Llama 3.1, and PaLM 2) were tested in standalone and pipeline configurations to compute HAS-BLED, CHA₂DS₂-VASc, and EuroSCORE II scores from routine clinical reports. Accuracy was assessed by comparing predictions to expert-adjudicated ground truth, using root mean squared error (RMSE), Krippendorff’s alpha for categorical agreement, and calibration analysis. Results Pipeline-generated scores showed substantially higher agreement with expert adjudication than standalone LLMs and treating clinicians (mean Krippendorff’s alpha: 0.79 vs 0.32 vs 0.31) and demonstrated superior calibration. The Qwen3-based pipeline, achieved the highest accuracy with lower RMSEs than clinicians for HAS-BLED (0.20 vs 0.87), CHA₂DS₂-VASc (0.53 vs 1.08), and EuroSCORE II (1.99 vs 2.05). Conclusion LLM-based pipelines enable accurate, well-calibrated, and scalable cardiovascular risk score computation from unstructured real-world clinical data, outperforming clinicians and standalone LLMs with the potential to reduce clinician workload and support evidence-based care."

However, there is currently no consensus in clinical guidelines regarding the optimal treatment approach for LVAD-associated AR. Case summary We report a case of a female patient who developed AR following LVAD implantation. This patient exhibited an open-like configuration of left ventricular outflow tract (LVOT), with no calcified stenosis in the supravalvular region and a lack of anchoring anatomical structures at the junction of the LVOT and sinus-tubular junction. This anatomical configuration posed a high risk of prosthetic valve displacement during conventional transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR). Therefore, we employed a novel TAVR system (Taurus Trio) equipped with a locator, which effectively prevented downward migration of the prosthetic valve after implantation. Discussion This case indicates the potential advantages and efficacy of the Taurus Trio valve in TAVR for AR Post-LVAD. We plan to conduct long-term follow-up to further explore and optimize the treatment protocol."

Chernyavskiy; Viacheslav V. Danilov,10.3389/fcvm.2025.1602780,2025-11-13,Frontiers in Cardiovascular Medicine,"Transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) is a highly effective treatment for patients with severe aortic stenosis. Accurate valve positioning is critical for successful TAVI, and highly accurate real-time visualization—with minimal use of contrast—is especially important for patients with chronic kidney disease. Under fluoroscopic conditions, which often suffer from low contrast, high noise and artifacts, automatic segmentation of anatomical structures using convolutional neural networks (CNNs) can significantly improve the accuracy of valve positioning. This paper presents a comparative analysis of various CNN architectures for automatic aortic root segmentation on angiographic images, with the aim of optimizing the TAVI process. The experimental evaluation included models such as FPN, U-Net++, DeepLabV3+, LinkNet, MA-Net, and PSPNet, all trained and tested with optimally tuned hyperparameters. During training dynamics, DeepLabV3+ and U-Net++ showed stable convergence with median Dice scores around 0.88. However, when evaluated at the patient level, MA-Net and PSPNet outperformed all other models, achieving Dice coefficients of 0.942 and 0.936, and an average symmetric surface distance of 4.1 mm. The findings underscore the potential of incorporating automatic segmentation methods into decision-support systems for cardiac surgery—reducing contrast agent use, minimizing surgical risks, and improving valve positioning accuracy. Future work will focus on expanding the dataset, exploring additional architectures, and adapting the models for real-time application."

However, a detailed methodological description that includes the surgical approach and imaging planes is lacking. The aim of this study was to standardize SE performed via a subxiphoid surgical approach and to provide reference values for future research. Methods SE was performed in 19 female German Landrace pigs under general anesthesia using a defined imaging protocol. After the induction of general anesthesia, a small subxiphoid incision was made to optimize the image quality for SE. The echocardiographic imaging protocol was adapted from human 2D-transthoracic echocardiography and included apical 2-, 3-, and 5-chamber views and Doppler measurements of blood flow and tissue velocities. Furthermore, speckle tracking was used to assess left ventricular (LV) and right ventricular (RV) myocardial deformation. Results During SE, the animals were under stable anesthesia with a heart rate of 65 ± 12 beats per minute, and a mean arterial pressure of 88 ± 12 mmHg. Blood gas values were within physiological ranges. High-quality images of both ventricles were consistently achieved using the established imaging protocol. One animal showed a severe aortic stenosis and was excluded from the analysis. The biplane LV stroke volume was 45 ± 13 ml and the LV ejection fraction was 67% ± 11%. LV-global longitudinal strain (GLS) was −22.4% ± 3.3%, and RV free wall longitudinal strain was −23.7% ± 5%. The V max of the aortic valve was 1.6 ± 0.3 m/s. Conclusion SE offers a standardized and reproducible imaging technique for the assessment of high-quality apical views in swine models. This study provides procedural guidance and reference values for translational research applications."

Although these findings can significantly support clinical decision-making, the large number of available studies renders an overview of this topic challenging. In this review, we provide a comprehensive overview of the currently identified factors associated with increased mortality after TEER. We also summarize the current evidence on published risk scores that stratify mortality risk after M-TEER and T-TEER. We aimed to provide clinical decision-making support for optimal patient selection and referral to TEER and to identify remaining gaps in evidence."
OpenAlex,valvular heart disease,Characterization of Left Ventricular Hemodynamic Forces in Mitral Regurgitation Using 4-Dimensional-Flow Magnetic Resonance Imaging,Monisha Ghosh Srabanti; Ali Fatehi Hassanabad; Lyes Kadem; Julio Garcia,10.1177/30494826251395620,2025-11-13,Journal of the Heart Valve Society,"Background: Mitral regurgitation (MR) is one of the most common valvular heart diseases. Despite the recognized importance of hemodynamic force (HDF) in cardiology, its exploration in MR has been limited. Therefore, using a retrospective observational study design, we aimed to investigate the potential of noninvasively assessed systolic and diastolic HDF derived from 4-dimensional-flow magnetic resonance imaging (4D-flow MRI) as markers for determining MR. Method: The study cohort included 15 controls (19-61 years) and 26 MR patients (20 with primary and 6 cases with secondary MR, 33-75 years) classified into trivial-to-severe MR through cardiac MRI. The 3 T/4D-flow MRI sequence was used to assess left ventricular (LV) HDF (integral of intraventricular pressure gradients over the LV cavity) in 3 directions (lateral-septal, inferior-anterior, and apical-basal) using “Segment,” v2.2 R6410. Results: A negative coefficient for peak-systolic apical-basal HDF corresponded to decreased ejection fraction (β = −8.1, SE = 3.3, t = −2.5, P = .03), and a positive association was found between LV mass index and peak-systolic apical-basal HDF (β = 25.6, SE = 11.1, t = 2.3, P = .04). Peak-systolic apical-basal and E-wave apical-basal (diastolic HDF at E-wave time point) HDF emerged as significant predictors in detecting severe MR (Estimate = 2.2, P = .007; Estimate = 1.8, P = .015, respectively). The peak-systolic apical-basal HDF was also notably correlated with age in moderate-severe MR ( r = 0.88, P = .022). Conclusion: Mitral regurgitation affects early diastolic filling and peak systolic ejection, indicated by peak-systolic and E-wave HDF in the apical-basal direction, offering insights into dynamic flow patterns and LV remodeling. Hemodynamic force analysis could enhance risk stratification and guide therapeutic decisions, complementing traditional diagnostic methods for improved MR management."

In this population, frailty, comorbidity, and functional variability significantly influence prognosis. This study evaluated short-term (30-day) and long-term (1-year) mortality predictors in elderly patients with AHF treated in the emergency department (HED), considering clinical variables, comorbidities, and precipitating factors (PFs). Materials and Methods: An observational cohort study was conducted based on a secondary analysis of older patients with AHF included in the Epidemiology of Acute Heart Failure in Emergency Departments (EAHFE) registry, treated at Hospital Universitario Marqués de Valdecilla (HUMV) between 2007 and 2022. Clinical, laboratory, and PF-related variables were collected. The primary outcome was all-cause mortality at 30 days and 1 year. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were performed. Results: A total of 548 patients were included (mean age: 80.7 years), of whom 78.6% required hospitalization, mainly in the Internal Medicine department. Mortality was 11.1% at 30 days and 29.9% at 1 year. Age, valvular heart disease, dementia, and elevated creatinine levels were independently associated with higher mortality. Hypoxemia and low-output symptoms were linked to short-term mortality, while NYHA class III and anemia were associated with long-term mortality. Among PFs, acute coronary syndrome (ACS) was related to worse short-term outcomes, whereas rapid atrial fibrillation (AF) was inversely associated with long-term mortality. Conclusions: The prognostic relevance of risk factors differs between short- and long-term outcomes in older patients with AHF. Incorporating clinical characteristics and PFs into risk stratification models may support individualized management and guide follow-up strategies tailored to the geriatric profile. This multidimensional approach is essential to improve clinical decision-making and outcomes in a highly vulnerable population."

Using a prospective multicentre cohort of patients treated for IE, we compared the performance of the 2023 ESC classification to that of 2015 ESC, 2019 European Heart Rhythm Association (EHRA) and 2023 Duke-International Society for Cardiovascular Infectious Diseases (ISCVID) classifications in patients with or without cardiac implantable electronic devices (CIEDs). Methods A total of 1180 patients treated for IE between January 2017 and October 2022 were categorised as having either definite or possible/rejected IE within each classification. The gold standard diagnosis of IE was independently adjudicated by experts as ‘certain’ or not. Definite and ‘certain’ cases of IE were cross-tabulated to calculate sensitivity, specificity and accuracy. Suspicion of lead IE was defined by specific anatomical or metabolic features of cardiac lead infection on imaging; or by pulmonary embolism without valvular vegetation; or by positive culture of a lead extracted during open-heart surgery. Results In the 269 patients with CIEDs, 208 (77.3%) were adjudicated as ‘certain IE’; 2023 Duke-ISCVID and 2023 ESC classifications achieved higher sensitivity (97.1% and 93.8%, respectively) but markedly lower specificity (31.1% and 41.0%, respectively) than 2015 ESC and 2019 EHRA classifications. In the 159 patients with CIEDs and lead IE (78.6% ‘certain IE’), while sensitivity remained high for all classifications, specificity dropped for 2023 Duke-ISCVID and 2023 ESC classifications (11.8% and 32.4%, respectively), but not for 2019 EHRA classification (67.6%). In the 911 patients without CIEDs (81.0% ‘certain IE’), sensitivity was higher than 96% for all classifications and specificity was 55.5%, 52.6% and 48.0% for 2015 ESC, 2023 Duke-ISCVID and 2023 ESC classifications, respectively. Conclusions The 2023 ESC and 2023 Duke-ISCVID classifications had a higher sensitivity but a lower specificity than the 2015 ESC classification in patients with CIEDs, especially among those with lead IE. In patients with CIEDs, the 2019 EHRA classification was the most accurate."

In people younger than 35 yo, when the cause of SD is"" cardiac"" (sudden cardiac death-SCD), it is mainly due to cardiomyopathies and channelopathies. Among the predictors of SCD, obesity (a well-established independent risk factor for cardiovascular diseases) has been found to increase arrhythmic risk (i.e., every 5-unit increment in BMI confers a 16 % higher risk of SCD). We herein describe an autoptic case of an obese 32-year-old woman (BMI of 49.9), who was discovered deceased in her bed at home. Interestingly, at the heart examination, the presence of an abnormality in the tendon apparatus of the anterior mitral valve leaflet was observed. In fact, an accessory tendon chord connecting the apex of the leaflet to the distal third of the antero-lateral papillary muscle was found in addition to an unusual retiform appearance (""web-like"") of the whole mitral valve tendon apparatus. At histological examination of the ventricular myocardium, foci of confluent interstitial and perivascular myocardiosclerosis, along with perivascular fibrosis of coronary intramyocardial were observed. According to the literature, the valvular findings observed could plausibly account for the cause of death. In particular, a fatal arrhythmia due to the above-described tendons apparatus abnormality may developed. Nevertheless, obesity, which is a well-established risk factor for adverse cardiovascular events, may have contributed independently of the accessory chordal tendon. This case underscores the intricate interplay between the existence of left ventricular false tendons (LVFTs) and an elevated risk of ventricular tachycardia. From a speculative point of view, an LVFT may induce mechanical stretch in the interventricular septum, leading to heightened automaticity and triggering premature ventricular beats or arrhythmias. Comprehensive awareness of these structural anomalies and their morphological attributes is crucial for establishing correlations with potentially fatal arrhythmias and for formulating targeted preventive interventions."

Objectives We evaluated clinical outcomes with GLP-1 RA use post-TAVI in patients with T2D. Methods We conducted a retrospective cohort study using the TriNetX network, including 25,184 adults (≥18 years) with T2D who underwent TAVI (2015-2023). Patients were stratified based on GLP1-RA initiation within 14 days post-TAVI. Baseline characteristics, comorbidities, medications, and laboratory data were balanced using 1:1 propensity score matching (PSM). Cox models estimated hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for events from one-month post-TAVI until most recent follow-up. Results PSM yielded 1,101 patients per group, with a mean age of 73 years and 39% female. Mean follow-up duration was 2.2±1.1 and 2.6±1.8 years for GLP1-RA users and non-users, respectively. GLP1-RA use was also associated higher survival probability (HR 0.708 [95% CI, 0.583-0.859]), and lower rates of all-cause hospitalization (HR 0.790 [95% CI, 0.706-0.885]), major cardiovascular events (HR 0.849 [95% CI, 0.749-0.963]), and acute heart failure exacerbation (HR 0.785 [95% CI, 0.677-0.909]), acute kidney injury (HR 0.843 [95% CI, 0.719-0.988]), and major kidney events (HR 0.665 [95% CI, 0.510-0.866]). No differences were observed in acute myocardial infarction, cerebral infarction, or cardiac arrest. Conclusions In patients with T2D undergoing TAVI, GLP1-RA use are associated with significant survival benefits and improved cardiorenal outcomes. However, these findings are limited by the observational design, high comorbidity burden, lack of data on medication compliance and specific cause of death.

Pulmonary hypertension is an important and grave hemodynamic consequence of mitral stenosis. Persistent pulmonary hypertension leads to increase right heart pressure, Right Ventricular Hypertrophy (RVH) and subsequently right heart failure. There are various electrocardiographic parameters and criteria of Right Ventricular Hypertrophy (RVH) for diagnosis of pulmonary hypertension in various disease. Different ECG parameters and criteria of Right Ventricular Hypertrophy (RVH) have different predictive value for diagnosis of pulmonary hypertension in MS patient. Echocardiography is an important non-invasive investigation for diagnosis, monitoring and selection of treatment and for prediction of mortality in MS patient. Obtaining good quality of 2D echocardiography is problematic in remote areas and they are not feasible for wide spread use due to cost and availability. So, ECG may be a guide for selecting appropriate patient for further testing. Objectives: This study was planned to identify more accurate parameters of ECG for prediction of pulmonary hypertension and Right Ventricular Hypertrophy (RVH) in patients with mitral stenosis. Methodology: This cross-sectional observational study was conducted in the Department of Cardiology, DMCH, from March 2018 to February 2019. A total of 100 patients with mitral stenosis (MS) who met the inclusion and exclusion criteria were enrolled. Detailed clinical history, physical examination, and baseline investigations were recorded for all participants. The study population was divided into two groups: Group I:MS patients without pulmonary hypertension (PASP &lt; 35 mmHg). Group II: MS patients with pulmonary hypertension (PASP ≥ 35 mmHg). A 12-lead ECG and Doppler echocardiogram were performed within 24 hours of the patient’s first contact. Fourteen different ECG parameters and criteria for right ventricular hypertrophy (RVH) were assessed. Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS version 22.0 for Windows. Results: 14 patients were found in group I and 86 patients were found in group II. Among the Group-II patents 18 patients had mild pulmonary hypertension (PASP = 35 ≤ 50 mmHg), 47 patients had moderate pulmonary hypertension (PASP = 50 ≤ 70 mmHg) and 21 patients had severe pulmonary hypertension (PASP ≥ 70 mmHg). Average age of patient in group-I: was 38.71 ± 9.6 years and average age of patients in group-II was 43.8 ± 13.1 years (p = 0.16) Sex distribution was also identical between 2 groups (p = 0.92). This study showed that among the different ECG criteria for detection of RVH in mitral stenosis patients (Which is a surrogate marker for pulmonary hypertension), only a few had good predictive value. In mild pulmonary hypertension, only R in V1 ≥ 7 mm has sensitivity (66.7%), specificity (100%), PPV (100%) and NPV (37.5%). In moderate and severe pulmonary hypertension, R in V1 ≥ 7 mm, R/S in V1 &gt; 1 andR in V1+S in V5 ≥ 10 mm had good sensitivity (60.5% and 63.2%; 65.1% and 68.4%; 53.5% and 63.2% respectively), good specificity (100% and 100%; 100% and 100%; 100% and 100% respectively), good PPV (100% and 100%; 100% and 100%; 100% and 100% respectively) and NPV (19% and 22.2%; 21.1% and 25%; 16.7% and 22.2% respectively). Conclusion: The sensitivity of the ECG parameters was as a whole low to moderate in detection of pulmonary hypertension by assessing presence of RVH. However, certain ECG criteria for RVH detection in mitral stenosis patients have acceptable predictive value only in moderate to severe pulmonary hypertension."

Studies have showed trace element concentrations varied in patients with AF and may be involved in the pathogenesis of AF. However, no data is currently available for those with VHD. Methods Urine samples as well as clinical data were collected from 72 VHD patients with AF (VHDAF) and 72 VHD patients without AF (VHD) and further analyzed for a panel of trace elements: lithium, manganese, cobalt, copper, zinc, arsenic, selenium, strontium, Cadmium, mercury, thallium, lead. Quantile g-computation was adopted to explore the joint effect of the 12 trace elements on AF in this population, and internal validation was performed using 1,000 bootstrap re-samples. Results Compared with the VHD group, Sr levels were reduced, while Mn, Cu and Hg concentrations were increased in the VHDAF group. Quantile g-computation model indicated a significant association between the mixtures of the 12 urinary trace elements and AF in patients with heart valve disease (adjusted OR: 2.051; 95% CI: 1.180–3.565; p = 0.011). Positive partial effect was owing to Cu (weight: 0.43) and Hg (weight: 0.18), while negative partial effect mainly attributed to Sr (weight: 0.43) and Li (weight: 0.23). Conclusion VHDAF patients had higher Cu levels and lower Sr levels, and the two elements have been supposed to exert the largest influence on AF. Further research is needed to establish the causal relationships."

Although the initial insult is driven by autoimmune responses triggered by Group A Streptococcus infection, the sustained progression of valvular fibrosis involves a complex interplay of persistent immune activation, chronic inflammation, and, critically, long‐term mechanical stress. Mechanical forces arising from altered hemodynamics and structural valve deformation perpetuate valvular interstitial cell activation, endothelial‐to‐mesenchymal transition, and extracellular matrix remodeling, thereby driving fibrosis even after acute inflammation resolves. Current therapeutic options to halt or reverse mitral valve fibrosis are limited, with surgical repair or replacement remaining the primary interventions for advanced disease. Advancing mechanistic understanding through physiologically relevant models, coupled with early diagnostic strategies and multitargeted antifibrotic approaches, holds promise for preserving valve function. Integrating molecular insights with scalable public health measures may ultimately mitigate the global burden of rheumatic heart disease and improve outcomes for affected populations."

This review outlines the complex interplay of traditional, transplant-specific, and recipient- and donor-related risk factors that sustain a high cardiovascular burden post-transplantation. While kidney function restoration reduces uremic toxins and improves cardiometabolic parameters, new challenges arise from immunosuppressive therapies, persistent hypertension, post-transplant diabetes mellitus, and chronic inflammation. Common cardiovascular complications include coronary artery disease, heart failure, valvular disease, peripheral artery disease, and refractory hypertension. Risk stratification tools and guidelines often fail to account for transplant-specific variables, resulting in suboptimal management. Although some pharmacological strategies and careful antihypertensive regimens show promise, most evidence is extrapolated from non-transplant populations due to the lack of dedicated randomized controlled trials. Emerging therapies like SGLT2 inhibitors, GLP-1 receptor agonists and non-steroidal mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists hold potential but require further validation in this population. Moreover, sex disparities persist in access to transplantation and in post-transplant outcomes, with men generally experiencing higher cardiovascular risk but women potentially facing greater relative mortality. The review underscores the urgent need for transplant-specific cardiovascular research, personalized therapeutic strategies including precision medicine, and greater inclusion of women in research. Optimizing cardiovascular outcomes in KTRs will require multidisciplinary collaboration, rigorous evidence generation, and an integrated approach to risk prediction, prevention, and treatment."

This pathology is the most prevalent valvular heart disease worldwide and is associated with a poor prognosis. Despite extensive research, no pharmacological treatments are available to slow or reverse valvular degeneration, making aortic valve replacement the only current therapeutic option. This lack of clinical success may stem from an incomplete understanding of the disease's mechanisms and the limitations of current preclinical models, which do not fully replicate the complexity of CAVD and its associated risk factors and comorbidities. Indeed, while existing models offer valuable insights, a deeper understanding of CAVD requires incorporating comorbidities, gender-specific mechanisms, and dynamic cellular and tissue-level changes. This review aims to provide the reader with an overview of preclinical models developed in recent years to study CAVD, assessing their strengths and limitations. We review how these models can be used to mimic and/or investigate the cellular and molecular mechanisms involved in CAVD development, and highlight how key risk factors and comorbidities can be incorporated to enhance the translational potential of research. We hope that this approach will help guide researchers in selecting the most appropriate model for their studies, with the goal of advancing the identification of effective therapeutic candidates."

Its causes can be divided into two large groups: those of genetic origin and those of nongenetic origin, which include infectious, toxic, and autoimmune disease causes, among others. Its natural course varies significantly based on the different etiologies and its diagnosis can influence the disease's management and prognosis. Clinical case: 29-year-old male, with a history of having suffered from Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia at the age of 4 with complete remission of the disease demonstrated at that time by bone marrow aspirate and immunophenotype, having been treated with anthracyclines. On this occasion, he attended due to the presence of sudden onset dyspnea and hemoptysis, for which in the first instance, due to the previously mentioned history, an attempt was made to rule out pulmonary thromboembolism with chest Angio tomography, which was corroborated by said study and demonstrating the presence of two intracavitary thrombi. Therefore, a transthoracic echocardiogram was performed, highlighting severe dilation of the left ventricle. Management for heart failure was adjusted based on structural alteration demonstrated by echocardiography, with favorable clinical evolution. Conclusions: The natural history of dilated cardiomyopathy is not easy to establish due to the wide heterogeneity of its etiology and the different rates of progression depending on it. In some cases, there may be functional recovery after acute myocardial damage, for example, in cardiomyopathy induced by tachycardia or in that induced by cardiotoxic drugs. In other cases, stabilization of the disease and systolic dysfunction and, in others, sudden death may be observed."

OpenAlex,deep learning,Zāl and Simorgh as Trickster Figures: A Mythological Reinterpretation of the Shahnameh Narratives,Tohid Teymori; Tohid Teymori,,2025-12-01,DOAJ (DOAJ: Directory of Open Access Journals),"This study examines the trickster archetype within the narrative of Zāl and Simorgh in Ferdowsi’s Shahnameh. The trickster, a mythological figure characterized by ambivalence, shape-shifting, resourcefulness, and divine intervention, occupies a significant role across various cultural traditions. Drawing upon established theoretical frameworks, this research identifies Zāl and Simorgh as a trickster within Iranian mythology. The analysis focuses on key trickster attributes—including shapeshifting, wisdom, and the capacity to disrupt and reconstitute social order. Zāl, marked by his extraordinary birth and upbringing by Simorgh, embodies a liminal identity that facilitates intervention in pivotal events. Simorgh, in turn, functions as a supernatural guide and healer, contributing to the restoration of equilibrium and the revelation of hidden truths. A close reading of the Rostam and Esfandiar episode demonstrates how Zāl and Simorgh employ cunning and esoteric knowledge to challenge oppressive power structures and institute a renewed order. This study underscores the significance of the trickster archetype in Iranian mythic traditions and elucidates the roles of Zāl and Simorgh as agents of transformation and balance within the Persian cultural discourse. Keywords: Trickster, Zāl, Simorgh, Shahnameh, Mythology. IntroductionThe trickster archetype represents one of the most significant and beloved figures in world mythology, characterized by paradoxical qualities where positive attributes typically outweigh negative ones, though this balance varies across different mythological traditions. As liminal beings existing between worlds, tricksters challenge established laws, confront deities, and disrupt social and cultural norms. While often depicted as deceiving ordinary people, tricksters more importantly challenge those in positions of power, undermining the dominion of kings, heroes, and the powerful through cunning and artifice.This study examines the trickster archetype within the narrative framework of Zāl and Simorgh in Ferdowsi’s Shahnameh, positioning these figures within the broader context of Iranian mythology. The research addresses a significant gap in Iranian mythological studies, as the trickster concept, despite its prominence in global mythology, has remained largely unexplored in Persian literary scholarship. By applying established theoretical frameworks from folklore, psychoanalysis, mythology, and anthropology, this investigation seeks to illuminate the transformative roles of Zāl and Simorgh as agents of change and balance within Persian cultural discourse. Materials and MethodsThe methodological approach employs a comprehensive theoretical framework drawing primarily from the foundational works of Paul Radin and Carl Gustav Jung on the trickster archetype. Radin’s conception of the trickster as a “culture-bringer” who facilitates societal transformation from lower to higher levels of civilization provides a crucial analytical lens. Jung’s psychological interpretation, viewing the trickster as a representation of the collective unconscious and undifferentiated human consciousness retaining its animal nature, offers complementary insights into the archetype’s enduring significance.The analysis incorporates perspectives from various scholars, including Claude Lévi-Strauss’s structural approach to mythological dualities, Joseph Campbell’s hero archetype theory, and Mary Douglas’s anthropological insights on social order disruption. The study employs close textual reading of Shahnameh, focusing particularly on key episodes including Zāl’s birth and upbringing by Simorgh, and the pivotal Rostam and Esfandiar confrontation. Comparative analysis with trickster figures from other cultural traditions—including Loki from Norse mythology, Anansi from West African folklore, Coyote from Native American traditions, and Prometheus from Greek mythology—provides cross-cultural context for understanding the unique characteristics of the Iranian trickster manifestation. Research FindingsThe investigation reveals that Zāl and Simorgh collectively embody the essential characteristics of the trickster archetype within Iranian mythology. Key findings of the study include:Extraordinary Birth and Liminal Identity: Zāl’s albinism marks him as fundamentally different from birth, leading to his abandonment and subsequent raising by Simorgh. This unusual upbringing creates a liminal identity existing between human society and the supernatural realm, a defining characteristic of trickster figures.Shape-shifting and Duality: The relationship between Zāl and Simorgh demonstrates the trickster’s capacity for transformation and dual existence. Simorgh functions as both a physical being and Zāl’s spiritual essence, while Zāl himself bridges the animal, human, and divine realms.Wisdom and Problem-solving: Zāl’s renowned wisdom, acquired through Simorgh’s tutelage and his own dedicated study, enables him to serve as advisor and mediator in critical situations. His knowledge encompasses both earthly learning and supernatural wisdom, positioning him as a crucial problem-solver in times of crisis.Shamanic Attributes: Zāl exhibits shamanic characteristics through his ability to summon Simorgh via the ritual burning of the sacred feather, accessing supernatural assistance when confronting seemingly insurmountable challenges. This shamanic connection enables intervention in the natural order when necessary.Divine Intervention and Social Transformation: In the Rostam-Esfandiar episode, Zāl and Simorgh’s intervention challenges corrupt power structures represented by Goshtasp and Esfandiar’s ambitions, ultimately facilitating a restoration of proper governance and social order. Discussion of Results and ConclusionsThe findings demonstrate that Zāl and Simorgh function as a unified trickster entity, challenging oppressive power structures while maintaining cosmic and social balance. Unlike tricksters in other traditions who often act from self-interest, the Zāl-Simorgh complex operates primarily for societal benefit, distinguishing the Iranian trickster tradition. The Rostam-Esfandiar confrontation exemplifies the trickster’s role in exposing corruption and facilitating necessary social transformation. Esfandiar’s invulnerability, granted through Zoroastrian blessing, represents a sacred power corrupted by personal ambition. Zāl and Simorgh’s intervention—revealing the secret of targeting Esfandiar’s eyes with a double-headed arrow from the gaz tree—demonstrates the trickster’s function in challenging even sacred authority when it threatens social harmony. This episode reflects broader tensions between two political paradigms: the pre-Lohrasp tradition of balanced power between royal and heroic houses, and the Lohrasp-Goshtasp model concentrating all authority in the monarchy. The trickster’s intervention supports the restoration of balanced governance, suggesting Ferdowsi’s critique of absolute monarchical power. The comparative analysis reveals both universal and culturally specific aspects of the Iranian trickster. While sharing common features with global trickster figures—liminality, shape-shifting, wisdom, and social disruption—Zāl and Simorgh demonstrate unique characteristics rooted in Persian cultural values, particularly the emphasis on wisdom (kherad) and justice (dād).This study establishes Zāl and Simorgh as a distinctive trickster manifestation within Iranian mythology, contributing significantly to the theoretical understanding of the trickster archetype. The trickster archetype plays a vital but previously unrecognized role in Iranian mythological traditions, with Zāl and Simorgh embodying this function through their combined attributes and interventions. The Iranian trickster tradition emphasizes wisdom, justice, and societal benefit over the self-interested cunning often associated with tricksters in other cultures, reflecting core Persian cultural values. The Zāl-Simorgh complex serves as a mechanism for critiquing and transforming unjust power structures, particularly relevant to Ferdowsi’s historical context and his concerns about tyrannical rule. Recognition of the trickster pattern in Shahnameh opens new avenues for comparative mythological studies and a deeper understanding of Persian literary traditions. The study’s findings have implications beyond literary analysis, offering insights into mechanisms of cultural resistance, identity formation, and social transformation relevant to contemporary Iranian society. This research advances scholarship in Iranian mythology, comparative literature, and archetypal studies while demonstrating the continued relevance of ancient mythological patterns for understanding cultural dynamics and social change. Future research might explore trickster manifestations in other Persian literary works and examine the archetype’s evolution in modern Iranian literature and culture."

Their black-box nature, however, may make it difficult to understand and trust the outcomes they provide. As a result, there is now a greater need for trustworthy visualisation tools to promote confidence in machine learning models. This topic has gained popularity in the visualisation community over the past few decades. To offer an overview of current research on the subject, as well as the frontiers of that study. The Internet of Things (IoT) enables billions of objects, in both physical and virtual contexts, to intelligently communicate with one another. Smartphones, for example, have evolved into valuable personal assistants and an integral part of people's daily lives and work. Machine learning, such as reinforcement learning and deep learning, is increasingly commonly used in IoT to improve performance and efficiency. Machine learning, on the other hand, has several flaws that could jeopardise the security, trust, and privacy of IoT environments. One of the most serious threats is adversarial learning, in which attackers try to trick the learning algorithm with carefully crafted training examples, leading to incorrect outputs. This Special Issue will feature cutting-edge research from academia and industry, with a focus on debates over the security, trust, and privacy issues in machine learning-based IoT.&lt;/p&gt;"

Advances in image processing and pattern recognition have enabled plant identification using digital images. Machine learning (ML) and convolutional neural network (CNN) models have demonstrated strong capabilities in handling texture-related features in image processing tasks, including segmentation. In this Paper, we present an approach that utilises ML and CNN models, including AlexNet, Inception, ResNet, LeNet, VGG Net, MobileNet, DenseNet, and GoogLeNet. These models are used to classify fruit plants from leaf images, achieving promising performance on leaf image datasets. Among the evaluated CNN models, MobileNet achieved the highest performance with 94.81% training, 99.57% validation, and 99.44% test accuracy, outperforming all others. LeNet, AlexNet, and ResNet also showed strong results above 93%, while DenseNet, GoogLeNet, and VGGNet achieved moderate accuracy. Inception performed the worst, confirming that MobileNet is the most efficient and reliable model for fruit plant leaf classification.&lt;/p&gt;"
OpenAlex,deep learning,A Framework for the Prediction of Eye Diseases using Deep Learning Models,Dr. Jagannibas Paul Choudhury,,2025-11-30,Zenodo (CERN European Organization for Nuclear Research),"&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract:&lt;/strong&gt; Artificial Intelligence (AI) has significantly enhanced various aspects of our lives, providing practical solutions to complex problems and narrowing the gap between real-world challenges and business needs. Within the realm of AI, innovative technologies such as machine learning and deep learning have revolutionised the way we analyse data, make informed decisions, and respond to complex situations, all with the goal of understanding and resolving them efficiently. As data generation and storage continue to expand rapidly, these technologies have become essential in managing data analytics, storage systems, and decision-making frameworks. Through digital transformation, industries are being reshaped, and global services&mdash;especially in fields such as healthcare&mdash;are being enhanced to improve the quality of human life. The eye is considered the most important sensory organ for humans, playing a vital role in their overall ability to interact with the world. Unfortunately, many individuals in both rural and urban areas suffer from eye conditions such as cataracts, glaucoma, ocular hypertension, bulgy vision, etc., that affect their vision. There are various causes, including age, diabetes, and genetic and hereditary factors. Modern lifestyles, which have led to increased use of displays for digital devices, are also a factor affecting vision. This study aims to develop a predictive model for vision-related diseases by leveraging medical data and analyzing the influence of various contributing factors using deep learning methodologies. Early detection of eye conditions is crucial to prevent serious complications, as timely diagnosis plays a vital role in ensuring effective treatment. Conducting thorough assessments to identify potential indicators of eye diseases is highly encouraged. Deep learning and artificial intelligence (AI) significantly enhance the ability to detect these illnesses at an early stage. The purpose of this research is to lay the foundation for discovering a robust and adaptable solution. Specifically, the study focuses on reviewing the classification of eye diseases using advanced deep learning models, such as Custom CNN (Convolutional Neural Network), VGG16, ResNet, InceptionV3, GoogleNet, EfficientNet B2, MobileNet, and DenseNet 121. The proposed classification framework follows a series of steps: initially, it involves gathering widely accessible datasets related to eye diseases and performing data preprocessing to ensure consistent experimental conditions. The primary objective is to train the model to accurately identify symptoms of eye diseases, rather than optimizing for a narrow subset of data. Given the success of deep learning in image classification and object recognition tasks, the research emphasizes these modern techniques over conventional handcrafted approaches.&lt;/p&gt;"

The objective of this study is to generate the first complete canopy height map of the Amazon forest at ~4.78 m resolution using Planet NICFI imagery and deep learning. Specifically, we (i) trained a U‐Net regression model with canopy height models (CHMs) derived from tropical airborne LiDAR and their corresponding Planet NICFI images to estimate canopy height, (ii) evaluated the accuracy of our map against existing global products based on Sentinel‐2/1 and Maxar Vivid2 imagery and (iii) assessed its capacity to capture small‐scale canopy height changes. Tree height predictions on the validation sample had a mean absolute error of 3.68 m, with minimal systematic bias across the full range of tree heights in the Amazon forest. The main biases are a slight overestimation (up to 5 m) for heights of 5–15 m and an underestimation for most trees above 50 m. Outperforming existing global model‐based canopy height products in this region, the model accurately estimated canopy heights up to 40–50 m with minimal saturation. We determined that the Amazon forest has an average canopy height of ~22 m (standard deviation ~5.3 m) and exhibits large‐scale patterns, ranging from the tallest forests of the Guiana Shield to shorter forests along wetlands, rivers, rocky outcrops, savannas and high elevations. Events such as logging or deforestation could be detected from changes in tree height, and the results demonstrated a first success in monitoring the height of regenerating forests. Finally, the map of the Amazon forest canopy height is displayed."

Bridge weigh‐in‐motion (B‐WIM) systems estimate gross vehicle weight (GVW) using strain measurements, but inaccuracies in axle configuration recognition can reduce reliability. This study presents a low‐cost computer vision (CV) extension for existing B‐WIM installations that verifies strain‐inferred axle configurations using traffic camera images and flags GVW estimates as reliable or unreliable. Experiments on a data set of over 30,000 HGV records show that by combining convolutional neural networks with strain‐based heuristics, GVW reliability can improve from 96.7% to 99.89%, effectively excluding nearly all erroneous measurements. The approach operates without interrupting ongoing B‐WIM operations and can be applied retrospectively to historical data. Limitations include the inability to detect raised axles (RAs), which the method excludes as unreliable. This method provides a practical, high‐precision enhancement for structural health monitoring of bridges."

Traditional methods of manual verification are slow, prone to mistakes, and can't keep up with the increasingly complex nature of forgeries. Incorporating Optical Character Recognition (OCR) and Deep Learning models, this study introduces an automated framework for detecting document forgeries. Optical character recognition (OCR) is used to extract structural and textual information from digital or scanned documents, and deep learning algorithms look for visual and textual discrepancies to detect possible manipulation. To detect patterns of forgery in space, language, and context, the suggested method uses architectures based on convolution and sequences. Experiments on benchmark datasets show excellent accuracy, precision, and recall, proving the method's resilience to a variety of forgery techniques, such as text replacement, insertion, and style manipulation. The system offers a dependable way to improve document authentication procedures in financial institutions, e-governance, and forensic investigations. It is also scalable and flexible enough to accommodate real-world applications"
OpenAlex,deep learning,Stock Price Prediction Using Machine Learning and LSTM-Based Deep Learning Models,"Shri Rawatpura Sarkar University , Raipur; Dipanshu Adil; Priyanka Bande",10.55041/ijsrem53992,2025-11-16,INTERANTIONAL JOURNAL OF SCIENTIFIC RESEARCH IN ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT,"Abstract. Prediction of stock prices has been an important area of research for a long time. While supporters of the efficient market hypothesis believe that it is impossible to predict stock prices accurately, there are formal propositions demonstrating that accurate modeling and designing of appropriate variables may lead to models using which stock prices and stock price movement patterns can be very accurately predicted. Researchers have also worked on technical analysis of stocks with a goal of identifying patterns in the stock price movements using advanced data mining techniques. In this work, we propose an approach of hybrid modeling for stock price prediction building different machine learning and deep learning-based models. For the purpose of our study, we have used NIFTY 50 index values of the National Stock Exchange (NSE) of India, during the period December 29, 2014 till July 31, 2020. We have built eight regression models using the training data that consisted of NIFTY 50 index records during December 29, 2014 till December 28, 2018. Using these regression models, we predicted the open values of NIFTY 50 for the period December 31, 2018 till July 31, 2020. We, then, augment the predictive power of our forecasting framework by building four deep learning- based regression models using long-and short-term memory (LSTM) networks with a novel approach of walk-forward validation. Using the grid-searching technique, the hyperparameters of the LSTM models are optimized so that it is ensured that validation losses stabilize with the increasing number of epochs, and the convergence of the validation accuracy is achieved. We exploit the power of LSTM regression models in forecasting the future NIFTY 50 open values using four different models that differ in their architecture and in the structure of their input data. Extensive results are presented on various metrics for all the regression models. The results clearly indicate that the LSTM-based univariate model that uses one-week prior data as input for predicting the next week's open value of the NIFTY 50 time series is the most accurate model.
