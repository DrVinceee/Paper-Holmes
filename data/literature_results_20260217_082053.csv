No medical therapy halts aortic stenosis progression, and aortic valve replacement remains the only curative option. Managing asymptomatic patients is challenging because of a persistent risk of sudden death, and the potential for irreversible myocardial damage if intervention is delayed, but also because aortic valve replacement carries procedural risks and long-term prosthesis-related complications. Functional assessment, especially exercise testing, is essential as it can identify a substantial proportion of ""falsely asymptomatic"" patients who will benefit from timely aortic valve replacement. Accurate assessment of aortic stenosis severity is crucial, with echocardiography as the cornerstone, although additional imaging modalities may be required in selected cases. Modern risk stratification integrates markers of subclinical myocardial dysfunction, haemodynamic compromise and procedural risk. Although observational studies and randomized trials suggest that early aortic valve replacement may reduce adverse events in selected low-risk patients, results are heterogeneous and methodological concerns remain. Meta-analyses have shown reductions in unplanned hospitalizations but no clear survival benefit with early intervention. Current guidelines recommend aortic valve replacement for classical indications, such as symptom onset or reduced ejection fraction, and suggest early aortic valve replacement only in carefully selected asymptomatic patients with low procedural risk. Shared decision-making within a multidisciplinary heart valve team remains essential, taking into account patient preferences, co-morbidities, life expectancy and lifestyle. Close follow-up with regular echocardiography and functional testing is critical to optimize timing and outcomes."

The myocardium responds through a sequence of mechanical and biological processes that initially preserve wall stress and cardiac output but eventually become maladaptive, leading to fibrosis, loss of contractile reserve and clinical heart failure. Integrating myocardial fibrosis assessment and staging frameworks into clinical decision-making may support earlier valve replacement, even before conventional triggers such as symptoms or reduced ejection fraction, to prevent irreversible myocardial damage in patients with severe/significant AS. Advances in imaging biomarkers - including cardiac magnetic resonance-derived late gadolinium enhancement, extracellular volume quantification and strain analysis - allow for more personalized risk stratification and may help identify which patients with asymptomatic severe AS stand to benefit most from earlier intervention. Beyond the valve procedure itself, adjunctive pharmacological strategies, such as antifibrotic therapies, renin-angiotensin system blockade, neprilysin inhibition and metabolic modulators, are being explored to address persistent fibrotic and metabolic remodelling that valve replacement alone cannot reverse. Equally important is the optimal treatment of concomitant cardiovascular comorbidities such as hypertension, coronary artery disease and atrial fibrillation, which may aggravate myocardial remodelling and blunt the benefits of valve replacement if left untreated."

As TAVI indications continue to expand to include younger patients, it is essential to systematically document redo TAVI procedures to better understand their long-term efficacy and safety. This study aimed to compare outcomes between redo TAVI and first TAVI procedures using a propensity score-matched analysis.
To compare the long-term clinical outcomes, including death, stroke and procedural adverse events, between redo TAVI and first TAVI procedures using a propensity score-matched analysis.
A retrospective analysis was conducted using the TriNetX database, identifying adults (≥18years) with severe aortic stenosis who underwent TAVI (2012-2024). Redo TAVI required an interval of ≥12months. Propensity score matching was performed using all baseline characteristics listed in Table 1, with outcomes assessed over 36months.
After matching, 446 patients were included in each cohort. No statistically significant difference was observed in the annual rates of all-cause death (11.3% vs 8.7%; hazard ratio 1.20, 95% confidence interval 0.86-1.68), ischaemic stroke (hazard ratio 2.07, 95% confidence interval 0.99-4.35) or major bleeding (hazard ratio 1.41, 95% confidence interval 0.99-2.02) between the redo TAVI and first TAVI groups. Pacemaker implantation (hazard ratio 0.25, 95% confidence interval 0.12-0.51), new-onset atrial fibrillation (hazard ratio 0.44, 95% confidence interval 0.24-0.79) and hospitalization for heart failure (hazard ratio 0.64, 95% confidence interval 0.41-0.99) were significantly lower in the redo TAVI group.
No statistically significant difference was observed in all-cause death, ischaemic stroke or major bleeding between the redo TAVI and first TAVI groups. Conversely, redo TAVI was associated with significantly lower rates of permanent pacemaker implantation and heart failure rehospitalization. These findings support the integration of redo TAVI as an essential component within a comprehensive lifetime treatment strategy for managing bioprosthetic aortic valve dysfunction."

We aimed to develop and internally validate a clinical risk score to accurately stratify this risk.
Using data from the nationwide, multicentre FRANCE-TAVI registry, we developed a clinical predictive risk score for 30-day ischaemic stroke post-TAVI using multivariable logistic regression analysis. The model was internally validated through cross-validation techniques.
Among 62,747 patients, 1712 (2.7%) experienced ischaemic stroke within 30 days. Nine clinical predictors were identified: female sex, age >85 years, weight <60kg, symptomatic status, history of stroke or transient ischaemic attack, multiple (i.e. >1) episodes of acute heart failure, severe mobility reduction, diabetes and creatinine clearance <60mL/min. The resulting scoring model demonstrated good accuracy (Brier score 0.18), moderate discrimination (C-index 0.63) and excellent calibration as assessed by calibration plots, calibration-in-the-large and calibration slope. The score categorized patients into low - (90.2% of the population), intermediate - (8.0%) and high-risk (1.8%) groups. Observed stroke rates increased progressively across these groups, from 2.25% in the low-risk group to 6.51% in the intermediate-risk group and 10.10% in the high-risk group.
This newly developed STRAT score is a clinical, practical and effective tool for predicting early ischaemic stroke in patients undergoing TAVI. It was derived and internally validated in the FRANCE-TAVI registry and may help tailor preventive strategies. Further studies are necessary to externally validate this score and evaluate its impact on clinical decision-making."

This is amplified in patients with LVOT obstruction (LVOTO). Ascertaining whether gestational elevations in LVOT gradients are transient haemodynamic responses that regress postpartum, or predictors of disease progression or adverse outcomes, is critical.
A retrospective, observational study was conducted between 2009 and 2023 in two tertiary centres. Clinical and echocardiographic data were collected preconception, antenatally, and postpartum. Key measurements included peak and mean LVOT gradients, left ventricular ejection fraction, and aortic valve area. The primary endpoint was the need for postpartum intervention, while the secondary endpoints were a composite of adverse clinical outcomes and postpartum intervention.
A total of 78 women with LVOTO (109 pregnancies) were included. Gestational increases in LVOT gradients were transient, regressing to baseline levels postpartum for most. Postpartum intervention was required in 11% of pregnancies within a median of 6.3 (4.4-9.2) years. Predictors of the primary endpoint were baseline LVOTO severity (HR = 29.6, p < 0.01), antenatal LVOTO severity (HR = 21.1, p < 0.01), and postpartum LVOTO severity (HR = 18.3, p < 0.01). While patients with inherently severe LVOTO at baseline (n = 8, 10%) had a significantly increased risk of postpartum intervention, those with transiently severe LVOTO during pregnancy did not.
Pregnancy causes an increase in LVOT gradients but no significant disease progression warranting either antenatal or postpartum intervention, except in patients who had severe LVOTO preconception. The development of pregnancy-specific echocardiographic thresholds for severity is a critical need to prevent misdiagnoses and optimise maternal outcomes."

Population health and outcomes,"The overall impact of the introduction of transcatheter aortic valve replacement (AVR) on the prognosis of the entire population with severe aortic stenosis has not been evaluated.
We analyzed 2 multicenter registries that consecutively enrolled patients with severe aortic stenosis before and after the introduction of transcatheter AVR in Japan (CURRENT AS [CURRENT AS, Contemporary Outcomes After Surgery and Medical Treatment in Patients With Severe Aortic Stenosis] Registry-1: 2003-2011; Registry-2: 2018-2020). Data were derived from hospital electronic health records. The primary outcome was 1-year all-cause mortality. Secondary outcomes included hospitalization for heart failure, cardiovascular death, and noncardiovascular death. we Multivariable Cox proportional hazards models were adjusted for age, sex, body mass index, hypertension, current smoking, diabetes on insulin therapy, prior myocardial infarction, prior symptomatic stroke, atrial fibrillation or flutter, aortic or peripheral vascular disease, creatinine level, hemodialysis, anemia, liver cirrhosis (child B or C), malignancy currently under treatment, chronic lung disease (moderate or severe), coronary artery disease, peak aortic jet velocity, any combined moderate or severe valvular disease, and tricuspid regurgitation pressure gradient.
A total of 6645 patients (Registry-1: 3448 patients, and Registry-2: 3197 patients) were included. Patients in Registry-2 were older than those in Registry-1 (81.7 versus 77.8 years), and an initial AVR strategy was more frequently selected (49.9% versus 31.3%). The cumulative 1-year incidence and adjusted risk of 1-year all-cause mortality were lower in Registry-2 than in Registry-1 (10.2% versus 16.0%, P<0.001, hazard ratio, 0.55 [95% CI, 0.47-0.63]). In contrast, the incidence and adjusted risk of hospitalization for heart failure did not differ between Registry-2 and Registry-1 (8.5% versus 9.0%, P=0.66, hazard ratio, 0.88 [95% CI, 0.75-1.04]).
The overall 1-year mortality outcome of patients with severe aortic stenosis improved in the posttranscatheter AVR era compared with the pretranscatheter AVR era, with no noticeable improvement in hospitalization for heart failure."

Annual follow-up is planned for 10 years, evaluating the composite of all-cause mortality or disabling stroke and key secondary endpoints.
Our prespecified objective was to report the 6-year clinical outcomes of transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) vs surgery from the Evolut Low Risk trial. Given an increase in reintervention rates at 6 years, we performed additional analyses in available 7-year data.
Low-risk patients with severe symptomatic aortic stenosis were randomized to TAVR or surgery from 2016-2019. Prespecified analyses at 6 years included annual follow-up of clinical outcomes reported as Kaplan-Meier estimates with log-rank test. Because the trial enrolled patients over several years, at the time of data lock, a majority of patients had completed 7-year follow-up. Given an increased reintervention rate at 6 years in the TAVR arm, we performed additional analysis of 7-year data available at the time of the database lock. Reintervention rates are reported as cumulative incidence.
A total of 1,414 patients underwent an attempted implantation (730 TAVR, 684 surgery). At 6 years, the composite endpoint of all-cause mortality or disabling stroke was 23.3% for TAVR and 20.4% for surgery (difference: 2.8% [95% CI: -1.9% to 7.6%]; P = 0.43). All-cause mortality with vital status sweep at 6 years was 23.3% (95% CI: 20.6%-26.4%) for TAVR and 20.2% (95% CI: 17.4%-23.3%) for surgery (P = 0.24). The reintervention rate at 6 years was 5.5% for TAVR and 3.3% for surgery (sHR: 1.66 [95% CI: 0.96-2.86]; P = 0.07). Using available 7-year follow-up (555 TAVR and 480 surgery), the reintervention rate for TAVR was 9.8% and for surgery was 6.0% (sHR: 1.68 [95% CI: 1.10-2.58]; P = 0.02). In the TAVR and surgery groups, the rate of reintervention for regurgitation was 5.6% vs 1.6% (sHR: 3.39 [95% CI: 1.62-7.07]; P < 0.001) and the rate of reintervention for stenosis was 3.6% vs 3.5% (sHR: 1.14 [95% CI: 0.61-2.15]; P = 0.70).
The 6-year results from the Evolut Low Risk trial show no significant difference in the composite endpoint of all-cause mortality or disabling stroke. At 6 and 7 years, the TAVR arm had a higher reintervention rate compared with surgery, driven by an increased incidence of aortic regurgitation.

All consecutive patients undergoing SU-AVR (n = 53) or TAVI (n = 245) between 2014-2023 were retrospectively analyzed. Propensity score matching (1:1 nearest neighbor, no replacement) generated 53 balanced pairs.
Paravalvular leak was more frequent after TAVI and was driven by mild leaks (40.0% vs. 13.3%; P = 0.019), while moderate-to-severe paravalvular leak was low and comparable (6.7% vs. 3.3%; P = 0.646). TAVI demonstrated lower transvalvular gradients compared to SU-AVR (P = 0.004); other 6-month echocardiographic parameters, including left ventricular ejection fraction and pulmonary artery pressure, were comparable. Permanent pacemaker implantation rates were comparable. Early mortality did not differ between the SU-AVR and TAVI groups (13.5% vs. 5.7%; P = 0.173). TAVI was associated with shorter hospitalization (median 5.2, interquartile range 3.7-7.3 vs. 8.7, interquartile range 6.3-11.9 days; P <0.001).
In selected high-risk patients, SU-AVR and TAVI showed complementary early profiles. Individualized Heart Team-based decision-making remains essential."

Case reports,"Differentiating Takotsubo cardiomyopathy (TCM) from myocardial infarction (MI) remains challenging, especially in elderly patients with structural heart disease. When complicated by severe aortic stenosis (AS), cardiogenic shock can rapidly develop, posing both diagnostic and therapeutic dilemmas.
A 91-year-old woman presented with progressive dyspnoea and was admitted for acute decompensated heart failure. Transthoracic echocardiography revealed severe AS and a reduced left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) of 30% with apical wall thinning, suggestive of an old MI. Despite optimal medical therapy, she developed recurrent syncope and was referred for transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR). Before the scheduled procedure, the patient developed cardiogenic shock and pulseless electrical activity. Veno-arterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (VA-ECMO) was initiated, and emergency TAVR was performed. The patient's haemodynamics stabilized, with subsequent clinical recovery. Coronary angiography revealed no obstructive coronary disease, and left ventriculography demonstrated apical ballooning consistent with TCM. The patient was weaned from ECMO, with a subsequent improvement in LVEF. She was discharged to a rehabilitation facility.
The present case highlights the diagnostic challenge of distinguishing TCM from ischaemic heart disease in elderly patients with severe AS and underscores the importance of prompt, multidisciplinary decision-making in managing cardiogenic shock. Furthermore, ECMO-supported TAVR may represent a viable life-saving option in selected high-risk patients."

Case reports,"Bioprosthetic valve dysfunction (BVD) is a common complication after aortic valve replacement. Valve-in-valve transcatheter aortic valve replacement (ViV-TAVR) offers a less invasive alternative to redo surgery. However, research on hypo-attenuated leaflet thickening (HALT) following ViV-TAVR remains limited.
A 74-year-old man with hypertension, transient ischaemic attack, and prior aortic and mitral bioprosthetic valve replacements for infective endocarditis 10 years ago demonstrated elevated transaortic pressure gradients and severely reduced effective orifice area index without paravalvular leakage on transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) despite initial asymptomatic status. Serial TTE monitoring every 6 months initially suggested patient-prosthesis mismatch, later progressing to structural valve degeneration. However, transoesophageal echocardiography revealed no evident leaflet thickening or limited aortic valve opening. Furthermore, computed tomography (CT) confirmed proper aortic valve opening and further excluded pannus and thrombus. Due to symptom progression, worsening echocardiographic haemodynamics, and elevated NT-proBNP, ViV-TAVR with pre-procedural balloon valve fracture was performed, resulting in improved haemodynamics at 1-month follow-up. Post-procedural follow-up CT at 5 months revealed HALT, accompanied by only a mild elevation in peak aortic flow velocity on transthoracic echocardiography. Warfarin at a dose of 1 mg daily was initiated, resulting in thrombus resolution on 6-month follow-up CT, after which therapy was continued with regular TTE monitoring.
This case highlights the importance of multimodality and serial imaging in diagnosing and managing complex BVD. The observed HALT resolution raises questions about anticoagulation strategies after ViV-TAVR, especially in the absence of definitive guidelines."

Truncating variants in exons 1-29 typically produce non-syndromic SVAS through elastin haploinsufficiency, whereas C-terminal variants are linked to autosomal dominant cutis laxa. However, clinically and mechanistically well-characterized variants in the distal part of this ""stenotic zone,"" such as exon 28, remain uncommon.
We conducted a retrospective family-based case report with standardized clinical evaluation, serial echocardiography, and trio whole-exome sequencing with Sanger confirmation and conservation analysis.
A female infant presented at 1 month with severe sinotubular junction narrowing (Z-score -4.8, peak gradient 24 mmHg), severe peripheral pulmonary artery stenosis, a small atrial septal defect, and moderate mitral regurgitation. Her father had severe SVAS with mild PPAS and prior aortic root enlargement, without syndromic features. Trio sequencing identified a novel heterozygous ELN exon 28 frameshift variant, c.1879_1883dup (p.Ala629LeufsTer15), inherited from the father. Ala629 is fully conserved, and the duplication introduces a premature stop codon, consistent with nonsense-mediated decay and elastin haploinsufficiency. At 9 months, SVAS progressed (peak gradient 35 mmHg), while PPAS gradients regressed by >40%.
This novel exon 28 ELN frameshift expands the non-syndromic SVAS spectrum and illustrates a characteristic pattern of progressive aortic stenosis with improving PPAS, supporting ELN testing and targeted longitudinal surveillance in similar patients and families."

Digital health,"We aim to explore whether biomechanical simulations can identify coronary compression sites and support pre-operative assessment as a proof-of-concept approach in subjects with anomalous aortic origin of a coronary artery.
Patient-specific computer-aided engineering models of the aortic root and coronary arteries were developed from computed tomography scans of subjects with anomalous aortic origin of coronary arteries, retrospectively evaluated to include variants with and without an intramural segment. The fixed and dynamic components of stenosis were assessed by simulating blood pressure from rest to extreme effort and by retrieving the percentage of narrowing of the proximal anomalous lumen with reference to the distal segment. Patients were classified as potential candidates for surgery if the degree of stenosis was >50% in any of the simulated pressure scenarios. A total of 31 patients (19 with interarterial course and intramural segment, 12 with non-intramural course) were simulated. Simulations showed promising trends of agreement with retrospective clinical treatment decisions (13 aligned with surgery, 11 aligned with non-surgical management). This concordance with surgical decisions should not be interpreted as validation for predicting myocardial ischaemia.
Computational models of the anomalous aortic origin of a coronary artery have not yet been routinely introduced into the clinical setting. Our method demonstrates potential as a proof-of-concept tool for identifying coronary compression-prone regions and estimating stenosis severity, but further studies are needed to validate its diagnostic and clinical utility."

Integration of novel biomarkers may enhance risk stratification.
This study aimed to assess whether combining preoperative transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) and artificial intelligence-enabled electrocardiography (AI-ECG) scores improves the prediction of AF/AFl recurrence after surgical ablation.
We retrospectively analyzed 1696 patients who underwent surgical AF/AFl ablation from 2006 to 2025 with available preoperative TTE and ECG and postblanking (90-day) ECG follow-up. Clinical, TTE, and AI-ECG variables (AF probability, ECG-estimated age, heart failure with preserved ejection fraction, left ventricular dysfunction, and aortic stenosis scores) were assessed. Cox proportional hazards and random survival forest models (80:20 train-test split) identified predictors of recurrence.
Among 1696 patients (mean age 67.3 ± 10.2 years; 61.7% male), 949 (56%) had AF/AFl recurrence over a median 3.14-year follow-up. Patients with recurrence had larger left atrial area (30.4 vs 24.5 cm2), elevated mitral E-wave velocity (1.015 vs 0.896 m/s), and adverse AI-ECG biomarkers for AF probability, ECG-estimated age, heart failure with preserved ejection fraction, left ventricular dysfunction, and aortic stenosis (all P < .001). In multivariable analysis, independent predictors of recurrence included higher ECG-AF probability (P < .0001), older ECG-estimated age (P = .0002), left atrial area (P = .046), body mass index (P = .036), and diastolic blood pressure (hazard ratio 1.008/mm Hg; P = .010). The final Cox model achieved a concordance index of ∼0.67 and a 3-year Brier score of 0.21, with 3-year freedom-from-arrhythmia rates of ∼85% vs ∼43% for the lowest- vs highest-risk quartiles. Random survival forest modeling yielded a slightly higher concordance index (∼0.69).
Preoperative AI-ECG biomarkers (AF probability, age discordance) and TTE markers of atrial remodeling independently predicted AF/AFl recurrence after surgical AF/AFl ablation. Integration of these metrics improved risk stratification."

Although right ventricular failure is considered a key mechanism, its pathophysiology - potentially driven by pulmonary microembolization, complement activation, and the release of histamine - remains poorly defined. Due to the high mortality of severe BCIS, evidence regarding optimal management is limited. An 80-year-old woman with moderate-to-severe aortic valve stenosis and moderate pulmonary hypertension (PH) underwent total hip arthroplasty (THA). Five minutes after bone cement implantation, she developed sudden, profound cardiopulmonary collapse. Pulmonary embolism (PE) was suspected but excluded by transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) and computed tomography (CT) pulmonary angiography. Venoarterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (VA-ECMO) was promptly initiated, resulting in hemodynamic stabilization. She was successfully weaned from ECMO and discharged from the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) on Day 23 and from the hospital on Day 52, without neurological complications. This case highlights that prompt recognition of BCIS and immediate VA-ECMO initiation may be vital for achieving favorable outcomes in catastrophic BCIS, in selected cases managed at specialized centers."

A 72-year-old male with diffuse atherosclerotic disease presented with acute-on-chronic abdominal pain and weight loss. Computed tomography angiography (CTA) demonstrated extensive calcified aortic atherosclerotic disease extending to the major branches, particularly the SMA, causing severe stenosis. Plain old balloon angioplasty (POBA) followed by Shockwave™ IVL enabled the placement of a stent graft, resulting in successful recanalization. Following the procedure, the patient reported significant improvement in abdominal pain. IVL provides a safe and effective method for managing severely calcified mesenteric lesions, particularly when standard angioplasty alone is insufficient.

These mutations cause persistently high levels of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), predisposing affected individuals to premature atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD). Homozygous FH (HoFH), a rare but severe form, manifests early in life with cutaneous xanthomas and accelerated coronary and aortic disease. Early diagnosis and aggressive, lifelong management are crucial, yet challenges remain, particularly when follow-up is interrupted. We report the case of a 20-year-old female diagnosed with HoFH at age 13 after presenting with xanthomas. Initial evaluation revealed mild to moderate aortic stenosis and early coronary artery involvement. Genetic testing confirmed a homozygous LDLR mutation. Despite treatment with atorvastatin and evolocumab, partial lipid control was achieved, and follow-up was disrupted during the COVID-19 pandemic. At 20 years, she presented with worsening dyspnea, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, and orthopnea. Advanced imaging documented severe heart failure with an ejection fraction of 20%, significant ventricular dilation, severe mitral regurgitation, and calcified aortic stenosis. Coronary angiography demonstrated critical coronary stenoses, while subsequent adjustments in her lipid-lowering regimen, including rosuvastatin, ezetimibe, increased evolocumab dosing, and bempedoic acid, failed to stabilize her condition. Despite recommendations for surgical intervention, the patient's critical status precluded operative management, and she tragically died on the day of her scheduled follow-up. This case underscores the aggressive natural history of HoFH and the dire consequences of interrupted follow-up care. Early detection and sustained, multidisciplinary management are essential to mitigate rapid cardiovascular deterioration in HoFH patients. Consistent monitoring and prompt therapeutic adjustments remain pivotal in improving outcomes and reducing the high mortality risk associated with advanced aortic and coronary complications in these patients."

Cardiovascular risk and prevention,"This paper seeks to examine the findings of the recently published study by Gitto et al., titled ""Clinical Outcomes in Women and Men with Raphe-Type Bicuspid Aortic Valve Stenosis Undergoing Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement,"" and to conduct a further analysis of the potential influencing factors.
A critical analysis was conducted on this published multicenter registry study, with a focus on the finding that female patients have a higher risk of valve migration after transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR). In-depth discussions were carried out from the perspectives of sex-related anatomical differences of the aorta and device selection.
The original study indicated that female patients have a higher risk of post-TAVR valve migration and a lower technical success rate. This analysis suggests that, in addition to the factors mentioned in the original study (e.g., more frequent use of self-expandable valves and intra-annular downsizing), female-specific anatomical characteristics-such as a more horizontal aortic angle, more significant vascular tortuosity, and smaller iliac artery diameter-may jointly affect device delivery, positioning, and release stability, thereby contributing to such outcome disparities. Furthermore, it is recommended that the original study data be further analyzed to evaluate the impact of different types of self-expandable valves (e.g., ACURATE neo2) on valve positioning.
In patients with raphe-type bicuspid aortic valve stenosis, sex-related anatomical variations and device selection discrepancies are important factors affecting TAVR outcomes. Future research and technological development should fully take these factors into account to achieve more personalized treatment strategies."

A systematic search of major databases was conducted up to March 2025 to identify studies comparing TAVR + PCI vs. SAVR + CABG in this population. Meta-analyses were performed using a random-effects model to estimate pooled odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Evidence quality was assessed using the GRADE framework.
Thirteen studies comprising 53,869 patients were analyzed. Compared with SAVR + CABG, TAVR + PCI was associated with lower 30-day risks of stroke, myocardial infarction, and acute kidney injury, but higher permanent pacemaker implantation. No differences were found in all-cause mortality, major vascular complications, or major bleeding. In mid- to long-term follow-up (≥2 years), the TAVR + PCI group exhibited increased risks of all-cause mortality, myocardial infarction, and repeat revascularization, with similar stroke rates between strategies. Certainty of evidence ranged from very low to moderate.
In intermediate- and high-risk patients with severe AS and concomitant CAD, TAVR + PCI appears to confer short-term safety advantages but may be associated with less favorable mid- to long-term outcomes compared with SAVR + CABG. These findings support individualized revascularization strategies that balance early procedural safety against longer-term risks and highlight the need for further randomized trials with extended follow-up.

However, delayed complete atrioventricular (AV) block is rare and may present late with serious clinical consequences. We describe the case of a 72-year-old man with hypertension who developed complete AV block nearly 1 year after TAVR, underscoring the importance of long-term surveillance in patients with high-risk anatomy. The patient initially presented with progressive exertional dyspnea and was diagnosed with severe low-flow, low-gradient aortic stenosis, with a left ventricular ejection fraction of 33%. Preprocedural computed tomography demonstrated a short membranous septum (4.0 mm) and an annulus-membranous septum distance of 1.2 mm, both of which are recognized predictors of conduction disturbances. He underwent transfemoral TAVR with a self-expanding Qiming L26 valve implanted at a depth of approximately 5 mm. Early recovery was uneventful, aside from a small paravalvular leak, which resolved by the 8-month follow-up, at which time echocardiography showed recovery of systolic function to 60%, and sinus rhythm was observed on electrocardiography. At 11 months following TAVR, a community screening ECG revealed 2:1 AV block, and 3 weeks later, he presented with symptomatic complete AV block and a ventricular escape rhythm at 30 bpm. Repeat CT showed increased frame depth (7.6 and 9.8 mm), suggesting possible valve-septum interaction; however, causal attribution is limited by the absence of immediate/serial CT and electrophysiological mapping, and age-related conduction system disease may have contributed to this finding. A dual-chamber permanent pacemaker was implanted, resulting in complete symptomatic recovery and a stable prosthetic valve function. This case report highlights a rare but clinically important phenomenon of very late conduction block after TAVR and supports a risk-stratified approach to anatomical assessment and long-term rhythm monitoring. However, this inference remains hypothesis-generating, given its single-patient nature."

Although they are traditionally linked to distinct ""rheumatogenic"" and ""nephritogenic"" strains and have different immunopathogenesis, their simultaneous occurrence in the same patient is extremely rare and the mechanism has not been fully elucidated.
In this study, a 15-year-old male patient who developed ankle pain and edema of the eyelids and extremities following a history of throat infection is presented. Laboratory findings were consistent with nephritic syndrome and elevated ASO levels, and echocardiography revealed rheumatic carditis with multivalve involvement. The patient was diagnosed with concurrent APSGN and ARF, and was treated with benzathine penicillin, oral prednisolone, furosemide, and antihypertensive therapy. While kidney parameters returned to normal during follow-up, mild valvular regurgitation findings persisted.
Systematic review research was conducted in the following four databases: PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science and Google Scholar published from inception to September 15, 2025. A total of 36 cases were analyzed for clinical and laboratory characteristics, treatment protocols, and follow-up results. The presented case was evaluated comparatively with these data.
Studies meeting the following criteria were included: (1) full-text articles available in English, (2) case reports, case series or letters to the editor, and (3) information provided on patient demographics, clinical presentation, laboratory findings, treatment and follow-up results. Articles that did not meet these criteria or were review articles without original case data were excluded.
Of the 36 cases analyzed, 86.1% were pediatric. The most common clinical findings were edema (63.8%), fever (55.5%), and hypertension (55.5%). The most common cardiac finding was mitral regurgitation (32/36, 88.8%). Corticosteroids were used in 16/36 cases (44.4%). Kidney recovery was reported in 26/27 cases with follow-up (96.2%), whereas persistent cardiac sequelae were reported in 19/27 cases (70.3%), with mitral regurgitation being the most frequent residual lesion (16/27, 59.2%).
The simultaneous occurrence of APSGN and ARF is a rare but clinically important entity requiring a multidisciplinary approach. While the kidney prognosis is generally favorable, cardiac sequelae frequently persist and may progress. Therefore, after acute nephritic manifestations are controlled, clinical attention should shift to long-term cardiac surveillance and secondary prevention; in patients presenting with APSGN, clinicians should maintain a low threshold for echocardiography when clinical, electrocardiographic, or systemic findings raise suspicion for concurrent rheumatic carditis."

This retrospective study evaluated 95 patients who underwent surgical secundum ASD closure, all of whom received preoperative and postoperative transthoracic echocardiography (TTE). Patient characteristics from preoperative TTE, as well as sex and age, were analyzed to identify predictors of MR. Follow-up TTE was conducted at 1 month, 3 months, 6 months, 1 year, and 2 years post-procedure, with all patients successfully completing the 2-year follow-up.
The univariate logistic regression analysis indicated that age, gender, LA, RA-VD, RA-HD, RV, ASD diameter, AS diameter, PAP, and peak tricuspid regurgitation velocity may serve as predictors of MR worsening. Subsequent multiple logistic regression analysis revealed that LA size was an independent predictor of MR worsening and acted as a protective factor. Our research indicates a marked reduction in right cardiac system after ASD closure, with significant remodeling of the LA within the first 6 months. The relative size of the LV increased notably within 2 years. The postoperative changes in LA differed between the worsening MR group and the non-worsening MR group.
In conclusion, 'prophylactic' mitral annuloplasty during ASD surgery may prove advantageous for patients with an enlarged LA, and the presence of additional risk factors associated with mitral annuloplasty heightens the recommendation for concurrent intervention."

However, there is limited evidence on its effectiveness in achieving reverse remodeling. Our aim was to assess the effects of TEER over time and to compare the effects of TEER plus GDMT vs. GDMT alone on echocardiographic parameters.
A systematic search of MEDLINE, EMBASE, and CENTRAL was conducted from inception to November 16, 2023. Eligible studies included patients with SMR treated with TEER and echocardiographic follow-ups. We evaluated changes in left ventricular end-diastolic diameter (LVEDD), left ventricular end-systolic diameter (LVESD), left ventricular end-diastolic volume (LVEDV), left ventricular end-systolic volume (LVESV), left atrial volume (LAV), left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) and NTproBNP levels.
Of 9,290 identified studies, 38 met inclusion criteria. After TEER, statistically significant reductions were observed in LVEDD (-1.63 mm), LVESD (-1.20 mm), LVEDV (-14.21 mL), and LVESV (-9.24 mL). Changes in LAV (-5.70 mL) and LVEF (+1.10%) were not statistically or clinically meaningful. NT-proBNP decreased substantially (-1,340 pg/mL). In comparative analyses, TEER plus GDMT did not show statistically significant differences vs. GDMT alone for any parameter, including LVEDD (-1.02 mm), LVEDV (-11.98 mL), LVEF (-0.14%), and LVESV (-5.29 mL). TEER reduced grade 3-4 MR from 99% to 9%.
identifier CRD42023483404.
TEER results in statistically significant but clinically small changes in echocardiographic parameters, and no clear advantage over GDMT alone. These findings should be interpreted with caution given the high heterogeneity and low certainty of evidence. Further studies are needed to define which SMR patient subgroups may derive meaningful reverse-remodeling benefit from TEER.

However, its full impact on the cardiovascular system, especially on right heart function, is not yet fully understood. Understanding this relationship is important because the right ventricle (RV) is critical for maintaining cardiovascular function. Dysfunction of the RV, which may be contributed by conditions like MR, is strongly associated with poor clinical outcomes. Despite its importance, comprehensively studying MR's effect on the RV has been challenging due to the complex, interdependent nature of cardiovascular dynamics, limited patient data, and the difficulty in synthesizing disparate information to clarify the left heart-right heart connection.
The primary goal of this study is to investigate the effects of MR on cardiovascular hemodynamics and RV function by integrating 3D models of the left heart with a closed-loop 0D models of the entire cardiovascular system. We further conduct detailed analyses using patient-specific models to explore how various system modifications impact the RV, providing insights into the nuanced effects of MR on the right heart.
This analysis provides several clinically relevant insights. First, progressive MR markedly increases RV afterload and predisposes the RV to dysfunction, even when intrinsic RV contractility is preserved or enhanced. Second, MR-specific severity indices and left-heart metrics alone fail to capture the true burden on the right heart; RV impairment can progress despite stable or only modestly changing MR descriptors. Finally, these findings highlight the need to incorporate direct assessment of RV structure and function into the evaluation of MR, as RV vulnerability plays a critical role in determining patient risk and guiding management decisions."

Case reports,"Ring annuloplasty failure after mitral valve repair frequently occurs after long-term follow up. Valve-in-ring transcatheter mitral valve replacement (TMVR) is an emerging therapeutic option for this high surgical risk condition. While a dual-chamber implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) is frequently utilized for sudden cardiac death prevention in this population, valve-in-ring TMVR intraprocedural difficulty associated with atrial lead presence is rarely known.
A 76-year-old male, with history of coronary artery bypass graft surgery and mitral ring annuloplasty experienced recurrence of severe mitral regurgitation. Due to high surgical mortality risk and unsuitable anatomy of mitral valve for transcatheter edge-to-edge repair, this patient underwent mitral valve-in-ring TMVR. Using transvenous-transseptal access, a 26 mm SAPIEN-3 prosthetic valve was delivered to the mitral area. However, as the patient has a history of dual-chamber ICD, a prosthetic valve cannot pass through during delivery, due to atrial lead entanglement. To overcome this difficulty, atrial septum balloon dilatation manoeuvre was done to facilitate valve delivery, which resulted in successful prosthetic valve delivery and deployment at the mitral position with satisfactory results.
Valve delivery difficulty due to atrial lead entanglement can occur during valve-in-ring TMVR in patients with dual-chamber ICD implantation history. Atrial septum balloon dilatation can be performed to overcome this problem."

We evaluated the value of right heart catheterization (RHC) and the 2022 ESC/ERS pulmonary hypertension (PH) definition prior to a mitral valve procedure for the prediction of PH several months thereafter. We studied 274 patients (mean age 68 ± 11 years) with at least moderate MR (84% degenerative, 11% functional, 5% combined) undergoing RHC (baseline) followed by surgical (70%) or transcatheter (30%) valve repair/replacement who had an echocardiogram after a median follow-up of 3 months. PH was defined as a mean pulmonary artery pressure (mPAP) > 20 mmHg and was subclassified by mean pulmonary artery wedge pressure (mPAWP) and pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR). The PH follow-up probability was assessed by peak tricuspid regurgitant velocity and indirect PH signs. At baseline, 143/274 (52%) patients had any PH: 40 had isolated post-capillary, 65 had combined pre- and post-capillary (CpcPH), 27 had pre-capillary, and 11 had unclassified PH. Follow-up PH probability was low in 149, intermediate in 73, or high in 42 patients. There was a progressive increase in baseline mPAP, mPAWP, and PVR (p < 0.001 for all) in patients with low, intermediate or high follow-up PH probability. Patients with baseline CpcPH had a nearly 11-fold higher risk (odds ratio 10.7) for a high follow-up PH probability compared to those without PH. In conclusion, in MR patients the hemodynamic constellation according to the 2022 ESC/ERS PH definition predicts the PH probability several months after a mitral valve procedure."

Its frequency is substantially higher in preterm infants, and it is frequently associated with other congenital heart defects. Its persistence into adulthood has become increasingly uncommon due to advances in neonatal screening, echocardiographic diagnosis, and timely therapeutic intervention. The hemodynamic burden imposed by PDA depends on the magnitude of the left-to-right shunt and may result in both short- and long-term complications. While small shunts may remain asymptomatic throughout life, moderate and large shunts can cause pulmonary congestion, cardiac volume overload, organ hypoperfusion, and even death, early in life. When left untreated, particularly in small-to-moderate defects that may not initially meet the criteria for intervention, chronic shunting may progressively result in pulmonary hypertension and heart failure. In adults, heart failure related to PDA is usually associated with preserved or moderately reduced left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF), whereas severe systolic dysfunction and acquired dilated cardiomyopathy are exceptionally rare. Here, we present the case of a 70-year-old male who was admitted with progressive dyspnea, orthopnea, dry cough, and bilateral lower extremity edema over one month. His medical history included PDA diagnosed in childhood, without intervention or regular follow-up. On admission, physical examination revealed signs of acute heart failure, including tachypnea, jugular venous distension, pulmonary congestion, and marked peripheral edema. Cardiac auscultation demonstrated a prominent second heart sound and systolic murmurs consistent with mitral and tricuspid regurgitation, and a characteristic continuous, ""machinery"" murmur suggestive of PDA. Electrocardiography showed sinus rhythm with frequent atrial and ventricular premature beats, poor R-wave progression in the precordial leads, and nonspecific ST-T abnormalities in the limb leads. Chest radiography demonstrated cardiomegaly, pulmonary vascular congestion, alveolar edema, and bilateral pleural effusions. Laboratory evaluation revealed elevated natriuretic peptide levels and mildly increased high-sensitivity cardiac troponin I, consistent with the setting of acute heart failure. Transthoracic echocardiography revealed dilation of all four chambers and severe biventricular systolic dysfunction, with an LVEF of 25%, mild mitral and tricuspid insufficiency, and increased systolic pressure in the pulmonary artery. A moderate left-to-right shunt was found. Evaluation by coronary angiography ruled out obstructive coronary artery disease. Further assessment with cardiac magnetic resonance imaging demonstrated a persistent communication between the aortic isthmus and the main pulmonary artery, confirming PDA. A diagnosis of acquired dilated cardiomyopathy secondary to long-standing left-to-right shunt, likely precipitated by frequent atrial and ventricular arrhythmias, was established. Although the patient was a candidate for transcatheter percutaneous ductal closure, he declined any intervention, and optimized guideline-directed medical therapy was initiated. This case represents an exceptionally rare presentation of PDA in adulthood and highlights the importance of lifelong medical surveillance in patients with congenital heart defects."

Seventeen patients with degenerative MR and AF undergoing were studied. Thirteen age-matched patients with lone AF provided a control group. Epicardial electrograms were constructed noninvasively with ECGI using 256 body surface electrocardiograms and patient-specific heart-torso geometry from delayed-enhancement magnetic resonance imaging (DE-MRI) or computed tomography (CT) scans. Bi-atrial epicardial activation time maps and phase maps were generated. AF drivers were classified as focal (radial activation) or rotors (high curvature wavefront rotating about a center). Left atrial (LA) fibrosis was quantified from the DE-MRI scans in 5 MR patients.
The LA and right atrium (RA) harbored 61% and 36% of drivers, respectively and the anterior inter-atrial groove had 3% of the sources. 51% of the drivers were mapped in the posterior LA. One third of drivers occurred repeatedly. The left PV and LA appendage regions had the most repetitive drivers. Activation patterns varied from single macro-reentry to simultaneous wavelets resulting in wave breaks and collisions. Driver distribution and activation patterns remained similar between MR and lone AF groups, except stable rotors were not observed in MR. DE-MRI maps showed bi-atrial fibrosis. Drivers and discontinuous wavefront propagation were often localized in fibrotic regions.
AF activation patterns in MR were complex and exhibited spatio-temporal variability. Bi-atrial drivers were present. The posterior LA harbored the highest percentage of drivers. This region also exhibited fibrosis in a subset of patients, suggesting that it may play a role in creating the AF substrate."

The objective of the study was to investigate procedure-related changes in eGFR and clinical outcomes following mTEER.
We studied patients in the Transcatheter Valve Therapy registry undergoing mTEER between 2013 and 2022 with available baseline and discharge eGFR. Multivariable linear regression identified baseline characteristics associated with changes in eGFR following mTEER. Cox proportional hazards models examined the adjusted association between improved (≥10% increase in eGFR), unchanged, and worsened renal function (≥10% decrease in eGFR) and survival at 1 year.
Among 48,472 patients undergoing mTEER, 15.7% experienced improved renal function and 13.7% had worsened renal function. Cardiogenic shock within 24 hours, age >80, Black race, diabetes, heart failure within 2 weeks, and female sex were strongly associated with worsened renal function after mTEER. Compared to the group with no change in renal function, improved renal function was associated with a decreased risk of 1-year mortality (adjusted hazard ratio: 0.77; 95% CI 0.69-0.86, p < 0.001), whereas worsened renal function was associated with an increased risk of death at 1 year (adjusted hazard ratio: 2.85; 95% CI 2.64-3.08, p < 0.001).
Approximately 30% of patients experience marked changes in renal function following mTEER.A greater than 10% increase or decrease in eGFR is independently associated with differences in 1-year survival.

Current AI-enabled tools rely on murmur detection as a proxy for VHD but lack sensitivity for common subtypes like mitral regurgitation and are limited by small datasets. This study presents a novel neural network that directly predicts clinically significant VHD from stethoscope recordings, trained using echocardiographic targets rather than heart murmur labels. A diverse dataset of 1767 patients across UK primary care and hospital settings was developed, combining stethoscope recordings with echocardiographic labels. The trained recurrent neural network achieved an AUROC of 0.83, outperforming general practitioners and demonstrating exceptional sensitivity for severe aortic stenosis (98%) and severe mitral regurgitation (94%). This algorithm shows promise as a scalable, low-cost screening tool, enabling earlier diagnosis and timely referral for intervention.

While traditional approaches have addressed these components in isolation, this review summarizes the mechanisms and clinical evidence of a 'whole-heart electro-mechanical optimization' approach for the treatment of bradycardia.
Accelerated atrial pacing can lower left-sided filling pressures and improve symptoms in patients with heart failure with preserved ejection fraction and diastolic dysfunction. Bachmann bundle-area pacing restores physiological atrial activation, which not only improves diastolic filling and reduces atrial arrhythmia burden but also redefines the effective AV delay. AV-sequential pacing enables optimization of AV-coupling to enhance left ventricular filling by restoring appropriate timing between early ventricular filling and atrial contraction, and by reducing diastolic mitral regurgitation. Importantly, conduction system pacing, typically left bundle branch area pacing, preserves near-normal ventricular activation enabling the full hemodynamic benefits of the preceding interventions without pacing-induced dyssynchrony.
Together, these complementary and interdependent pacing strategies form an integrated 'whole-heart electro-mechanical optimization' approach aimed at integrative optimization of whole-heart pump function in selected patients."

This study aimed to correlate MAVIR with echocardiographic and clinical variables of myxomatous mitral valve disease (MMVD) severity in dogs.
Data from two centres were reviewed for healthy dogs and dogs with MMVD. The RF was calculated using Teichholz (RFTeichh) and Simpson (RFSMOD) methods. The correlation between MAVIR and echocardiographic indices and its difference across American College of Veterinary Internal Medicine and Mitral INsufficiency Echocardiographic (MINE) classes were assessed. A receiver operating characteristic curve analysis assessed MAVIR's ability to predict MMVD severity and RF.
A total of 1,109 examinations from 950 dogs were included in the present study. The MAVIR differed between healthy and MMVD at all American College of Veterinary Internal Medicine stages and MINE classes (P<0.001). It correlated with RFSMOD (Rho: 0.78, P<0.001) and RFTeichh (Rho: 0.83, P<0.001). The areas under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUCs) for discriminating mild from moderate and moderate from severe-late stage according to the MINE score were AUCs = 0.709 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.673, 0.745) and 0.784 (95% CI: 0.731, 0.836), respectively; for predicting RFSMOD ≥ 50%, the AUC was 0.946 (95% CI: 0.926, 0.966), with a cutoff >1.27 (sensitivity 91.11%; specificity 84.15%).
Retrospective study design and negative RF values are the limitations of this study.
Although not clinically validated against a gold standard, the MAVIR is associated with MMVD severity. A MAVIR >1.27 predicts an RFSMOD ≥ 50%. Given its simplicity, MAVIR might represent a valuable tool for staging MMVD and warrants further investigation."

This retrospective propensity-score-matched analysis compared the outcomes of MI-MVr in obese patients (body mass index [BMI] ≥30 kg/m2), with those in individuals with normal body weight (BMI 19-25 kg/m2), focusing on overall survival.
In 501 analysed matched pairs, BMI ranged 30-60 kg/m2 in obese group and 19-24.9 kg/m2 in normal-BMI group. There were no baseline differences among matched cohorts, except for higher incidence of hypertension (78% vs 57%, P < .001) and hypercholesterolaemia (35% vs 28%, P = .02) in obese patients, and slightly worse renal function. All patients received MI-MVr through right lateral mini-thoracotomy. The median total operative time (by 11 minutes) and cardiopulmonary by-pass time (by 5 minutes) were longer in obese patients (P = .001), but the cross-clamp times did not differ. There were no intergroup differences in the early complication rates or hospitalization lengths. After a median follow-up of 9.3 years, the overall survival was similar. Actuarial survival at 15 years was 59% for obese patients and 57% for those with normal BMI (log-rank, P = .38). A multivariable model identified diabetes (HR [95% CI], 1.65 [1.26-2.16], P = .0003), chronic lung disease (1.81 [1.31-2.51], P = .0004), left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) <50% (2.28 [1.78-2.93], P ≤ .0001), and older age (1.08 [1.07-1.10], P ≤ .0001) as independent predictors of mortality.
Obesity alone does not influence the outcomes of MI-MVr, but diabetes, chronic lung disease, and impaired pump function do affect the overall survival."

There has been increased interest in the interventional management of TR after three recent clinical trials showing procedural safety and important quality of life gains. Interventional procedures require advanced imaging techniques for characterization of TR etiology, grade, as well as right heart anatomy and function. In this review, we describe the advantages and pitfalls of the main imaging modalities for TR assessment, namely echocardiography, cardiac magnetic resonance and cardiac computed tomography, including major parameters that require attention on the preoperative evaluation as well as recent imaging advances.

With rigorous imaging adjudication, real-world patient selection (mean age 78 years, 64% women, 95% AF), and pragmatic patient-centered endpoints, Tri-FR sets a benchmark for future studies. The trial highlights key challenges in imaging reproducibility, patient profiling, procedural timing, and residual TR grading, while its long-term follow-up will uniquely leverage both onsite reassessment and linkage to the French national health database (SNDS). Together with complementary RCTs and registries, Tri-FR reshapes the management paradigm for TR, emphasizing earlier referral, structured valve networks, and the need to balance repair versus replacement strategies. Still some data are missing for widespread adoption of transcatheter therapies. Recent ESC/EACTS guidelines IIa-A recommendation for T-TEER in severe isolated secondary TR is paving the way."

However, new clinical and pharmacological evidence have raised concern about their potential association with valvular heart disease (VHD), which may be mediated by inhibition of the serotonin transporter (SERT) and activation of the 5-hydroxytryptamine receptor 2B (5-HT2B receptor). Methods In this study, we utilized VigiBase, the World Health Organization's global pharmacovigilance database, to examine potential safety signals related to cardiac valvular incompetence among users of six SSRIs: sertraline, paroxetine, fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, citalopram, and escitalopram. Disproportionality analyses using Information Component (IC) statistics were performed, and complementary logistic regression analyses were used to identify risk factors. Results Disproportionality analyses identified significant safety signals for paroxetine and sertraline, particularly for pulmonary and tricuspid valve incompetence. Logistic regression analyses demonstrated that additional cardiac comorbidities and concomitant use of medications associated with serotonin dysregulation and valvopathy were independent risk factors for valvopathy. In the unadjusted analysis, the presence of additional cardiac comorbidities (OR 10.498, 95% CI 5.107-21.579; p < 0.0001) and concomitant use of medications associated with serotonin dysregulation and valvopathy (OR 1.956, 95% CI 1.025-3.732; p = 0.0419) were associated with increased odds of cardiac valvular incompetence. These associations remained significant in the adjusted model for cardiac comorbidities (OR 10.28, 95% CI 5.007-21.109; p < 0.0001) and concomitant medications (OR 2.011, 95% CI 1.055-3.833; p = 0.0337), indicating robustness of findings after covariate adjustment. Conclusions The present global pharmacovigilance analysis has revealed safety signals indicating a potential association between three SSRIs (paroxetine, sertraline, and fluoxetine) and cardiac valvular incompetence. Notably, paroxetine and sertraline demonstrated the strongest signal strength. Adjusted logistic regression analysis identified pre-existing cardiac comorbidities and concomitant medications for which there is evidence of serotonin dysregulation and valvopathy as independent predictors of valvopathy. Prospective cohort studies, mechanistic research, and real-world evidence are essential to substantiate these pharmacovigilance signals and to elucidate potential pathophysiological mechanisms."

This case series analyzed five neonates diagnosed with FPA and reviewed relevant literature. The diagnostic criteria for FPA included: (1) retrograde flow through the pulmonary valve during diastole; (2) significant tricuspid regurgitation with estimation of right ventricular pressure by tricuspid regurgitation peak velocity; (3) marked right heart enlargement; and (4) resolution of pulmonary valve obstruction with restoration of antegrade flow on follow-up echocardiography.
All five patients demonstrated recovery of forward flow across the pulmonary valve following individualized medical management. One neonate required surgical intervention due to progressive closure of the ductus arteriosus and foramen ovale. Ultimately, all five neonates were successfully discharged.
Prompt and accurate recognition of FPA is critical to prevent unnecessary surgical procedures, and tailored therapeutic strategies can promote reopening of the pulmonary valve, resulting in favorable clinical outcomes."

However, guidelines for imaging surveillance frequency are not well established among young children, particularly those diagnosed during infancy without hemodynamically significant associated congenital lesions.
The Mayo Clinic echocardiography database was retrospectively searched for infants (age <1 year) diagnosed with BAV from 2001-2019. We initially identified 307 patients and of these, 204 (66%) patients with BAV and concomitant significant CHD were excluded. Therefore, 103 (34%) patients with isolated BAV without critical valvulopathy and/or BAV with simple CHD (atrial septal defects, muscular ventricular septal defects, and/or patent ductus arteriosus) were included for further analysis.
Overall, 103 infants (68% male) with isolated BAV or BAV with simple CHD underwent their first echocardiogram at a median age of 8 days (IQR 2 - 84 days, range 0 - 349 days). A total of 92 (89%) subjects had at least one follow-up visit and most recent echocardiogram at a median age of 8.6 years (IQR 3.7 - 13.6 years) with a total clinical follow-up of 791 patient-years. BAV was present as an isolated lesion in 43% (44/103), while concomitant simple CHD was present in 57% (59/103) of infants. The most common indication for an echocardiogram was presence of a murmur (68%, 70/103). The first echocardiogram demonstrated aortic regurgitation (AR) in 4% (4/92) and aortic stenosis (AS) in 30% (28/92). A total of 10 aortic valve procedures were performed in 8 patients (9%); with AS (p<0.001) and ascending aortic Z-score ≥2 (p=0.006) on the index echocardiogram significantly associated with risk of aortic valve intervention. Among 61 infants without AS or AR on their first echocardiogram (61/92) none required any valvular intervention at a median follow-up age of 6.0 years (IQR 2.1 - 10.8 years). Among 28 infants who had AS (any degree) on their first echocardiogram, 8 (29%) required valvular intervention by a median age of 12.4 years (IQR 7.2 - 17.7 years) and all had at least moderate AS at the baseline echocardiogram. AS on the baseline echocardiogram was not only predictive of aortic valve intervention (p<0.001) but also progression of AR (p = 0.007), and ascending aorta dilation (p=0.0002) at last follow-up. Among 35 infants with aortopathy at their first echocardiogram, none required intervention on the aorta at a median age of 8.8 years (IQR 4.0-14.2 years). Overall, 4 patients died with no deaths related to cardiac disease.
Infants with normally functioning BAV without severe CHD did not develop significant valvulopathy or aortopathy over the first few years of life and required no interventions on the aortic valve or aorta. Conversely, those with more than mild AS or ascending aortic dilation at first echocardiogram incurred higher risk of valvular intervention, valvulopathy and aortopathy progression. Therefore, initial valve and aortic pathology should guide frequency of follow-up surveillance imaging."

Retinal fundus imaging has emerged as a non-invasive modality capable of capturing microvascular alterations that may serve as biomarkers for systemic cardiovascular dysfunction.
This review systematically examined literature published between 2015 and 2025 on the use of retinal fundus imaging for predicting structural heart diseases. Databases including PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science were searched using predefined keywords. Studies were evaluated according to disease focus, imaging modality, analytical methods, and diagnostic performance.
Findings highlight that deep learning and machine learning models applied to retinal fundus images have demonstrated promising accuracy in detecting and classifying CVDs. Convolutional neural networks achieved up to 91% AUC for CHD detection, while hybrid multimodal approaches improved sensitivity in AHD and valvular disease prediction. Cardiomyopathies were associated with vessel tortuosity and microhemorrhages, quantifiable through automated image analysis. Table 1 provides a statistical summary of performance across studies.
Emerging approaches, such as transformer-based models and adaptations of the Segment Anything Model (SAM) for medical imaging, offer potential for improving generalizability and interpretability. Challenges remain, including dataset imbalance, limited longitudinal validation, and the black-box nature of AI models.
Retinal imaging holds strong potential as a scalable, non-invasive tool for cardiovascular disease prediction. Integrating advanced AI architectures may enhance diagnostic accuracy and accelerate translation into clinical practice."

Experimental groups included 105 confirmed cases of heart disease in failure and a control group of 40 confirmed cases of heart disease not in failure. The program had an 87.04% sensitivity and an 80% specificity for radiographically concluding HF in dogs. Compared to true findings, the program had a 98% sensitivity in detecting an interstitial pattern, 100% sensitivity in detecting cardiomegaly, and 95% sensitivity in detecting a vascular pattern among other findings. In cats, the program had a 96% sensitivity in detecting an interstitial pattern, 96% sensitivity in detecting cardiomegaly, and 94% sensitivity in detecting a vascular pattern, among other findings. Despite this high sensitivity performance, the program only combines these findings to conclude HF with a sensitivity of 9.8% and specificity of 95%. The AI software had a similar success rate compared to radiologists in identifying the individual findings of HF in both species. This software has reached a level of sophistication to identify the different abnormalities as accurately as a large radiology group and also combine these findings and arrive at the radiographic conclusion of HF in dogs. The performance of this program in cats highlights the importance for veterinarians to utilize their medical knowledge to interpret the AI report like any other ancillary diagnostic test."

We performed a single-centre retrospective analysis of all patients who underwent surgery for SVAS between August 1974 and January 2025. The outcomes were analysed using survival and competing risk analysis, and risk factors were identified using Cox regression models.
A total of 75 patients were identified, 26 (35%) profited from the McGoon technique, 33 (44%) patients received a Doty repair, and 16 (21%) underwent Brom repair. Williams-Beuren syndrome was associated with 45 (60%) patients. Associated anomalies included pulmonary stenosis in 40 (53%) patients, aortic coarctation in 24 (32%), and abnormal coronary arteries in 14 (19%). Transplant-free survival at 15 years was 92%, and no difference was found between surgical techniques (P = .339). Abnormal coronary arteries were a risk factor for major adverse cardiac events (odds ratio 8.666, P = .011) and mortality (hazard ratio [HR] 4.285, P = .030). Cumulative incidence of reoperation at 15 years was 18%, with no difference between surgical techniques (P = .299). However, patients with pulmonary stenosis (HR 3.450, P = .020) had a higher risk of reoperation.
Survival after surgical repair of SVAS is over 90% at 15 years regardless of the surgical technique. Abnormal coronary arteries are responsible for higher operative mortality. Concomitant pulmonary artery stenosis is at a higher risk of reoperation, suggesting more severe arterial disease."

Diabetic cardiomyopathy (DbCM), defined as myocardial dysfunction occurring independently of coronary artery disease, hypertension, or significant valvular disease, is an important complication of T2DM and may progress to overt heart failure if undiagnosed. While well characterised in high-income settings, DbCM prevalence and distribution in LMICs remain poorly defined. This systematic review aims to estimate the pooled prevalence of DbCM among adults with T2DM in LMICs.
This protocol follows the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses Protocols (PRISMA-P) guidelines and the Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) Manual for Evidence Synthesis. A comprehensive search will be conducted in PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, Embase, AJOL, and EBSCOhost, supplemented by regional databases and grey literature sources. Observational studies conducted in LMICs that report the prevalence of DbCM among adults with T2DM will be considered. DbCM must be diagnosed using objective cardiac imaging after exclusion of alternative causes of myocardial dysfunction. Two reviewers will independently screen, extract data, and assess risk of bias using a tool adapted for prevalence studies.
Where data are sufficiently comparable, pooled prevalence estimates will be calculated using random-effects meta-analysis. Prevalence proportions will be modelled using generalised linear mixed models with a logit link function to account for within- and between-study variability. Statistical heterogeneity will be assessed using the I2 statistic and explored through subgroup analyses by demographic, clinical, and regional characteristics. Where meta-analysis is not appropriate, findings will be synthesised using a structured narrative approach.
This review is expected to report pooled prevalence estimates of DbCM across LMICs and to describe regional variation. Differences in diagnostic approaches, glycaemic control, diabetes duration, age, sex, and geographical region are anticipated to contribute to heterogeneity and will be explored where data permit.
By synthesising available evidence on the prevalence of DbCM in LMICs, this review will clarify the burden of disease and provide evidence to inform health system planning and guide future research and prevention efforts aimed at reducing diabetes-related heart failure."

Methods: A total of 70 patients who underwent CMR examinations were enrolled from the UK Biobank database as the training set. A four-dimensional mesh model of the cardiac left and right ventricles was constructed using CMR images that passed quality control. Additionally, a validation set consisting of 30 patients who underwent CMR examinations at the First Medical Center of the Chinese People's Liberation Army General Hospital from March 2021 to October 2024 were included. These patients were classified into three groups based on clinical diagnosis: dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) group, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) group, and control group (no cardiomyopathy). The trained model was applied to analyze the CMR images of the validation set patients, calculating various cardiac structure and function parameters, including left ventricular volume index, left ventricular ejection fraction, left myocardial mass index, and strain. Differences in these parameters between the DCM or HCM groups and the control group were compared, and linear mixed models were used for statistical analysis of inter-group differences. Results: The age of patients in the training set was (62.2±10.3) years, with 58 (83%) males. The age of patients in the validation set was (56.5±13.9) years, with 21 (70%) males, including 8 patients in the HCM group, 9 in the DCM group, and 13 in the control group. The left ventricular ejection fraction in the DCM group was lower than that in the control group ((39.34±3.73) % vs. (53.56±2.98) %, P=0.006 3). The linear mixed model analysis showed that the left ventricular volume index and various strain parameters in the DCM group were significantly higher than those in the control group (all P<0.001). The left myocardial mass index in the HCM group was higher than that in the control group ((94.21±9.10) g/m² vs. (56.36±11.33) g/m², P<0.001). The analysis results of the linear mixed model were consistent with it (P<0.001). Conclusions: The preliminary results confirm that the four-dimensional cardiac mesh model based on CMR imaging constructed in this study could integrate and evaluate multiple parameters of cardiac structure and function in patients with cardiomyopathy. It has the potential to become an intelligent imaging diagnostic tool for cardiac diseases."

This was a cross-sectional study conducted using an on-site questionnaire.
In this cross-sectional study, we used convenience sampling to recruit participants from the outpatient department at a tertiary hospital in Shanghai, China, between July 2023 and December 2023.
Patients who had undergone TAVR for 2 years or more were included in the study.
The self-reported PA levels were assessed using the validated Chinese version of the International Physical Activity Questionnaire-Short Form. Additionally, medical records of the patients were thoroughly reviewed to accurately document the history of syncope for everyone.
Via convenience sampling, we recruited 179 consecutive participants aged 60 years and older who underwent TAVR. Only 36.31% (65/179) of patients remained physically active ≥2 years post-TAVR, with 27.37% having a syncope history. After adjusting for potential confounders, a history of syncope was independently associated with significantly lower levels of long-term PA (adjusted OR 0.287, 95% CI 0.122 to 0.675). This negative association was particularly pronounced among men and individuals with a normal body mass index (BMI).
A history of syncope is a strong independent predictor of reduced PA in the long term after TAVR. These findings highlight that patients with a history of syncope, especially men and those with normal BMI, represent a high-risk subgroup warranting particular attention in post-TAVR care. Targeted assessment and rehabilitation strategies should be considered for this population, and further research is needed to elucidate the underlying mechanisms."

This study aims to perform a comparative performance analysis of two next-generation deep learning architectures, YOLOv11 and YOLOv12, for the automated detection of 13 different dental conditions. A hybrid dataset consisting of 2,297 panoramic radiographs was compiled, comprising 1,579 images from a single institution and 718 external images from Roboflow Universe to test generalization. The models were trained to detect conditions including caries, implants, bone loss, and impactions using a standardized training protocol. Performance was evaluated using mean Average Precision (mAP@0.5), Precision, Recall, and F1-score on both internal and external test sets. YOLOv11 demonstrated superior performance compared to YOLOv12, achieving a mAP@0.5 of 0.857 on the internal test set. Furthermore, YOLOv11 exhibited robust generalization capabilities, maintaining a mAP@0.5 of 0.806 on the unseen external dataset. While detection rates were high for well-defined objects like crowns and implants, performance was lower for subtle pathologies such as bone loss and caries. The findings identify YOLOv11 as the more robust and reliable architecture for multi-class dental object detection compared to the newer YOLOv12. The proposed model holds significant potential as a clinical decision support tool, serving as a reliable ""second opinion"" to enhance diagnostic accuracy and efficiency in daily practice."

However, allosteric modulation has emerged as a promising and innovative strategy in the realm of GPCR drug discovery1. Here, drawing inspiration from the natural regulation of GPCRs by transmembrane proteins, we have developed GPCR exoframe modulators (GEMs), de novo designed proteins that specifically target the transmembrane domain of GPCRs. Utilizing a hallucination-like design approach, we crafted GEMs with three strategic structural prompts to achieve the desired binding modes. We selected the dopamine D1 receptor as a prototypical model and systematically investigated four GEMs. Structural studies and functional assays revealed that these GEMs bind to the transmembrane domains and function as diverse allosteric modulators, including agonist-positive allosteric modulator, negative allosteric modulator and biased allosteric modulator. The ago-PAM GEM restores the activity of various D1 receptor loss-of-function mutants, suggesting a promising therapeutic target for GPCR-related disorders. Our work introduces GEMs that target the transmembrane domain as potent agents for allosteric GPCR modulation and highlights the potential of deep learning-based approaches in the design of function-oriented membrane proteins."

PubMed,deep learning,A method for compiling satellite image map geographic objects based on vector map data via deep learning.,Jiawei Du; Dexian Zeng; Kaijun Cai; Yiyang Qiu,10.1038/s41598-026-39096-0,2026-02-16,Scientific reports,"Map compilation is a fundamental component of cartography. Apart from vector maps, satellite image maps also require compilation for specific purposes, such as enhancing visual clarity, concealing sensitive information, and ensuring consistency with corresponding vector representations. This paper proposes an automated method for satellite image map compilation based on deep learning and guided by vector map data, which consists of several key steps. First, scale-matched vector maps and satellite image maps are aligned and partitioned to generate training samples in the form of paired vector tiles and satellite image patches. Second, a base satellite image generation model with an encoder-decoder-type deep learning architecture is constructed and trained on these sample pairs to learn the mapping from vector data to realistic satellite imagery. Third, geographic objects designated for compilation are identified, and transfer learning is performed to fine-tune the base model, which improves its sensitivity to regions requiring modification. Subsequently, specific compilation operations-deletion, insertion, distortion, and displacement-are defined; corresponding vector features are then edited using analogous transformations before being input into the trained model to generate updated satellite images reflecting the intended changes. The proposed method enables both selective and operation-diverse compilation of geographic objects in satellite image maps. Experiments conducted using real-world datasets verify the capability of the proposed method to compile linear and polygonal geographic objects through various operations."

We propose a Hybrid Quantum-Classical Training Framework (HQC-TF) based on the Quantum Parameter Generation (QPG) technique to reduce trainable parameters while preserving model structure and adaptively determining parameter matrices' ranks during training. This retains representational flexibility with parameter efficiency. HQC-TF uses independent Variational Quantum Circuits (VQCs) per channel, preserving channel independence and applying flexibly to deep neural network training. Experiments showed it significantly improved segmentation with fewer parameters compared to the classical training framework: UNetPP gained 6.77% IoU and 3.09% DSC for kidney tumors.

Most existing P300 speller BCIs require users to spell all or the first few initial letters of the intended word, letter by letter. Consequently, a large number of keystrokes could be required to write an intended sentence, thereby, increasing user's time and cognitive load. There is a need for more efficient and user-friendly methods for faster, and practical sentence composition. In this work, we introduce ChatBCI, a P300 speller BCI that leverages the zero-shot learning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) to suggest words from user-spelled initial letters or predict the subsequent word(s), reducing keystrokes and accelerating sentence composition. ChatBCI retrieves word suggestions through remote queries to the GPT-3.5 API. A modified GUI, displaying GPT-3.5 word suggestions as extra keys is designed. Stepwise linear discriminant analysis (SWLDA) is used for the P300 classification. Seven subjects completed two online spelling tasks: 1) copy-spelling a self-composed sentence using ChatBCI, and 2) improvising a sentence using ChatBCI's word suggestions. Results demonstrate that for the copy-spelling task, on average, ChatBCI outperforms letter-by-letter BCI spellers, reducing time and keystrokes by [Formula: see text] and [Formula: see text], respectively, and increasing information transfer rate by [Formula: see text]. For the improvised sessions, ChatBCI achieves [Formula: see text] keystroke savings across subjects. Overall, ChatBCI, by employing remote LLM queries outperforms traditional spellers without requiring local model training or storage. ChatBCI's (multi-)word prediction capability paves the way for developing next-generation speller BCIs that are efficient and effective for real-time communication, specially for users with communication and motor disabilities."

Mechanistically, the MnO2 nanosheets initially quench the GOX fluorescence via Förster Resonance Energy Transfer (FRET). In the presence of glucose, the enzymatically generated H2O2 reduces MnO2 to Mn2+, triggering simultaneous color fading and fluorescence recovery. The solution-based sensor exhibited a linear response from 0.005 to 10 mM with a detection limit (LOD) of 2.9 μM.

Although electronic health records contain abundant phenotypic information, much of it is unstructured. Early automated phenotyping methods are rule-based, limiting their ability to capture semantic variability and contextual information. Recent deep learning approaches, including BERT-based models and large language models (LLMs), improve semantic understanding but still face key limitations. BERT-based methods are constrained by limited context windows, requiring text chunking and aggregation for long clinical narratives, while LLMs that directly generate Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) identifiers may produce non-existent identifiers. To address these challenges, we propose LEAP (LLM-Enhanced Automated Phenotyping), a two-stage framework that integrates an LLM for free-text phenotype extraction with a sentence-transformer model fine-tuned on a large-scale dataset of 5,330,557 instances for HPO mapping.

End-to-end deep learning models address this by considering MRI signal intensities. However, their explainability components typically focus on attention regions, neglecting underlying patterns. This work overcomes both problems by training and explaining time-to-event models utilizing Radiomics features. SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) and high-level explanations were combined to interpret the effects of MRI texture, shape, and volumes, as well as neuro-psychological and cognitive tests, and socio-demographic features on the AD risk score. All models were trained and internally validated on the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) dataset. External validation was performed on the Australian Imaging Biomarkers and Lifestyle flagship study of Ageing (AIBL) and the Open Access Series of Imaging Studies version 3 (OASIS-3). The results demonstrate that Radiomics features add value to models trained on cognitive tests, socio-demographics, genetics, and MRI volumes, particularly for long-term AD predictions. On average, the Radiomics-based models slightly outperformed the comparison models by between 0.11% points and 3.02% points in terms of Brier scores for the eight-year prediction. Despite varying data distributions during external validation, the models demonstrate moderate to high reproducibility. The analysis of Radiomics features uncovered complex associations with AD, including tissue with complex texture in the left entorhinal cortex, an irregular shape of the right amygdala, and a fine-granular texture of the left middle temporal gyrus. All models showed reasonable concordance with the Voxel-Based Morphometry (VBM)."

The limitations of traditional identification methods-such as ear tags, markings, and Radio Frequency Identification (RFID)-have accelerated the adoption of image-based biometric approaches. In recent years, deep learning-based facial identification systems have emerged as a prominent alternative in modern livestock management due to their contactless, fast, and user-friendly nature. Despite these advances, studies focusing specifically on individual sheep identification remain limited, and systematic comparisons of modern architectures and ensemble strategies are still scarce. To address this gap, this study reconstructs an existing dataset for individual sheep identification and systematically evaluates state-of-the-art deep learning architectures and ensemble approaches.
A dataset originally developed for breed classification was reconstructed for individual sheep face identification. After data cleaning, the dataset comprised 1,680 facial images from 172 unique sheep. To increase data diversity, comprehensive augmentation strategies were applied, expanding the dataset to 14,810 images. Sixteen deep learning architectures-including EfficientNet (B0, B1, B2, B3, B5), DenseNet (121, 169, 201), MobileNet (V2, V3-Small, V3-Large), ResNet50, InceptionV3, NASNetMobile, Xception, and VGG16-were evaluated under both baseline and fine-tuned configurations. Based on the fine-tuned results, the three highest-performing models were selected to develop three ensemble approaches, namely Soft Ensemble, Weighted Ensemble, and Stacked Ensemble. In addition, a user-friendly graphical user interface (GUI) was implemented to support practical sheep identification from user-uploaded images.
Under baseline configurations, EfficientNetB1, EfficientNetB2, and DenseNet201 achieved identification accuracies of 85.0%, 84.5%, and 87.7%, respectively. After fine-tuning, substantial performance improvements were observed, with accuracies increasing to 91.3% for EfficientNetB1, 91.0% for EfficientNetB2, and 90.7% for DenseNet201. Using these fine-tuned models, ensemble strategies further enhanced identification performance. The Soft Ensemble achieved an accuracy of 92.4%, the Weighted Ensemble reached 92.6%, and the Stacked Ensemble achieved the highest accuracy of 93.7%. The developed GUI enabled fast and intuitive verification of user-uploaded face images, supporting real-time on-farm identification workflows.
This study provides a comprehensive evaluation of modern deep learning architectures for individual sheep face identification and demonstrates that fine-tuning significantly improves model performance. Furthermore, the proposed Stacked Ensemble approach achieves the highest and most balanced identification performance among all evaluated methods. The results confirm that facial biometrics, supported by ensemble-driven deep learning and a practical GUI, offer a reliable and scalable solution for livestock identification. Future work will focus on expanding the dataset, improving robustness across diverse farm environments, and optimizing the framework for real-time deployment on resource-constrained edge devices."

They are among the most common causes of non-dental orofacial pain and functional impairment, significantly affecting quality of life. Despite advances in assessment and the development of standardized diagnostic systems such as the Research Diagnostic Criteria (RDC/TMD) and Diagnostic Criteria for Temporomandibular Disorders (DC/TMD), accurate diagnosis remains difficult due to the multifactorial nature of TMDs, variability in symptoms, and subjectivity in pain reporting. Diagnostic accuracy is further limited by interexaminer variability, symptom overlap with other orofacial pain conditions, and restricted access to advanced imaging techniques. Artificial intelligence (AI) has emerged as a promising approach to address these challenges. Machine learning and deep learning algorithms can process complex imaging, clinical, and psychosocial data to improve diagnostic accuracy, consistency, and efficiency. AI-assisted imaging has shown strong performance in detecting disc displacement, degenerative changes, and other TMJ abnormalities, while predictive models based on symptoms, wearable sensors, and AI-driven decision-support tools are broadening diagnostic capabilities. This review summarizes current challenges in TMD diagnosis and highlights the growing role of AI in this field. Integrating AI technologies with established frameworks such as the DC/TMD may enable more objective, data-driven, and personalized diagnostic approaches. Ongoing interdisciplinary research, clinical validation, and ethical implementation are crucial for realizing AI's potential to transform TMD diagnosis and enhance patient outcomes."

Single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) provides valuable 3D functional imaging of ventilation and perfusion, but is limited by low spatial resolution, availability, additional radiation, and cost. Alternative methods, including CT-based perfusion (CT-P) and deep learning models, require large datasets to validate results that are often scarce. Pulmonary function tests (PFTs) offer rapid and noninvasive global lung function measures and are clinically widely used. While ventilation correlates well with PFTs, perfusion imaging presents challenges due to complex blood flow and difficulty summarizing 3D data into one value. Additionally, commonly employed percentile scaling removes absolute quantitative information, complicating interpretation. &#xD;Approach: We propose a framework leveraging lung discretizations based on Voronoi diagrams to capture local spatial information from raw-valued and percentile-scaled perfusion maps (SPECT and CT-P). We compute hierarchical descriptive statistics at 3 levels (intra-subvolume, inter-subvolume, left-right lungs) to derive one global value per patient. &#xD;Main results: Across PFT measures of DLCO, FEV1, and FEV1/FVC, we find that discretizing perfusion maps into Voronoi subvolumes always yields stronger Spearman correlations than not discretizing. Specifically, our approach demonstrates strong correlations of 0.636 ≤ ρ ≤ 0.843 (P < 0.005) for raw-valued (SPECT and CT-P) maps, 0.590 ≤ ρ ≤ 0.789 (P < 0.005) for percentile-scaled maps, and reliably distinguishes normal from abnormal lung function via logistic regression analysis (0.865 ≤ AUC ≤ 0.937 for raw-valued maps, 0.877 ≤ AUC ≤ 0.933 for percentile-scaled maps). &#xD;Significance: This framework bridges regional perfusion imaging and global pulmonary function assessment, enabling meaningful quantitative comparisons between SPECT and CT-based perfusion maps. By preserving local spatial variability, the method offers a noninvasive tool for integrating imaging and physiological data, paving the way toward broader clinical and AI-driven applications in lung function evaluation."

Deep learning can segment complex ultrasound anatomy, but its application to SGB has not been systematically assessed. We developed and validated a multilevel feature fusion UNet (MLF-UNet) to automatically delineate the SGB region on ultrasound, aiming to support accurate needle placement and improve procedural safety.
In this retrospective study, 370 patients who underwent ultrasound-guided SGB between March 1, 2023 and January 16, 2025 were included. Three expert anesthesiologists jointly annotated 730 videos (2190 images) to produce ground truth. Data were split 9:1 by patient into development and heldout test sets. MLF-UNet was trained and compared with 5 benchmark models using identical pipelines. Test-set performance was evaluated with Dice similarity coefficient (DSC), Intersection over Union (IoU), 95th percentile Hausdorff distance (95HD), and average symmetric surface distance (ASSD). Three blinded experts rated model outputs (0-2 scale) for topological integrity, boundary precision, and background accuracy. For clinical validation and human-machine comparison, 3 additional experts and 3 nonexperts independently delineated SGB regions on the test set; spatial agreement was visualized with heat maps and assessed by Bland-Altman analysis. Metrics (DSC, IoU, 95HD, and ASSD) were compared among MLF-UNet, experts, and nonexperts.
MLF-UNet achieved the best test performance: DSC 0.856 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.846-0.865), IoU 0.754 (95% CI, 0.740-0.768), 95HD 3.98 mm (95% CI, 3.44-4.52 mm), and ASSD 1.08 mm (95% CI, 0.99-1.18 mm). Expert ratings favored MLF-UNet over all benchmark models for topological integrity (all P < .001), boundary precision (all P < .001), background accuracy (P < .01 or P < .001), and total score (all P < .001). Bland-Altman analysis showed a mean segmentation area difference between MLF-UNet and ground truth of -38.1 mm² (limits of agreement -278 to +202 mm²). MLF-UNet outperformed the nonexpert group on region overlap (DSC, IoU; both P < .001) and boundary precision (95HD, ASSD; both P < .001). Compared with experts, MLF-UNet showed no significant difference in overlap (DSC P = .332; IoU P = .125) but had slightly larger boundary precision (95HD and ASSD: both P < .001).

Although U-Net variants with popular encoder backbones are widely used, the coupled effects of encoder selection, training duration, and computational cost, as well as comparisons against volumetric architectures such as V-Net, remain insufficiently standardized.
We propose a unified benchmarking framework that evaluates a family of multi-encoder 2D U-Net models together with an optional 3D V-Net baseline under the same preprocessing, input construction, and 3-fold cross-validation protocol on LiTS17. Multiple backbones (VGG16/VGG19/ResNet34/ResNet50/ResNet101/MobileNetV2) are assessed under 15/50/100-epoch schedules, and performance is reported using overlap and detection metrics (Dice, IoU, precision, recall) alongside efficiency indicators (training time and model complexity when available) to characterize the accuracy-efficiency trade-off.
Results show liver segmentation rapidly reaches near-ceiling performance across models, while tumor segmentation benefits markedly from longer training and stronger encoders, especially for small or low-contrast lesions.
Overall, the study provides a reproducible protocol and practical guidance for selecting segmentation models that balance accuracy, robustness, and deployment cost."

Endovascular stents typically consist of a metal framework and a flexible membrane graft designed to reopen obstructed aortic segments and maintain blood flow through the true lumen. Consequently, stents are widely used to treat aortic expansion diseases and aortic occlusive stenosis. However, traditional stents have limitations in terms of adaptability to complex anatomical structures, long-term durability, biomechanical stability, and reliance on radial support force for fixation, lacking active fixation mechanisms. These shortcomings remain the primary causes of postoperative complications, significantly impacting the quality of life for patients with aortic dissection.                                                           Methods:                     The research status of the endovascular stent was discussed in depth, and the main factors for the optimal design of the stent (geometry, pattern configuration, additional fixtures, and optimization methods) were analyzed and summarized according to the complications targeted by the repair device.                                                           Results:                     The composition structure, working principle, and development status of the stent grafts under review are elaborated in detail. Stent grafts attempt to alleviate postoperative complications through three approaches: enhancing the flexibility of the stent framework, improving the fit between the vessel wall and the stent, and reducing vascular injury. Blood flow guiding channels are established to alleviate the obstruction of branch blood flow. Additional self-anchoring devices are added to adapt to the dynamic remodeling of blood vessels.                                                           Discussion:                     The effects of various factors, including geometric parameters, structural design, and parameter optimization techniques, on the optimization of stent primary mechanical performance are discussed. The current research status of functional improvement methods for stents is also summarized.                                                           Conclusion:                     Refining the quantitative relationship between stent structural parameters and mechanical performance, as well as exploring the balance criteria between flexibility and radial support force, represent promising directions for future development. These objectives necessitate further in-depth analysis and research."

Recent evidence suggests that subvalvular apparatus preservation might enhance postoperative recovery in high-risk populations. Methods: This prospective observational investigation (Hue Central Hospital, March 2015–September 2016) evaluated 87 patients undergoing mechanical mitral valve replacement with posterior leaflet preservation. Participants were stratified into two groups: reduced ejection fraction (EF ≤ 50%, n = 38) and preserved EF (&gt;50%, n = 49). Comprehensive clinical and echocardiographic assessments were conducted at 1, 3, 6, and 12 months postoperatively. Statistical analysis employed parametric and non-parametric methodologies, with survival analyzed via Kaplan–Meier techniques. Results: The reduced EF cohort demonstrated significant improvement in contractile performance from 48.8 ± 5.2% preoperatively to 61.6 ± 7.2% at 12 months (p &lt; 0.05). Ventricular dimensions decreased notably from 59.2 ± 6.6 mm to 47.6 ± 4.0 mm (p &lt; 0.05). Hospital mortality was 2.3% (2 patients). Twelve-month survival rates reached 94.66% and 97.96% for reduced and preserved EF groups, respectively, without significant inter-group differences (p = 0.42). All surviving participants achieved functional status in NYHA class I or II. Conclusions: Mechanical mitral valve replacement with posterior leaflet preservation represents an effective approach for patients with reduced ventricular performance, promoting substantial improvement in cardiac function and excellent clinical outcomes."

J. van ‘t Hof; Pieter A. Vriesendorp,10.3390/jcm15041495,2026-02-14,Journal of Clinical Medicine,"Background: Mitral valve regurgitation (MR) is associated with an impaired prognosis. Due to its frequently asymptomatic presentation, MR often leads to undertreatment, which can delay diagnosis. In addition, the optimal timing and choice of intervention remain unclear. The Significant Mitral Insufficiency Limburg Evaluation (SMILE) registry aims to provide a comprehensive real-world characterisation of patients with moderate-to-severe mitral regurgitation. Methods and Results: The SMILE registry is a multicentre prospective registry initiated in 2020, enrolling all consecutive patients with moderate-to-severe MR from all hospitals in Limburg, the Netherlands. Treatment approaches include surgical, catheter-based, and conservative (medical) options, with decision-making from an expert multidisciplinary team. Data are collected via Castor EDC, ensuring compliance with the General Data Protection Regulation using pseudonymisation. The co-primary endpoints are all-cause mortality and heart failure hospitalisations during the five-year follow-up. Secondary objectives include describing management strategies, characterising disease progression and cardiac remodelling, evaluating associations between baseline clinical and echocardiographic characteristics and long-term outcomes, identifying predictors of treatment success, and assessing longitudinal changes in health-related quality of life. Conclusions: The SMILE registry represents an important step towards improving MR management. Its broad data collection, including conservative care and patient-reported outcomes, provides valuable real-world insights beyond procedure-focused studies. The registry may refine intervention timing and personalise treatment strategies to enhance patient outcomes and improve their quality of life."

With a focus on the prevalent psychological complications following the onset of this condition, this study aimed to explore the correlation between antenatal depression and Corona disease anxiety, personality traits, and postpartum depression during the COVID-19 pandemic.                                                           Materials and Methods:                     This cross-sectional descriptive-analytical study investigated women receiving care at health centers affiliated with Kerman University of Medical Sciences during the last month of their pregnancy and the postpartum period in 2022. Following the acquisition of informed consent, participants were assessed using various measures, including demographic and obstetric information, the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale, the Corona Disease Anxiety Scale (CDAS), and the NEO Personality Inventory-Revised during their third trimester of pregnancy. The same group of participants completed the Edinburgh Depression Scale and the Corona Disease Anxiety Scale (CDAS) 4-6 weeks after childbirth.                                                           Results and Discussion:                     There was a significant correlation between family income, unwanted pregnancy as perceived by both the mother and father, and antenatal depression. Additionally, marital satisfaction played a significant role in postpartum depression. Furthermore, antenatal depression was significantly associated with neuroticism, agreeableness, and physical symptoms related to Corona disease anxiety. Personality traits, with the exception of extroversion and conscientiousness, and various domains of Corona disease anxiety, excluding psychological symptoms, were also significantly associated with postpartum depression.                                                           Conclusion:                     During pandemics or epidemics, such as the COVID-19 outbreak, experiencing mental distress during pregnancy can contribute to mental health issues during the postpartum period. This risk is particularly true in individuals with unique personality traits, emphasizing the need for increased focus on mental health within prenatal care during these crises."

Method:                     This cross-sectional study was conducted in Kerman, Iran. Data were collected from patients who visited Afzalipour Hospital in Kerman more than twice during the COVID-19 epidemic from the end of February 2020 to March 21, 2021. We conducted two key analyses: 1. Mixed effect logistic regression was used to check the relationship between the variables and COVID-19 severity. 2. Mixed effect linear regression was used to check the relationship between the variables and the length of stay in the hospital.                                                           Results:                     The findings indicated that the most important risk factors for the severity of COVID-19 were heart diseases (OR=1.67,95%CI:1.20-2.30), increasing age (OR=2.23 for age&gt;54, 95%CI:1.70- 2.90), male gender (OR=1.47,95%CI:1.10-1.96), respiratory diseases other than asthma, and frequency of admission (OR=1.60,95%CI:1.20-2.15). All patients who underwent readmission experienced a shorter duration of hospitalization during their subsequent admission (OR=0.94,95%CI:0.91,0.96) and had a higher mortality rate (30% within 14 days, 26.6% between 14-90 days). Patients readmitted at intervals of 14-90 days and greater than 90 days exhibited lower disease severity compared to those readmitted within the 0-14 day period.                                                           Conclusion:                     Examining readmissions, the severity of COVID-19, and the length of hospital stay in affected patients are important factors for planning and allocating resources for COVID-19 management and treatment. These factors can help policymakers develop effective clinical guidelines for hospitalization or outpatient treatment of COVID-19 patients and contribute to reducing the burden of disease in the community."

Kinovea, as an accessible motion-analysis software, provides both visual and quantitative feedback. However, its application in supporting technique development among beginner athletes remains insufficiently explored. Aim: This study aims to describe the use of Kinovea in biomechanics training and examine its contribution to the awareness of kinematic characteristics and movement techniques among beginner athletes. Methods: A descriptive qualitative design involved 72 beginner athletes aged 18–25 years selected through purposive sampling. Data were collected over 16 weeks through interviews, field observations, and motion video recordings analyzed using Kinovea. Kinematic data focused on joint angles, stride behavior, and movement phases during walking, running, and the flight phase. Qualitative data were analyzed using content analysis with NVivo 12, while kinematic results were interpreted descriptively to identify performance patterns and areas for technical refinement. Result: Kinematic analysis showed coordinated joint-angle patterns across all phases. Walking analysis identified arm swing angles of 50.9°–58.8° and leg separation angles of 64.3°–67.2°, indicating a stable gait rhythm. The running analysis revealed knee angles of 68.8°–69.8° and elbow angles of 87.6°–89.1°, indicating efficient propulsive mechanics. The flight phase demonstrated knee angles of 81.2°–87.8° and elbow angles of 80.4°–88.3°, suggesting effective momentum use and postural stability. These measurements supported stride-efficiency assessment and technique evaluation. Qualitative findings revealed that Kinovea enabled athletes to interpret movement phases and identify technical inefficiencies through slow-motion and frame-by-frame visualization. Conclusion: Kinovea supports basic motion analysis by providing clear kinematic information and helping beginner athletes observe and refine their movement techniques. The findings also offer practical value for coaches by enabling more precise identification of inefficient patterns and guiding targeted corrections during early-stage training."

OpenAlex,deep learning,Combating Data and Target Shifts in Visual Tasks,Zhaorui Tan,10.17638/03194353,2031-01-01,University of Liverpool,"The rapid advancement of deep learning models for visual tasks has led to significant progress in many domains. However, a key challenge remains: ensuring that models can generalize effectively to unseen samples or novel classes, especially in real-world scenarios where training data-target pairs are often limited or unavailable, and test data may exhibit shifts in both data and targets. This thesis addresses the problem of shifts across data and targets, proposing novel methods to improve model generalization and transferability in complex settings. The thesis identifies the different shift scenarios for visual tasks and presents their problem forms. The research first relaxes the static target distribution assumption in Multi-Domain Generalization (mDG) tasks, introducing the General Multi-Domain Generalization (GMDG) objective to improve generalization under varying data shifts. Specifically, Extensive experiments validate that GMDG is feasible for classification, segmentation, and regression tasks. Further considering extreme target distribution shifts where even unknown novel classes emerge, the study also explores logical regularization techniques for tasks such as Generalized Category Discovery (GCD), mDG+GCD, and Class Incremental Learning (CIL), proposing a sample-based logical regularization term (L-Reg) to enhance data-, target-, and all-shift generalization. Additionally, a partial logic framework is introduced to address challenges in CIL, enabling models to retain room for unknown classes during training. This is further extended by the Partial-Logic Regularization (PL-Reg), which improves generalization across GCD, mDG+GCD, and transferability for CIL tasks. Furthermore, the thesis proposes a novel Semantic-aware Data Augmentation (SADA) framework for cross-modality generalization in text-to-image synthesis (T2Isyn), text-image retrieval (TIR), and image-text retrieval (ITR) tasks. This framework ensures semantic preservation across text and image modalities, improving both semantic consistency and image quality in cross-modality tasks. The methods proposed in this thesis offer significant advancements in visual generalization and transfer scenarios, providing theoretical insights and practical solutions for handling data shifts, target shifts, and multi-modalities in complex scenarios. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of the proposed methods, demonstrating their superior performance across a range of tasks."
OpenAlex,deep learning,Antecedents and consequences of Green-tech FDI in emerging markets,Zhuoran Liu,10.17638/03195308,2031-01-01,University of Liverpool,"As environmental pressures intensify, attracting sustainable foreign direct investment (FDI), particularly green-tech FDI, has become a critical pathway for emerging markets to achieve environmental sustainability. However, existing research remains fragmented, offering limited insights into why green-tech FDI enters emerging markets and how it affects regional green innovation. This thesis addresses these gaps by systematically examining both the antecedents and consequences of green-tech FDI through three empirical studies using regional data from China. Study 1 and Study 2 focus on the antecedents of green-tech FDI. Study 1 examines how host-country conditions can attract green-tech FDI, highlighting the role of environmental management information disclosure (EMID) by domestic firms in reducing information gaps and strengthening green market–seeking motives. Study 2 shifts attention to the active decision-making of green-tech FDI, showing that under uncertainty, green-tech foreign investors engage in identity-based bandwagon learning by imitating peers with similar green identities, thereby mitigating investment risks. Study 3 turns to the consequences of green-tech FDI. It demonstrates that, due to the technological complexity of green innovation and limited absorptive capacity in emerging markets, green-tech FDI may generate crowding-out effects rather than purely positive spillovers. Adopting a network perspective, the study further finds that universities play a key moderating role: through broad linkages and deep collaborations, they help mitigate negative spillovers and facilitate the diffusion of green technologies. Together, the three studies advance the literature on sustainable FDI by differentiating green-tech FDI from general FDI and identifying the specific mechanisms that shape its entry decisions and local innovation outcomes. Practically, the findings provide guidance for emerging-market governments and firms on how to attract and manage sustainable investment, balance growth with environmental objectives, and strengthen local innovation ecosystems."
OpenAlex,deep learning,A UAV-Based Framework for Community-Scale Residential Building Energy Modelling in China,Mengfan Jin,10.17638/03195460,2029-01-01,University of Liverpool,"With increasing emphasis on energy efficiency and carbon emission reduction in the building sector, rapid and scalable energy modelling of existing buildings is critical for retrofit projects and policy development. Conventional surveys, data collection and energy modelling processes remain labour-intensive and impractical for large-scale applications, and energy modelling often dominates project time and cost. Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) equipped with high-resolution and infrared cameras now offer fast and safe exterior surveys, showing great potential in building energy assessments. Yet, a systematic framework for UAV integration, from image capture through processing to inputs for building energy simulation, has not been established. This research addresses these challenges by developing a structured framework for community-scale building energy modelling, which integrates UAV photogrammetry to accelerate data acquisition, reduce labour, and shorten energy modelling time for retrofit projects. The framework is designed to minimise prior data requirements while maximising automation and retaining sufficient accuracy and reliability. It also addressed systemic issues, such as the lack of data necessary to fully exploit the potential of available technologies in the context of this study. To achieve this research objective, a mixed-methodology approach, combining desk studies and fieldwork, was adopted. First, a comprehensive review of UAV-based building energy studies mapped the current applications and available tools, proposing a preliminary framework. Fieldwork then encompassed a pilot study and a detailed case study. In the pilot test, a single building was surveyed to identify an optimal toolchain for flight planning, image capture, photogrammetric reconstruction, model generation, and selection of a simulation platform. The resulting refined framework was applied to a case study of a 39-building community, and it was demonstrated that further automation was necessary. The potential for automation was then further explored. Geomatic algorithms, machine learning, and deep learning techniques were compared, and the combination that best balanced accuracy and processing time was selected for 3D model generation and window-to-wall ratio (WWR) extraction. In parallel, an archetype library of residential buildings in the Hot Summer Cold Winter (HSCW) zone in China was compiled to facilitate the assignment of thermal parameters. Finally, a reusable community-scale building energy modelling (CBEM) workflow was assembled in Grasshopper using Ladybug Tools components to process the aforementioned inputs. In conclusion, this study integrates UAV photogrammetry, GIS-based geomatic algorithms, machine learning, and graphical programming to develop an UAV-CBEM framework. The outcomes establish a foundation for scalable UAV-based building energy assessments, enhancing applicability in data-limited and large-scale settings worldwide."

OpenAlex,deep learning,Unsupervised Deep-learning Methods for Low-dose Computed Tomography Reconstruction,Ran An,10.17638/03194237,2027-01-01,University of Liverpool,"Computed tomography (CT) has become an indispensable imaging technique in medical diagnostics and industrial applications, owing to its non-invasive nature and high resolution in visualizing object internal structures. While X-ray CT (X-ray computed tomography) significantly enhances lesion detection capabilities, excessive exposure to X-ray radiation raises substantial health concerns, including elevated cancer risks and potential genetic damage. Although low-dose CT (LDCT) protocols reduce radiation safety concerns, they inevitably introduce severe noise and artifacts, which might compromise diagnostic accuracy. Recent advances in supervised deep learning approaches have demonstrated remarkable success in LDCT reconstruction. However, the reliance on paired training data severely limits their deployment in practical CT applications. This fundamental constraint highlights the critical importance of developing unsupervised reconstruction methods. Although existing unsupervised LDCT methods have made notable progress, they still face challenges requiring systematic solutions. This thesis makes three contributions to advance the field of unsupervised LDCT reconstruction: 1. Current dual-domain self-supervised LDCT denoising methods typically neglect the heterogeneity of the non-stationary Gaussian noise levels in low-dose sinograms and usually treat them as common images without appropriately controlling the denoising strength. The denoisers employed by them, which are based on classic convolutional neural networks (CNN), will lead to blurring artifacts in the reconstructed images if directly used for sinogram denoising. In addition, the denoising strength in the sinogram and image domains must be well-balanced to avoid introducing over-blurring or secondary artifacts in the reconstructed images, but existing approaches do not focus on this crucial point. To address these limitations, this thesis proposes a novel end-to-end dual-domain self-supervised framework for LDCT denoising. It employs Dropblock layers to adaptively localize the effect of convolution for sinogram denoising and sets a weighted average between the denoised sinograms and their noisy counterparts to better control the denoising strength, thus effectively reducing the blurring artifacts and leading to a well-balanced dual-domain denoising. Numerical experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and superior performance of the proposed method. 2. Existing normalizing flows (NFs)-based unsupervised LDCT reconstruction methods face challenges in both image quality and computational efficiency. On one hand, they typically utilize a two-way transformation strategy between noisy images and latent variables, which could easily lead to detail loss and secondary artifacts in the reconstructed images. On the other hand, training NFs on high-resolution CT images is computationally intensive. Although conditional normalizing flows (CNFs) can mitigate computational costs by learning conditional probabilities, existing approaches rely on labeled data for conditionalization, leaving unsupervised CNFs-based LDCT reconstruction a challenge. To tackle these issues, this thesis proposes a novel unsupervised LDCT iterative reconstruction algorithm based on CNFs. The proposed method employs a strict one-way transformation strategy during the alternating optimization in the dual spaces to prevent detail loss and secondary artifacts, and proposes a novel unsupervised conditionalization strategy for CNFs, thus achieving efficient training and inference on high-resolution images. The proposed method illustrates high-quality and relatively fast unsupervised reconstruction. Experiments across two datasets demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed method by rivaling several state-of-the-art methods. 3. Current diffusion model-based LDCT reconstruction methods solely employ the prior distributions learned from normal-dose CT data but neglect the valuable priors in low-dose data, which contain information about the characteristics of low-dose noise and artifacts. In addition, their reconstruction speed suffers from multiple sampling steps, presenting low efficiency. Breaking new ground in prior utilization, this thesis proposes a novel unsupervised LDCT iterative reconstruction algorithm based on dual denoising diffusion probabilistic models (DDPM), which leverages both normal-dose and low-dose priors. Specifically, the proposed method employs two DDPMs to learn the prior distributions from normal-dose and low-dose images, respectively, and incorporates them into a joint iterative reconstruction framework. To accelerate the reconstruction, partial diffusion sampling and single-pass deterministic reconstruction strategy are utilized in the proposed method, as well as the spaced OS-SART approaches. Experiments at different dose levels demonstrate the outstanding performance and fast speed of the proposed reconstruction algorithm. Through these innovations and contributions, this thesis addresses some significant challenges in current deep-learning-based unsupervised LDCT reconstruction methods, and proposes three novel unsupervised reconstruction algorithms. The proposed methods effectively improve the performance and efficiency of LDCT reconstruction under different unsupervised learning conditions, and provide some new perspectives and inspirations for future research."
OpenAlex,deep learning,From Sparse to Dense: Label-Efficient Weakly Supervised Segmentation for Images and Videos,Jian Wang,10.17638/03195330,2027-01-01,University of Liverpool,"Obtaining high-quality annotated data has become a primary bottleneck for training deep learning models, particularly for dense prediction tasks like semantic segmentation and video salient object segmentation. The demand for meticulous, pixel-level labeling makes fully-supervised approaches prohibitively expensive and limits their scalability. This thesis directly confronts this issue by proposing and systematically investigating a label-efficient ""sparse-to-dense'' paradigm. The core objective is to develop innovative frameworks that can learn from sparse, inexpensive weak supervision—such as image-level tags or scribbles—and intelligently propagate this minimal information to generate complete, pixel-accurate dense predictions. The major part of this thesis focuses on the ""sparse-to-dense'' challenge within Weakly Supervised Semantic Segmentation (WSSS) for images, where models learn from only image-level tags. Dominant approaches rely on Class Activation Maps (CAMs) as initial object seeds. However, CAMs inherently activate only the most discriminative object regions, leading to incomplete pseudo-labels. This gives rise to the central problem of activation densification: the critical process of expanding these sparse activations to cover the full extent of an object. Our research addresses this challenge through a progressive, multi-faceted strategy. Our exploration begins with a foundational framework (C3) designed to rectify the intrinsic flaws of initial CAMs. We propose a synergistic mutual calibration method. This method leverages the discrepancies between the two maps to generate local prototypes, which are simultaneously utilized to complete missing object parts and suppress background noise, yielding a significantly more accurate and complete initial seed. This foundational work immediately reveals the limitation of single-prototype instability and its inability to capture diverse features. Building on this foundation, we then develop architecture-specific strategies to address deeper limitations of the prototype-based approach. For Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) (C4), the use of a single prototype proves insufficient to capture significant intra-class variation. In response, we introduce an Optimal Transport (OT)-assisted framework that effectively mines multiple, diverse prototypes, thereby yielding more comprehensive activation maps. However, while C4 solves the intra-class diversity problem, the inherent local context constraint of the CNN architecture becomes the new bottleneck, fundamentally limiting the quality of globally-aware feature extraction needed for optimal multi-prototype assignment. This limitation necessitates a shift in architectural focus from CNNs to Vision Transformers. In the ViT architecture (C5), a new challenge arises where the token gap between the discriminative class token and varied patch tokens leads to incomplete activation. To bridge this gap, we leverage a tailored application of Optimal Transport, where the algorithm is tasked with learning a comprehensive proxy to ensure complete object activation. Despite these architectural advances (C3-C5), the overall WSSS performance hit a ceiling. This is fundamentally limited by the sparse supervision of class labels, which cannot provide precise boundary information. To break this ceiling, our WSSS exploration culminates in a universal enhancement strategy (C6) that transcends architecture-specific designs by leveraging Visual Foundation Models (VFMs). We resolve the conflict between the discriminative nature of initial CAMs and the VFM's need for holistic prompts. By modeling the CAM foreground as a graph and employing spectral analysis, our method intelligently selects a diverse set of prompt points that represent the overall structure of the foreground object. This guides the VFM to generate superior, boundary-aware supervision that can universally enhance any WSSS pipeline. Subsequently, the thesis extends the ""sparse-to-dense'' paradigm to the dynamic domain of video, addressing Weakly Supervised Video Salient Object Segmentation (WSVSOS) (C7) from sparse scribble annotations. In this specific context, the challenge evolves into spatio-temporal densification, which requires both full-object coverage within each frame and temporal consistency across the video sequences. To this end, we introduce the core CFMR framework, which utilizes Spatio-Temporal co-regulation. This framework is subsequently enhanced (CFMR+) by integrating the VFM guidance strategy from C6, which provides high-quality spatial priors essential for ensuring both high spatial detail and inter-frame consistency. By enforcing both intra-frame and cross-frame consistency between these two streams, our method effectively propagates the sparse initial signal to generate dense and temporally coherent saliency masks. In conclusion, this thesis presents a comprehensive and cohesive investigation into label-efficient segmentation tasks, offering a suite of innovative and effective strategies for the ""sparse-to-dense'' challenge. Our work establishes a progressive roadmap that systematically overcomes architectural and semantic limitations, culminating in highly robust and generalized densification pipelines. Our extensive experimental results on standard benchmarks validate the state-of-the-art performance of these methods, providing robust solutions to a long-standing problem in the computer vision field."

OpenAlex,deep learning,Diseño y construcción de un sistema predictivo de congestión de tráfico basado en aprendizaje automático,Zehan Li,,2026-07-17,UPM Digital Archive (Technical University of Madrid),"Resumen: Este proyecto desarrolla un sistema de predicción de la intensidad del tráfico urbano mediante técnicas de aprendizaje profundo, con el objetivo de mejorar la toma de decisiones de movilidad. A diferencia de otras plataformas centradas en la visualización del estado actual, la solución propuesta busca anticipar comportamientos futuros, y se plantea como una alternativa abierta, replicable y específicamente orientada a la predicción. Para lograrlo, se ha diseñado una arquitectura modular basada en el lenguaje Python, capaz de integrar múltiples fuentes de datos abiertos: registros históricos del tráfico, datos históricos de situación meteorológica, y coordenadas espaciales de los sensores de medición. El sistema aplica un proceso de limpieza, interpolación temporal y transformación de variables, incluyendo la codificación cíclica del tiempo y la conversión espacial a coordenadas UTM, lo que permite una fusión precisa entre datos geográficos y meteorológicos mediante técnicas como la ponderación por distancia inversa (IDW). El modelo predictivo se basa en una red neuronal LSTM, especialmente adaptada para secuencias temporales multivariables. Se entrena utilizando una estrategia de ventana deslizante a 32 muestras (7 horas y 45 minutos) para predecir la intensidad de tráfico en el siguiente intervalo. El sistema incorpora además mecanismo de IterableDataset para manejar grandes volúmenes de datos de entrenamiento sin comprometer la estabilidad del entorno. Los resultados obtenidos muestran una precisión robusta en escenarios de validación, con errores de predicción (MAE y RMSE) aceptable. Además, se ha desarrollado una interfaz web interactiva, que permite el despliegue local del sistema, con capacidad de ingestión de datos en tiempo real y visualización directa de las predicciones. Ente trabajo demuestra la viabilidad técnica y operativa de aplicar aprendizaje profundo al análisis de tráfico urbano, y sienta las bases para su evolución futura hacia sistemas más generalizables, robustos y útiles en contexto reales de ciudad inteligente. Abstract This Project develops an urban traffic intensity prediction system using deep learning techniques, with the aim of improving mobility decision-making. Unlike other platforms focused on visualizing the current state, the proposed solution seeks to anticipate future behaviors, and is positioned as an open, replicable alternative specifically oriented towards prediction. To achieve this, a modular architecture based on the Python language has been designed, capable of integrating multiple open data sources: historical traffic records, historical weather situation data, and spatial coordinates of measurement sensors. The system applies a process of cleaning, temporal interpolation, and variable transformation, including cyclic encoding of time and spatial conversion to UTM coordinates, allowing for precise fusion between geographical and meteorological data through techniques such as inverse distance weighting (IDW). The predictive model is based on an LSTM neural network, especially adapted for multivariate time sequences. It is trained using a sliding window strategy of 32 samples (7 hours and 45 minutes) to predict traffic intensity in the next interval. The system additionally incorporates an IterableDataset mechanism to handle large volumes of training data without compromising the stability of the environment. The obtained results show robust accuracy in validation scenarios, with acceptable prediction errors (MAE and RMSE). Furthermore, an interactive web interface has been developed, allowing for the local deployment of the system, with the capacity for real-time data ingestion and direct visualization of predictions. This work demonstrates the technical and operational feasibility of applying deep learning to urban traffic analysis and lays the groundwork for its future evolution towards more generalizable, robust, and useful systems in real smart city contexts."
OpenAlex,deep learning,Deep Learning-Based Data Hiding Technique for Medical Images,Hadjer SAIDI,,2026-06-26,University of Biskra Theses Repository (University of Biskra),"This thesis introduces novel deep learning-based frameworks for secure medical image steganography, addressing the critical challenge of protecting sensitive patient information while preserving diagnostic quality. Medical images present unique security requirements due to their dual nature: containing both critical visual data for diagnosis and sensitive patient metadata, which conventional steganographic techniques do not adequately address. Our work presents two complementary approaches to this challenge. First, we develop a Mask-RCNN based framework that intelligently identifies diagnostically insignificant regions within medical images for strategic data embedding. By combining this regionaware detection with Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) embedding in the frequency domain, our method achieves remarkable imperceptibility with Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR) values exceeding 115 dB while maintaining high payload capacity. Second, we propose a clinical quality-aware convolutional neural network architecture that leverages an encoder-decoder framework for end-to-end steganography. This approach employs parallel processing paths with scaled residual learning to embed secret medical images within cover images while preserving diagnostic features. Extensive experimentation across multiple medical imaging modalities (CT, MRI) from datasets including MIDRC-RICORD-1B, and IQ-OTH/NCCD, demonstrates that our method achieves a good trade-off between payload and imperceptibility. The frameworks developed in this thesis achieve an optimal balance between embedding capacity, imperceptibility, and robust secret recovery, providing healthcare institutions with effective tools for safeguarding patient privacy while maintaining the integrity of medical diagnostics. This work significantly advances the field of medical image security and establishes a foundation for future innovations in secure healthcare information systems."
OpenAlex,deep learning,A Novel Deep-Learning-Based Approach for Estimating High-Resolution InSAR Parameters,"Dell Amore, Luca; Carcereri, Daniel; Demir, Begüm; Rizzoli, Paola",,2026-06-01,elib (German Aerospace Center),"Nowadays, SAR Interferometry (InSAR) represents one of the most powerful tools to perform complex tasks, such as retrieving Earth’s surface topography and monitoring its deformations. However, denoising strategies are crucial for the generation of reliable and high-quality InSAR products. In this framework, we propose a complete and generalized theoretical and statistical model to physically describe and simulate a noise-free interferogram, together with its corresponding noisy version, starting from the knowledge of the InSAR acquisition geometry and of the underlying topography. A deep-learning-based model is then trained in a fully-supervised manner to estimate high-resolution InSAR parameters, i.e. coherence and interferometric phase, leveraging the proposed statistical model. In particular, an accurate assessment of the network’s estimation performance is conducted by comparing it to state-of-the-art denoising filters, such as Boxcar and Phi-Net and showing the added value of the proposed theoretical modifications to the state-of-the-art literature."
