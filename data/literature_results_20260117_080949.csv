PubMed,aortic stenosis,Sex-based differences in outcomes after transcatheter aortic valve implantation: a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised trials.,Gonçalo Nuno Ferraz-Costa; Mariana de Jesus Almeida; Joana Delgado Silva; Lino Gonçalves,10.1136/openhrt-2025-003642,2026-01-16,Open heart,"While female sex has historically been associated with worse outcomes following surgical aortic valve replacement, the evidence regarding sex-related differences after transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) remains inconclusive. Given that women are more frequently referred for TAVI, clarifying the role of sex in procedural outcomes is clinically relevant.
To systematically evaluate and summarise randomised clinical trial (RCT) evidence comparing TAVI outcomes between women and men.
A systematic review was conducted following Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines and registered in PROSPERO (CRD42024510202). PubMed, EMBASE and Web of Science were searched for English-language RCTs up to 1 July 2024. Studies comparing TAVI outcomes by sex were included. The primary outcome was all-cause mortality. Secondary outcomes included cardiovascular mortality, stroke or transient ischaemic attack (TIA), major bleeding and permanent pacemaker implantation (PPI). Pooled ORs were calculated using Mantel-Haenszel random-effects models.
14 RCTs with a total of 15 225 participants were included. No overall difference in all-cause mortality was observed between sexes (OR: 0.83; 95% CI 0.65 to 1.06), though a significant protective effect for female sex was found among intermediate-risk patients (OR: 0.64; 95% CI 0.49 to 0.84; I²=0%). Women had a significantly higher risk of major bleeding (OR: 1.35; 95% CI 1.21 to 1.52; I²=15%). No significant sex-based differences were identified in cardiovascular mortality (OR: 0.98), stroke/TIA (OR: 0.96) or PPI (OR: 1.05).
Female sex was associated with a lower all-cause mortality among intermediate-risk patients undergoing TAVI, but also with a higher overall risk of major bleeding. These findings suggest the need for further investigation into sex-related anatomical and procedural factors.

Despite this, aortic valve replacement rates remain low for patients with severe AS due to challenges in identifying clinically significant AS in time. This has prompted the need to develop and investigate novel diagnostic modalities. The objective of this study was to develop and validate novel, non-invasive diagnostic algorithm leveraging seismocardiography (SCG) data to detect severe AS.
A device capable of collecting a single-lead ECG and a three-dimensional SCG signal using a microelectromechanical-based accelerometer was used to collect sensor data. Phase 1 data were collected for training and validation of an algorithm for AS detection. Phase 2 data were collected as a blinded independent test set with age-matched and sex-matched patients as controls.
In phase 1 of the study, 115 subjects (n=56 AS patients and n=59 controls; mean age 73.8±10.4 years) were collected for training and validation of an algorithm for AS detection. Once model development was complete, the frozen model was then evaluated in a fully independent, single blinded phase 2 cohort of 99 subjects (n=50 AS patients and n=49 controls; mean age 76.8±6.4 years) for final analysis. The algorithm accurately classified 89 out of 99 patients, with four true AS cases misclassified as controls and six true control cases misclassified as AS. The sensitivity, specificity and area under the curve of the model were 92% (95% CI 84.5% to 99.5%), 87.8% (95% CI 78.6% to 96.9%), and 96% (95% CI 91.9% to 99.9%), respectively.
This SCG-based algorithm to detect severe AS demonstrated high sensitivity and specificity when tested in a blinded, age-matched and sex-matched cohort. These findings suggest that this technology may hold potential as a low-cost diagnostic tool for the detection of AS."

While a subset of AVSc patients progresses to AS, reported rates vary widely. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to better define the natural history of AVSc progression.
Following Preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses (PRISMA) guidelines, we searched PubMed, Scopus and Web of Science through July 2025 for observational studies reporting AS development in AVSc patients. Primary outcomes were progression to any degree of AS and to severe AS. Pooled event rates were calculated using a random-effects model. Heterogeneity and publication bias were assessed using standard statistical methods. Meta-regression explored associations with clinical and demographic variables.
Eight studies (n=12 388 patients) reported on the progression of AVSc patients to any AS stage, and nine studies (n=19 486 patients) on the progression to severe AS. Over a median follow-up of 4.0 years, 14.1% of AVSc patients progressed to any AS stage (effect size: 0.14; 95% CI 0.02 to 0.53), and 2.0% to severe AS (effect size: 0.02; 95% CI 0.003 to 0.094). Heterogeneity was high, but no publication bias was detected. Meta-regression found no significant predictors of progression.
Approximately one in six AVSc patients progresses to AS within 4 years, and 2% develop a severe disease. These findings underscore the importance of structured echocardiographic surveillance and support AVSc as a clinically relevant marker of systemic cardiovascular risk."

This study aimed to evaluate the prognostic impact of overall calcification burden in patients with severe AS undergoing AVR.
A retrospective analysis of 313 patients with severe AS undergoing CCT before AVR between 2016 and 2019 was conducted. MAC, CAC, AVC were quantified using established scoring methods. For TAC, a total thoracic aortic (TTA) score was developed by evaluating calcifications in the ascending, descending and aortic arch. MAC, CAC, AVC, and TTA were integrated into a comprehensive scoring system, the New Total Calcium (NTC) score, using Random Forest models. Outcomes considered included MACE, all-cause mortality, and non-cardiovascular mortality over a 60-month follow-up.
Among 313 patients (mean age 81 years), 93% underwent transcatheter AVR. Severe CAC and MAC were observed in 11% and 7.7% of patients, respectively. During follow-up, 48% of patients died, with non-cardiovascular deaths accounting for 34% and MACE occurring in 43%. In this predominantly TAVR population, the TTA score predicted MACE (p = 0.01), all-cause mortality (p = 0.01), and non-cardiovascular mortality (p = 0.005). The NTC score demonstrated high prognostic accuracy for MACE at 1-, 2-, and 3-years, with AUC values of 0.91, 0.80, and 0.81, respectively. Validation in an external cohort of 100 patients confirmed its robustness.
In this predominantly transcatheter AVR cohort, the NTC score is a promising tool for risk stratification in patients with severe AS. These findings are primarily applicable to transcatheter AVR patients, and further validation in SAVR populations is warranted."

Despite its high prevalence, affecting an estimated 20% of Canadians, Lp(a) remains under-recognized and under-measured in clinical practice. This paper provides guidance on the assessment and management of Lp(a) in primary and secondary prevention in the Canadian context. It outlines when and how to measure Lp(a), with a recommendation for universal, one-time testing in adulthood. The paper summarizes the pathophysiologic role of Lp(a) in promoting atherosclerosis, thrombosis, and AS, and highlights significant ethnic variability in Lp(a) levels and associated risk. It also addresses the limitations of existing cardiovascular risk calculators that omit Lp(a) and discusses the potential role of emerging imaging and treatment strategies, including novel Lp(a)-lowering therapies. Special attention is given to clinical interpretation of Lp(a) values, the role of cascade screening in families and recommendations for preventive interventions, with an emphasis on current approaches for managing patients with elevated Lp(a) while awaiting the availability of targeted therapies. The goal of this paper is to support clinicians in identifying at-risk individuals earlier and guiding appropriate risk reduction strategies in primary and secondary prevention settings."

This single-center observational study (Zhongshan Hospital, China; Oct 2024-Apr 2025) enrolled 72 symptomatic oHCM patients (NYHA II/III, LVEF ≥ 55%, resting/Valsalva-provoked LVOT gradient [LVOTG] ≥ 30 mmHg). All patients initiated mavacamten 2.5 mg once daily. Doses were adjusted at Weeks 4, 8, and 12 based on LVEF and LVOTG. Primary outcomes were changes in resting/provoked LVOTG, NT-proBNP, and NYHA class at Week 12. Safety outcomes included LVEF < 50%, cardiac hospitalization, and death.Significant reductions from baseline to Week 12 were observed: Resting LVOTG (52.4 ± 28.7 to 32.1 ± 23.1 mmHg, p < 0.001), Valsalva-provoked LVOTG (74.1 ± 24.4 to 48.7 ± 25.4 mmHg, p < 0.001), NT-proBNP (1102.7 ± 1114.9 to 320.2 ± 406.2 pg/mL, p < 0.001). LVEF remained stable. NYHA class improved by ≥ 1 class in 83.3% (60/72) of patients.Subgroup analyses revealed significantly greater LVOTG reductions in patients with classic HCM (vs. apical HCM, p < 0.001) and high baseline resting LVOTG (≥ 50 mmHg vs. < 50 mmHg, p < 0.001/p = 0.04). NYHA improvement was consistent across subgroups.Twenty-two patients escalated to 5 mg at Week 12, achieving further significant LVOTG reductions (p < 0.001), particularly in apical HCM and high-baseline-gradient subgroups, with stable LVEF.No safety events occurred (LVEF < 50%, arrhythmias, hospitalization, and death). Four patients reported transient minor adverse events (dizziness, nausea, and fatigue).
In this first Chinese real-world study, initiating mavacamten at 2.5 mg significantly improved haemodynamics (LVOTG), biomarkers (NT-proBNP), and functional status (NYHA) in oHCM patients over 12 weeks with an excellent safety profile. Greater haemodynamic efficacy was observed in classic HCM and high-baseline-gradient patients. Escalation to 5 mg provided additional benefit. Mavacamten is an effective and safe therapy for oHCM in this Asian population."

Prosthetic valve stenosis is a life-threatening condition and can significantly alter the maternal and fetal outcome without treatment. We report a case of a pregnant woman with twin gestation who developed prosthetic valve stenosis due to pannus formation and requiring redo AVR.
A 31-year-old woman, pregnant with dichorionic diamniotic twins at 14 weeks, presented with worsening dyspnea. She had undergone mechanical AVR at 11 years of age and was on warfarin; however, she stopped taking warfarin since 2014. Echocardiography revealed prosthetic aortic valve stenosis, with severely elevated transvalvular gradients. She underwent redo AVR with a 21 mm On-X mechanical valve following aortic root enlargement. Postoperatively, she developed complete atrioventricular dissociation, requiring a permanent pacemaker. Multidisciplinary care ensured fetal viability, and she was discharged in stable condition with appropriate anticoagulation management.
Redo AVR during pregnancy requires meticulous planning, balancing maternal and fetal risks. This case highlights the complexities of anticoagulation strategies, surgical execution, and maternal-fetal monitoring.
A multidisciplinary approach is essential to optimize outcomes in pregnant patients undergoing redo AVR. Long-term follow-up is crucial for continued surveillance of prosthetic valve function and maternal health."

The Naples Prognostic Score (NPS), which integrates inflammatory and nutritional markers, has shown promise in cardiovascular disease prognosis. This study investigated the relationship between preprocedural NPS and 30-day mortality in patients undergoing TAVI.
This retrospective, single-center study analyzed 308 patients aged ≥ 65 years who underwent elective transfemoral TAVI between August 2012 and December 2022. NPS was calculated using the neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio, lymphocyte-to-monocyte ratio, serum albumin, and total cholesterol levels. Patients were stratified into low NPS (0-2) and high NPS (3-4) groups. The primary endpoint was 30-day all-cause mortality.
The mean age was 79.81 +- 7.68 years, and 54.9% patients were female. The high NPS group comprised 191 patients (62.0%), while 117 patients (38.0%) were in the low NPS group. Thirty-day mortality was significantly higher in patients with high NPS (16.8% vs. 4.3%, P < 0.001), representing nearly a four-fold increased risk. NPS demonstrated good discriminative ability for mortality prediction (area under the curve: 0.692, 95% confidence interval: 0.611-0.774, P < 0.001), performing comparably to established surgical risk scores. Independent predictors of mortality included age (odds ratio [OR] 1.067, P = 0.039), neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (OR 1.062, P = 0.048), and pulmonary artery pressure (OR 1.039, P = 0.006).
The Naples Prognostic Score is a significant predictor of early mortality following TAVI and offers a simple, readily available tool for preoperative risk stratification. Patients with high NPS may benefit from enhanced perioperative monitoring and targeted interventions."

In the Fractional Flow Reserve versus Angiography for Multivessel Evaluation 2 trial, patients with hemodynamically significant stenoses (fractional flow reserve (FFR) ≤ 0.80) were randomized to receive FFR-guided percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) plus medical therapy (n = 447) or medical therapy alone (n = 441). At 5 years, FFR-guided PCI reduced the risk of the primary composite outcome of time to death, myocardial infarction or urgent revascularization, largely because of fewer urgent revascularizations. We now report the long-term clinical outcomes from this trial. Sixteen hospitals, contributing 748 randomized patients (161 women, 21.5%), participated in the long-term follow-up. The primary composite outcome was analyzed hierarchically using the unstratified win ratio, which addressed differential missingness of data on nonfatal outcomes in deceased patients by prioritizing comparisons on time to death. At a median follow-up of 11.2 years, the primary endpoint occurred in 150 of 447 patients (33.6%) in the PCI group versus 182 of 441 (41.3%) in the medical therapy group. PCI was superior in 29.2% of comparisons, medical therapy in 23.3%, and the two groups were tied in 47.5%, resulting in a win ratio of 1.25 in favor of PCI (95% confidence interval (CI) 1.01-1.56, P = 0.043). The corresponding win difference was 5.9% (95% CI 0.2-11.6), and the number needed to treat was 17 (95% CI 9-500). Win ratios were 0.88 for all-cause death (95% CI 0.66-1.17), 1.50 for myocardial infarction (95% CI 0.98-2.31) and 4.57 for urgent revascularization (95% CI 2.53-8.24). During long-term follow-up, FFR-guided PCI in patients with stable CAD and hemodynamically significant stenoses reduced the composite of death, myocardial infarction or urgent revascularization, primarily because of fewer urgent revascularizations. These long-term findings reaffirm the efficacy of FFR-guided PCI over medical therapy in patients with stable CAD. ClinicalTrials.gov registration: NCT06159231 ."

Methods: This was a retrospective cohort study. A total of 96 fetuses diagnosed with CPS-IVS or PA-IVS at the Women and Children's Hospital, Qingdao University between July 2018 and June 2021 were included. Fetuses who did not undergo FPV constituted the modeling cohort, while those who underwent FPV constituted the validation cohort. Fetuses were classified into biventricular and non-biventricular circulation groups based on postnatal circulatory outcomes, and prenatal fetal echocardiographic parameters were compared. Inter-group comparisons were performed using the t test, Mann-Whitney U test, χ2 test or Fisher exact test. Based on inter-group differences, parameters associated with postnatal circulatory outcomes were screened in the modeling cohort. For continuous variables, optimal cut-off values were determined using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves and the Youden index and then dichotomized. Right ventricular endocardial fibroelastosis (EFE) was graded as 0, 1 or 2 according to severity. OR of each parameter were calculated, and a multiparametric scoring system was constructed. ROC curves were used to evaluate its predictive performance. Post-FPV outcome improvement was assessed in the validation cohort. Results: Among the 96 fetuses, 78 were assigned to the modeling cohort and 18 to the validation cohort. Postnatally, biventricular circulation was achieved in 56 cases (72%) in the modeling cohort and 13 cases in the validation cohort. In the modeling cohort, the right ventricular long-axis/left ventricular long-axis (RV/LV), tricuspid annulus diameter/mitral annulus diameter (TV/MV) and pulmonary valve annulus/aortic valve annulus (PV/AV) in the non-biventricular group were lower than that in the biventricular group (all P<0.05). The optimal cut-off values for predicting postnatal circulatory outcomes were 0.65, 0.82 and 0.78, respectively. There was statistically significant difference in the distribution of circulatory outcomes between fetuses with grade 2 EFE and those with no or grade 1 EFE (χ2=21.28, P<0.001). Therefore, right ventricular EFE was dichotomized in the model as ""none or grade 1"" versus ""grade 2"". Each parameter was assigned a corresponding weight based on its OR value, and an integer score was obtained to construct the scoring system: grade 2 right ventricular EFE was assigned 5 points, RV/LV≤0.65 was assigned 2 points, TV/MV≤0.82 was assigned 2 points, and PV/AV≤0.78 was assigned 1 point, with a maximum total score of 10 points. At cut-off scores of 3, 4, and 5 points, the areas under the curve were 0.88, 0.91, and 0.88, respectively, with the highest specificity (0.95, 95% CI 0.84-0.99) observed at a score threshold of 5 points. In the validation cohort, 15 fetuses had scores ≥5 points, among whom 10 fetuses achieved biventricular circulation after birth, whereas in the modeling cohort, only 1 of 18 fetuses (scores≥5 points) achieved biventricular circulation. Conclusions: A multiparametric scoring system based on prenatal fetal echocardiographic parameters can effectively predict non-biventricular postnatal outcomes in fetuses with CPS-IVS and PA-IVS. By identifying high-risk patients, the indications for FPV can be optimized."

European guidelines consider aortic valve replacement (AVR) a Class IIa indication for asymptomatic patients with an LVEF of less than 55%, whereas American guidelines recommend AVR when the LVEF is less than 50%. The authors assessed outcomes of AVR vs conservative management in this range where guidelines differ.
A registry was created for individuals with severe high-gradient AS (AVA ≤ 1 cm²), an LVEF of 50% to 54%, and a mean gradient greater than or equal to 40 mm Hg from 2000 to 2022 using queries of transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) reports. Only asymptomatic cases were included; time-zero was defined as the time of the index TTE, and both AVR (considered as a time-dependent covariate) and mortality could occur at any point after. Proportional hazard modeling assessed the AVR-mortality association, with subset analyses for individuals with AVAs of less than 0.9 cm² and less than or equal to 0.75 cm².
Among 693 included individuals, 83 were asymptomatic at their index TTE. Of these, 38 (45.8%) underwent AVR within 2 years. After adjusting for immortal time, individuals with AVR had a trend toward decreased mortality (HR, 0.56; 95% CI, 0.31-1.01; P = .054).

Analysis of tissues from HCM hearts revealed genotype-specific differences in cardiomyocyte volume, morphology, and extracellular volume, with pathogenic variants exhibiting greater concentric cellular hypertrophy and disarray and variant-negative cases showing predominant fibrosis. Longitudinal profiling of a pig HCM model revealed early-onset fibrosis preceding cardiomyocyte hypertrophy. Integrating transcriptomic and morphologic changes, we identified genes associated with cellular and extracellular remodeling.

The aims of this study were to determine whether TAVR patients with HFrEF receive optimal HF-GDMT and to investigate the prognostic significance of HF-GDMT in this setting.
In a prospective registry, consecutive TAVR patients with HFrEF were stratified into 4 groups (quadruple, triple, double, or single or no therapy) according to prescription of HF-GDMT at discharge post-TAVR and after a 3-month GDMT optimization period. Major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) were defined as a composite of cardiovascular mortality or hospitalization for heart failure. The median follow-up time was 699 days (Q1-Q3: 510-961 days).
Among 336 TAVR patients with HFrEF, the rates of quadruple, triple, double, and single or no HF-GDMT were 15%, 19%, 28%, and 38% at discharge and 27%, 21%, 21%, and 27% at 3 months postprocedure, respectively. Among 280 patients (83.3%) eligible for quadruple HF-GDMT, only 27% (n = 76) received this combination at 3 months post-TAVR. Following a 3-month HF-GDMT optimization period, 2-year MACE rates were lower in patients taking quadruple (15.0%; 95% CI: 5.2%-24.8%) compared with triple (22.6%; 95% CI: 10.4%-34.8%), double (24.2%; 95% CI: 13.8%-34.6%), and single or no therapy (43.6%; 95% CI: 31.8%-55.4%; log-rank P < 0.001).
HF-GDMT is underused in patients with HFrEF who undergo TAVR, and suboptimal HF-GDMT is associated with increased MACE in this setting. Strategies to improve the initiation and up-titration of HF-GDMT in TAVR patients with HFrEF are needed."

While computed tomography (CT) is the gold-standard for annular sizing in TAVR, its routine use in SAVR planning is limited by resource constraints.
To develop and validate the Patient Referral Evaluation to Determine Indication for CT (PREDICT) model - a predictive tool utilizing anthropometric and transthoracic echocardiography (TTE)-derived data to identify SAS at the point of referral.
This retrospective, multicentre study included 1708 patients with severe aortic stenosis undergoing CT for annular assessment. A development cohort (n = 912) was used to construct the PREDICT multivariate regression model incorporating left ventricular outflow tract diameter (LVOTd), height, and sex. PREDICT performance was evaluated in a separate validation cohort (n = 796) using R2, Bland-Altman analysis, and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves. Diagnostic accuracy was assessed for small annulus (≤430mm2), very small annulus (VSAS≤400mm2), and extremely small annulus (ESAS≤370mm2).
In the validation cohort, PREDICT demonstrated good-to-excellent predictive accuracy, with AUCs of 0.838, 0.849, and 0.858 for SAS, VSAS, and ESAS, respectively; outperforming height and LVOTd alone (p < 0.001). Negative predictive values were consistently high, exceeding 88% across all annulus size thresholds, confirming PREDICT's excellent rule-out capability. Bland-Altman analysis showed good agreement with CT (mean bias -7 mm2). Diagnostic performance was unaffected by age or sex (p > 0.40).
PREDICT is a simple, accurate, non-invasive tool for identifying SAS at referral-optimizing CT use and enabling earlier planning to reduce PPM in severe aortic stenosis patients."

Case reports,"Transfemoral access is the preferred route for transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR), but severe calcification and luminal narrowing of the iliofemoral artery or abdominal aorta may preclude safe large-bore sheath passage. Intravascular lithotripsy (IVL) has been increasingly used for iliofemoral vessel preparation, yet its application in the abdominal aorta has been rarely reported.
An 84-year-old woman with symptomatic severe aortic stenosis was deemed high risk for transfemoral TAVR owing to severe narrowing with circumferential calcification of infrarenal aorta with luminal diameter <5 mm. To preserve transfemoral access, IVL with a 7.0-mm Shockwave balloon was performed using stepwise low-pressure inflations (1-6 atm, 300 pulses), achieving adequate luminal expansion for an 18-F sheath. A 23-mm self-expanding valve was successfully implanted without complications, and the patient was discharged the next day.
This case demonstrates that IVL can safely modify a small-caliber, circumferentially calcified iliofemoral and abdominal aorta to facilitate transfemoral TAVR.
Stepwise low-pressure inflations and meticulous procedural planning may expand the feasibility of transfemoral access in patients otherwise considered for higher-risk alternative routes."

While transthoracic echocardiography remains the diagnostic standard, deep learning-based approaches offer the potential for improved disease tracking. This study examined the longitudinal changes in a previously developed deep learning-derived index for AS continuum (DLi-ASc) and assessed its prognostic association with progression to severe AS.
We retrospectively analyzed 2373 patients (7371 transthoracic echocardiographies) from 2 tertiary hospitals. DLi-ASc (scaled 0-100), derived from parasternal long-axis and short-axis views, was tracked longitudinally. The median follow-up duration was 42.8 (interquartile range, 22.2-75.7) months.
DLi-ASc increased in parallel with worsening AS stages (P for trend<0.001) and showed strong correlations with aortic valve maximal velocity (Pearson correlation coefficient, 0.69; P<0.001) and mean pressure gradient (Pearson correlation coefficient, 0.66; P<0.001). Higher baseline DLi-ASc was associated with a faster AS progression rate (P for trend<0.001). Additionally, the annualized change in DLi-ASc, estimated using linear mixed-effect models, correlated strongly with the annualized progression of aortic valve maximal velocity (Pearson correlation coefficient, 0.71, P<0.001) and mean pressure gradient (Pearson correlation coefficient, =0.68; P<0.001). In Fine-Gray competing risk models, baseline DLi-ASc was independently associated with progression to severe AS, even after adjustment for aortic valve maximal velocity or mean pressure gradient (hazard ratios per 10-point increase, 2.38 and 2.80, respectively).
DLi-ASc increased in parallel with AS progression and was independently associated with severe AS progression. These findings support its role as a noninvasive imaging-based digital marker for longitudinal AS monitoring and risk stratification."

ARIC (Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities) study participants with protocol echocardiography at Visit 5 (V5; 2011-2013) and free of aortic valve (AV) replacement or cardiovascular disease were classified by ACC/AHA AS stages at V5 and Visit 7 (V7; 2018-2019). AS stage progression was defined as AV replacement or hospitalization, or a higher stage at V7. Associations of AS stage at V5 and AS stage progression from V5 to V7 with cardiac structure and function were assessed using multivariable linear regression. Associations of extra-AV cardiac abnormality categories with AS stage progression were assessed by multivariable logistic regression.
Of 5206 V5 participants (age 75±5 years, 40% men), AS stages A and B at V5 were associated with greater left ventricular wall thickness, mass, and filling pressure measures at both V5 and V7 compared with Stage 0. Among 1562 participants with assessable AS stage at V7, AS stage progression occurred in 370 and was associated with greater worsening of these measures (all P<0.02). The presence of both left ventricular and left atrial extra-AV abnormalities was associated with greater likelihood of AS stage progression (odds ratio 1.7 [95% CI, 1.2-2.6], P=0.009).
Early AS stages are associated with greater left ventricular mass and diastolic dysfunction, and AS stage progression is associated with worsening of these measures. The presence of both left ventricular and left atrial extra-AV abnormalities is associated with a greater likelihood of early AS stage progression."

To better comprehend the causal link between circulating cytokines and CAVS, we performed a bidirectional Mendelian randomization (MR) study. Genetic variants associated with 41 cytokines were obtained from public genome-wide association study (GWAS), and summary statistics for GWAS of CAVS were obtained from the FinnGen consortium. Forward MR analysis was conducted to determine the impacts of 41 cytokines on CAVS risk and reverse MR analysis was used to determine whether genetic susceptibility to CAVS altered the levels of these cytokines. Inverse-variance weighting (IVW) was implemented as the primary method, and several different sensitivity analyses were used to verify the reliability of the findings. Our results found no significant association between 41 cytokines and CAVS risk. However, increased levels of interleukin-18 (IL-18) (odds ratio [OR] = 1.080, 95% CI: 1.024-1.139) and interferon-gamma (IFN-γ) (OR = 1.157, 95% CI: 1.028-1.302) had suggestive connections with an elevated risk of CAVS, and increased levels of IL-13 (OR = 0.942, 95% CI: 0.890-0.997) and IL-5 (OR = 0.892, 95% CI: 0.804-0.990) had suggestive associations with a reduced risk of CAVS. A reverse MR analysis found that CAVS had a suggestive relationship with a reduced level of platelet-derived growth factor BB (PDGF-BB) (OR = 0.920, 95% CI: 0.853-0.993) and IL-4 (OR = 0.925, 95% CI: 0.856-1.000). Our findings suggest the causal effects of IL-18, IFN-γ, IL-13, and IL-5 on CAVS risk, and genetic predisposition of CAVS may reduce the levels of PDGF-BB and IL-4."

A total of 310 patients with HOCM who underwent interventricular septal myectomy were retrospectively analyzed. Patients were divided into a MAC group (n = 24) and a non-MAC group (n = 286). Demographic characteristics, echocardiographic parameters, and clinical data were compared between groups. Major adverse cardiovascular and cerebrovascular event (MACCE) and circulating levels of brain natriuretic peptide, Apelin, and Galectin-3 were analyzed.
Patients with MAC were older and showed higher prevalence of aortic annular calcification, mitral leaflet thickening, and moderate-to-severe tricuspid regurgitation (P < 0.05). Multivariate analysis identified gender, age, aortic annular calcification, moderate-to-severe tricuspid regurgitation, and mitral leaflet thickening as independent risk factors for MAC. Patients with MAC showed larger left ventricular end-diastolic volume, reduced left ventricular ejection fraction, and greater left atrium mass, and a higher incidence of MACCE than those without MAC (P < 0.05).
In HOCM undergoing septal myectomy, MAC is associated with adverse cardiac remodeling and unfavorable clinical outcomes. Identification of related factors may aid risk stratification and perioperative management."

However, the prognostic relevance of left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) in this population remains unclear.
We analyzed data from 821 patients undergoing M-TEER at four German tertiary care centers between 2011 and 2022. Patients were stratified into heart failure subgroups based on LVEF: heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF, LVEF ≥50%), mildly reduced ejection fraction (HFmrEF, LVEF 41-49%), and reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF, LVEF ≤40%). Propensity score matching was used to balance baseline characteristics. The primary endpoint was all-cause mortality, with secondary endpoints including cardiovascular mortality and major adverse cardiac and cerebrovascular events (MACCE).
HFrEF patients exhibited greater comorbid burden, including higher rates of coronary artery disease and functional MR. Despite these differences, no significant association was observed between LVEF and long-term mortality, even after propensity score matching. Long-term survival rates at three years were similar across subgroups: 50.8% for HFrEF, 60.6% for HFmrEF, and 58.9% for HFpEF (p=0.2). Patients with HFrEF experienced higher in-hospital mortality (5.2%) than HFmrEF (0%) and HFpEF (2.5%), primarily due to non-cardiac causes. The overall rate of major adverse cardiac and cerebrovascular events (MACCE) was low at 3.8% (31/821) without significant difference between the respective subgroups. Multivariable analysis identified high-grade tricuspid regurgitation, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and impaired renal function as stronger predictors of mortality than LVEF.
LVEF demonstrated limited prognostic value for long-term outcomes following M-TEER, challenging its role as a standalone marker in this population. Procedural safety and efficacy were consistent across subgroups, underscoring the viability of M-TEER in surgically inoperable patients. Given the significant higher in-hospital mortality rate due to non-cardiac causes in the HFrEF subgroup, tailored therapeutic strategies addressing the underlying diseases should be pursued to optimize outcomes. Future studies should explore possible improvements in risk assessment and patient selection, for example by integrating emerging imaging modalities and accounting for comorbidities, to improve treatment outcomes."

Occasionally, mitral valve repair is inadequate (residual MR), or result in mitral stenosis, or is associated with systolic anterior motion (SAM) of the mitral valve and left ventricular outflow tract obstruction. Two- and three-dimensional Transesophageal echocardiography (2D and 3D TEE) can precisely diagnose the mechanisms, location and scallops causing MR, identify the mechanisms of repair failure, identify the predictors of SAM, and help decide when to return to bypass and address the residual lesion. The review comprehensively describes 2D and 3D TEE imaging methods relevant for evaluating the mechanisms of MR, identification of the location of MR, and the predictors of SAM prior to valve repair; and describes imaging methods to identify the presence of mitral stenosis and SAM post-repair. Further, the review discusses the importance of more-than-mild residual MR, describes the evaluation of residual MR and discusses pitfalls in differentiating mild and more- than-mild residual MR."

The objective of this pilot study was to compare a clinical combined endpoint achieved by left bundle branch pacing (LBBP) vs right ventricular (RV) pacing in patients with preserved left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) post-TAVI at 12-month follow-up.
Consecutive patients post-TAVI with high-degree AV block and LVEF ≥ 50% were randomized to LBBP or RV pacing. The primary endpoint was survival with an improvement of ≥ 1 point in New York Heart Association functional class or a ≥ 25% increase in distance covered on the 6-minute walking test. Secondary endpoints were change in LVEF, septal flash, mitral regurgitation, N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide, heart failure hospitalization, score on symptoms, and QRS duration.
Twenty-four patients were included in the study, 12 in each arm. Both groups showed a similar incidence of the primary endpoint: 33.3% (n = 4) in the LBBP group vs 25% (n = 3) in the RV group (P = 1.0). In relation to secondary endpoints, significant shortening in the QRS was observed in the LBBP group compared with the RV group (median: -39 ms vs 0 ms, P < 0.001). Septal flash excursion was significantly lower for the LBBP group (median: 0 mm vs 2 mm, P = 0.03). There was no difference between groups on any other endpoint.
Similar midterm outcomes were obtained with LBBP and RV pacing in an elderly population with high-degree AV block and preserved LVEF after TAVI. The pilot Phys-TAVI trial showed the feasibility of LBBP in this population. Larger randomized clinical trials with longer follow-up are needed to test for differential clinical outcomes between pacing modalities.

A 30-year-old man with mitral valve prolapse and prior IE presented with chest pain, dyspnea, and fever. Electrocardiogram showed anterior ST-segment elevation, and coronary angiography demonstrated distal left anterior descending artery occlusion with otherwise normal coronaries. Plain balloon angioplasty without stent was performed given the embolic nature of the lesion. Blood cultures grew Staphylococcus hominis. Transesophageal echocardiography revealed severe mitral regurgitation with leaflet perforation and vegetations, whereas computed tomography revealed hepatic infarction as systemic embolization. He underwent early mitral valve repair after antibiotics and recovered well.
Coronary embolism complicating IE is rare (∼2% incidence) but associated with high morbidity and mortality. This case underscores the need to suspect septic coronary embolism in acute coronary syndrome with normal coronaries, avoid fibrinolysis, and pursue percutaneous coronary intervention without stenting followed by early surgical intervention.
Early recognition of septic coronary embolism and timely multidisciplinary intervention are essential to optimize outcomes."

This retrospective single-centre study aims to provide additional insight into clinical outcomes and its determinants following TMVI.
Data of all TMVI procedures (n = 88) performed between February 2014 and June 2024 were retrospectively analyzed. The primary endpoints were 1-year mortality and the Mitral Valve Academic Research Consortium (MVARC) composite endpoints. Secondary outcomes included complications and echocardiographic outcomes.
Overall, in-hospital, 30-day, and 1-year mortality rates were 6.8%, 5.8%, and 16.5%, respectively. No significant differences were observed between transseptal and transapical approach (20.0 vs 13.2%, p = 0.439) or between valve-in-valve and valve-in-ring procedure (16.3 vs 18.2%, p = 0.828). At 1-year follow-up, only one patient presented with mitral regurgitation ≥ grade 2. However, a post-procedural mean pressure gradient (MPG) ≥5 mmHg was observed in 51 patients (58%). In multivariate analysis, higher post-procedural MPG was associated with increased mortality risk (p = 0.047, HR = 1.23, 95% CI: 1.00-1.51), whereas technical success was associated with reduced mortality risk (p = 0.014, HR = 0.12, 95% CI: 0.02-0.65).
TMVI provided acceptable mid-term mortality irrespective of procedure type and access route, with excellent technical success. Furthermore, mid-term follow-up showed near-complete elimination of mitral regurgitation. However, a high rate of post-procedural relevant mitral stenosis was observed, which may have an impact on mortality. In the light of the anticipated increase in TMVI procedures, we advocate for larger prospective studies to investigate the long-term determinants of mortality."

The procedure was initially performed using systems designed for mitral valve repair, which were replaced by tricuspid-dedicated devices. This retrospective study compared outcomes of tricuspid-dedicated devices (TriClip or PASCAL) with a non-dedicated device (MitraClip) used for TR treatment. MATERIAL AND METHODS We analyzed data from 44 consecutive patients (mean age 74.7±7.5 years) who underwent T-TEER (2018-2024): 22 with non-dedicated (MitraClip) and 22 with dedicated systems (TriClip or PASCAL). The primary endpoint was technical success. Secondary endpoints included post-procedural TR≤ moderate, ≥2-grade TR reduction, peri-procedural complications, and 6-month mortality. RESULTS Baseline characteristics were largely balanced, although the non-dedicated group showed greater left-ventricular dysfunction. Technical success was significantly higher with dedicated systems (100% vs 77.3%, risk ratio 1.29; 95% CI 1.03-1.63; P=0.048) Post-procedural moderate or less TR and a reduction of ≥2 grades was achieved in 68.2% of patients with dedicated devices vs 31.8% with non-dedicated devices (risk ratio 2.14, 95% CI 1.09-4.21; P=0.02). Mortality during a 6-month follow-up was comparable between both cohorts (0.0% vs 9.1%; risk ratio 1.10; 95% CI 0.96-1.26; P=0.23). CONCLUSIONS Tricuspid-dedicated systems (TriClip or PASCAL) were associated with higher procedural success rates and greater TR reduction. They improved early outcomes and enabled the application of T‑TEER in a broader population of patients with less-advanced heart failure. Given the limited sample size and retrospective design, these findings should be interpreted with caution and regarded as exploratory and hypothesis-generating."

PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science were searched for studies evaluating the prognostic impact of RVPA coupling in patients undergoing MTEER, using tricuspid annular plane systolic excursion (TAPSE)/pulmonary artery systolic pressure (PASP) or related markers. Risk of bias was assessed with the ROBINS-I tool, and meta-analyses were used to evaluate associations with clinical outcomes, including all-cause mortality, major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE), and residual mitral regurgitation (MR).
Nine studies involving 3281 patients were included. Baseline RVPA uncoupling was significantly associated with an increased incidence of MACE (risk ratio [RR] 1.75, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.40-2.19) and higher all-cause mortality (RR 1.82, 95% CI: 1.53-2.18). No significant association was observed with post-operative MR (RR 1.17, 95% CI: 0.83-1.63). Sensitivity analyses did not alter the direction of the findings.
RVPA uncoupling is associated with adverse outcomes after MTEER. Routine assessment may improve pre-procedural risk stratification. Further studies should refine diagnostic thresholds and evaluate potential therapeutic strategies in the setting of impaired RVPA coupling prior to MTEER."

The primary outcome was a composite of all-cause death and heart failure hospitalizations (HFHs).
Of 1748 patients, 568 (32.5%) met the criteria for HNDC. HNDC patients were more likely to be male, with a higher prevalence of obesity and atrial fibrillation. HNDC also showed less advanced disease (less advanced New York Association class, higher left ventricular ejection fraction, lower prevalence of moderate-severe mitral regurgitation, and less atrial dilatation). After a median follow-up of 13 months, the primary outcome occurred less frequently in HNDC compared with DCM [12.5 vs. 17.1%; hazard ratio 0.762, 95% confidence interval (95% CI) 0.581-0.999; P = 0.049]. However, the adjusted prognosis was similar between groups (hazard ratio 1.031, 95% CI 0.771-1.380; P = 0.834). Beta-blockers emerged as the most protective drug for HNDC (hazard ratio 0.462, 95% CI 0.258-0.826; P = 0.009).
HNDC appears as a distinct form of DCM with milder clinical presentation. However, the absence of LV dilation did not independently influence prognosis. Beta-blockers may offer the most consistent benefit in HNDC."

Previous studies have largely focused on central mitral regurgitation with favorable valve anatomy or a general broad spectrum of complex mitral regurgitation. However, no established approach is currently available for M-TEER in commissural degenerative mitral regurgitation (DMR).
Therefore, this study aimed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of a novel morphology classification-guided M-TEER strategy for treating commissural DMR using the MitraClip system. This prospective, multicenter, single-arm, objective performance criteria study involved 12 experienced centers in Asia, primarily located in China. Patients with symptomatic moderate-to-severe (3+) and severe (4+) native DMR and commissural involvement were stratified into three morphological categories based on an echocardiographic core laboratory analysis, and tailored M-TEER strategies were proposed. The primary endpoint is the proportion of patients achieving a mitral regurgitation (MR) grade of ≤1+ without repeat mitral intervention at one-year follow-up. Clinical, echocardiographic, functional, and quality-of-life outcomes were assessed over one year.
Based on statistical power calculations, a total of 148 patients are required to achieve adequate power to test the primary efficacy hypothesis, accounting for an estimated 10% attrition rate at 12 months.
The morphology classification system enhances M-TEER for commissural DMR by addressing the unique challenges of this approach, enabling tailored interventions that optimize procedural success and patient outcomes.

Additionally, anatomical and pathophysiological heterogeneity significantly influences procedural complexity, durability of repair, and clinical outcomes within both primary and secondary MR. Furthermore, recent trials suggest that the timing of the intervention is as critical as patient anatomy; delaying treatment until advanced ventricular remodeling has occurred may limit the benefits of MR reduction. Moreover, long-term data on durability and device-failure management remain limited, particularly in secondary MR, where the progression of the underlying cardiomyopathy largely determines the outcomes. Thus, this review underscores how integrating MR subtyping with intervention strategies may influence patient selection and highlights the need for future research to adopt a more individualized, mechanism-driven approach."

Given her extremely high surgical risk, transcatheter edge-to-edge mitral valve repair with the MitraClip® device was selected as the most appropriate therapeutic option. The procedure was technically challenging due to altered post-transplant anatomy, but it was completed successfully without immediate complications and resulted in a substantial reduction in regurgitation. During early follow-up, a small left atrial thrombus was identified and subsequently resolved after a six-week course of oral anticoagulation. This report illustrates the feasibility and safety of transcatheter mitral repair in carefully selected heart transplant recipients and underscores the importance of tailored post-procedural surveillance in this complex population."

On the other hand, atrial fibrillation (Af) is one of the primary causes of AFMR, and increasing in the elderly population residing in industrialized countries. In addition, in recent years, flow energy loss (EL) assessed by four-dimensional (4D) flow magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is expected to be a novel parameter of cardiac workload. This study aimed to evaluate the pathophysiology of AFMR by comparing parameters between AFMR with Af and structural MR (StMR) with prolapse from a viewpoint of hemodynamic.
This study was a prospective study. Preoperative 4D flow MRI studies were performed in 10 AFMR for Af and 10 StMR for prolapse surgical candidates. Study results were segmented to visualize flow patterns, quantify hemodynamics, and energy dynamics [EL and cardiac output (CO), among other parameters], using iTFlow2 (Cardio Flow Design Inc., Tokyo, Japan). Statistical analysis the Mann-Whitney U test was used to compare the differences between the two groups, and Spearman's correlation coefficient by the Mann-Whitney U test, and Spearman's correlation coefficient was performed.
In AFMR, CO and cardiac index (CI) were significantly lower [CO: 5.01 (4.53-6.13) vs. 8.54 (7.51-11.11) L/min, P<0.001; CI: 3.54 (3.17-3.98) vs. 5.47 (4.37-6.09) L/min/m2; P=0.007], with lower systemic (left side) EL (ltEL) [3.34 (1.96-6.46) vs. 7.13 (4.75-9.72) mW, P=0.08] and higher pulmonary (right side) EL (rtEL) [2.43 (1.87-4.03) vs. 1.70 (1.18-2.13) mW, P=0.17]. TR fraction was higher [56.1% (39.5-69.2%) vs. 29.0% (20.9-37.9%), P=0.01], while the left ventricular end-diastolic volume (LVEDV) was significantly lower [134.6 (114.1-177.3) vs. 209.0 (190.1-255.6) mL, P=0.01]. EL densities [defined as EL/each chamber volume (mW/mL)] and CO ratios [defined as EL/CO (mW·min·m2/L)] were significantly reduced compared to those of StMR (all P<0.05). In the AFMR group, a positive relationship was observed between ltEL and both ventricular volumes, rtEL, and right ventricular volume (P<0.05). Af duration showed a non-significant but positive correlation with rtEL/CO (P=0.056).
4D flow MRI revealed that AFMR is associated with lower CO, higher pulmonary load and right ventricular enlargement, compressing the left ventricle, and increasing systemic EL. Longer Af duration correlates with higher EL in smaller left ventricles."

Focused transthoracic echocardiography (FTTE) may help diagnose or rule out a cardiac cause of the clinical dilemma. We studied the diagnostic and therapeutic impact of FTTE in post-CS patients in the ICU.
In this prospective observational study, 60 post-CS patients in the ICU requiring FTTE were studied for indications for FTTE. Following FTTE, the hemodynamic cause of hypotension was differentiated as hypovolemia, cardiac failure due to underlying cardiac conditions such as cardiomyopathy or valvular heart disease, sepsis, pulmonary embolism, and myocardial infarction. In respiratory distress, FTTE differentiated pulmonary edema secondary to cardiac causes from non-cardiac causes. FTTE was considered to have a diagnostic impact whenever, in a clinically unsuspected case, it diagnosed a new cardiac disorder, thus helping to narrow down to a single cause out of multiple differential diagnoses or ruled out a cardiac cause in a clinically suspected case. FTTE was considered to have a therapeutic impact whenever it led to an alteration in management.
FTTE diagnosed a new cardiac pathology in 18 (30%) patients and ruled out a worsening of existing cardiac function in 18 (30%) patients with known cardiac disease. An underlying cardiac condition was ruled out in 22 (36.66%) patients, supporting an alternate diagnosis. FTTE led to a change in the management of 45 (75%) patients.
FTTE had a high diagnostic impact of 96.66% and a management impact of 75% in post-CS ICU admissions."

The physical examination skills of clinicians are insufficient for accurate diagnosis, making complementary tests generally necessary. Despite being commonly requested, electrocardiography and chest radiography present low positive and negative likelihood ratios. Incipient studies involving artificial intelligence have shown promising opportunities to support the diagnosis. In addition, solid current evidence demonstrates that point-of-care ultrasound enhances bedside diagnosis of several cardiovascular conditions. Echocardiographic skills can be acquired after only a few hours of training, which encourages routine bedside use with handling equipment. Despite the routine use of sonography in emergencies, large-scale simplified screening protocols for valvular disease remain lacking. Therefore, improving the accuracy of valvular heart disease diagnosis by integrating all bedside modalities needs to be better understood. We propose a simple, reproducible five-step point-of-care ultrasound protocol for diagnosing valvular heart disease (the ValvUS approach), applicable to all patients. The proposed visual assessment involves evaluating valvular movement, thickness, regurgitant flow, aliasing, and chamber dimensions. This evaluation should be interpreted in the context of traditional clinical probability to ensure the most accurate bedside diagnosis. Typical findings of severe valvular disease on electrocardiography and chest radiography, and particularly on point-of-care ultrasound, may improve the accuracy of bedside diagnosis after clinical assessment in the near future."

Therefore, this research aimed to study the connection of LDL-C levels with the incidence of adverse clinical outcomes in patients undergoing CVS.
1,304 patients undergoing first-time CVS were identified from the MIMIC-IV database. Participants were split into two groups based on admission LDL-C levels: a low LDL-C group (< 1.4 mmol/L, n = 215) as well as a high LDL-C one (≥ 1.4 mmol/L, n = 1,089). The main endpoint was 30-day all-cause mortality (ACM), with secondary endpoints including in-hospital, 90-, 180- and 365-day ACM rates. The connection between preoperative LDL-C levels and clinical outcomes was evaluated via survival analysis, mediation analysis, and subgroup analyses.
Multivariable Cox regression analysis demonstrated preoperative LDL-C level served as an independent protective factor against 30-day ACM following cardiac valve surgery (adjusted HR: 0.594; 95% CI: 0.368-0.960). In stratified analysis, patients in the higher LDL-C tertile exhibited a remarkably lower mortality risk (HR: 0.285; 95% CI: 0.134-0.604). Consistent subgroup analyses validated these findings' robustness across all clinically relevant subgroups. Notably, mediation analysis provided mechanistic evidence that the mortality-increasing effect of lower LDL-C levels may be partially mediated through activation of systemic inflammation.
Lower preoperative LDL-C levels are independently related with higher 30-day mortality following cardiac valve surgery, potentially mediated by the activation of inflammatory pathways."

Cardiovascular interventions,"Small multicenter studies have shown that transcatheter pulmonary valve replacement (TPVR) can be performed with good procedural and early hemodynamic results in patients weighing <30 kg; little is known about longer term outcomes.
The aim of this study was to characterize long-term outcomes after Melody valve placement in patients weighing ≤30 kg.
Selected centers participating in prior registry studies provided updated outcome data.
Between April 2009 and April 2019, 199 patients weighing ≤30kg underwent successful Melody valve placement across 10 centers. During a median follow-up period of nearly 8 years, 78 patients underwent initial reintervention with balloon dilation (n = 20), transcatheter valve-in-valve (n = 30), or explantation (n = 28). Among patients who had not undergone reintervention, 81% of those with available echocardiograms had good valve function. Thirty-two patients developed endocarditis, 20 with predisposing factors; 9 were managed medically. Estimated freedom from pulmonary valve reintervention at 10 years was 46% (95% CI: 36%-55%). On age- and weight-adjusted multivariable Cox regression, right ventricular systolic pressure immediately after implantation (HR: 1.03; 95% CI: 1.00-1.05; P = 0.026) was associated with freedom from reintervention. Freedom from Melody valve explantation at 10 years was 78% (95% CI: 69%-85%), and freedom from endocarditis was 79% (95% CI: 71%-86%). These outcomes did not vary significantly according to weight, delivery system, or era of implantation.
In this large multicenter study, longer term survival and freedom from reintervention or explantation after TPVR were similar to previously reported data for small patients with a surgical pulmonary conduit or bioprosthetic valve. These findings support the utility of TPVR with a Melody valve for delaying surgical valve replacement in small patients."

Moderate to severe tricuspid regurgitation (TR) is associated with increased mortality after liver transplantation (LT). Open cardiac surgery is recommended for patients with symptomatic severe TR, however LT candidates often face prohibitive surgical risk.
A 45-year-old woman with advanced cirrhosis awaiting LT was diagnosed with severe functional TR due to anatomical tricuspid valve incompetence (TVI). The tricuspid valve anatomy was unsuitable for transcatheter tricuspid edge-to-edge repair, a technique previously described in cirrhotic patients before LT. The patient underwent a transcatheter tricuspid valve replacement (TTVR) followed by LT.
LT recipients with TR secondary to anatomical TVI have significantly lower 1-year survival. Minimally invasive valve interventions are promising alternatives for patients who are not cardiac surgical candidates, such as LT recipients with advanced cirrhosis.

Sixty patients meeting inclusion and exclusion criteria with at least one criterion of a high risk for AV conduction disorder were enrolled in the study. All included patients were randomized 1:1 into two groups. In Group 1, TAVI was performed using a 3D navigation-guided technique, while in Group 2, the classical TAVI technique was used. The primary endpoint was the composite incidence of permanent pacemaker (PP) implantation and new-onset complete left bundle branch block (LBBB) at 6 months.Results  In the early postoperative period, the 3D navigation-guided TAVI group had a lower incidence of new-onset LBBB (10.3% vs. 33.3%; p=0.03), better parameters of intraventricular conduction according to electrophysiology study (EPS) (H-V interval 79.1±13.5 ms vs. 96.0±39.9 ms; p=0.03) and electrocardiography (QRS complex duration 108.0±16.3 ms vs. 119.0±22.6 ms; p=0.04). The incidence of PP implantation during the hospital stage, A-H interval duration, and Wenckebach point in the AV junction according to EPS did not differ significantly between the groups. The incidence of the primary endpoint (PP implantation + new-onset LBBB) during the 6-month follow-up period was 43.3% in the classical technique group and 16.7% in the 3D navigation-guided TAVI group (p=0.02). There were no statistically significant differences between the groups in the incidence of procedural complications or major adverse cardiovascular and cerebrovascular outcomes.Conclusion         This study demonstrated the efficacy and safety of a new 3D navigation-guided TAVI technique in reducing the composite rate of implantation PP and LBBB at 6 months post-procedure, with comparable rates of procedural complications and major adverse cardiac and cerebrovascular events (MACCE) during long-term follow-up.

Epicardial cysts attached to the cardiac surface with intimate coronary artery involvement are even rarer and pose significant diagnostic and surgical challenges. This case highlights a giant pericardial cyst with intimate right coronary artery involvement in a 10-month-old infant, where subtotal resection was necessary to preserve coronary integrity. A 10-month-old male infant with a pericardial cyst initially detected at 27 weeks of gestation presented with progressive compression of right heart chambers. Imaging revealed a large multiloculated cystic mass (5.3 × 3.5 × 3.9 cm) compressing the right atrium and right ventricle, with associated pulmonary valve stenosis. Intraoperatively, the cyst was found on the epicardial surface with intimate involvement of the right coronary artery. Complete excision was not feasible due to the risk of coronary injury. The main cystic mass was excised with cavity obliteration, while the portion adjacent to the right coronary artery was intentionally preserved. Concurrent pulmonary valve commissurotomy and pulmonary artery augmentation were performed. Histopathology confirmed a mesothelial-lined pericardial cyst. The patient recovered uneventfully and was discharged. This case underscores the importance of comprehensive preoperative coronary artery assessment in pericardial cysts with atypical locations. When complete excision risks vital structure injury, subtotal resection with cavity obliteration represents a safe alternative strategy."

This narrative review critically examines the current state of AI applications across the bladder cancer care focusing on diagnostic, prognostic and surgical domains. A comprehensive literature search was conducted to identify relevant studies. Key topics include radiomics in computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), radiogenomics, pathomics and AI-assisted cystoscopy. Furthermore, the role of AI in preoperative planning, intraoperative navigation and surgical training is discussed highlighting its integration in robotic and endoscopic procedures.
AI is rapidly redefining bladder cancer management through multimodal data integration and predictive modeling. While current evidence demonstrates high diagnostic and prognostic performance, clinical implementation remains limited by heterogeneity, lack of standardization and insufficient external validation. Future efforts should prioritize prospective validation, explainability and integration into clinical workflows to realize AI's full potential in personalized uro-oncology."

Given that adenoids typically regress with age and may respond to oral appliance therapy, early identification, clear orthodontic indications, and timely referral are essential for effective management. A major challenge in this process is accurately assessing adenoid volume and quantifying nasopharyngeal obstruction in three dimensions. To address this, we developed a deep learning-based method using cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT) to accurately segment adenoid, and establish a novel quantitative index, the Three-Dimensional Adenoidal-Nasopharyngeal Ratio (3D-AN), for assessing nasopharyngeal airway obstruction.
This retrospective study included three datasets. Dataset 1 comprised 126 CBCT scans (pre- and post-adenoidectomy) from 63 pediatric OSA patients. Dataset 2 included post-adenoidectomy CBCT scans of 26 pediatric OSA patients. Dataset 3 involved 161 pediatric patients with both polysomnography and CBCT data. A SegResNet-based model was trained on Datasets 1 and 2 (1326 training pairs) to predict postoperative airway morphology following adenoidectomy using preoperative scans. By inputting preoperative airway data, the model predicts postoperative morphology, and the volumetric difference represents the adenoid. 3D-AN ratio was then computed from adenoid-to-nasopharyngeal volume. Dataset 3 was used to investigate the relationship between the 3D-AN and pediatric OSA.
The segmentation model achieved a Dice similarity coefficient of 0.88 and a relative volume error of 0.09. Preliminary analysis showed that a 3D-AN ratio below 0.18 was not significantly correlated with pediatric OSA, while values above 0.18 correlated significantly with OSA (r = 0.56, P < 0.01).
This automated method enables accurate adenoid segmentation. The proposed 3D-AN, based on volumetric ratios, holds potential for early detection of adenoid-related airway obstruction and for supporting future research in adenoid assessment and clinical management."

The latest models of deep learning are applied for processing and classification of digital images to analyze textures, color compositions, and lighting patterns across artistic and real-world imagery. In this research work, we aim to classify the given images to identify whether they are human artwork of paintings or captured photos. We apply state-of-the-art Vision Transformer (ViT) architecture to classify artistic images, achieving a classification accuracy of 95% outperforming existing relevant in the relevant literature. To validate and benchmark the approach, comprehensive experiments are carried out on the standard dataset using DenseNet, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), and Visual Geometry Group (VGG19) models. The results highlight the superior performance of ViT in capturing complex visual features, such as texture variation and compositional details. Grad-CAM further enhances the interpretability of the model by highlighting the specific visual regions influencing the model's decisions, confirming that ViT able to capture meaningful artistic attributes such as brushstroke patterns, smoothness, and illumination gradients. This combination of high performance and transparency analysis of proposed model ensures a reliable and explainable solution for automated artwork classification."
PubMed,deep learning,The peak shifting electricity consumption management and influencing factors of smart grid from recurrent neural network model and deep learning.,Feng Wang; Dingwei Huang; Weitian Lu,10.1038/s41598-026-35754-5,2026-01-16,Scientific reports,"This study uses Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) model and Electricity Consumption (EC) management model to conduct in-depth research and analysis to achieve effective management of peak shifting EC in smart grids and analyze its influencing factors. A management method that is superior to other models has been found, which has a breakthrough effect on the use and research of smart grids. Firstly, the RNN model is analyzed, and a smart grid energy consumption prediction model based on EC management of peak shifting is established. Secondly, with the goal of shifting peaks and filling valleys, the power load data with several different characteristics is divided into different EC modes. Finally, in predicting smart grid energy consumption, it is compared with Linear Regression (LR), nonlinear regression, and Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average Mode prediction models. The results show that: (1) Before using the hydrogen energy peak shifting and valley filling EC management mode, the peak energy consumption is about 46kWh, and the adjusted peak energy consumption decreases by about 12kWh. This indicates that the hydrogen peak shifting EC management mode operates well in smart grids. (2) In practical environments, the Mean Square Error (MSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), and Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) values of the RNN-based energy consumption time series prediction model are 0.124, 0.26, and 5.75, respectively. The MSE, MAE, and MAPE values of the LR prediction model are 22.09, 3.33, and 21.48, respectively. The MSE, MAE, and MAPE values of the nonlinear regression prediction model are 0.223, 489, and 16.32, respectively, indicating that the prediction accuracy of the RNN energy consumption time series prediction model is superior to other comparative models. This study has important reference value for schools and factories to use artificial intelligence to elucidate future energy consumption needs and reasonable allocation of energy in the power grid."

In order to categorize AD and PD in comparison to Healthy Controls (HC), this study suggests a multimodal classification framework that combines genetic Single Nucleotide Polymorphism (SNP) data, structural Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), and functional Electroencephalography (EEG). To improve the model's accuracy and interpretability, the method makes use of an uncertainty estimate module and a novel cross-modality attention mechanism. The framework strives for diagnosis, concentrating on detecting Parkinson's disease (PD) and Alzheimer's disease (AD) in individuals exhibiting modest motor symptoms or early cognitive impairments, which are indicative of the prodromal stage of both conditions. A dataset of 2,500 MRI images, 1,500 EEG recordings, and SNP data for 1,000 subjects drawn from OpenNeuro, PPMI, and the UK Biobank was utilized in extensive analyses. The developed model was contrasted with recent unimodal and multimodal techniques. Our findings exhibit statistically significant increases of 6-12% compared to similar methods, with 95.6% average classification accuracy on AD and 94.8% on PD. The importance of the attention mechanism and both modalities to overall performance is quantified using ablation studies. Quantification of uncertainty also improves interpretability for possible clinical use. These results demonstrate the proper neurodegenerative disease diagnosis when explainable AI elements are paired with stable multimodal fusion."

This study aimed to predict mortality in patients with pulmonary hypertension (PH) and right heart failure (RHF) using an artificial intelligence (AI)-assisted multimodal echocardiography approach. A total of 586 patients with PH and RHF were enrolled. Transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) was performed either before hospital admission in the outpatient department or after admission in the inpatient unit. RV structure and function were assessed using two-dimensional measurements and speckle tracking strain analysis of septal and the free-wall segments. A multimodal deep-learning framework, integrating clinical variables, conventional echocardiographic indices, and AI-extracted RV strain features was developed to predict in-hospital and follow-up mortality. Model performance was evaluated using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves and the area under the curve (AUC). The death group had significantly higher NT-proBNP levels, pulmonary artery systolic pressure (PASP), and average RV longitudinal strain (RVLS) than the survival group. Logistic regression identified PASP and average RVLS as independent predictors of in-hospital mortality, while Cox regression confirmed average RVLS as an independent predictor of follow-up mortality. The testing AUC for the AI model was 0.823 (0.741-0.905). The AI-guided TTE framework provides an effective and efficient method for mortality prediction in patients with PH and RHF, supporting personalized clinical decision-making and risk stratification."
PubMed,deep learning,Prediction of left ventricular systolic dysfunction in left bundle branch block using a fine-tuned ECG foundation model.,Do Heon Kim; Youngnam Bok; Sun Hwa Lee; Jihye Heo; Seung Park; Dongheon Lee; Jae-Hyeong Park,10.1038/s41598-025-34911-6,2026-01-17,Scientific reports,"Left bundle branch block (LBBB) is an important electrocardiographic (ECG) finding strongly associated with left ventricular systolic dysfunction (LVSD), a condition linked to poor clinical outcomes. Although early LVSD detection is crucial, standard diagnosis via echocardiography may not always be immediately accessible. In this study, we propose a fine-tuned ECG foundation model (FM) to enhance LVSD detection specifically in patients with LBBB. We conducted a retrospective multicenter analysis of 2,031 paired ECG-echocardiographic datasets from 892 LBBB patients. The ECG-FM was fine-tuned for optimal LVSD prediction and compared against baseline models, which were conventional deep learning methods, including Fully Convolutional Network (FCN), LSTM-FCN, ResNet, and InceptionTime. The proposed ECG-FM with single-step full fine-tuning outperformed baseline models, achieving accuracy, sensitivity, and AUROC of 0.758, 0.771, and 0.807, respectively. Additionally, sequential partial fine-tuning exhibited the highest sensitivity (0.787), enhancing screening capability. DeepLIFT analysis identified QRS complex and T wave features in leads V1-V4 as critical predictive factors. Our results demonstrated that the recommended fine-tuned ECG-FM significantly improves LBBB patient LVSD detection, potentially enabling earlier clinical diagnosis in such cases when echocardiography is not readily available, thereby potentially improving patient outcomes and clinical management."
PubMed,deep learning,QPSODRL: an improved quantum particle swarm optimization and deep reinforcement learning based intelligent clustering and routing protocol for wireless sensor networks.,Liu Guangjie,10.1038/s41598-026-35365-0,2026-01-16,Scientific reports,"In wireless sensor networks (WSNs), energy-efficient clustering and adaptive routing are key to extending network lifetime and ensuring reliable communication under dynamic conditions. Although numerous metaheuristic- and learning-based schemes have been developed to address these challenges, existing methods may suffer from premature convergence, imbalanced energy utilization, and limited generalization capability when network conditions vary, which restricts their long-term effectiveness. To address these limitations, an intelligent clustering and routing protocol called QPSODRL (Quantum Particle Swarm Optimization and Deep Reinforcement Learning), that integrates an enhanced Quantum Particle Swarm Optimization (QPSO) and Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL), is proposed in this paper. In the clustering phase based on QPSO, an entropy-guided activation strategy is introduced to dynamically switch between global exploration and local exploitation, based on the network's energy distribution entropy. Additionally, an elite-guided quantum perturbation mechanism is adopted to drive particles toward promising regions while maintaining diversity, significantly improving convergence quality. In the routing phase, a modified Dueling Double Deep Q-Network (D3QN) is extended with an advantage entropy regularization term, which encourages policy diversity and avoids overfitting, thereby increasing robustness against topology variations. Furthermore, an Enhanced Prioritized Experience Replay (E-PER) strategy is integrated to adjust sampling priorities based on temporal-difference errors, residual energy, and communication cost, accelerating policy convergence in energy-constrained environments. Extensive simulation results demonstrate that QPSODRL outperforms four state-of-the-art protocols in terms of network lifetime, load balancing, throughput, and energy consumption, validating its superiority in optimization accuracy, learning efficiency, and environmental adaptability."

This study focuses on the role of alexithymia-a condition where individuals struggle to recognize and articulate emotions and symptoms-in the detection of depression. We aimed to determine whether deep learning models could enhance the accuracy of depression detection in people with alexithymia compared to self-report scales.
We analyzed data from 194 patients with major depressive disorder and 105 community controls, employing eight large language models (LLMs) trained on transcript text from clinician-administered structured interviews using the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAMD).
Here we show that generalized logistic regression analysis indicates a positive relationship between alexithymia and depression. Using the HAMD as the gold standard, individuals with alexithymia show poorer performance on the self-reported Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale-Depression Subscale (HADS-D) in identifying depression (b = -0.37, p = .002). Four of the eight LLMs (AUCs=0.87-0.89) significantly outperform the HADS-D (AUC = 0.79) in depression detection (p <0.05). Subgroup analysis demonstrates that while LLMs achieve AUCs ranging from 0.79 to 0.96, the HADS-D only reaches an AUC of 0.35 for individuals with alexithymia.
Our findings reveal that LLMs can potentially outperform self-report scales in detecting depression, particularly in those with alexithymia. These results highlight the importance of considering patient characteristics, such as alexithymia, when detecting depression. Deep learning analyses can enhance the accuracy of clinical assessments for depression and potentially for other mental health disorders."

STimage enhances robustness by estimating gene expression distributions and quantifying both data-driven (aleatoric) and model-based (epistemic) uncertainty using an ensemble approach with foundation models. Interpretability is achieved through attribution analysis at single-cell resolution integrated with histopathological annotations, functional genes, and latent representations. We validated STimage across diverse datasets, demonstrating its performance across various platforms. STimage-predicted gene expression can stratify patient survival and predict drug response. By enabling molecular and cellular prediction from routine histology, STimage offers a powerful tool to advance digital pathology."

Four-dimensional flow magnetic resonance imaging (4D Flow MRI) holds promise for enhancing our understanding of atrial hemodynamics, but its analysis is hindered by the inherently low velocities within the chamber and the modest spatial resolution of 4D Flow MRI. Heterogeneity in acquisition protocols and MRI vendors, and the lack of standardized computational frameworks further complicates the creation of large, comparable datasets needed to assess the prognostic value of hemodynamic markers provided by 4D Flow MRI. To address these challenges, we introduce a computational framework tailored to the analysis of 4D Flow MRI in the LA, enabling the qualitative and quantitative analysis of advanced hemodynamic parameters (e.g., kinetic energy, vorticity, and pressure). We applied this framework to a diverse cohort spanning different degrees of left ventricular diastolic dysfunction to investigate the prognostic potential of these metrics. Our framework proved robustness across multicenter data of varying quality, producing high-accuracy automated segmentations. Notably, our findings show that 4D Flow MRI-derived parameters provide superior differentiation between healthy and pathological states than those available to conventional hemodynamic analysis tools."

However, generalization remains unclear because most evaluations rely on a single dataset, which risks overfitting to site-specific traffic, label taxonomies, and non-IID client mixtures. This study provides a comprehensive dataset-centric evaluation of FL-based IDS across three contemporary IoT/IIoT datasets: Edge-IIoTset (2022), CIC-IoT2023, and TII-SSRC-23 (2023), that differ in devices, feature distributions, and attack families. We benchmark three FL aggregation algorithms (FedAvg, FedProx, FedNova) with two deep learning backbones (LSTM and Transformer) to assess detection accuracy, cross-environment generalizability, convergence behavior, and communication cost. Methodologically, we construct non-IID clients by device or application type, harmonize labels to a common family-level schema, align features to the intersection set, and evaluate three regimes: in-domain, cross-dataset, and a combined multi-dataset federation. Results show that federated models approach centralized performance in-domain, with macro-F1 up to 98% and accuracies in the 92-98% range. Transformers consistently exceed LSTM by ≈1-2% points in macro-F1 at comparable communication budgets. Cross-dataset tests expose substantial degradation, with up to 30 percentage-point macro-F1 loss when models face unseen environments, underscoring the need for diverse training coverage. Combined multi-dataset federation substantially restores transfer, yielding ≈90% macro-F1 across datasets in the harmonized family-level setting. Under heterogeneous clients, FedProx improves stability by reducing round-to-round variance, while FedNova achieves target accuracy in fewer rounds and lowers communication by ≈15-25% relative to FedAvg. These findings indicate a practical recipe for deployment: prioritize attack and environment diversity through combined-dataset FL, select Transformer backbones where feasible, and use FedProx or FedNova to stabilize training and reduce communication in bandwidth-constrained IoT settings."

The study included 330 participants with axial SpA. All patients underwent whole spine MRI with short τ inversion recovery (STIR) sequence by 3T MR unit. Three independent readers identified regions of interest to locate bone marrow oedema (BMO) and performed Spondyloarthritis Research Consortium of Canada (SPARCC) scoring. Two deep learning models based on attention Unet were developed. The BMO model differentiated image with or without spinal inflammation. The vertebral body (VB)-intervertebral disc (IVD) model identified discovertebral units for localisation. The intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) and Pearson coefficient were used to evaluate agreement and correlation between scorings by human readers and deep learning-based pipeline. Performance of the models was evaluated using sensitivity, specificity, accuracy and Dice coefficient.
The ICC and the Pearson coefficient of SPARCC scores between human readers and the deep learning-based scoring pipeline were 0.80 and 0.82, respectively. The sensitivity and specificity of spinal inflammation identification were 0.90 and 0.84, respectively. The Dice coefficients were 0.81 (VB) and 0.80 (IVD) in images with spinal inflammation.
The high consistency of the scoring pipeline with human readers suggested that the deep learning-based algorithm has the potential to provide semiquantitative assessment of spinal inflammation based on SPARCC in axial SpA."

However, the standard manual approach to GTV contouring requires considerable time and is prone to inter-observer variability. Accordingly, this study presents a deep learning framework for automatic GTV contouring in HGG cases.
A modified 3D U-Net architecture was employed and trained on 469 subjects sourced from the Brain Tumor Segmentation (BraTS) 2018-2019 challenges, with multi-sequence magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to enhance feature learning. The GTV was delineated following the European Society for Radiotherapy and Oncology (ESTRO) and the European Association of Neuro-Oncology (EANO) guidelines, based on the contrast-enhancing region of the tumor on post-contrast T1-weighted images, excluding edema. This corresponds to the enhancing tumor and necrotic core labels in our dataset. The segmentation accuracy was assessed using the Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC) and the 95th-percentile Hausdorff Distance (HD95).
The proposed model yielded a DSC of 91.70% ± 4.62% (mean ± standard deviation) and an HD95 of 2.43 ± 1.30 mm, indicating a high degree of overlap with minimal boundary deviation.
The results of our study highlight the potential of deep learning as a promising and efficient solution for GTV contouring in HGGs, supporting RT planning, improving clinical workflow, and enhancing treatment accuracy."

With a focus on the prevalent psychological complications following the onset of this condition, this study aimed to explore the correlation between antenatal depression and Corona disease anxiety, personality traits, and postpartum depression during the COVID-19 pandemic.                                                           Materials and Methods:                     This cross-sectional descriptive-analytical study investigated women receiving care at health centers affiliated with Kerman University of Medical Sciences during the last month of their pregnancy and the postpartum period in 2022. Following the acquisition of informed consent, participants were assessed using various measures, including demographic and obstetric information, the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale, the Corona Disease Anxiety Scale (CDAS), and the NEO Personality Inventory-Revised during their third trimester of pregnancy. The same group of participants completed the Edinburgh Depression Scale and the Corona Disease Anxiety Scale (CDAS) 4-6 weeks after childbirth.                                                           Results and Discussion:                     There was a significant correlation between family income, unwanted pregnancy as perceived by both the mother and father, and antenatal depression. Additionally, marital satisfaction played a significant role in postpartum depression. Furthermore, antenatal depression was significantly associated with neuroticism, agreeableness, and physical symptoms related to Corona disease anxiety. Personality traits, with the exception of extroversion and conscientiousness, and various domains of Corona disease anxiety, excluding psychological symptoms, were also significantly associated with postpartum depression.                                                           Conclusion:                     During pandemics or epidemics, such as the COVID-19 outbreak, experiencing mental distress during pregnancy can contribute to mental health issues during the postpartum period. This risk is particularly true in individuals with unique personality traits, emphasizing the need for increased focus on mental health within prenatal care during these crises."

Method:                     This cross-sectional study was conducted in Kerman, Iran. Data were collected from patients who visited Afzalipour Hospital in Kerman more than twice during the COVID-19 epidemic from the end of February 2020 to March 21, 2021. We conducted two key analyses: 1. Mixed effect logistic regression was used to check the relationship between the variables and COVID-19 severity. 2. Mixed effect linear regression was used to check the relationship between the variables and the length of stay in the hospital.                                                           Results:                     The findings indicated that the most important risk factors for the severity of COVID-19 were heart diseases (OR=1.67,95%CI:1.20-2.30), increasing age (OR=2.23 for age&gt;54, 95%CI:1.70- 2.90), male gender (OR=1.47,95%CI:1.10-1.96), respiratory diseases other than asthma, and frequency of admission (OR=1.60,95%CI:1.20-2.15). All patients who underwent readmission experienced a shorter duration of hospitalization during their subsequent admission (OR=0.94,95%CI:0.91,0.96) and had a higher mortality rate (30% within 14 days, 26.6% between 14-90 days). Patients readmitted at intervals of 14-90 days and greater than 90 days exhibited lower disease severity compared to those readmitted within the 0-14 day period.                                                           Conclusion:                     Examining readmissions, the severity of COVID-19, and the length of hospital stay in affected patients are important factors for planning and allocating resources for COVID-19 management and treatment. These factors can help policymakers develop effective clinical guidelines for hospitalization or outpatient treatment of COVID-19 patients and contribute to reducing the burden of disease in the community."

Kinovea, as an accessible motion-analysis software, provides both visual and quantitative feedback. However, its application in supporting technique development among beginner athletes remains insufficiently explored. Aim: This study aims to describe the use of Kinovea in biomechanics training and examine its contribution to the awareness of kinematic characteristics and movement techniques among beginner athletes. Methods: A descriptive qualitative design involved 72 beginner athletes aged 18–25 years selected through purposive sampling. Data were collected over 16 weeks through interviews, field observations, and motion video recordings analyzed using Kinovea. Kinematic data focused on joint angles, stride behavior, and movement phases during walking, running, and the flight phase. Qualitative data were analyzed using content analysis with NVivo 12, while kinematic results were interpreted descriptively to identify performance patterns and areas for technical refinement. Result: Kinematic analysis showed coordinated joint-angle patterns across all phases. Walking analysis identified arm swing angles of 50.9°–58.8° and leg separation angles of 64.3°–67.2°, indicating a stable gait rhythm. The running analysis revealed knee angles of 68.8°–69.8° and elbow angles of 87.6°–89.1°, indicating efficient propulsive mechanics. The flight phase demonstrated knee angles of 81.2°–87.8° and elbow angles of 80.4°–88.3°, suggesting effective momentum use and postural stability. These measurements supported stride-efficiency assessment and technique evaluation. Qualitative findings revealed that Kinovea enabled athletes to interpret movement phases and identify technical inefficiencies through slow-motion and frame-by-frame visualization. Conclusion: Kinovea supports basic motion analysis by providing clear kinematic information and helping beginner athletes observe and refine their movement techniques. The findings also offer practical value for coaches by enabling more precise identification of inefficient patterns and guiding targeted corrections during early-stage training."

Jedrzejczyk,10.3389/fmedt.2025.1687873,2026-01-15,Frontiers in Medical Technology,"Background Ischaemic mitral regurgitation (IMR) is a significant complication of myocardial infarction associated with increased morbidity and mortality. Large animal models are essential for testing novel mitral valve therapies, yet no consensus exists on the optimal infarction strategy to induce IMR. Methods A systematic review and meta-analysis were conducted to evaluate infarction strategies used to induce IMR in large animal models. Studies were identified through database searches and screened according to predefined inclusion criteria. Subgroups were stratified by infarction strategy. Proportions of IMR development and severity were analysed using a random-effects model, and reporting quality was assessed across studies. Results Forty-four studies met the inclusion criteria, comprising 869 animals across 52 subgroups. Ethanol injection in select obtuse marginal arteries (EtOH-OMx strategy) yielded the highest rate of IMR development (87%, 95% CI: 79%–96%) with the lowest associated mortality. Ligation of obtuse marginal arteries under cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB-OM2, OM3 and CPB-OMx) demonstrated high mortality and inconsistent IMR severity. Reporting quality was variable, with frequent omissions regarding sex, randomisation, and adverse event documentation. Conclusions This review identifies the EtOH-OMx strategy as a promising method for inducing IMR in large animal models, demonstrating favourable performance within the limitations of available data."
OpenAlex,mitral regurgitation,Hypertension and Valvular Heart Disease: An Overview of a Complex and Clinically Meaningful Relationship,Roxana Darabont; Diana Mihalcea; Dragos Vinereanu,10.3390/life16010125,2026-01-14,Life,"The overlooked relationship between hypertension (HTN) and valvular heart disease (VHD) has been brought to wider attention by large-scale population studies and the latest guidelines. Approximately 45% of patients with VHD have been diagnosed with HTN. This association increases with age, but cannot be explained solely by the rising prevalence of both conditions. HTN promotes the onset or worsening of VHD by mechanically stressing the valves and by modified blood flow dynamics through increased filling pressures and afterload. It has been shown that a 20 mmHg rise in BP triples the risk of aortic valvular disease and mitral regurgitation. This review will address the impact of HTN on the occurrence and progression of valvular lesions, its effect on the prognosis of patients with VHD, and the available data on blood pressure management. As long as relatively well-documented data on aortic valve disease are available, studies are still needed to clarify target blood pressure values under therapy and the most appropriate drug classes for mitral regurgitation, especially in its primary forms."
OpenAlex,mitral regurgitation,Silent cardiac burden: Echocardiographic abnormalities and their predictors in kidney transplant candidates and their impact on graft function,Nihal Mohammed Sadagah; Muhammad Abdul Mabood Khalil; Hinda Hassan Khideer Mahmood; Ibtisam Ali Alghamdi; Ghada Abdulrahman Buridi; Salem H Al-Qurashi,10.5500/wjt.v16.i1.110628,2026-01-14,World Journal of Transplantation,"BACKGROUND An echocardiogram is an essential tool in the evaluation of potential kidney transplant recipients (KTRs). Despite cardiac clearance, potential KTRs still have structural and functional abnormalities. Identifying the prevalence of these abnormalities and understanding their predictors is vital for optimizing pre-transplant risk stratification and improving post-transplant outcomes. AIM To determine the prevalence of left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH), left ventricular systolic dysfunction (LVSD), diastolic dysfunction (DD), pulmonary hypertension (PH), and their predictors, and to assess their impact on graft function in pre-transplant candidates. METHODS The study included all successful transplant candidates older than 14 who had a baseline echocardiogram. Binary logistic regression models were constructed to identify factors associated with LVH, LVSD, DD, and PH. RESULTS Out of 259 patients, LVH was present in 64% (166), 12% (31) had LVSD, 27.5% (71) had DD, and 66 (25.5%) had PH. Independent predictors of LVH included male gender [odds ratio (OR): 2.51; 95%CI: 1.17–5.41 P = 0.02], PH (OR = 2.07; 95%CI: 1.11–3.86; P = 0.02), DD (OR: 2.47; 95%CI: 1.29–4.73; P = 0.006), and dyslipidemia (OR = 1.94; 95%CI: 1.07–3.53; P = 0.03). Predictors for LVSD included patients with DD (OR = 3.3, 95% CI: 1.41–7.81; P = 0.006) and a family history of coronary artery disease (OR = 4.50, 95%CI: 1.33–15.20; P = 0.015). Peritoneal dialysis was an independent predictor for DD (OR = 10.03; 95%CI: 1.71-58.94, P = 0.011). The presence of LVH (OR = 3.32, 95%CI: 1.05–10.55, P = 0.04) and mild to moderate or moderate to severe mitral regurgitation (OR = 4.63, 95%CI: 1.45–14.78, P = 0.01) were significant factors associated with PH. These abnormalities had no significant impact on estimated glomerular filtration at discharge, 6 months, 1 year, or 2 years post-transplant. CONCLUSION Significant echocardiographic abnormalities persist in a potential transplant candidate despite cardiac clearance, although they don’t affect future graft function. Understanding the risk factors associated with these abnormalities may help clinicians address these factors pre- and post-transplant to achieve better outcomes."
OpenAlex,mitral regurgitation,Leaflet Lengths and Commissural Dimensions as the Primary Determinants of Orifice Area in Mitral Regurgitation: A Sobol Sensitivity Analysis,Ashkan Bagherzadeh; Vahid Keshavarzzadeh; Patrick Hoang; Steve Kreuzer; Jiang Yao; Lik Chuan Lee; Ghassan S. Kassab; Julius Guccione,10.3390/bioengineering13010097,2026-01-14,Bioengineering,"Mitral valve orifice area is a key functional metric that depends on complex geometric features, motivating a systematic assessment of the relative influence of these parameters. In this study, the mitral valve geometry is parameterized using twelve geometric variables, and a global sensitivity analysis based on Sobol indices is performed to quantify their relative importance. Because global sensitivity analysis requires many simulations, a Gaussian Process regressor is developed to efficiently predict the orifice area from the geometric inputs. Structural simulations of the mitral valve are carried out in Abaqus, focusing exclusively on the valve mechanics. The predicted distribution of orifice areas obtained from the Gaussian Process shows strong agreement with the ground-truth simulation results, and similar agreement is observed when only the most influential geometric parameters are varied. The analysis identifies a subset of geometric parameters that dominantly govern the mitral valve orifice area and can be reliably extracted from medical imaging modalities such as echocardiography. These findings establish a direct link between echocardiographic measurements and physics-based simulations and provide a framework for patient-specific assessment of mitral valve mechanics, with potential applications in guiding interventional strategies such as MitraClip placement."
OpenAlex,mitral regurgitation,Quantifying Mitral Regurgitation in MVP: The Added Value of Three-Dimensional Continuity Equation,Aoues Abdelkader; Amro Alsaid; Ralph Matar; Prajakta Phatak; Janaki Rami Reddy Manne; Z. Wang,10.1093/ehjimp/qyag009,2026-01-13,European Heart Journal - Imaging Methods and Practice,"Abstract Background Quantifying mitral regurgitation (MR) in patients with mitral valve prolapse (MVP) is particularly challenging due to the complex mitral valve anatomy, presence of multiple eccentric jets, and non-holosystolic regurgitation. The continuity equation (CE) offers a potentially more accurate method for assessing MR regurgitant volume in this population. Methods We evaluated patients with MVP and at least moderate MR. Regurgitant volumes (RVol) were quantified using the three-dimensional continuity equation (3D-CE) with direct area measurements and compared with RVol derived from the conventional diameter-based continuity equation (D-CE) and cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR). Results Among 72 patients (mean age 59.7 years, 65% female), bileaflet MVP was present in 86% and MAD in 96%. Multiple MR jets (32%) limited PISA accuracy (r=0.40 with CMR). Compared with 3D-CE, D-CE overestimated RVol by 19 mL, though correlation remained strong (r=0.74). In 21 paired studies, 3D-CE and CMR showed excellent agreement (r=0.94, bias +2.1 mL). Severity grading showed strong concordance, with most discrepancies within one category. Conclusions In patients with MVP, incorporating 3D annular measurements into 3D-CE improves agreement with CMR-based volumetric assessment and mitigates overestimation associated with D-CE and PISA-based methods. This approach may be particularly valuable in patients with moderate or moderate-severe MR, in whom conventional echocardiographic parameters are frequently discordant, and supports the role of integrative multimodality imaging in refining MR severity assessment and guiding clinical management. Larger prospective studies are warranted to confirm these findings."
OpenAlex,mitral regurgitation,Case Report: Emergency mitral valve plasty in an unstable dog with left atrial rupture secondary to myxomatous mitral valve disease,Tomoki Wada; Ryosuke TAKEMURA; Hideki Yotsuida; M Ohashi; Naoki Miyashita; On Uezawa; Takuya Mori,10.3389/fvets.2025.1653646,2026-01-12,Frontiers in Veterinary Science,"Objective To describe the medical and surgical management of recurrent left atrial rupture (LAR) in a dog with severe mitral regurgitation (MR). This report focuses on challenges encountered with pericardiocentesis, the role of hemodynamic support, and the importance of invasive blood pressure monitoring. Case summary An 11-year-old, weighing 2.9 kg, male Chihuahua was scheduled for mitral valve plasty due to severe MR. The dog developed acute collapse and dyspnea and was diagnosed with LAR and pulmonary edema; pericardiocentesis was withheld due to relatively stable hemodynamics. Despite inotropic support and diuretics administration, a second LAR occurred the following day during transport for echocardiographic examination, with a large intrapericardial clot preventing pericardiocentesis and causing shock. Although fluid therapy and ephedrine administration improved blood pressure, invasive blood pressure monitoring and strict rest were subsequently employed to maintain a lower systolic pressure, enabling safe anesthetic induction. Under cardiopulmonary bypass, clot removal was performed. Intraoperatively, due to inadequate venous return, the heart enlarged and a third LAR occurred, necessitating repair of the rupture site with a pericardial patch under cardioplegic arrest alongside chordae tendineae reconstruction. Postoperatively, the dog developed dyspnea potentially related to lung injury, transfusion effects, or residual pulmonary edema, which resolved with medical management. Marked thrombocytopenia emerged soon after switching antibiotics but improved rapidly following corticosteroid administration and discontinuation of the suspected antibiotic. The dog was discharged in good condition and remained clinically stable 1 year later. Conclusion This case provides a detailed account for the stepwise medical and anesthetic management of recurrent LAR secondary to severe MR. During conservative treatment, pericardiocentesis was not always effective, particularly in the presence of intrapericardial clots, which might have interfered with drainage. In the setting of cardiac tamponade, increasing pre- and after-load along with positive inotropic support appeared to contribute to temporary hemodynamic stabilization. Invasive arterial pressure monitoring allowed for stable hemodynamic control and safe anesthetic induction, underscoring its importance for preoperative management. Furthermore, the third intraoperative rupture was successfully repaired using a pericardial patch, which achieved effective hemostasis and demonstrated its potential value as a surgical option for LAR repair."
OpenAlex,mitral regurgitation,Adult Presentation of Congenital Mitral Stenosis: The Challenges of a True Parachute Mitral Valve,Maria Jose Lizano; Álvaro Herrera; Eduardo Induni; Félix Eduardo Solís; Tulio Caldonazo,10.1055/a-2785-8203,2026-01-12,The Thoracic and Cardiovascular Surgeon Reports,"Background: Parachute mitral valve (PMV) is a rare congenital anomaly where all chordae tendineae insert into a single papillary muscle, causing stenosis or regurgitation. Adult presentations are uncommon and often underdiagnosed. Case Description: A 35-year-old male presented with exertional dyspnea. ETT demonstrated severe mitral stenosis, reduced ejection fraction, bicuspid aortic valve, and pulmonary hypertension. Intraoperative findings confirmed true PMV. Due to anatomical complexity, a 27-mm mechanical prosthesis replacement was performed successfully, with rapid postoperative recovery. Conclusion: Adult PMV requires high clinical suspicion and often surgical confirmation. Valve replacement is effective in complex cases, emphasizing the importance of early diagnosis and intervention."

Artificial intelligence (AI) may enable rapid, point-of-care cardiac assessment using simplified imaging protocols. Objectives To evaluate whether a deep learning model can accurately detect significant valvular and ventricular dysfunction using only a single two-dimensional apical four-chamber echocardiographic view, including images acquired by non-cardiologists with handheld ultrasound devices. Methods We retrospectively analyzed 120,127 echocardiographic studies from a tertiary medical center to train and validate a deep learning model for identifying moderate-or-greater mitral or tricuspid regurgitation, right ventricular dysfunction, and reduced left ventricular ejection fraction (≤40%). A prospective cohort of 209 patients underwent handheld point-of-care cardiac ultrasound performed by non-cardiologist physicians, with same-hospitalization comprehensive echocardiography as the reference standard. Results In retrospective testing, model areas under the curve (AUCs) were 0.883 for mitral regurgitation, 0.913 for tricuspid regurgitation, 0.940 for right ventricular dysfunction, and 0.982 for reduced ejection fraction. In the prospective cohort, AUCs were 0.72, 0.87, 0.95, and 0.97 for the same respective targets. Conclusions A single-view deep learning model demonstrated strong diagnostic accuracy for detecting significant valvular and ventricular dysfunction across both standard and handheld ultrasound acquisitions. This approach may facilitate rapid, scalable cardiac function screening by non-cardiologists in diverse clinical environments. Clinical Trial Registration identifier NCT05455541."
OpenAlex,mitral regurgitation,Changes in echocardiographic parameters and strain and outcomes following mitral valve repair: insight from new mitral regurgitation classifications,Roslan Aslannif; Si Ling Soh; Yee Sin Tey; Am Haris Norhaliza; Teo Jassie; Lynne Murray Rowina; Kee Soon Chong; Kian Boon Wong; Dillon Jeswant; Mazeni Alwi; Mohd Ghazi Azmee,10.3389/fcvm.2025.1666071,2026-01-12,Frontiers in Cardiovascular Medicine,"Introduction Mitral valve repair is a cornerstone treatment for mitral regurgitation (MR), but outcomes across various etiologies remain incompletely understood. Therefore, this study aimed to comprehensively assess the outcomes of mitral valve repair across different MR etiologies, including primary MR, left ventricle functional MR (LVFMR), ischemic MR, left atrial functional MR (LAFMR), and rheumatic MR, by examining in-hospital, short-term, and medium-term outcomes, as well as the change in cardiac function through echocardiographic parameters and strain analysis. Methods This retrospective study included 911 patients who underwent mitral valve repair at a single center from 2015 to 2021. Echocardiographic and strain analyses were performed preoperatively and at 6 months post-surgery. Mortality outcomes were assessed at in-hospital and at 6, 12, and 51 months postoperatively. Results There were significant differences in outcomes across MR etiologies. The primary and rheumatic groups demonstrated the lowest mortality rates, whereas the LVFMR, LAFMR, and ischemic groups exhibited markedly higher mortality, both in the early postoperative period and during long-term follow-up. Echocardiographic analysis showed improvements in cardiac dimensions and volumes, but concurrent declines in myocardial function, particularly in ejection fraction, global longitudinal strain, and left atrial reservoir strain. Discussion This study highlights the importance of etiology-specific risk stratification. While mitral valve repair effectively reduces MR, myocardial recovery may be delayed or insufficient in certain subgroups, especially those with pre-existing myocardial dysfunction. Tailored therapeutic strategies that address the multifactorial nature of functional and ischemic MR are warranted to improve long-term outcomes."

However, the long-term clinical impact of MR persistence or progression has not been well stratified. We aimed to evaluate the proportion, clinical benefits, and prognostic value of maintaining mild MR one year after M-TEER. Methods and Results This multicenter registry-based analysis included 1,865 patients who achieved mild MR at discharge following M-TEER. At one year, patients were classified as having stable MR (≤ mild) or worsening MR (≥ moderate). The frequency of left atrial (LA) and left ventricular (LV) reverse remodeling and tricuspid regurgitation (TR) improvement were assessed from baseline to one year. Clinical endpoints—including all-cause mortality and heart failure hospitalization—were evaluated beyond one year after M-TEER up to two years. Worsening MR occurred in 28.4% of patients. Compared with the worsening MR group, the stable MR group demonstrated significantly more frequent LA and LV reverse remodeling (38.4% vs. 28.1%, and 44.7% vs. 31.1%, respectively; both p&amp;lt;0.001). Improvement in TR (≥ grade 1) was also more prevalent in the stable MR group (32.4% vs. 20.6%, p&amp;lt;0.001). Worsening MR was independently associated with increased risk of adverse clinical outcomes (hazard ratio: 2.02; 95% confidence interval: 1.26–3.23; p=0.003). Conclusions Maintaining MR within mild at one-year post-M-TEER is associated with favorable cardiac reverse remodeling and improved clinical prognosis. These findings underscore the importance of long-term MR surveillance and its implications for outcome optimization following M-TEER."
OpenAlex,mitral regurgitation,Successful use of immunoadsorption therapy in advanced dilated cardiomyopathy: A case report,Rendan Zhang; Lvwen Ning; Y. M. Liu; Zhixiong Tan; Lu Kong; Xiaoqing Quan; Xiehui Chen,10.1097/md.0000000000047080,2026-01-09,Medicine,"Rationale: Dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) is a major cause of chronic heart failure, and some patients continue to deteriorate despite guideline-directed medical therapy. Immunoadsorption (IA), which removes pathogenic autoantibodies, has been proposed as a potential adjunctive therapy, but its clinical use remains limited. This case illustrates the potential benefits of IA in advanced, treatment-refractory DCM. Patient concerns: A 53-year-old woman with a 9-year history of DCM presented with recurrent chest tightness and dyspnea. Despite long-term guideline-directed medical therapy, her symptoms progressively worsened. Diagnoses: The patient had chronic DCM initially diagnosed in the peripartum period, with a left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) of 11% at onset. Before IA, echocardiography demonstrated severe systolic dysfunction (LVEF 22%–24%) with significant mitral regurgitation, and laboratory evaluation showed markedly elevated pro-BNP (4454 pg/mL). Interventions: The patient underwent two sessions of immunoadsorption in September 2024, followed by high-dose intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) as per standard protocols. Outcomes: Following treatment, her symptoms improved, pro-BNP decreased to 2109 pg/mL, and repeat echocardiography showed an increase in LVEF to 29.2%. Lessons: This case suggests that immunoadsorption may offer clinical benefit in patients with advanced, refractory DCM. While promising, IA remains experimental and requires further investigation in larger, controlled studies."

Teerlink; John J V McMurray,10.1093/ejhf/xuag007,2026-01-09,European Journal of Heart Failure,"Abstract Aims Given the emerging role of transcatheter valve repair in HFrEF patients with moderate/severe secondary mitral regurgitation (MR), we evaluated the prevalence and outcomes related to MR in the GALACTIC-HF trial. Methods and results The randomized GALACTIC-HF trial compared the efficacy and safety of omecamtiv mecarbil (OM) to placebo in 8,232 patients with HFrEF, with a primary composite outcome of a first HF event or cardiovascular death. Of 7998 patients (97.2%) with baseline data on MR, 5782 (72.3%) had no MR, 970 (12.1%) had mild MR, and 1221 (15.3%) had moderate MR (only 25 had severe MR). Patients with moderate MR had a higher risk of the primary outcome than those without MR (adjusted HR 1.11; 95% CI 1.01–1.23); risk was not higher in patients with mild MR. The association between moderate MR and the primary outcome was most prominent in patients with less severe HF (milder NYHA class, higher LVEF, and lower NT-proBNP) compared to more severe HF. In adjusted analyses, MR was not associated with mortality, and the results of all analyses remained consistent after including patients with severe MR. The beneficial treatment effect of OM versus placebo on clinical outcomes was not modified by MR. Over 80% of patients with moderate/severe MR fulfilled the broad inclusion criteria for COAPT and RESHAPE-HF2. Conclusions In GALACTIC-HF, almost 15% of HFrEF patients had moderate MR, which was associated with a higher risk of the primary outcome.

OpenAlex,mitral regurgitation,Novel characterization of MRAS mutation-associated Noonan syndrome: Mild adult-onset hypertrophic cardiomyopathy combined with infective endocarditis: A case report,Xiaoli Mou; Yong Liu; Y Z Zhang; Xinhe Cheng; Junshuai Feng,10.1097/md.0000000000046340,2026-01-09,Medicine,"Rationale: Noonan syndrome (NS) is a RASopathy most frequently associated with mutations in HRAS, NRAS, KRAS, and RRAS2. The contribution of MRAS variants to NS pathogenesis remains poorly characterized, and infective endocarditis (IE) is extremely rare in patients with NS. Patient concerns: A 22-year-old woman presented with typical dysmorphic features of NS, including short stature, broad forehead, hypertelorism, low-set posteriorly rotated ears, and a broad neck. She developed fever and progressive exertional dyspnea. Diagnoses: Echocardiography demonstrated obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy with vegetation located in the left ventricular outflow tract. Blood cultures grew Streptococcus mutans. Whole-exome sequencing identified a heterozygous MRAS c.203C&gt;T (p.Thr68Ile) mutation affecting a highly conserved residue among RASopathy-associated GTPases, supporting the diagnosis of MRAS-associated Noonan syndrome complicated by infective endocarditis. Interventions: Antibiotic therapy was escalated to intravenous gentamicin (60 mg daily) combined with ceftriaxone in accordance with the 2023 European Society of Cardiology guidelines for infective endocarditis. Outcomes: After one month of intravenous gentamicin and ceftriaxone therapy, fever resolved, and follow-up echocardiography showed disappearance of the vegetation. Residual cardiac abnormalities persisted, including marked left ventricular hypertrophy with left ventricular outflow tract obstruction, left atrial enlargement, moderate mitral regurgitation, patent foramen ovale with minor shunting, and impaired diastolic function. Exertional dyspnea remained despite resolution of the infection. Lessons: This case expands the genotypic spectrum of Noonan syndrome by supporting MRAS mutations as pathogenic drivers. It also identifies infective endocarditis as a previously unreported complication in MRAS-associated NS with outflow tract obstruction, highlighting the importance of careful cardiac surveillance in patients with RASopathies."
OpenAlex,mitral regurgitation,Effects of Levosimendan in Patients with Severe Mitral Insufficiency and Left Ventricular Dysfunction Undergoing Transcatheter Edge-to-Edge Repair: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis,Stephanie Gladys Kühne; Deborah Penet; Simon Wölbert; Eva Harmel; Damyan Penev; Sebastien Elvinger; Mauro Chiarito; Philip W. J. Raake; Dario Bongiovanni,10.3390/jcdd13010040,2026-01-09,Journal of Cardiovascular Development and Disease,"Severe mitral regurgitation (MR) is one of the most common valvular heart diseases and is frequently associated with advanced left ventricular (LV) systolic dysfunction. Transcatheter edge-to-edge repair (TEER) offers effective symptom relief but may induce abrupt hemodynamic changes leading to afterload mismatch and acute LV failure. Levosimendan may help mitigate this complication by improving contractility, yet evidence supporting its use in this setting is scarce. Therefore, the aim of this study was to systematically evaluate the evidence on the effects of Levosimendan in patients with severe MR and LV dysfunction undergoing TEER. We performed a comprehensive search of PubMed, Embase, Scopus, and Google Scholar. Primary outcomes were postprocedural LV ejection fraction (LVEF) and systolic pulmonary artery pressure (sPAP). Secondary outcomes included procedural success, procedure duration, and in-hospital complications. Five studies comprising 315 patients (n = 141 Levosimendan, n = 174 controls) met the inclusion criteria. Pooled analysis showed no significant difference in postprocedural LVEF between Levosimendan-treated patients and controls (mean difference 0.45%, 95% CI [−1.46–2.35] p = 0.65) and no significant change from baseline. Similarly, postprocedural sPAP did not differ significantly. Procedural success was higher with Levosimendan, and procedure duration was shorter. These hypothesis-generating findings highlight the need for larger, prospective randomized trials to clarify the role of Levosimendan in this setting."

Traditional management strategies follow a step-by-step approach, prioritizing guideline-directed medical therapy (GDMT) and reserving interventional (surgical or percutaneous) options only in case of persistent symptoms or worsening HF after GDMT. However, greater experience with the use of percutaneous procedures, even in high-risk patients, could support a more integrated approach, which exploits the synergistic effects of medical and interventional therapies to increase the tolerability of one vs the other, thereby improving quality of life and outcomes through their synergic effects. This expert opinion paper summarizes current data and evolving practices in the management of VHD in patients with HF, including secondary mitral regurgitation, aortic stenosis, aortic regurgitation, and tricuspid regurgitation."
