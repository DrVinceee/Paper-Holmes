Comparative outcome data for balloon-expandable valves (BEV) and self-expanding valves (SEV) in this population remain scarce.
This retrospective single-center study evaluated 246 consecutive subjects with left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) < 50% who underwent transfemoral TAVR between January 2015 and June 2025. Clinical, echocardiographic, and procedural characteristics were compared between BEV (n = 96) and SEV (n = 150) recipients. Long-term all-cause mortality served as the primary endpoint.
Individuals treated with BEV were older (78.8 +- 7.9 vs. 75.7 +- 9.8 years; P = 0.019) and demonstrated higher EuroSCORE II (European System for Cardiac Operative Risk Evaluation II) values (24.9 +- 6.2% vs. 22.2 +- 15.8%; P = 0.01). Periprocedural and in-hospital clinical outcomes, including mortality, vascular complications, and pacemaker requirement, were comparable between groups. SEV implantation yielded lower post-procedural transvalvular gradients (mean 7.8 +- 4.0 mmHg vs. 9.6 +- 4.1 mmHg; P = 0.001). Although crude mortality was observed more frequently among BEV patients (50.0% vs. 36.0%; P = 0.041), Kaplan-Meier survival curves showed no survival difference (log-rank P = 0.92). In multivariable Cox regression, predictors of long-term mortality included older age (hazard ratio [HR] 1.05; P = 0.007), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) (HR: 2.64; P < 0.001), coronary artery disease (HR: 2.08; P = 0.018), lower serum albumin (HR: 0.63; P = 0.011), and lower hemoglobin (HR: 0.84; P = 0.023); valve type was not predictive.
In patients with LVSD undergoing TAVR, BEV and SEV provided comparable procedural and long-term outcomes. Although SEV yielded lower postoperative gradients, valve type did not affect survival. Future studies with larger samples and higher use of new-generation devices are warranted to refine valve selection in this high-risk group."

We aimed to determine the incidence and risk factors for CVE at 30 days and 1 year after TAVI in a large, real-world patient cohort and evaluate the association of these events with all-cause mortality at 1 year.
All consecutive patients undergoing TAVI at a single centre between April 2008 and February 2024 were included in the analysis. CVE were defined as a composite of stroke and transient ischaemic attack.
One thousand and three patients (mean age 81.8 ± 7.0 years, 52.6% male, median EuroSCORE II 6% [Q1 = 3.51%; Q3 = 10.9%]) underwent TAVI with a self-expandable valve (SEV) (n = 275; 27.4%) or balloon-expandable valve (BEV) (n = 728; 72.6%). The cumulative incidence of CVE was 3.6% (95% confidence interval (95% CI) = [2.6%; 4.9%], n = 36) at 30 days (77.8% within 48 h) and 6.2% (95% CI = [4.8%; 7.8%], n = 62) at 1 year. Risk factors associated with a lower risk of CVE at 30 days included BEV vs. SEV (OR 0.32 [0.16-0.63], p = 0.0009) and larger baseline aortic valve area (AVA) (ORUnit = 0.1 cm2 0.74 [0.61-0.91], p = 0.0035), while the risk was higher in the case of new-onset atrial fibrillation (AF) (OR 3.19 [1.18-8.59], p = 0.0218), diabetes (OR 2.00 [1.01-3.97], p = 0.0484), and conversion to sternotomy (OR 16.57 [4.62-59.48], p < 0.0001). Analysis at 1-year follow-up identified the same associations. Finally, the occurrence of CVE significantly increased 1-year all-cause mortality (OR 2.44 [1.32-4.50], p = 0.0045).
CVE after TAVI were associated with double the odds of 1-year all-cause mortality. Risk factors associated with CVE include the use of a SEV, new-onset AF, diabetes, conversion to sternotomy, and a smaller AVA."

This shift raises important questions about valve durability, reintervention strategies, and long-term outcomes compared with surgical aortic valve replacement. Younger patients often present with unique anatomical challenges, including bicuspid aortic valves, and are expected to outlive their first valve prosthesis, making lifetime management a central concern. While new valve technologies show promise, long-term data remain limited. Careful patient selection, shared decision-making, and ongoing prospective studies are essential to guide the role of TAVR in this population."

Digital health,"There is a lack of studies investigating the pathophysiologic and phenotypic distinctiveness of aortic stenosis (AS). This heterogeneity has important implications for identifying optimal intervention timing and potential medical management. This study seeks to identify phenogroups of AS using unsupervised machine learning to improve risk stratification.
A total of 349 patients with asymptomatic AS from the PROGRESSA study were included in this analysis. Echocardiographic, clinical and blood sample data were used in the unsupervised clustering process. Longitudinal echocardiographic data were used to evaluate AS progression. Five clusters of patients were revealed using 18 variables selected by an unsupervised machine learning algorithm. Amongst them, aortic valvular phenotype, mean gradient, peak jet velocity (Vpeak), and left ventricle stroke volume were selected as discriminatory variables. Following the clustering process, characteristics differed between clusters, including age, body mass index, and sex ratio (all P < 0.001). Of note, cluster 1 showed higher AS severity at baseline with significantly higher initial Vpeak (344 [314; 376] cm/s) and calcium score (1257 [806; 1837] UA) (P < 0.001). Patients from cluster 1 had a faster AS progression (progression of Vpeak = 22 [9; 39] cm/s/year), and calcium score (213 [111; 307] UA/year) (P < 0.001). Cluster 1 was also associated with a higher composite risk of mortality and aortic valve replacement when adjusted for age, sex, and baseline AS severity (P < 0.001).
Artificial intelligence-guided phenotypic classification revealed 5 distinct groups and enhanced risk stratification of patients with AS. This approach may be useful to optimize and individualize medical and interventional management of AS."

While Impella-supported high-risk PCI (HRPCI) has demonstrated improved outcomes, its safety in patients with AS remains inadequately established.
We evaluated the effectiveness and safety of Impella support in patients with AS undergoing HRPCI.
Patients from the PROTECT III study (NCT04136392), a single-arm, FDA-audited, multicenter investigation of Impella-supported HRPCI, were assessed. AS severity was classified as none/trivial, mild, moderate, or severe. The primary outcome was 90-day major adverse cardiac and cerebrovascular events [MACCE, defined as the composite of all-cause mortality, MI, stroke/transient ischemic attack (TIA), and revascularization]. Secondary outcomes included in-hospital complications, stroke/TIA, and vascular complications requiring surgery.
Of the 594 patients with available echocardiographic data, 490 had none/trivial AS, while 34, 24, and 46 had mild, moderate, or severe AS, respectively. Patients with AS were older, had fewer incidences of diabetes, were more likely to have left main disease, and had higher left ventricular ejection fraction. Severely calcified lesions and atherectomy were more frequent among patients with moderate or severe AS. No significant differences were observed in PCI-related complications, stroke/TIA, and 30-day or 90-day MACCE across AS severity groups. However, transfusion rates were higher in patients with AS.
In patients undergoing Impella-supported HRPCI, 90-day MACCE and PCI-related complications were similar across all levels of AS severity. These findings suggest that the procedure is safe in this complex, high-risk population.

We aimed to evaluate the impact of a CVC in managing the treatment pathway of patients undergoing TAVI across Europe before and after implementing 8 Benchmark best practices.
The BENCHMARK registry (ClinicalTrials NCT04579445) was a multicenter international study of patients with severe symptomatic aortic stenosis undergoing TAVI with balloon-expandable valves across 28 European centers. Primary outcomes were hospital and intensive care length of stay (LoS). The secondary outcome was 30-day patient safety.
Of 2323 patients, 1262 were treated at centers without a pre-existing CVC and 1061 at centers with a pre-existing CVC; propensity matching resulted in 891 matched pairs. The total procedural time was significantly reduced in both groups (p < 0.001) after implementing Benchmark best practices. Hospital LoS was lower before Benchmark when a CVC was present and was significantly shorter in both groups following implementation (p < 0.001), as was the critical care LoS (p < 0.001). The presence of a CVC did not affect safety outcomes but was associated with a reduced risk of major vascular bleeding when combined with Benchmark best practices. Patient satisfaction was higher in centers with a pre-existing CVC (p < 0.001).
The addition of a CVC to the multidisciplinary team and their sustained contributions to processes of care align with the implementation of Benchmark practices, significantly decrease the health service requirements of TAVI patients, and are associated with improved patient-reported experiences."

However, the decision to continue anticoagulation therapy during the TAVR perioperative period and the optimal regimen for postoperative anticoagulation therapy remain debatable.
We searched the PubMed, EMBASE, MEDLINE, and Cochrane Library databases from their date of establishment to September 2024. We evaluated the choice of anticoagulation regimen in the TAVR perioperative and postoperative period. The primary outcomes were stroke, major bleeding, all-cause death, and net adverse clinical events (NACEs). The secondary outcomes were any bleeding, life-threatening bleeding, thrombotic events, and cardiovascular death. We conducted a meta-analysis with a RR and 95% CI. We performed subgroup analyses based on the follow-up duration, study design, and whether oral antiplatelet drugs (OAP) were used.
We compared four studies with peri-procedural continuation or discontinuation of oral anticoagulants (OACs). We did not observe a difference between the two groups with major bleeding, stroke, all-cause death, and NACEs (P > 0.05). Seventeen studies compared the effects of direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) and vitamin K antagonists (VKAs) after TAVR. The risk of NACEs (RR: 0.84, 95% CI :0.71-0.99, P = 0.04) and cardiovascular death (RR: 0.78, 95% CI: 0.69-0.87, P < 0.0001) was significantly lower in the DOACs than in the VKAs, but there were no statistically significant differences between the two groups with other outcomes. In the subgroup analysis, the beneficial effects of DOACs on NACEs were observed in the early postoperative (P < 0.05). During the long-term follow-up time after TAVR, DOACs had a lower risk of all-cause mortality and cardiovascular death compared to VKAs (P < 0.05), but an increased risk of any bleeding (P < 0.05). In RCTs, the risk of any bleeding owing to DOACs was higher (P < 0.05). In cohort studies, DOACs led to lower NACEs and cardiovascular death (P < 0.05). When administered in combination with OAP drugs, DOACs posed a lower risk for cardiovascular death and all-cause death than VKAs (P < 0.05). If not administered in combination with OAP drugs, DOACs posed a lower risk for all-cause death (P < 0.05).
In patients undergoing TAVR with established indications for OACs, periprocedural continuation of OACs may offer comparable clinical outcomes to temporary discontinuation. Furthermore, DOACs after TAVR appear to be associated with more favorable clinical outcomes than VKAs, although this benefit must be weighed against a potentially increased risk of bleeding. Further large-scale RCTs are warranted to validate these findings."

Despite advances, stroke remains a serious complication, impacting morbidity, mortality, and long-term cognitive function, thus the need for effective prevention strategies.
Based on a targeted review of the PubMed literature, this review addresses mechanisms and risk factors for stroke after TAVR and evaluates current preventive approaches. Cerebral embolic protection devices (CEPDs), particularly the Sentinel system, are discussed alongside other devices. Antithrombotic strategies before, during, and after TAVR are also reviewed, emphasizing the balance between thromboembolic protection and bleeding risk in an elderly population.
While some studies suggest CEPDs may reduce stroke, randomized trials have not confirmed broad and robust benefit, and high cost limits routine adoption. Future work should focus on high-risk subgroups, device refinement, and large-scale trials. For now, individualized antithrombotic therapy and selective CEPD use remain central to stroke prevention in TAVR."

Nested, longitudinal, qualitative substudy of an ongoing randomised controlled trial (RCT) (NCT04204915) testing early intervention (EI) versus watchful waiting (WW) in patients with asymptomatic severe AS.
Six select UK sites of the RCT.
Select participants of the RCT, their next-of-kin and some who declined RCT participation.
73 interviews were conducted, with 41 participants.Few knew much about AS before diagnosis. Uncertainty and the need for reliable information regarding symptoms and progress was a significant problem.While some expressed unease at a major intervention for an asymptomatic condition, there were no outright objections to the idea.Those who declined participation in the RCT did so for personal reasons, for example, their home circumstances did not permit the required period of recovery or they felt too old to risk intervention.Reasons for accepting early intervention included the belief that the condition was serious and likely to deteriorate, and so better to have the intervention before such deterioration, as well as avoiding long waiting lists. Trusting clinicians' judgement played a part in some decisions. Patients also wanted choice in the type of intervention received.The longitudinal interviews (n=32) showed satisfaction in the early intervention group despite some problems in the the early recovery phase, especially for those undergoing surgical AVR.
Where evidence supports major intervention for an asymptomatic condition, patients are likely to accept the offer, although personal circumstances play an important role in decision-making. Where a condition is not well known to the public, such as AS, patients rely on clinicians and other resources to help decide. Liaison with patient groups in developing shared decision-making resources may help with complex decisions.

It demonstrates that not all aortic diseases are amenable to endovascular treatment and that open surgical treatment remains highly important, especially in younger patients with hereditary aortic diseases."

Cardiovascular Imaging,"Assessing cardiac function is critical for managing cardiovascular disease, guiding treatment, monitoring progression, and risk stratification. While left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) is firmly established, it has limitations. Myocardial contraction fraction (MCF) - the ratio of stroke volume to myocardial volume, is simple to compute without additional analysis and offers a promising alternative to LVEF.
MCF was assessed across four datasets spanning healthy controls and chronic structural cardiac disease, with direct comparison to LVEF. Association between age, sex and MCF were investigated in 3,541 healthy subjects from the UK Biobank and sex-specific reference ranges derived. Several cohorts were recruited to investigate the discriminative power of MCF and LVEF between health and physiological adaption (n=278 veteran athletes), pathological hypertrophy (hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, amyloid, Fabry, severe aortic stenosis, and hypertension; n=633) and dilatation (n=103 dilated cardiomyopathy). Ability to track disease severity was assessed by looking at 41,558 subjects from the UK Biobank. Finally, prognostication was assessed on 1,277 consecutive patients from an independent external dataset. All images were analysed using the same validated AI algorithm.
MCF varied with sex (mean MCF: 0.94 male; 1.1 female) but not age. Sex-specific reference ranges were established: [0.68-1.20] for male, [0.82-1.38] for female. MCF decreased in pathological disease (e.g. mean MCF: 0.72 HCM; 0.69 severe AS; 0.5 amyloid; 0.9 hypertension) but there was no significant decrease in LVEF other than in amyloid (mean EF: 76% HCM; 64% severe AS; amyloid 56%; 65% hypertension). Both MCF and EF decreased in DCM (EF 34%; MCF 0.58). MCF decreased with worsening hypertension, whereas LVEF increased (P<0.05). MCF had superior prognostic ability to LVEF (MCF vs LVEF: HR=0.772 vs HR=0.816; χ²=198 vs χ²=151; p<0.001).
We established MCF reference ranges, showing superior performance for detecting early disease and tracking progression compared to LVEF. MCF offers enhanced prognostic utility, complementing established metrics of LV function."

This study sought to investigate 5-year clinical outcomes in patients with severe aortic stenosis with a small annulus compared with those with a large annulus following transcatheter aortic valve replacement with newer-generation balloon-expandable valves.
A total of 3182 patients with aortic stenosis treated with balloon-expandable valves were divided into small-annulus (≤430 mm2) and large-annulus (>430 mm2) groups. A 1:1 propensity-matched analysis was performed to adjust baseline differences. The primary end point was all-cause death at 5-year follow-up. Secondary end points included heart failure hospitalization, bioprosthetic valve failure, and aortic valve reintervention.
Among 533 matched pairs, compared with the large-annulus group, the small-annulus group had higher rates of aortic valve mean gradients ≥20 mm Hg (14.1% versus 2.9%; P<0.001) and severe prosthesis-patient mismatch (9.8% versus 5.2%; P=0.019). At 5 years, there were no significant differences in all-cause death (hazard ratio, 0.75 [95% CI, 0.52-1.09]; P=0.13). The incidence of heart failure rehospitalization, bioprosthetic valve failure, and aortic valve reintervention were similar between groups. Both groups achieved similar sustained improvements in New York Heart Association functional class and Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire-Overall Summary scores.
Despite higher transvalvular gradients and a greater rate of severe prosthesis-patient mismatch, 5-year clinical outcomes in patients with a small annulus were comparable to those with a large annulus following transcatheter aortic valve replacement using newer-generation balloon-expandable valves."

Cardiovascular imaging,"Computed tomography based planimetric assessment of the anatomic aortic valve area (aAVACTA) in aortic stenosis is routinely performed. Unlike transthoracic echocardiography-based effective AVA by transthoracic echocardiography, it lacks clearly defined severity cutoff values, limiting clinical utility.
In this retrospective single-center analysis with computed tomography angiography data from 2013 to 2025, cutoffs were determined from 1294 transthoracic echocardiography-based conclusive severe or nonsevere patients by congruence of maximum velocity, mean pressure gradient, and effective AVA by transthoracic echocardiography. In separate receiver operator curves analyses for tricuspid and bicuspid valves, the severe stenosis likely cutoff was defined by Youden index and the unlikely cutoff by a negative likelihood ratio <0.1. Cutoffs were internally validated in 480 patients, compared with the Agatston score by net reclassification index, and tested in 190 separate normal flow-low gradient-aortic stenosis cases.
Correlation between aAVACTA and effective AVA by transthoracic echocardiography was moderate and strong in tricuspid and bicuspid valves, respectively (Pearson r 0.67 and 0.78; P<0.001). Severe stenosis was likely in tricuspid valves at aAVACTA ≤0.95 cm² (sensitivity 87%, specificity 78.9%) and unlikely at ≥1.10 cm² (negative likelihood ratio, 0.092). In bicuspid valves severe stenosis was likely at aAVACTA ≤1.08 cm² (sensitivity 88.3%, specificity 77.3%) and unlikely at ≥1.20cm2 (negative likelihood ratio, 0.091). Validation showed comparable results. Net reclassification index compared with the Agatston score was 0.16 for likely and 0.17 for unlikely cutoffs (P<0.001). Cutoffs were applied to 190 suspected severe low-gradient cases. Adding aAVACTA as an additional severity marker led to reclassification to nonsevere in 5.8% of cases.
Direct planimetry of AVA is feasible and shows utility in low gradient-aortic stenosis. However, as the hemodynamic effect is impacted by valve shape, cutoff values should differentiate between tricuspid and bicuspid valves."

This retrospective study consecutively enrolled 175 patients with severe AS who underwent either SAVR or TAVR. Transthoracic echocardiograms obtained at baseline, 30 days, and 1 year after the procedure were analyzed by multiple echocardiographers at our institution.
At baseline, the TAVR group was significantly older (74 ± 7 years vs. 62 ± 9 years, p < 0.001) and had a higher prevalence of hypertension (53.5% vs. 31.0%, p = 0.003), coronary artery disease (38.4% vs. 23.0%, p = 0.028), and atrial fibrillation (16.3% vs. 2.3%, p = 0.002). Additionally, the TAVR cohort demonstrated significantly worse cardiac functional status (p < 0.001). Compared to TAVR patients, SAVR patients (N = 87) exhibited a more pronounced reduction in left ventricular end-systolic dimension (-0.5 ± 0.65 cm vs. -0.2 ± 0.47 cm, p < 0.001) and left ventricular end-diastolic dimension (-0.6 ± 0.64 cm vs. -0.3 ± 0.55 cm, p < 0.001) at the 1-month follow-up. A decrease in left ventricular mass was observed in both groups from baseline to 1 month postoperatively, with the SAVR group showing a significantly greater reduction (LV mass: -67.3 ± 59.31 g vs. -38.2 ± 46.49 g, p = 0.003; LVMI: -39.1 ± 33.93 g/m2 vs. -22.5 ± 27.08 g/m2, p = 0.005). However, these differences were not sustained at the 1-year follow-up. SAVR patients experienced a transient decline in right ventricular function at 1 month, which recovered by 1 year postoperatively. At the 1-year follow-up, the TAVR group experienced a higher incidence of Major Adverse Cardiac Events (MACE) (p = 0.01), despite showing significant improvement in the severity of both mitral and tricuspid regurgitation compared to baseline (p < 0.001). Although pulmonary artery pressure improved in both groups after AVR, the SAVR group demonstrated significantly lower pressure at 1 year (p < 0.001).
In patients with severe aortic stenosis, SAVR was associated with more significant regression of left ventricular dimensions and mass at 1 month compared to TAVR, alongside a transient impairment of right ventricular function. By 1 year postoperatively, however, no significant differences in ventricular remodeling were observed between the two groups."

To investigate the efficacy of different treatment methods. Methods: A retrospective analysis was conducted on 181 sECD patients admitted to the First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University between June 2018 and February 2025, of whom 23 had bilateral involvement, resulting in a total of 204 dissected vessels. Based on the Borgess classification, 204 dissected vessels were categorized into 2 groups: type Ⅰ (intact intima, 71 vessels) and type Ⅱ (with an intimal tear, 133 vessels). Patients were followed up at 3, 6, and 12 months, and every 12 months thereafter via outpatient visits or readmission. Demographic data, clinical manifestations, imaging features, treatment regimens, and follow-up data were collected to analyze and compare the incidence of cerebral ischemic events, cerebral hemorrhage, and mortality during hospitalization and follow-up between the 2 groups. To observe the efficacy between surgical and conservative treatments as well. Results: A total of 181 patients aged (50±11) years were included, comprising 139 males and 42 females. Compared with type Ⅱ sECD, type Ⅰ were younger [48 (40, 56) vs 51 (44, 57) years, P=0.043] and had higher National Institute of Health Stroke Scale scores at admission and discharge [2 (0, 5) vs 0 (0, 3) points, P=0.029; and 0 (0, 2) vs 0 (0, 1) points, P=0.026, respectively]. The incidence of ischemic stroke was significantly higher in type Ⅰ sECD [60.6% (43/71) vs 43.6% (58/133), P=0.021]. Type Ⅰ sECD also exhibited a higher proportion of true lumen stenosis >70% [78.9% (56/71) vs 36.8%(49/133), P<0.001]. A total of 67 patients (71 vessels) underwent surgical treatment with a 100.0% (71/71) success rate and no perioperative complications. Among 114 patients (133 vessels) receiving conservative treatment, the cerebral ischemia recurrence rate was 3.7% (2/53) for type Ⅰ and 6.3% (5/80) for type Ⅱ, with no statistically significant difference (P>0.05). However, the complete and partial healing rates were higher in type I sECD than in type Ⅱ [88.7% (47/53) vs 30.0% (24/80), P<0.001]. Conclusions: Type Ⅰ sECD is more common in younger patients and is associated with a higher risk of severe ischemic stroke, yet it exhibits better healing rates with antithrombotic therapy. Surgical treatment intervention is safe and effective for both types."

Baseline clinical, laboratory, and echocardiographic parameters were analyzed. A composite endpoint comprising cardiovascular death, heart failure hospitalization, and appropriate implantable cardioverter-defibrillator shocks was assessed. Logistic regression analyses were used to identify independent associations, and receiver operating characteristic analysis was performed to evaluate discriminative ability.ResultsThe uric acid-to-albumin ratio was higher in patients with obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy than in those with nonobstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and controls (1.56 ± 0.15 vs 1.21 ± 0.08 vs 1.15 ± 0.11; p < 0.001). Adverse events occurred in 32 patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (25.8%) and were more frequent in the obstructive group (34.5% vs 18.2%; p = 0.038). In multivariable analysis, higher uric acid-to-albumin ratio (per 0.1 increase; OR, 1.50; 95% confidence interval: 1.18-1.90; p = 0.001) and septal thickness (OR, 1.65; 95% confidence interval: 1.30-2.10; p < 0.001) were independently associated with adverse outcomes. Receiver operating characteristic analysis yielded an area under the curve of 0.717 (p < 0.001).ConclusionsElevated uric acid-to-albumin ratio was independently associated with adverse outcomes in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and may serve as a simple and inexpensive biomarker for risk stratification."

CT coronary angiography (CTA) and CT-derived fractional flow reserve (FFRCT) are tools used to assess CAD. However, adoption in the TAVR population is hindered by safety concerns with nitroglycerin and beta-blockers. The safety, accuracy, and utility of CTA and FFRCT optimised with these medications for TAVR have not been established.
This international, multi-center, prospective registry included severe AS patients referred for TAVR, assessed for CAD with CTA and FFRCT. Patients all received nitroglycerin and beta-blockers as needed to optimise image quality. Severe ventricular dysfunction, recent syncope/heart failure, critical hemodynamics, or prior revascularization were excluded. Significant CAD was defined as CTA stenosis ≥50 ​% and FFRCT≤0.75. Primary endpoint was per-patient sensitivity and negative predictive value (NPV) of CTA compared to invasive coronary angiography (ICA). Secondary endpoints included specificity and positive predictive value (PPV) of CTA and FFRCT, safety, feasibility (non-evaluable rate), and the modelled potential of CTA ​+ ​FFRCT to reduce pre-TAVR ICA.
327 patients (75.9 ​± ​9.7 years, 53 ​% male) underwent CTA. CTA was safe and well tolerated in nearly all patients, with transient hypotension in 4 (1.2 ​%). CTA was evaluable in 326 patients (99.7 ​%), with 9 (2.8 ​%) having a non-evaluable vessel. FFRCT and ICA were performed in 110 (33.6 ​%) and 133 (40.7 ​%) patients, respectively. Per-patient sensitivity, specificity, NPV, and PPV of CTA were 100 ​%, 71.4 ​%, 100 ​%, and 75.9 ​% and per-vessel 82.7 ​%, 78.9 ​%, 92.3 ​%, and 59.9 ​%. FFRCT improved specificity and PPV to 88.9 ​% and 88.0 ​% for per-patient and 95.1 ​% and 81.8 ​% for per-vessel analysis. Using a simulated triage model deferring ICA in patients with CTA <50 ​% or ≥50 ​% stenosis with FFRCT >0.75, 267 patients (81.7 ​%) could potentially have avoided ICA.
Coronary CTA performed with nitroglycerin and selective use of beta-blockers is safe and effective for assessing CAD in stable severe AS patients. Combining CTA and FFRCT enhances diagnostic accuracy, potentially reducing the need for invasive angiography and streamlining TAVR workup."

In this retrospective cohort study, we analysed 22 906 patients with HF undergoing echocardiography between 2010 and 2020. AS was classified as mild, moderate, low-gradient (LG) or severe according to guideline criteria. Outcomes were assessed using Cox regression, stratified by HF subtype and adjusted for clinical confounders. The primary endpoint was event-free survival, defined as all-cause mortality or aortic valve replacement (AVR).
Moderate AS was present in 5.5%, LG AS in 2.5% and severe AS in 6.5% of HF patients, with HF with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) being the most common HF subtype across all AS grades. Increasing AS severity was associated with a stepwise increase in adverse outcomes compared with HF patients without AS (adjusted HR 2.20 (95% CI 2.00 to 2.41) for moderate AS; 3.32 (95% CI 2.97 to 3.72) for LG AS and 6.20 (95% CI 5.74 to 6.69) for severe AS). These associations were consistent across HFpEF, HF with mildly reduced EF and HF with reduced EF. Despite established guideline indications, only 59.5% (95% CI 57% to 62%) of HF patients with severe AS underwent AVR within 2 years.
AS is common in HF and is associated with substantially worse long-term outcomes across all HF subtypes, even at non-severe stages. The high mortality risk and frequent lack of intervention highlight major treatment gaps and underscore the need for prospective trials evaluating earlier intervention strategies."

With a focus on the prevalent psychological complications following the onset of this condition, this study aimed to explore the correlation between antenatal depression and Corona disease anxiety, personality traits, and postpartum depression during the COVID-19 pandemic.                                                           Materials and Methods:                     This cross-sectional descriptive-analytical study investigated women receiving care at health centers affiliated with Kerman University of Medical Sciences during the last month of their pregnancy and the postpartum period in 2022. Following the acquisition of informed consent, participants were assessed using various measures, including demographic and obstetric information, the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale, the Corona Disease Anxiety Scale (CDAS), and the NEO Personality Inventory-Revised during their third trimester of pregnancy. The same group of participants completed the Edinburgh Depression Scale and the Corona Disease Anxiety Scale (CDAS) 4-6 weeks after childbirth.                                                           Results and Discussion:                     There was a significant correlation between family income, unwanted pregnancy as perceived by both the mother and father, and antenatal depression. Additionally, marital satisfaction played a significant role in postpartum depression. Furthermore, antenatal depression was significantly associated with neuroticism, agreeableness, and physical symptoms related to Corona disease anxiety. Personality traits, with the exception of extroversion and conscientiousness, and various domains of Corona disease anxiety, excluding psychological symptoms, were also significantly associated with postpartum depression.                                                           Conclusion:                     During pandemics or epidemics, such as the COVID-19 outbreak, experiencing mental distress during pregnancy can contribute to mental health issues during the postpartum period. This risk is particularly true in individuals with unique personality traits, emphasizing the need for increased focus on mental health within prenatal care during these crises."

Method:                     This cross-sectional study was conducted in Kerman, Iran. Data were collected from patients who visited Afzalipour Hospital in Kerman more than twice during the COVID-19 epidemic from the end of February 2020 to March 21, 2021. We conducted two key analyses: 1. Mixed effect logistic regression was used to check the relationship between the variables and COVID-19 severity. 2. Mixed effect linear regression was used to check the relationship between the variables and the length of stay in the hospital.                                                           Results:                     The findings indicated that the most important risk factors for the severity of COVID-19 were heart diseases (OR=1.67,95%CI:1.20-2.30), increasing age (OR=2.23 for age&gt;54, 95%CI:1.70- 2.90), male gender (OR=1.47,95%CI:1.10-1.96), respiratory diseases other than asthma, and frequency of admission (OR=1.60,95%CI:1.20-2.15). All patients who underwent readmission experienced a shorter duration of hospitalization during their subsequent admission (OR=0.94,95%CI:0.91,0.96) and had a higher mortality rate (30% within 14 days, 26.6% between 14-90 days). Patients readmitted at intervals of 14-90 days and greater than 90 days exhibited lower disease severity compared to those readmitted within the 0-14 day period.                                                           Conclusion:                     Examining readmissions, the severity of COVID-19, and the length of hospital stay in affected patients are important factors for planning and allocating resources for COVID-19 management and treatment. These factors can help policymakers develop effective clinical guidelines for hospitalization or outpatient treatment of COVID-19 patients and contribute to reducing the burden of disease in the community."

Kinovea, as an accessible motion-analysis software, provides both visual and quantitative feedback. However, its application in supporting technique development among beginner athletes remains insufficiently explored. Aim: This study aims to describe the use of Kinovea in biomechanics training and examine its contribution to the awareness of kinematic characteristics and movement techniques among beginner athletes. Methods: A descriptive qualitative design involved 72 beginner athletes aged 18–25 years selected through purposive sampling. Data were collected over 16 weeks through interviews, field observations, and motion video recordings analyzed using Kinovea. Kinematic data focused on joint angles, stride behavior, and movement phases during walking, running, and the flight phase. Qualitative data were analyzed using content analysis with NVivo 12, while kinematic results were interpreted descriptively to identify performance patterns and areas for technical refinement. Result: Kinematic analysis showed coordinated joint-angle patterns across all phases. Walking analysis identified arm swing angles of 50.9°–58.8° and leg separation angles of 64.3°–67.2°, indicating a stable gait rhythm. The running analysis revealed knee angles of 68.8°–69.8° and elbow angles of 87.6°–89.1°, indicating efficient propulsive mechanics. The flight phase demonstrated knee angles of 81.2°–87.8° and elbow angles of 80.4°–88.3°, suggesting effective momentum use and postural stability. These measurements supported stride-efficiency assessment and technique evaluation. Qualitative findings revealed that Kinovea enabled athletes to interpret movement phases and identify technical inefficiencies through slow-motion and frame-by-frame visualization. Conclusion: Kinovea supports basic motion analysis by providing clear kinematic information and helping beginner athletes observe and refine their movement techniques. The findings also offer practical value for coaches by enabling more precise identification of inefficient patterns and guiding targeted corrections during early-stage training."
