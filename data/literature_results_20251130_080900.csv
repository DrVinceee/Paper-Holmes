Both conditions are strongly age-dependent, and their association is increasingly recognized as more than coincidental. Transthyretin deposits have been identified within stenotic aortic valves, supporting the hypothesis that mechanical stress and shear forces may promote protein misfolding and amyloid deposition. The reported prevalence of ATTR-CM among patients with severe AS ranges from 4 % to 29 %, particularly in those undergoing transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR). Diagnosis remains challenging and a multimodality imaging strategy integrating ECG-echocardiographic discordance, cardiac magnetic resonance with extracellular volume (ECV) quantification, and bone scintigraphy is essential to achieve final confirmation of disease. Newer tools such as the RAISE and GRAM scores and CT-derived myocardial extracellular volume (ECV) quantification enhance screening accuracy in this population. Clinically, even moderate AS may worsen restrictive hemodynamics in ATTR-CM, emphasizing the need for early recognition and individualized management. Contemporary studies suggest that carefully selected patients with dual pathology benefit from TAVR, achieving outcomes comparable to those with isolated AS, especially when patients are initiated on disease-modifying therapies. Future research should clarify the mechanistic link between valve and myocardial amyloid deposition, refine risk stratification, and integrate artificial intelligence to improve early detection and guide combined interventional and pharmacologic strategies."

The prognostic implications of post-TAVR FR remain unclear, particularly in non-Western populations. We investigated the prognostic relevance of FR after TAVR in a Japanese population.
We retrospectively analyzed 499 consecutive patients with severe aortic stenosis (AS) who underwent TAVR between 2014 and 2022. Patients were classified into three groups based on pre- and post-TAVR FR measured with transthoracic echocardiography: Normal FR (pre-FR ≥ 200 mL/s, N = 253), Recovered FR (pre-FR < 200 and post-FR ≥ 200, N = 112), and Persistently low FR (pre-FR < 200 and post-FR < 200, N = 134) group. All cause death- and heart failure (HF) readmission-free survival rate after TAVR were compared among the groups.
The mean age and BSA of participants were 84.1 ± 5.0 years and 1.45 ± 0.17 m2, and 64% were female. Thirty-eight all-cause deaths and 35 HF readmissions occurred within 2 years after TAVR. Patients in the Persistently low FR group had significantly more HF readmission than those in the Normal FR or Recovered FR groups (Log rank P < 0.001), whereas the all-cause death-free survival rate was similar among the three groups. Cox-Hazard multivariate analysis demonstrated that atrial fibrillation, chronic kidney disease, anemia, and persistently low FR were independent predictors of future HF readmission after TAVR (hazard ratio of persistently low FR = 2.38, P = 0.047).
AS patients with persistently low FR even after TAVR had a higher rate of HF hospital-readmissions in a Japanese cohort."

Lp(a) is composed of apoB-100 and apo(a). Lifestyle changes and statin therapy lower LDL-cholesterol and apoB, but do not reduce Lp(a), whereas PCSK9 inhibitors exert a modest effect. There are currently no approved Lp(a)-lowering drugs, although several are at various phases of clinical development.
We discuss the role of Lp(a) as a therapeutic target, describe the development, pharmacodynamics, pharmacokinetics, and metabolism of zerlasiran, a small interfering RNA (siRNA) targeting Lp(a), and report the findings of recent clinical trials.
The GalNAc-conjugated siRNA zerlasiran reduces Lp(a) by targeting hepatic apo(a) synthesis and subsequent assembly of Lp(a), with comparable efficacy to other Lp(a)-lowering therapies in phase II development. Its long half-life, infrequent dosing, and potentially lower cost, together with its favorable safety and tolerability profile, make zerlasiran a promising candidate. However, long-term studies are needed to assess its impact on major adverse cardiovascular events and safety in diverse patient populations, and across different clinical settings. The phase III cardiovascular outcome study is eagerly anticipated."

Severe aortic stenosis (AS) patients are at risk for heart failure and frequently on LDT. We assessed cardiac structure and function, organ congestion, filling pressures, and long-term outcomes of severe AS patients on LDT undergoing aortic valve replacement (AVR).
Consecutive patients with severe AS with [n = 157; median (interquartile range) daily torasemide dose: 10 (5-15) mg] or without (n = 346) LDT undergoing a detailed assessment of congestion (B-type natriuretic peptide, liver enzymes, systematic chest X-ray analysis) and cardiac catheterization before AVR with a post-AVR follow-up of several years were studied.
Despite similar AS severity (indexed aortic valve area 0.41 ± 0.12 vs. 0.43 ± 0.12 cm2/m2) patients with LDT had more advanced biventricular remodeling and dysfunction, higher B-type natriuretic peptide [446 (245-991) vs. 150 (62-317) ng/L; p < 0.001], higher liver enzymes, higher chest x-ray congestion score [2 (1-4.5) vs. 1 (0-2) score points; p < 0.001], and higher mean right atrial pressure (8 ± 4 vs. 6 ± 3 mmHg) and mean pulmonary artery wedge pressure (21 ± 8 vs. 14 ± 6 mmHg; p < 0.001 for both) than those without. After a median post-AVR follow-up of 15 months functional capacity was worse, and estimated systolic pulmonary pressure was higher (37 ± 11 vs. 32 ± 8 mmHg; p < 0.001), and after a median follow-up of 44 months mortality was higher [hazard ratio 2.01 (95% confidence interval 1.17-3.77); p = 0.01] in LDT compared to non-LDT patients.
LDT identifies AS patients with more advanced cardiac remodeling, more severe congestion, unfavorable hemodynamics, impaired post-AVR status, and increased post-AVR long-term mortality."

However, there is no consensus on the optimal vasculoprotective cardioplegia. We aim to assess endothelial integrity using coronary sinus blood samples in patients who have received various types of cardioplegia.
Aortic valve replacement for aortic stenosis and isolated coronary artery bypass grafting patients were included. del Nido and blood cardioplegias were subjected to assessment. Blood samples from the coronary sinus were collected before and after aortic cross-clamping. Endothelial and redox biomarkers were assessed utilizing immunochemical and colorimetric techniques.
In coronary artery bypass grafting patients, E-selectin levels were found significantly lower after cross-clamping compared to pre-clamp values, regardless of cardioplegia type (p = 0.015). ROC analysis revealed that Endocan, E-selectin, and TNF-α levels are reliable biomarkers of endothelial injury after cardiopulmonary bypass (p values: 0.004, 0.007, and < 0.001 for each parameter, respectively). Total oxidant status emerged as a significant redox biomarker, with 87% ROC sensitivity (p = 0.037).
This study uniquely assesses localized endothelial responses via coronary sinus sampling with a multiplex biomarker panel, providing evidence of del Nido cardioplegia's protection. Our findings indicate that del Nido cardioplegia exhibits significant vasculoprotection, as evidenced by modulation of coronary sinus Endocan, E-selectin, and TNF-α. These biomarker changes, together with the absence of adverse differences in major postoperative outcomes, suggest that del Nido cardioplegia provides efficient myocardial and vascular protection in both aortic valve replacement and coronary artery bypass procedures, supporting its safe use in adult elective cardiac surgery."

Case reports,"Adult survivors of childhood cancer experience an increased risk of cardiovascular disease. Surgical therapy is often high risk, particularly in survivors with history of mediastinal radiation. Transcatheter valve intervention for these patients is an evolving field.
A 58-year-old woman with history of Hodgkin lymphoma s/p mediastinal radiation therapy and recent coronary artery bypass grafting presented with recurrent congestive heart failure. Echocardiography revealed moderate-severe aortic insufficiency, severe mitral regurgitation/mild mitral stenosis, and severe tricuspid regurgitation. After receiving transcatheter aortic valve replacement requiring extracorporeal membrane oxygenation support, she remained balloon pump dependent. Given her mild mitral stenosis, transcatheter edge-to-edge repair was not feasible, and she was treated with transcatheter mitral valve replacement on an emergency use basis. She was ultimately discharged home.
Multivalvular disease in survivors of childhood cancer present anatomical challenges and transcatheter valve therapies will play an increasing role in these patients.
Survivors of childhood cancer can develop severe coronary artery and complex valvular disease. Some of these patients, particularly those with history of chest radiation, will have a hostile mediastinum with elevated surgical risk; transcatheter interventions could be an alternative therapy. For patients with mixed mitral valve disease, Transcatheter mitral valve replacement is feasible but is limited to research devices until one or more technologies are commercially available."

Severe AS is a life-threatening condition which affects 1.48% of individuals aged 55 and older, with a four-year mortality rate of 44.9% if left untreated. Minimally invasive treatment for AS involves the implantation of a bioprosthetic valve with porcine or bovine pericardium leaflets, which frequently succumb to failure due to regurgitation or stenosis caused in part by calcification and structural damage. The relationship between these two durability-limiting processes is debated, and the influence of device crimping on both factors is not comprehensively understood. This study aims to explore the relationship between calcification and structural damage and determine if device crimping affects these processes. First, porcine pericardium (PP) tissue was exposed to either in vitro calcification in unloaded conditions (calcification) or cyclic bulge loading in saline, without calcification (structural damage). Subsequently, PP was simultaneously calcified and cyclically loaded for 30 million cycles. Simultaneous calcification and loading led to dramatically increased calcification and structural damage, including tissue rupture. Device crimping was not found to have a significant impact on calcification or structural damage. However, fibre architecture was found to affect rupture location, and dramatically affect the rate of rupture of PP. This finding has implications for future bioprosthetic valve leaflet anti-calcification strategies, where tissue mechanics influenced by the underlying tissue fibre architecture should be considered to minimise both structural damage and calcification. STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCE: Porcine pericardium (PP) is a commonly used biomaterial, most frequently in the leaflets of bioprosthetic valves. These devices frequently succumb to failure due to regurgitation or stenosis caused in part by calcification and structural damage of their leaflets. This work shows that calcification and structural damage work together to accelerate failure of PP, with dramatically increased calcification and structural damage of PP, including rupture, when the tissue is exposed to both simultaneously. Fibre architecture of PP was found to affect rupture location, and dramatically affect rate of rupture. This finding has implications for bioprosthetic leaflet durability, where tissue mechanics influenced by the underlying tissue fibre architecture should be considered to minimise both structural damage and calcification and maximise valve durability."

This systematic review and meta-analysis evaluated ECG parameters to identify features distinguishing pediatric HCM from physiological adaptations in young athletes. Literature searches in PubMed, ScienceDirect, and Google Scholar yielded 25 eligible studies. Data were synthesized using a random-effects meta-analysis to account for clinical and methodological heterogeneity across studies. Odds ratios with 95% confidence intervals were generated using the Mantel-Haenszel method for two-arm studies and were pooled using Review Manager 5.4, while single-arm proportions of ECG abnormalities in pediatric HCM patients were pooled using a random-effects single-arm meta-analysis in OpenMeta[Analyst]. Heterogeneity was quantified using the I2 statistic, and sensitivity analyses were conducted by excluding studies with a high risk of bias. Significant differences were found in QTc prolongation, T-wave and ST segment abnormalities, and pathological Q waves, which were more prevalent in HCM. Supplementing with one-arm studies and comparing to normative athlete data highlighted additional differences in axis deviation, atrial enlargement, and bundle branch blocks. Conclusion: Based on current data available, ECG can help in distinguishing athlete's heart and HCM in the pediatric and adolescent population, particularly regarding QTc prolongation, T wave abnormalities, ST segment abnormalities, and pathological Q waves. ECG abnormalities detected during ECG should prompt further diagnostic evaluation for confirmation. What is known? • Differentiating athlete's heart from hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is difficult in children due to similar ECG patterns. • Current ECG criteria for athletes were developed for adults and may not fit pediatric patients well. What is new? • QTc prolongation, ST-T changes, and pathological Q waves are key ECG markers for differentiating pediatric HCM from athlete's heart. • Provides pediatric-specific ECG parameters to address the evidence gap in diagnosing youth athletes."

This study evaluated the late-term diastolic function of Ross patients compared to patients who underwent other types of index surgical repairs for congenital heart lesions. Patients who underwent catheterization for transcatheter pulmonary valve implantation (TPVi) at a single center between 2010 and 2022 were retrospectively reviewed. Patients who had undergone a Ross procedure were compared to those who had undergone Tetralogy of Fallot (TOF) repair and other index congenital heart operations. The primary outcome was left ventricular end diastolic pressure (LVEDP). Ross patients, TOF patients, and all others were compared in both univariate and multivariable analyses. Of 250 patients, 33 (13%) had prior Ross and 143 (57%) had prior TOF repair. Compared to other patients, Ross patients were larger at the time of catheterization (p < 0.01), more likely referred for pulmonary stenosis (vs. insufficiency or mixed) (p = 0.03), had fewer previous surgeries (p < 0.0001), and were older at their index cardiac surgery (p < 0.0001). Ross patients had significantly higher LVEDP than both TOF and other patients (p = 0.03). In multivariable analysis, higher LVEDP in Ross patients remained significant (p < 0.01) when controlling for age and RVEDP at the time of catheterization and reason for TPVi referral. Despite fewer prior surgical interventions and older age at time of index surgery, Ross patients have worse LV diastolic function compared to patients with other index congenital heart operations."

It affects 1 in 500 individuals, with an autosomal dominant inheritance pattern involving MYH7 and MYBPC3, the most commonly affected genes. Diagnosis relies on echocardiography, with cardiac magnetic resonance providing additional insights, including late gadolinium enhancement, aneurysms, and microvascular dysfunction linked to adverse outcomes. Risk stratification for sudden cardiac death includes the HCM Risk-SCD (adults) and HCM Risk-Kids (pediatrics) models, guiding implantable cardioverter defibrillator therapy. Management depends on phenotype: 1. Obstructive HCM: First-line therapy includes beta-blockers or non-dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers. Myosin inhibitors offer new options for symptom control. In refractory cases, surgical myectomy or alcohol septal ablation is recommended. 2. Non-Obstructive HCM: Treatment focuses on diastolic dysfunction and arrhythmia management, with emerging pharmacologic options under investigation. 3. Atrial fibrillation: Common in HCM, requiring anticoagulation, rate control, or ablation. Advances in genetic testing, imaging, and targeted therapies have significantly reduced HCM-related mortality to 0.5% per year, transforming it into a manageable condition. Future research will enhance precision medicine, surgical expertise, and equitable access to care."

Although traditionally regarded as rare, contemporary evidence indicates a greater prevalence, particularly among elderly females. While multi-vessel involvement is considered classical, symptomatic single-vessel disease is increasingly recognized in the setting of inadequate collateral circulation. Diagnostic evaluation relies on a combination of imaging modalities including duplex ultrasonography, computed tomography angiography, magnetic resonance angiography and selective use of conventional angiography or functional studies in equivocal cases. Revascularization remains the cornerstone of definitive management. A paradigm shift toward endovascular-first strategies has occurred, driven by superior peri-operative safety, minimal invasiveness and shorter hospitalization. Endovascular therapy is indicated in most anatomically accessible lesions, especially ostial or short-segment stenoses of the celiac or superior mesenteric arteries. Covered stents are preferred in these settings due to enhanced patency. However, limitations include restenosis risk, technical failure in long-segment occlusions and contra-indications in extrinsic compression syndromes such as median arcuate ligament syndrome. Open surgical revascularization remains critical in patients with associated complex aortoiliac disease, long occlusions or failed endovascular attempts. Retrograde bypass from the iliac or infra-renal aorta is favored in high-risk patients for technical ease, while antegrade bypass from the supraceliac aorta may offer greater durability. Hybrid approaches such as retrograde open mesenteric stenting (ROMS), indicated in cases where aortic clamping is not feasible and in acute-on-chronic mesenteric ischemia with bowel gangrene, offer high technical success and favorable mid-term outcomes. Early diagnosis and tailored revascularization strategies remain central to improving long-term clinical outcomes in CMI. Continued refinement of endovascular techniques and hybrid interventions holds promise for optimizing outcomes in anatomically and physiologically diverse patient populations."

However, the durability of transcatheter heart valves (THV) and the risk of leaflet thrombosis preclude the extension of TAVI in young people. This study sought to formulate a proof-of-concept solution for non-invasive, continuous monitoring of THV function using photoplethysmography (PPG) sensors and machine learning models. An in vitro mock circulatory loop was developed using a compliant aortic phantom and an implanted self-expanding Evolut FX device. Two PPG sensors were attached to the phantom surface to record flow signals during various hemodynamic scenarios generated by Latin Hypercube Sampling. Endoscopic imaging measurements of the geometric orifice area (GOA) were used to assess valve performance. PPG-derived metrics and flow variables were used to train regression and classification models that predicted healthy versus decreased leaflet motion. The regression model showed an R2 of 0.83, RMSE of 7.18 mm2, and MAE of 5.58 mm2. The classifier correctly identified reduced leaflet motion (95% accuracy, 0.89 precision, and 0.91 recall). This study demonstrates the efficacy of PPG sensors and machine learning for non-invasive THV monitoring. The approach offers a promising tool for early detection of leaflet dysfunction, thereby improving the management of TAVI patients."

This study evaluates the clinical and procedural impact of aortic angulation in contemporary TAVI procedures.
This retrospective single-center observational study included 509 consecutive patients undergoing transfemoral TAVI between January 2021 and December 2024. Primary end-point was device success according to VARC-3 criteria. Secondary end-points included technical success, early safety at 30 days, procedural time, fluoroscopy time, contrast volume, paravalvular regurgitation (PVR) and permanent pacemaker implantation (PPI). Multivariable logistic and linear regression models were used to assess the association between aortic angulation (in degrees) and clinical outcomes. ROC and spline regression analyses were used to evaluate potential threshold effects.
Device success at discharge was achieved in 89.4% (455/509) of patients, technical success in 96.3% (490/509), and early safety at 30 days in 75.6% (385/509). Aortic angulation did not significantly influence device success (aOR: 0.974, 95% CI: 0.938-1.012, p = 0.175), technical success (aOR 1.034; 95% CI 0.980-1.091; P = 0.22), or early safety (aOR: 0.994, 95% CI: 0.968-1.020, p = 0.633). Similarly, no association was observed between aortic angulation and PPI (aOR 1.016; 95% CI 0.984-1.050; P = 0.34) and PVR.

The most promising methods for evaluating excess fluid are bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA) and lung ultrasonography with B-line assessment (LUS). The latter is traditionally performed in 28 anatomical locations on the front side of the chest. The study aimed to investigate whether a shorter LUS procedure in 8 locations correlates with other markers of HV and arterial stiffness.
We performed a single dialysis center observational study in adult chronic HD patients. Patients had to be without active malignancy, infection, chronic atrial fibrillation, carotid stenosis, severe aortic stenosis, or peripheral artery disease. We performed predialysis blood pressure measurements, LUS on 8 predefined locations, BIA, carotid-femoral pulse wave velocity (cfPWV) assessment, and laboratory values of the N-terminal prohormone of brain natriuretic peptide.
19 patients were included, 7 male (36.8%). The median age of the patients was 71 years (IQR (60 - 74)), the median dialysis vintage was 51 months (IQR (27 - 87)). We found a statistically significant positive correlation between LUS and overhydration measured by BIA (rs = 0.697; p < 0.001), LUS and intracellular water measured by BIA (rs = 0.478; p = 0.038), and between LUS and extracellular water measured by BIA (rs = 0.462; p = 0.046).

LUS in 8 locations is associated with markers of HV in HD patients, correlating positively with BIA measurements. Its correlation with cfPWV should be further investigated."

Although general anesthesia was the main anesthesiologic approach during the early years of the development of TAVI, over the last decade, there has been a shift towards sedation. Hemodynamic stability is the main concern of intraoperative anesthesiologic management. Preprocedural, multidisciplinary assessment of the patient is essential prior to TAVI and should include a full anesthesiologic evaluation. TAVI offers a number of advantages to patients and medical teams, but important accompanying complications and anesthesiologic risks remain. In this narrative review, all aspects of sedation in TAVI are presented and analyzed, including methods, patient selection, contraindications, drug administration, intraprocedural parameters, outcomes, and future developments in this field."

Kinovea, as an accessible motion-analysis software, provides both visual and quantitative feedback. However, its application in supporting technique development among beginner athletes remains insufficiently explored. Aim: This study aims to describe the use of Kinovea in biomechanics training and examine its contribution to the awareness of kinematic characteristics and movement techniques among beginner athletes. Methods: A descriptive qualitative design involved 72 beginner athletes aged 18–25 years selected through purposive sampling. Data were collected over 16 weeks through interviews, field observations, and motion video recordings analyzed using Kinovea. Kinematic data focused on joint angles, stride behavior, and movement phases during walking, running, and the flight phase. Qualitative data were analyzed using content analysis with NVivo 12, while kinematic results were interpreted descriptively to identify performance patterns and areas for technical refinement. Result: Kinematic analysis showed coordinated joint-angle patterns across all phases. Walking analysis identified arm swing angles of 50.9°–58.8° and leg separation angles of 64.3°–67.2°, indicating a stable gait rhythm. The running analysis revealed knee angles of 68.8°–69.8° and elbow angles of 87.6°–89.1°, indicating efficient propulsive mechanics. The flight phase demonstrated knee angles of 81.2°–87.8° and elbow angles of 80.4°–88.3°, suggesting effective momentum use and postural stability. These measurements supported stride-efficiency assessment and technique evaluation. Qualitative findings revealed that Kinovea enabled athletes to interpret movement phases and identify technical inefficiencies through slow-motion and frame-by-frame visualization. Conclusion: Kinovea supports basic motion analysis by providing clear kinematic information and helping beginner athletes observe and refine their movement techniques. The findings also offer practical value for coaches by enabling more precise identification of inefficient patterns and guiding targeted corrections during early-stage training."

CASE SUMMARY We describe a case of an 80-year-old female patient with a history of severe aortic stenosis and hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy that underwent aortic valve replacement and myectomy. The patient presented with acute pulmonary edema and low blood pressure due to LVOTO and SAM post cardiac surgery in the intensive care unit. She was paced with an epicardial dual-chamber pacing system due to complete atrioventricular block and treated initially with norepinephrine, furosemide, and esmolol infusion and continuous positive pressure ventilation. The patient remained hypoxemic and kept deteriorating hemodynamically despite titrating up norepinephrine. The addition of vasopressin infusion and tapering of norepinephrine finally stabilized the patient with significant reduction of LVOTO, confirmed by transthoracic echocardiography assessment, improved oxygenation and increased urine output. CONCLUSION Vasopressin seems to be the preferred vasopressor for managing LVOTO and SAM post-cardiac surgery, because of its absence of inotropic effects. Echocardiography is crucial for early diagnosis and therapeutic management."

We report a 12-day-old male neonate presenting with respiratory distress, edema, and oliguria. Physical examination revealed a grade 2/6 systolic murmur at the left sternal border. Echocardiography identified PFAA with coarctation, IAA, PDA, and an atrial septal defect (ASD), confirmed by cardiac CT. Surgical intervention included aortic arch repair, fifth arch excision, and ASD closure. The postoperative recovery was smooth, and the patient remained clinically well with normal cardiac function during the 1-year follow-up period. This case underscores the critical role of echocardiography in early diagnosis and surgical planning for complex congenital heart disease."

Medium- and large-vessel vasculitides represent a diagnostic challenge. The case described here highlights the importance of an accurate differential diagnosis, as non-inflammatory vascular diseases can mimic vasculitic patterns, with significant therapeutic implications. Materials and Methods. A 42-year-old man presented to the emergency department with subacute onset of temporal headache, low-grade fever, left flank pain, and hypertension (BP 170/100 mmHg). Rheumatologic history was unremarkable and physical examination was normal. Abdominal CT, performed for suspected ureterolithiasis, showed a hypodense area in the mid and upper third of the left kidney compatible with parenchymal ischemia, and a sleeve-like thickening with filiform stenosis of the ipsilateral renal artery, initially suggestive of vasculitis (renal arteritis). The patient was admitted to the Rheumatology Unit. Laboratory tests revealed inflammatory activity (CRP 3.7 mg/dL, ESR 51 mm/h). Intravenous methylprednisolone pulses (250 mg for 3 days) were started, followed by oral prednisone (1 mg/kg) and antihypertensive therapy. Given the suspicion of vasculitis, PET imaging was performed, showing no evidence of vascular inflammation, as well as duplex ultrasound of the four limbs and supra-aortic trunks, which revealed no stenotic or occlusive lesions. Considering the abrupt onset of symptoms, negative autoimmunity, negative PET findings, and absence of additional clinical or instrumental abnormalities, a renal arteriography was performed. It revealed a dissection of the left renal artery with thrombosis of the false lumen and parenchymal ischemia, allowing a final diagnosis of spontaneous left renal artery dissection complicated by renal infarction and renovascular hypertension. Results. The case was discussed with the Radiologist and Vascular Surgeon. Given the complete thrombosis of the false lumen, endovascular revascularization was excluded, and a conservative approach was adopted with antihypertensive and antiplatelet therapy, along with progressive steroid tapering, with no clinical relapse. A follow-up contrast-enhanced CT after 15 days confirmed stability of the renal ischemic lesion and improved parenchymal perfusion (Figure 1). Conclusions. Spontaneous renal artery dissection is a rare clinical entity with elusive etiology, accounting for only 1–2% of all arterial dissections. To date, approximately 200 cases have been reported in the medical literature. Our case emphasizes the importance of considering non-inflammatory vascular conditions, such as spontaneous dissection, in all instances where first-line imaging raises a generic suspicion of medium- or large-vessel vasculitis, particularly in cases of isolated vascular involvement and absence of systemic symptoms. A high index of suspicion is required in clinical practice, especially in atypical or subtle presentations, to promptly achieve the correct diagnosis."

Zeiher,10.1161/jaha.125.044406,2025-11-26,Journal of the American Heart Association,"Clonal hematopoiesis of indeterminate potential (CHIP), defined as the presence of somatic mutations in subjects without other hematologic abnormalities has been recently associated with several cardiovascular diseases. Degenerative aortic valve stenosis (AVS), a prototypical cardiovascular age‐related disorder resulting from calcification and inflammation processes for which no medical treatment is currently available, has become the subject of scientific research in this field. In this review we describe the clinical relevance of CHIP in patients with AVS, as well as its effects on left ventricular dysfunction and heart failure, particularly about compensatory hypertrophy and diastolic dysfunction assessed by echocardiographic parameters. CHIP‐driver mutations DNMT3A and TET2 have been found in a third of all patients with severe AVS undergoing transcatheter aortic valve replacement in most studies; and several short‐term and long‐term studies have reported an increased mortality rate associated with the presence of CHIP in these patients. Additionally, we discuss potential mechanistic insights involving inflammatory pathways both from a clinical and from an experimental approach. These include primarily fluorescence‐activated cell sorting (FACS) analyses or single‐cell RNA sequencing (sc‐RNA‐seq) analyses from circulating leukocytes of patients with AVS, showing an increase in proinflammatory interleukines, and analyses on valve tissue exhibiting higher transcript levels of immunoglobulins, as well as murine models mimicking the consequences of AVS that could shed some light on potential causal link between CHIP and AVS. Lastly, we summarize prospects for novel therapeutic strategies, with efforts focusing on developing both general and more specific inflammatory therapies targeting inflammatory pathways. Future research will need to assess the incidence and progression of milder stages of aortic stenosis and evaluate potential interactions with different types of acquired mutations."

This study aimed to assess whether plasma from patients with AS induces oxidative stress and contributes to valvular endothelial cells (VECs) dysfunction. Methods Human plasma samples were obtained from patients with severe AS (AS+, n=110), patients with cardiovascular risk factors without AS (n=30), and healthy individuals (n=15). Plasma levels of proinflammatory cytokines (IL [interleukin]‐1β, IL‐6, TNF [tumor necrosis factor]‐α, and factor Xa [FXa]) were measured. Porcine aortic VECs were then incubated with plasma (10%, 24 hours). Oxidative stress levels were assessed using dihydroethidium staining, NO formation with 4‐amino‐5‐methylamino‐2′,7′‐difluororescein diacetate, mRNA expression by quantitative reverse transcription‐polymerase chain reaction, and protein expression levels by Western blot analyses. Platelets and monocytes adhesion as well as thrombin generation were determined. Different pharmacological inhibitors were used to explore the underlying pathways. Results Plasma from patients with AS+ exhibited elevated levels of IL‐1β, IL‐6, TNF‐α, and FXa activity. Incubation of VECs with AS+ plasma induced a pro‐oxidant response mediated by proinflammatory cytokines, the angiotensin system‐SGLT2 (sodium‐glucose transport protein 2) pathway, and FXa. AS+ plasma also triggered VEC dysfunction, inflammation, monocytes and platelets adhesion, and thrombin generation. These detrimental effects were mitigated by empagliflozin, losartan, neutralizing antibodies targeting proinflammatory cytokines, and dabigatran and rivaroxaban. Conclusions Patients with AS displayed subclinical systemic inflammation and increased FXa activity. These processes contributed to aortic VEC dysfunction, inflammation, monocytes and platelets adhesion, and thrombin generation upon exposure to AS+ plasma."

Malaysia; Mogaraj Sellapan",10.17576/jsa.2025.1502.04,2025-11-26,Journal of Surgical Academia,"Prostatic artery embolisation (PAE) is a well-established minimally invasive procedure for the management of lower urinary tract symptoms secondary to benign prostatic hyperplasia. In patients with advanced prostate cancer, its primary role has been palliative, particularly for controlling refractory haematuria. However, emerging evidence suggests that PAE may offer additional cytoreductive benefits. We presented the case of an 85-year-old male with advanced prostate cancer and multiple comorbidities, including severe aortic stenosis and stage 4 chronic kidney disease, who developed refractory gross haematuria unresponsive to conservative management. Due to high surgical risk, bilateral PAE was performed via a single right femoral artery access. The procedure resulted in complete resolution of haematuria, allowing early catheter removal. Remarkably, his prostate-specific antigen (PSA) declined from 5.28 ng/mL to 0.45 ng/mL over seven months, in the absence of systemic therapy. The patient remained haematuria-free with improved voiding symptoms. This case highlights the effectiveness of PAE for haemostatic control in advanced prostate cancer and suggests potential cytoreductive effects, evidenced by sustained PSA normalisation. PAE may serve a dual role in symptom control and disease modulation in patients unsuitable for surgery or systemic therapy. Further studies are warranted to explore its oncologic impact."

Over the past three decades, clinical trials and translational studies have generated a substantial evidence base supporting specific medical therapies, particularly drugs that modulate hemodynamics or target the renin–angiotensin–aldosterone system (RAAS). At the same time, gaps remain in our knowledge, and areas of clinical practice are guided more by expert consensus or extrapolation from human medicine than by robust veterinary data. This review summarizes current evidence for pharmacologic interventions in MMVD, including established therapies such as ACE inhibitors, mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists, diuretics, and inodilators, as well as emerging drug classes such as angiotensin receptor–neprilysin inhibitors and SGLT-2 inhibitors. For each, we highlight the existing data, discuss limitations of prior studies, and note areas where additional research is needed to guide optimal clinical use."

Intimal sarcoma, a subtype of undifferentiated sarcoma, is characterized by high metastatic potential and poor prognosis. Case Summary: A 23-year-old woman with no prior medical history presented to the emergency department with a 20-day history of progressive palpitations and dyspnea. Initial evaluation revealed tachycardia, hypotension, and a systolic mitral murmur. Laboratory tests demonstrated elevated D-dimer and high-sensitivity troponin I levels. Pulmonary thromboembolism was initially suspected; however, chest CT angiography revealed a left atrial mass, subsequently confirmed by transthoracic echocardiography as a heterogeneous mass causing dynamic mitral obstruction and moderate eccentric mitral regurgitation, with associated right ventricular dysfunction. The patient underwent emergency surgical resection, including removal of the left atrial appendage and partial atrial roof, followed by reconstruction of the interatrial septum. Histopathology confirmed high-grade intimal sarcoma with MDM2 overexpression. Postoperative management included adjuvant chemotherapy (Doxorubicin and Ifosfamide) and planned radiotherapy. Despite early intervention, follow-up MRI five months later revealed cerebral metastases, necessitating neurosurgical resection. Discussion and Conclusion: This case highlights the rapid progression and aggressive nature of cardiac intimal sarcoma, even in young patients with timely diagnosis and multidisciplinary care. Early recognition, prompt surgical intervention, and coordinated postoperative management remain critical to optimizing outcomes in this rare and high-risk disease."

The primary objective of this study was to directly compare structural valve deterioration between porcine and bovine bioprosthetic valves used in mitral valve replacement. Methods A systematic review was conducted following PRISMA guidelines. Studies directly comparing porcine and bovine bioprosthetic valves in MVR were identified through comprehensive searches of Embase, MEDLINE, and Web of Science databases from inception through March 5, 2025. Eligible studies were cohort studies that directly compared bovine and porcine bioprosthetic valves implanted in the mitral position and reported SVD outcomes. The primary exposure was valve type, and the primary outcomes were reports of SVD. Data extraction included patient demographics, valve characteristics, SVD definitions, and modes of SVD. The Newcastle-Ottawa Scale was used for risk-of-bias assessment. Principal analyses involved narrative synthesis. Results Nine studies comprising 6,945 patients (range per study: 240–1,695) with follow-up periods ranging from 3.5 to 15 years were included. Three studies favored porcine valves, two favored bovine valves, and four showed no significant difference in terms of SVD. Porcine valves frequently demonstrated leaflet tearing resulting in acute regurgitation, while bovine valves predominantly exhibited calcification leading to stenosis. Younger patients (&lt; 65 years) generally showed better results with porcine valves. Despite variability across studies, cumulative evidence suggested a trend toward superior long-term durability of porcine bioprostheses. Conclusions Valve selection should be tailored to patient-specific factors, including age, anticipated longevity, clinical risk profile, and religious preference. Future studies should employ standardized definitions and longitudinal follow-up to clarify these findings."

This study aimed to evaluate the influence of PH severity on in-hospital mortality and early outcomes after valve surgery in patients with RHD. Methods In this prospective observational study, 152 patients with RHD undergoing valve surgery were categorized into three groups based on estimated systolic pulmonary artery pressure on echocardiography: no or mild PH (&lt;45 mmHg), moderate PH (45–59 mmHg), and severe PH (≥60 mmHg). The primary endpoint was in-hospital all-cause mortality and major morbidity; the secondary endpoint was 30-day readmission. Results In-hospital all-cause mortality was 3.3% ( n = 5), with no statistically significant difference among severe (4.8%), moderate (3.2%), and no/mild PH (0%) groups ( p = 0.518). ICU stay was significantly longer in patients with severe PH ( p = 0.042). There was no significant difference in mortality based on predominant valve lesion (mitral stenosis or regurgitation) across PH groups ( p = 0.625, p = 0.172). The 30-day readmission rate was 12.5%, with no significant variation across PH categories ( p = 0.194). Conclusion The severity of PH did not significantly impact early postoperative outcomes or in-hospital mortality following valve surgery for RHD. These findings support the feasibility and safety of surgical intervention even in patients with severe PH and provide a critical foundation for future studies in Yemen."

We aimed to investigate how remodelling of the left ventricle and left atrium impacts the mitral annulus size and function in patients with transmural myocardial infarction. Methods In this prospective observational study, patients with ST-elevation myocardial infarction were examined with 3D echocardiography at admission and at 1-year follow-up (n=87). Size and function of the left cardiac chambers and the mitral annulus was analysed. The cohort was divided into groups with (n=16) or without (n=71) mitral annular remodelling, defined as an area increase of 15% or more, from baseline to follow-up. Results During follow-up, the group without mitral annular remodelling had stable volumes and improved function for both the left ventricle and the left atrium. Although the group with mitral annular remodelling also exhibited improved left ventricular function, both left ventricular volume and left atrial volume increased, and no improvement was seen in left atrial emptying fraction or left atrial reservoir or contractile strain. In linear regression analysis, increased mitral annular area at follow-up was associated with change in both left atrial (β=0.025 (0.007, 0.043), p=0.006) and left ventricular volume (β=0.014 (0.003, 0.025), p=0.012). Conclusion Mitral annular remodelling after transmural myocardial infarction is associated with increased volumes of the left ventricle and the left atrium, and absence of atrial functional improvement. Both increasing left atrial and left ventricular volume are associated with mitral annular dilatation, but left atrial volume is the strongest factor."
OpenAlex,mitral regurgitation,Cardiotoxicity is not always the only explanation - a case report,Andreea-Madalina Varvara; Irina Serban; Ruxandra Jurcuţ,10.2478/rjc-2025-0033,2025-11-26,Romanian Journal of Cardiology,"Abstract Cisplatin is a platinum-based chemotherapeutic agent; in fact, it is known as a vasculotoxic agent, but there are some case reports describing mild myocardial dysfunction related to cisplatin-based chemotherapy. Truncating variants in the titin (TTN) gene are rare in cardiomyopathy genes, but they are known to occur more frequently among cancer patients with cancer therapy-induced cardiomyopathy. We present the case of a 54-year-old female who was brought to the emergency room with shortness of breath at mild exertion. Biologically, we noted elevated N-terminal prohormone of brain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) at 5453 pg/mL. Her medical history includes six series of cisplatin-based chemotherapy for invasive cervical carcinoma at 47 years old with subsequent remission. The electrocardiography (ECG) noted sinus rhythm and T-wave inversion in inferior and lateral leads. The transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) revealed a dilated left ventricle with severe diffuse hypokinesia of the walls, an estimated ejection fraction of 15%, systolic dysfunction of the right ventricle, and severe mitral functional regurgitation. Her family history includes her mother being diagnosed with cardiomyopathy and sudden cardiac death (SCD) at 54 years old and a brother with SCD at 34 years old. Furthermore, the systolic dysfunction seems to be caused by more than just the cardiotoxic effects of platinum-based chemotherapy. This, corroborated with the family history, rather advocates for a possible genetic etiology, so we performed genetic testing, which detected a likely pathogenic mutation in the TTN gene (c.64915C&gt;T, p (Arg21639Ter). Additionally, a unicameral implantable cardioverter-defibrillator was considered for primary prevention of SCD. The present case illustrates the importance of baseline cardiac evaluation of the patients receiving cardiotoxic chemotherapy. The identification of genetic risk factors helps us to identify patients at high risk for developing cardiomyopathies secondary to chemotherapy and associated adverse outcomes."
OpenAlex,mitral regurgitation,Rescue upon rescue: ventricular tachycardia ablation using cerebral protection device in a patient with left ventricular thrombus associated with mitral valve transcatheter repair,Elie Kozaily; Bishnu P Dhakal; Ian Laxina; Rory P.

Dowd; Chau Vo; Jeffrey Winterfield,10.1007/s10840-025-02192-8,2025-11-25,Journal of Interventional Cardiac Electrophysiology,"Abstract We present the case of an elderly man with advanced heart failure and worsening severe mitral regurgitation who underwent transcatheter mitral valve edge-to-edge repair (M-TEER) who presented with VT storm 2 weeks after M-TEER. VT ablation was considered but not performed since cardiac CT scan revealed M-TEER associated thrombus on the ventricular surface of the posterior mitral leaflet. Despite being on amiodarone, the patient returned few days later with VT storm. After multidisciplinary assessment and patient-centric discussions, the decision was made to proceed with emergent, rescue VT ablation using cerebral embolic protection device (CEP) and mechanical support as needed. VT ablation was safe and successfully performed. Patient had no recurrence of VT during 2.5 month follow up. To our knowledge, this is the first reported case of VT ablation using CEP for LV thrombus in North America.

OpenAlex,mitral regurgitation,Predictors of functional mitral regurgitation progression after isolated surgical correction of chronic aortic insufficiency,A.A. Bulynin; E.R. Charchyan; S. O. Popov,10.17116/hirurgia20251026,2025-11-25,Pirogov Russian Journal of Surgery,"Objective. To identify the predictors of progression of naive functional mitral regurgitation (MR) in patients with severe left ventricular dilation in addition to chronic aortic insufficiency (AI) after isolated surgical correction of the aortic valve disease. Material and methods. The study included 80 patients with end-diastolic volume (EDV) of the left ventricle (LV) ≥250 ml in presence of chronic AI with functional MR. AI was the only primary factor of LV remodeling in all patients. Surgical treatment of AI was performed according to the David and Bentall-DeBono methods, as well as AV replacement and isolated plasty of AV leaflets were done on the basis of several centers. The dynamics of functional MR severity was evaluated by transthoracic echocardiography. Evaluation of MR severity and analysis of possible predictors were performed 1—10 days before surgery, 7—10 days after surgery and at least 6 months after surgical treatment. Results. Mitral annulus diameter (MAD) ≥45 mm at the preoperative stage of observation serves as an independent predictor of MR progression from the post-operative level to long-term one at EDV ≥250 ml in all groups (OR 1.560; 95% confidence interval — CI 1.033—2.358; p=0.035). The MAD/end-diastolic dimension ratio ≥0.539 before surgery is a statistically significant gross predictor of MR aggravation from the post-operative stage to long-term period (AUC=0.734; 95% CI 0.562—0.905; p=0.011). The MAD/end-systolic dimension ratio ≥0.833 before surgery serves as a statistically significant predictor of MR aggravation from the post-operative stage to long-term period (AUC=0.698; 95% CI 0.522—0.875; p=0.031). Conclusion. Functional MR that occurred in presence of chronic AI may progress after correction of the aortic valve disease in severe mitral annular dilatation outpacing the LV dilation."
