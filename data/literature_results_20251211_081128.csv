PubMed,aortic stenosis,The Emerging Lipid Risk: Lipoprotein(a).,Sang-Hak Lee; Ki Hoon Han,10.4070/kcj.2025.0380,2025-10-20,Korean circulation journal,"Based on epidemiological and genetic studies in recent decades, lipoprotein(a) (Lp(a)) has been accepted as a causal risk factor for atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease and aortic stenosis. Although inter-ethnic differences exist, Lp(a) level ≥50 mg/dL is commonly reported to indicate elevated cardiovascular risk. Blood Lp(a) levels are largely determined based on genetic background, and the kringle IV type 2 repeat variant is a major factor. Lp(a) is structurally similar to low-density lipoprotein (LDL) but also contains apolipoprotein(a) (apo(a)), which includes kringle domains associated with diverse effects depending on particles and individuals. The LDL-like property of Lp(a) and effect of apo(a) on vascular cells can promote atherosclerosis. Apo(a) competes with plasminogen and can inhibit the role of plasmin during fibrinolysis. Furthermore, oxidized phospholipids on apo(a) may induce oxidative stress to enhance atherosclerosis and can affect valve calcification. Trials on new therapeutics targeting Lp(a) RNA, including antisense oligonucleotide (e.g., pelacarsen), siRNAs (e.g., olpasiran, lepodisiran, and zerlasiran), and small molecules (e.g., muvalaplin), are under way. Depending on the study or dose, these agents lowered Lp(a) levels by 80-100% compared with the control; however, results of clinical outcomes have yet to be reported."

Cardiovascular interventions,"The prognostic value of fractional flow reserve (FFR) in assessing coronary stenosis before transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) is unclear.
The aim of this study was to evaluate cardiovascular risks associated with significant and nonsignificant FFR values of coronary stenosis prior to TAVR.
Patients were enrolled from the NOTION-3 (Nordic Aortic Valve Intervention-3) randomized trial and registry, including those with severe aortic stenosis scheduled for TAVR and ≥50% coronary stenosis. Patients with FFR ≤0.80 or stenosis ≥90% were randomized to conservative therapy (FFR ≤0.80 conservative group) or percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI; FFR ≤0.80 PCI group). Those with FFR >0.80 were included in the registry (FFR >0.80 defer group). Outcomes were cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction, and/or urgent revascularization through 36 months.
Of 587 patients, 232 were in the FFR ≤0.80 conservative group, 220 in the FFR ≤0.80 PCI group, and 135 in the FFR >0.80 defer group. The cumulative incidence rates of cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction, or urgent revascularization were 21.6%, 11.5%, and 10.5%, respectively (P = 0.003). Excess risk in the FFR ≤0.80 conservative group was due mainly to higher myocardial infarction and urgent revascularization rates compared with the other groups. At a coronary lesion level, revascularization occurred in 12.6% of conservatively treated FFR ≤0.80 segments vs 1.3% of PCI-treated FFR ≤0.80 segments and 0.9% of deferred FFR >0.80 segments (P < 0.0001).
Conservative management of FFR ≤0.80 lesions was linked to higher cardiovascular risk compared with either PCI of FFR ≤0.80 lesions or deferral of FFR >0.80 lesions, which had similar outcomes. These findings support an FFR threshold of 0.80 to guide coronary revascularization in patients undergoing TAVR.

Here, we developed a metabolomic age clock in the UK Biobank (n = 196,790) using a comprehensive panel of 249 plasma metabolites. This framework was trained to predict phenotypic age (PhenoAge), a validated composite biomarker that integrates clinical chemistry across multiple systems, and was evaluated for its utility to predict incident cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) and dementia. We found that this new measure accurately predicted actual PhenoAge (Pearson's r = 0.90) and was significantly associated with the incidence of seven CVDs, including major adverse cardiovascular events, atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, myocardial infarction, stroke, aortic stenosis, heart failure, and abdominal aortic aneurysm, but not dementia. Furthermore, metabolomic aging was associated with biological, physical, and cognitive age-related phenotypes, comprising telomere length, frailty index, and reaction time. Incorporating the metabolomic age clock with PREVENT (Predicting Risk of CVD Events) risk score modestly improved the performance, as measured by C-statistic and net reclassification index. Genetic analyses revealed 91 genomic loci and 168 genes (e.g., SERPINA1, FADS cluster), with tissue-enrichment analysis highlighting the liver's significant role in metabolic aging. By bridging metabolomic profiles with multisystem aging information, this framework provides a measure of biological aging that is associated with age-related functional status and cardiovascular risk."

To better understand mechanisms underlying heart block complicating TAVR and improve prediction of intraprocedural and delayed heart block.
This cohort study was conducted at a single academic medical center in Boston, Massachusetts, from May 2021 to January 2024 among all patients undergoing TAVR, except those with preexisting pacemakers. A total of 409 consecutive patients undergoing TAVR were prospectively studied. An electrophysiologic study was performed at the beginning and end of the TAVR procedure. An electrophysiologist monitored the electrocardiogram (ECG) and His bundle recording continuously during the procedure. Patients were followed up for 1 year. Occurrence of high-grade atrioventricular (AV) block was related to ECG and electrophysiological, anatomic, and procedural variables. Data analysis was performed from March 2023 to May 2025.
An electrophysiologist monitored the ECG and intracardiac electrograms continuously during the valve implant; patients with preexisting right bundle-branch block (RBBB) or periprocedural conduction abnormalities were discharged with an ECG monitor.
The primary outcome was Mobitz type II or complete heart block.
A total of 409 consecutive patients were enrolled, among whom median (IQR) age was 78.5 (73.1-83.5) years and 182 patients (44.5%) were female. Forty patients (9.7%) developed heart block requiring permanent pacemakers: block developed during the TAVR procedure in 15 patients and after TAVR in 25. Block was persistent in all patients developing block during the TAVR but paroxysmal in 20 of 25 patients with post-TAVR block. Block localized to the AV node during TAVR in 6 cases (all resolved) and in 3 patients (7.5%) with delayed block. In the remaining 9 patients that developed intraprocedural block and 22 patients developing postprocedural block, the block was infranodal. Preexisting RBBB was the only ECG or electrophysiological predictor for intraprocedural block, but preexisting RBBB did not predict postprocedural block. The best predictors of delayed heart block were His-ventricular interval of 80 milliseconds or longer at the end of the implant procedure, PR interval longer than 300 milliseconds, and AV Wenckebach cycle length of 500 milliseconds or longer post-TAVR.
In this cohort study, the characteristics and mechanisms causing AV block during TAVR differed from delayed block. Both AV nodal and infranodal block contributed to heart block accompanying TAVR procedures."

Case reports,"Primary antiphospholipid syndrome (PAPS) may cause thromboembolic events and valvular heart disease.
A 42-year-old woman with a history of pre-eclampsia, epilepsy, and thrombocytopenia presented with acute chest pain and shortness of breath. Investigations revealed vegetation on both the aortic and mitral valves, severe aortic stenosis, and a non-ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction. Autoimmune testing confirmed antiphospholipid antibodies, which led to a diagnosis of PAPS with Libman-Sacks endocarditis, as well as secondary coronary embolic complications. After multidisciplinary consultation, the patient received anticoagulation, immunosuppressive therapy, and plasmapheresis.
This case report underlines the aggressive nature of PAPS, particularly given its presentation of severe aortic stenosis and dual valve involvement in a relatively young patient. To our knowledge, this is the first reported case of such a presentation.
PAPS can manifest with fulminant cardiac manifestations including severe aortic stenosis, dual valve vegetations, and myocardial infarction, emphasizing the importance of early recognition and management."

Despite central aortic repair with antegrade selective cerebral perfusion, insufficient reperfusion of the occluded carotid artery may lead to severe neurological injury. To overcome this limitation, we modified the conventional single-roller pump antegrade selective cerebral perfusion and introduced a 2-roller pump technique for direct carotid artery reperfusion during acute type A aortic dissection repair.
Between January 2022 and December 2024, 112 patients underwent emergency surgery for acute type A aortic dissection at our institution. Of these, 15 (13.4%) presented with severe stenosis or occlusion of the common carotid artery and received direct common carotid artery reperfusion. Patients were divided into 2 groups: single-roller pump antegrade selective cerebral perfusion (n = 7) and 2-roller pump antegrade selective cerebral perfusion (n = 8). In the 2-roller pump technique, separate cerebral perfusion circuits were used for the malperfused carotid artery and the remaining neck vessels, allowing independent flow regulation.
Baseline characteristics, operative parameters, and systemic outcomes were comparable between groups. No in-hospital deaths occurred in either group. Neurological deterioration was observed in 2 patients (28.6%) in the single-roller pump group, whereas no patient worsened in the 2-roller pump group. All symptomatic patients in the 2-pump group showed postoperative neurological improvement. No complications related to carotid exposure or 2-pump perfusion were identified.
The 2-roller pump technique provides reliable perfusion to both dissected and unaffected neck vessels, potentially reducing the risk of cerebral ischemia. This strategy is safe and feasible, and may improve neurological outcomes in patients with acute type A aortic dissection and carotid malperfusion."

Case reports,"Iodine-based contrast agents can be associated to uncommon side effects, as the generalized bullous fixed drug eruption (gbFDE), that cannot be counteracted by drugs.
We report a case of TAVI performed with a gadolinium-based contrast agent in a patient that had previously experienced a severe form of gbFDE. The patient was successfully treated by a balloon-expandable prosthesis implanted under the guidance of a total of 30 cc of gadolinium injections, avoiding any side effect.
Thus, the planning of TAVI procedure with zero iodinated contrast is mandatory in high-risk patients for such complication and it is feasible, safe with a gadolinium-based contrast."

Preoperative left ventricular diastolic function influences TAVI outcomes. The left atrioventricular coupling index (LACI) is a novel prognostic indicator in cardiovascular research that is significantly correlated with left ventricular diastolic function. Its role in TAVI remains unclear. The aim of this study was thus to investigate the prognostic value of the echocardiography-derived LACI in predicting major adverse cardiac events (MACEs) after TAVI.
This study included patients with moderate-to-severe aortic stenosis undergoing TAVI (June 2021-December 2024). Preoperative transthoracic echocardiography assessed LACI [defined as left atrial to ventricular end-diastolic volume ratio (LAEDV/LVEDV)], left atrial/ventricular function, and diastolic parameters. Baseline clinical data were systematically collected from electronic medical records. Postoperative MACEs (malignant arrhythmia, heart failure rehospitalization, or all-cause mortality) were tracked via follow-up.
Ultimately, 148 patients [mean age 81.3±4.8 years; 40.5% female; mean European System for Cardiac Operative Risk Evaluation (EuroSCORE) II 2.79%±1.13%] were included. MACEs occurred in 25 patients. The MACE group, compared to the non-MACE group, showed higher preoperative LACI (37.84±10.38 vs. 28.18±6.05; P<0.001), left atrial volume index (59.34±18.22 vs. 50.19±19.07; P=0.035), and E/e' ratio (16.00±5.00 vs. 11.96±6.38; P<0.001), along with lower left ventricular global longitudinal strain (11.30±2.76 vs. 13.28±2.28; P<0.001) and left atrial reservoir strain (11.70±3.97 vs. 17.43±7.79; P<0.001). Multivariate Cox analysis demonstrated that LACI was significantly associated with MACE occurrence (hazard ratio: 1.16, 95% confidence interval: 1.10-1.22; P<0.001). Receiver operating characteristic analysis suggested that an LACI ≥28% had acceptable sensitivity and specificity for predicting MACEs, and Kaplan-Meier curves revealed a higher MACE incidence among patients with LACI ≥28% (P<0.001).
LACI is an independent risk factor for adverse cardiac events in TAVI. Patients exhibiting left atrioventricular decoupling (LACI ≥28%) appear to have an elevated risk of MACEs."

Imaging methods and practice,"The hemodynamic consequences of aortic stenosis (AS) on supra-aortic trunks may play a potential role during the diagnosis of concomitant internal carotid artery (ICA) stenosis by dampening blood flow velocity. To investigate the effect of AS on ICA blood flow we evaluated carotid and vertebral blood flow velocity indexes in patients undergoing transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI).
Patients admitted for endovascular treatment of a severe AS underwent supra-aortic duplex ultrasound examination prior and after TAVI to be enrolled in the study. Patients with symptomatic or severe ICA stenosis were excluded. Patients with other cardiac impairments that could configure a confounding factor were excluded. One hundred and five patients of a median age of 80 years met the study inclusion criteria. The median peak systolic velocity (PSV) of the assessed supra-aortic arteries increased after TAVI: common carotid artery (CCA) from 64.5 to 78.0 cm/s (+24%; P < 0.01), ICA from 67.0 to 90.5 cm/s (+36%; P < 0.01), and vertebral artery (VA) from 44.0 to 51.0 cm/s (+17%; P < 0.01). Median end-diastolic velocity (EDV) also increased: CCA from 12.0 to 14.0 cm/s (+12%; P < 0.01), ICA from 19.0 to 23.0 cm/s (+20%; P < 0.01), and VA from 10.0 to 11.0 cm/s (+18%; P < 0.01). In parallel, median acceleration time (AT) decreased markedly at each site: CCA from 0.180 to 0.100 s (-44%; P < 0.01), ICA from 0.195 to 0.100 s (-41%; P < 0.01), and VA from 0.180 to 0.100 s (-36%; P < 0.01).
Severe AS significantly affects supra-aortic arteries blood flow as assessed by duplex, by decreasing both PSV and EDV and increasing AT. This study suggests that carotid ultrasound criteria to assess ICA stenosis severity should be re-evaluated in larger multi-centre studies to validate their predictive values in patients with concomitant AS."

Contrast-enhanced Computed tomography showed infiltrative soft-tissue masses in the posterior mediastinum, para-aortic region, and bilateral chest/abdominal walls, encasing the esophagus and major vessels; endoscopy confirmed extrinsic esophageal stenosis. EUS-FNA was nondiagnostic for small-cell carcinoma. Core biopsy with high-power review revealed predominantly medium-to-large blasts with focal granulocytic maturation. Immunophenotype supported myeloid lineage: MPO diffuse positive; CD117 positive; focal CD34 and CD99; weak-to-focal CD45/LCA; negative B-cell (CD19, CD20, CD79a), T-cell (CD2, CD3, CD5, CD7), and epithelial markers (CK AE1/AE3, CK19). Ki-67 proliferation rate was 40%-50%. Peripheral blood counts were unremarkable for blasts or cytopenias; bone marrow aspirate/biopsy/flow showed no diagnostic evidence of AML. Final diagnosis: MS with extrinsic esophageal compression.
AML-type systemic chemotherapy with the HAA regimen (homoharringtonine 3 mg d1-7, aclarubicin 20 mg d1-7, cytarabine 0.2 g d1-7; q3 weeks) plus standard supportive care.
Dysphagia improved during the first cycle. Interval imaging demonstrated reduction of mediastinal/retroperitoneal soft-tissue bulk and improved esophageal lumen consistent with disease control. No radiotherapy or esophageal stenting was required. On follow-up, disease remained controlled without transformation to AML.
Infiltrative mediastinal/retroperitoneal MS may present with esophageal obstruction and mimic lymphoma or carcinoma. High-index suspicion, targeted biopsy with high-power morphology, and a focused immunohistochemical panel are critical for timely diagnosis and treatment initiation."

We aimed to identify frequency and course of VHD stages as well as determinants of VHD progression in the general population.
The STAAB cohort study (Characteristics and Course of Heart Failure STAges A/B and Determinants of Progression) recruited a prestratified, population-based sample of residents (30-79 years) from Würzburg, Germany, without self-reported heart failure. Participants underwent baseline transthoracic echocardiography (2013-2017) with follow-up after 3 years (2017-2021). VHD progression was defined as an increase in stage or valve intervention.
Of 4943 participants (mean age 55 years, 53% women) VHD stages were: 24% no VHD, 54% stage A, 21% stage B and 0.3% stage C/D. Prevalence of VHD increased with advancing age. Among 3833 participants who were followed for a median of 34 months, 10% in stage A and 1.3% in stage B progressed. Progression rates were highest in participants aged 60-69 and 70-79 years, at rates of 15% and 25% for stage A and 1.6% and 2.6% for stage B, respectively. In multivariable age-adjusted models, elevated E/e' predicted progression from stage A, while elevated N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) predicted progression from stage B. Continuous analysis of aortic stenosis progression showed associations with older age, higher body mass index, diabetes and baseline peak velocity.
In a large community cohort, VHD was common, especially at older ages, and about 11% of individuals progressed within 3 years. Echocardiographic indices (E/e') and the biomarker NT-proBNP emerged as stage-specific predictors, supporting their potential role, along with age and metabolic factors, in identifying individuals at higher risk for progression."

We aimed to characterise metabolic profiles in patients with severe AS before and after aortic valve replacement (AVR) and their association with functional status, structural remodelling and mortality. Patients with symptomatic, severe AS before (n=143) and 1-year after (n=113) AVR underwent cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR), serum cardiac biomarkers, and 6-minute walk test. Resting non-fasting plasma samples underwent targeted nuclear magnetic resonance for fatty acids (FA), branched chain amino acids (BCAAs), glycolysis-related metabolites, and ketones. Lower FA and BCAA concentrations, but not glycolysis metabolites or ketones, correlated with greater myocardial mass and focal fibrosis, NT-proBNP, TnT and 6-minute walk distance. After 10.5 years of follow-up (66/143 deaths), lower FAs and BCAAs, but not ketones were independently associated with higher mortality risk (P<0.05). At 1-year after AVR, FAs had decreased compared to baseline. In conclusion, reduced serum FA and BCAA concentrations are cardiac, maladaptive, prognostic metabolic changes to AS, which are not reversible after AVR. Whether these markers may be used to guide the timing of AVR or provide metabolic risk stratification remains to be evaluated by future research. Condensed Abstract: In patients with aortic stenosis (AS) systemic metabolomics and their association with myocardial remodeling and outcome after aortic valve replacement (AVR) are largely unknown. We show that in severe AS low levels of unsaturated fatty acids and branched-chained amino acids correlate with higher mortality risk, and biomarkers measured by cardiac magnetic resonance, serum, and functional incapacity, and do not increase after AVR. This may provide an alternate approach to risk stratification using blood biomarkers or guide targeted therapies to myocardial energetics before or after AVR."

To investigate the association of obstructive CAD with clinical outcomes and health status among patients with symptomatic severe AS undergoing TAVR.
This post hoc analysis of the investigator-initiated, multicenter SCOPE I (Safety and Efficacy of the Symetis ACURATE Neo/TF Compared to the Edwards SAPIEN 3 Bioprosthesis for Transcatheter Aortic Valve Implantation by Transfemoral Approach) randomized clinical trial was conducted at 20 tertiary heart centers in Europe from February 8, 2017, to February 2, 2019, with follow-up through 3 years. Data were analyzed from February 17 through August 13, 2025.
Presence vs absence of obstructive CAD, defined as greater than 50% stenosis in at least 1 major epicardial coronary vessel.
Parameters of interest included vital and patient-reported disease-specific health status (Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire [KCCQ] scores, ranging from 0 to 100, with higher numbers indicating better health status), and clinical efficacy according to Valve Academic Research Consortium (VARC)-3 definitions. Analyses were conducted using the as treated population.
Of 732 patients with symptomatic severe AS undergoing TAVR (mean [SD] age, 82 [4] years; 416 [56.8%] female), obstructive CAD was identified in 373 (51.0%), 144 (38.6%) of whom underwent elective percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) during the periprocedural period. At 3 years after TAVR, there were no statistically significant differences in patient-reported health status (eg, median [IQR] baseline overall KCCQ scores with CAD, 54.2 [40.3-69.8] vs without CAD, 55.2 [38.5-72.9] and at 3-year follow-up with CAD, 79.7 [64.4-90.6] vs without CAD, 82.3 [68.2-91.7]), mortality (all-cause death: 88 of 373 [24.7%] vs 76 of 359 [22.3%], adjusted hazard ratio, [HR], 0.97 [95% CI, 0.66-1.43]; cardiovascular death: 59 of 373 [17.6%] vs 51 of 359 [15.5%], adjusted HR, 0.87 [95% CI, 0.54-1.42]), and clinical efficacy of TAVR (163 of 313 [52.1%] vs 159 of 298 [53.4%]; adjusted risk ratio, 1.10 [95% CI, 0.92-1.32]) between patients with vs without obstructive CAD. Having (vs not having) obstructive CAD was associated with a numerically albeit not statistically significantly higher risk of myocardial infarction (18 of 372 [5.5%] vs 3 of 359 [1.1%]; adjusted HR, 3.83 [95% CI, 0.96-15.31]). Periprocedural PCI among patients with obstructive CAD did not improve clinical outcomes, patient-reported health status, nor the integrated end points of clinical outcomes and quality of life measures.
In this post hoc analysis of SCOPE I, patients with obstructive CAD who underwent TAVR had no statistically significant differences in survival, patient-reported health status, or VARC-3 clinical efficacy compared with patients without CAD through 3 years of follow-up. Findings suggest that a tailored approach may be essential in the treatment of TAVR candidates with severe AS and CAD.

We report the use of distal coronary pressure (Pd) above proximal aortic pressure (Pa) during the early expansion period as a visual dichotomous marker (negative expansion resistance, NER) for rapid clinical decision-making. Simultaneous pressure and velocity signals were used to calculate instantaneous wave-free ratio (iFR), fractional flow reserve (FFR), hyperemic stenosis resistance (hSR), and to identify the NER. NER was defined as the Pd > Pa during the early-expansion period, which refers to early-decompression of coronary circulation marked by pressure decay (dP/dt < 0) coinciding the time-window of reduced ejection phase of systole to early diastole. Classification performance of NER was evaluated against iFR, FFR and hSR. Out of 475 lesions with mean diameter stenosis of 61% ± 16% from 388 patients with chronic coronary syndrome (CCS), 46%(217/475) exhibited the NER-phenomenon. Of these, 96% (209/217) had an iFR above 0.89(NPV = 0.96[95%CI 93-98] PPV = 0.47[95%CI 41-54]) indicating hemodynamically non-significant lesions. 94%(204/217) of the NER( +) lesions had an hSR below 0.80(NPV = 0.94 [95%CI 90-97] PPV = 0.36[95%CI 30-42]), and 88%(191/217) had an FFR above 0.80 (NPV = 0.88[95%CI 83-92] PPV = 0.53[95%CI 46-59]), indicating non-flow limiting lesions. Of 8 lesions with NER despite an abnormal iFR, only 1 had abnormal hSR, whereas 7 had normal hSR. Of 162 lesions with abnormal FFR, iFR identified 53 (33%) as 'normal' whereas NER was present in 26 (16%) of these cases.NER was associated with instantaneously stronger coronary decompression wave(8.0 ± 11.2 vs 5.5 ± 10.1 10.kW.m-2.s-2 p:0.016) and higher flow acceleration(195 ± 204 vs 106 ± 182 cm.s-2 p < 0.001). In conclusion, the NER, visually recognized by resting pressure tracings, rules out flow-limiting lesions in CCS with high certainty, offering a simple first-line evaluation for clinical decision-making, and warrants prospective clinical studies."
PubMed,aortic stenosis,Ambulatory General Anesthesia for Dental Treatment in a Patient With Williams Syndrome and Supravalvular Aortic Restenosis: A Case Report.,Yukako Tsutsui; Hitomi Izumikawa; Miyuki Itakura; Katsuhisa Sunada,10.2344/24-0032,2025-12-09,Anesthesia progress,"Williams syndrome (WS) is a genetic disorder marked by intellectual disability, distinctive craniofacial features, dental abnormalities, and congenital heart defects, particularly supravalvular aortic stenosis-a narrowing above the aortic valve. Patients with WS are at increased risk of perioperative sudden cardiac death, necessitating thorough cardiovascular assessment. Additionally, craniofacial anomalies such as micrognathia and retrognathia may lead to difficult airway management and often require awake intubation. However, awake intubation and hospitalization can be distressing for patients with WS due to their developmental challenges. These facts indicate the importance of identifying during the preoperative assessment for ambulatory general anesthesia those at low risk for cardiovascular complications and airway difficulties. This case report details the successful anesthetic management of a 9-year-old boy with WS undergoing ambulatory general anesthesia for dental treatment by maintaining a balance between myocardial oxygen supply and demand to minimize cardiovascular fluctuations and by paying careful attention to managing his airway. Our case highlights the feasibility and safety of ambulatory general anesthesia for patients with WS, minimizing hospitalization stress and ensuring patient safety."

HCM phenotype cases were defined as cats with echocardiographic findings of a maximum left ventricular wall thickness (LVWT) ≥6 mm on at least one presentation. TMT was defined as an increased LVWT ≥6 mm on at least two presentations, a subsequent decrease in LVWT of more than 25% within 6 months, no subsequent increase in left atrial-to-aortic root ratio (LA/Ao) ≥20% from baseline, and a fractional shortening ≤30%. A total of 145 cats had HCM phenotypes. Among cats that underwent serial echocardiography (n = 53), 16 were diagnosed with TMT and 34 with HCM. At presentation, the maximum LVWT was 8.3 ± 1.7 mm in cats with TMT, and decreased to 5.4 ± 0.9 mm after a median of 3.5 months [1-6 months]. Two cats initially classified as TMT were later identified as TMT on HCM based on persistent LV thickening, and all cats with TMT survived until the time of publication. The prevalence of TMT may be higher than expected when including asymptomatic TMT and TMT on HCM. Clinicians should be aware of the possibility of dynamic changes in myocardial thickness in cats."

However, the interpretation of variants, especially those of uncertain significance (VUSs), remains challenging for laboratories and clinicians. In April 2024, the ClinGen Cardiomyopathy Variant Curation Expert Panel (VCEP) adapted the ACMG/AMP criteria for eight of the sarcomeric genes (MYH7, MYBPC3, TNNI3, TNNT2, TPM1, ACTC1, MYL2, and MYL3), providing a refined framework for variant interpretation in these genes. This retrospective study re-evaluated 69 VUSs identified in 84 HCM patients between 2017 and 2024, aiming to resolve uncertainty and reduce the VUS rate.
Here, two groups of curators reinterpreted variants with the most recent data using the Cardiomyopathy VCEP specifications until a consensus was reached. To streamline the process, we created a semiautomated decision support tool based on these gene-specific rules.
The application of the Cardiomyopathy VCEP specifications resulted in the reclassification of 17.4% (N = 12/69, 95% CI: 10.2%-28.0%) of VUS, whereas the new data alone were not sufficient. Out of the reclassified variants, 91.7% (N = 11/12) were downgraded to benignity (involving 17 patients), and 8.3% were upgraded to pathogenicity (involving one patient), with a mean reclassification time of 68.3 months, corresponding to 5.7 years. The most applied criteria were related to population (PM2 = 55%; BA1/BS1 = 16%), bioinformatic prediction (PP3 = 45%; BP4 = 25%), and critical domains (PM1 = 21%). However, most codes suffer from a lack of evidence (segregation data, functional assays, and case-control studies). When comparing this curation with classifications in public databases, 13.3% (N = 8/60) and 16.2% (N = 11/68) of variants listed as having inconclusive significance in ClinVar and CardioClassifier were, respectively, reclassified in this study.
Using gene-specific ACMG/AMP criteria reduces the rate of VUS, increasing diagnostic yield, and informing clinical management in the context of HCM. Nonetheless, ongoing efforts to generate evidence and promote standardization remain essential to improve variant interpretation."
PubMed,aortic stenosis,Aortic stenosis in cirrhosis: Pathophysiology and management in the context of liver transplantation.,Brian Osorio; Sam W Fox; Katherine M Cooper; Sahas Chandragiri; Amir F Mohani; Deepika Devuni,10.5500/wjt.v15.i4.102995,2025-12-18,World journal of transplantation,"Aortic stenosis (AS), a progressive disease affecting aortic valve function, is common among individuals with metabolic and degenerative conditions, and is notably challenging to manage in patients with cirrhosis. Patients with cirrhosis frequently experience exacerbated AS symptoms due to the hyperdynamic circulatory state induced by portal hypertension, which masks early AS signs, resulting in delayed diagnosis. The coexistence of AS and liver disease significantly complicates management, particularly for those awaiting liver transplantation (LT), where untreated AS can increase perioperative morbidity and mortality. This review examines the pathophysiology, clinical manifestations, and management of AS in cirrhotic patients, with a focus on implications for LT candidates. Available treatment options, including surgical aortic valve replacement and transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR), are discussed, with TAVR emerging as a preferred approach due to favorable outcomes in high-risk patients. We also explore the potential role of TAVR as a bridge to LT, with case reports showing promising, albeit anecdotal, success in restoring LT candidacy. Limitations in current perioperative risk assessment tools, which inadequately address the unique risks faced by cirrhotic patients undergoing cardiac procedures, highlight the need for multi-disciplinary care and further research to improve outcomes of patients with concomitant end-stage liver disease and AS."

Kinovea, as an accessible motion-analysis software, provides both visual and quantitative feedback. However, its application in supporting technique development among beginner athletes remains insufficiently explored. Aim: This study aims to describe the use of Kinovea in biomechanics training and examine its contribution to the awareness of kinematic characteristics and movement techniques among beginner athletes. Methods: A descriptive qualitative design involved 72 beginner athletes aged 18–25 years selected through purposive sampling. Data were collected over 16 weeks through interviews, field observations, and motion video recordings analyzed using Kinovea. Kinematic data focused on joint angles, stride behavior, and movement phases during walking, running, and the flight phase. Qualitative data were analyzed using content analysis with NVivo 12, while kinematic results were interpreted descriptively to identify performance patterns and areas for technical refinement. Result: Kinematic analysis showed coordinated joint-angle patterns across all phases. Walking analysis identified arm swing angles of 50.9°–58.8° and leg separation angles of 64.3°–67.2°, indicating a stable gait rhythm. The running analysis revealed knee angles of 68.8°–69.8° and elbow angles of 87.6°–89.1°, indicating efficient propulsive mechanics. The flight phase demonstrated knee angles of 81.2°–87.8° and elbow angles of 80.4°–88.3°, suggesting effective momentum use and postural stability. These measurements supported stride-efficiency assessment and technique evaluation. Qualitative findings revealed that Kinovea enabled athletes to interpret movement phases and identify technical inefficiencies through slow-motion and frame-by-frame visualization. Conclusion: Kinovea supports basic motion analysis by providing clear kinematic information and helping beginner athletes observe and refine their movement techniques. The findings also offer practical value for coaches by enabling more precise identification of inefficient patterns and guiding targeted corrections during early-stage training."
