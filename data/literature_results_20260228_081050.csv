PubMed,aortic stenosis,Association Between AI-derived Thoracic Calcium Volume and Aortic Valve Calcification Quantified by Agatston Scoring.,Gonçalo G Almeida; Dana Belde; Mike Guldimann; Stephan Engelberger; André Euler; Fabienne Knöpfli; Rahel A Kubik-Huch; Michael Thali; Tilo Niemann,10.21873/invivo.14266,2026,"In vivo (Athens, Greece)","Aortic valve calcification is a key determinant of aortic stenosis severity. Whether AI-derived thoracic aortic calcium volume reflects valvular calcification remains unclear. This study examined the association between aortic valve calcification quantified using Agatston, volume and mass scores, and total aortic calcium volume measured with an automated AI tool.
This retrospective single-center study included 32 patients undergoing computed tomography (CT) for transcatheter aortic valve implantation planning. Aortic valve calcification was quantified on noncontrast CT using Agatston, volume and mass scores. Total aortic calcium volume was derived from contrast-enhanced CT using the AI-Rad Companion Chest CT. Correlation analyses and simple linear regression assessed associations between aortic and valvular calcification metrics.
Mean total aortic calcium volume was 4.38 ml. Mean aortic valve Agatston score was 3307 units and mean valve calcium volume was 2727 mm3. Correlation between total aortic calcium and aortic valve Agatston score was weak and nonsignificant (Pearson r=0.213, p=0.259). Correlation with valve calcium volume was similarly weak (Pearson r=0.219, p=0.244). Regression models showed minimal explained variance (R2≈4-5 percent), and slopes were not statistically significant. No clinically relevant association between thoracic aortic calcium burden and aortic valve calcification was identified.
AI-derived thoracic aortic calcium volume did not correlate with aortic valve calcification. Valvular calcification appears to progress independently of thoracic aortic wall calcification. Automated aortic calcium measurements cannot substitute for direct quantification of aortic valve calcification in preprocedural assessment."
PubMed,aortic stenosis,Early TAVR cost-effectiveness compared to clinical surveillance in patients with asymptomatic severe aortic stenosis in the US.,Phillippe Généreux; Matthew R Reynolds; Marcella A Kelley; Christin Thompson; Suzanne J Baron,10.1016/j.jval.2026.02.005,2026-02-25,Value in health : the journal of the International Society for Pharmacoeconomics and Outcomes Research,"The EARLY TAVR trial demonstrated improved clinical outcomes for patients with asymptomatic severe aortic stenosis (aSAS) treated with transcatheter aortic valve replacement (eTAVR) compared with clinical surveillance (CS). The cost effectiveness of an eTAVR strategy for patients with aSAS in the United States (US) is unknown.
A Markov model with 30-day cycles was developed from the US healthcare payor perspective to estimate the cost-effectiveness of eTAVR vs. CS over a lifetime horizon. Inputs for population characteristics and health outcomes were derived from the EARLY TAVR trial. Costs were derived from US Medicare reimbursement rates. Probabilistic and deterministic sensitivity analyses were performed to evaluate the effect of parameter uncertainty on model output.
When compared to CS, eTAVR was associated with 0.21 additional life years (LY) and 0.24 additional quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) over a lifetime due to more time spent in the alive and well health state with eTAVR. Lifetime costs were estimated to be $8,812 lower, due primarily to reductions in costs associated with the AVR procedure, stroke, and heart failure hospitalizations. Accordingly, eTAVR was projected to be economically dominant over CS. In probabilistic sensitivity analysis, a large majority of iterations (95.9%) produced cost-effective results ($100,000 threshold) for eTAVR versus CS, with most simulations (90.3%) showing dominance, confirming the robustness of the base case results. These findings were consistent over a variety of scenario analyses.
An eTAVR strategy for the treatment of aSAS may be a cost-saving approach for US healthcare payors, when compared to CS."
PubMed,aortic stenosis,Relative Aortic Valve Stiffness: A New Parameter Quantifying Aortic Stenosis.,Eric Buffle; Athanasios Papadis; Isaac Blaser; Nikolas Nozica; Mohammad Kassar; Roger Ludwig; David Berger; Matthias Hänggi; Marco Mauri; Dominik Obrist; Christian Seiler; Stefano F de Marchi,10.1152/ajpheart.00804.2025,2026-02-27,American journal of physiology. Heart and circulatory physiology,"Background: Aortic stenosis (AS) quantification relies on transvalvular gradients or aortic valve opening area (AVA), two measures that inherently depend on the instantaneous transvalvular flow rate (Q). We present a new quantification method for AS based on new modelling where AVA saturates with increasing Q, contradicting the assumption of linear Q-AVA-relation currently predominant in the literature. Objective: Development of a new method for the quantification of AS. Methods: In 141 patient undergoing transesophageal echocardiography, AVA was obtained frame-by-frame over an entire systole from 3D echocardiograms using multiplanar reconstruction. Q was retrieved by Doppler- and 3D echocardiography of the left ventricular outflow tract. A sigmoid Q-AVA relation was fitted with a machine learning algorithm. The measured and the predicted AVA were compared between a parametrized linear and sigmoid Q-AVA-relation model. A relative aortic valve stiffness (rAVS) was calculated, and an isostiffness nomogram was constructed. Cox proportional hazard modelling was used to look for predictors of rehospitalization-free survival Results: Compared to the linear model, the sigmoid model consistently better predicted measured AVA in all AS severity groups. Within severity groups, rAVS remained robust and constant, a property not shared by the linear model. A ROC-Analysis revealed a rAVS-value of 1.51 as the best cut-off for distinguishing severe from non-severe AS. Cox proportional hazard modelling showed its value as an independent predictor of rehospitalization-free survival. Conclusions: We present a new method for the quantification of AS that could help simplify the diagnosis of patients with low-flow, low-gradient AS."
PubMed,aortic stenosis,All three coronary arteries and a separate conus branch arising from the right sinus of Valsalva in an octogenarian with an acute myocardial infarction: a case report.,Mihajlo Kovacic; Branko Ostricki; Mateja Ostricki; Tea-Terezija Cvetko; Josip Andelo Borovac,10.1093/ehjcr/ytag094,2026-02,European heart journal. Case reports,"Coronary artery anomalies are encountered in less than 1% of the population and are usually found incidentally. Some vessel courses are linked to myocardial ischaemia and sudden cardiac death while successful PCI in ACS scenarios poses a clinical challenge.
An 83-year-old woman with hypertension and dyslipidaemia presented with an ACS. The ECG showed atrial fibrillation while echocardiography revealed ischaemic cardiomyopathy with mildly reduced ejection fraction. Diagnostic coronary angiography showed a four separate ostia arising from the right sinus of Valsalva: RCA, LAD, LCX, and an independent conus branch. Transient occlusion of the conal branch by the diagnostic catheter triggered VF promptly terminated with DC cardioversion. On Day 4, PCI via right transulnar access was performed as we treated a first diagonal branch with DCB and mid-RCA stenosis with two DES. CTCA at follow-up confirmed an anterior (pre-pulmonic) course of the LAD, a retroaortic course of the LCX, and a dominant RCA. LAAT was detected and oral anticoagulation was initiated. The patient was discharged in stable condition on GDMT.
This constellation, a separate ostia of four coronary arteries arising from the right coronary sinus, is exceedingly rare. The case underscores several practical points. Anomalous coronaries are susceptible to atherosclerosis and should be revascularized according to clinical context and not anomaly per se. Furthermore, meticulous catheter manipulation should be performed in order to avoid transient ostial compromise of small branches, such as in our case. Finally, CTCA complements invasive angiography by clarifying spatial relationships essential for risk stratification."
PubMed,aortic stenosis,The Combined Double-Orifice and Single-Patch Technique for Partial Atrioventricular Septal Defect in Adults: A Novel Strategy.,Hua-Jie Zheng; Rui-Han Xiao; Mao-Ting Ye; Jun Li; Mei Guo; San-Jiu Yu; Yong-Bo Cheng; Wei Cheng,10.1155/cdr/8493694,2026,Cardiovascular therapeutics,"The aim of this study is to share our experience of the combined double-orifice and single-patch technique for the correction of partial atrioventricular septal defect (pAVSD) and its associated tricuspid valve dysplasia (TVD).
Between January 2014 and May 2024, 99 patients (age ≥ 18 years) who underwent repair of pAVSD and its associated TVD using the aforementioned strategy were retrospectively analyzed.
The mean aortic cross-clamp time was 48.5 ± 12.6 min, and the mean cardiopulmonary bypass time was 75.8 ± 13.0 min. Follow-up was 100% at a mean of 5.2 years (3-8 years). No operative or late deaths occurred. No evidence of mitral stenosis was detected, and only one patient developed a severe MR 2 years after the surgery and underwent reoperation. There was no moderate or severe tricuspid regurgitation during follow-up. There was neither secondary tricuspid valve repair nor permanent pacemaker implantation among all patients.
The combined double-orifice and single-patch technique is a safe, effective, and durable strategy for repair of pAVSD and its associated TVD, demonstrating an excellent technical reproducibility."
PubMed,aortic stenosis,A rare case of partial Shone complex in adulthood: coarctation-site methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus endocarditis and saccular aneurysm.,Murat Akdoğan; Burak Karaman; Selen Münüsoğlu; Yeliz Aktürk; Özer Kandemir; Hatice Tolunay Karaman,10.1017/S1047951125110913,2026-02-27,Cardiology in the young,"Shone complex is a rare congenital cardiovascular anomaly characterized by multiple left-sided obstructive lesions. Adult presentation is uncommon and may result in atypical clinical manifestations, particularly when complicated by infective endocarditis. Coarctation of the aorta-associated infective endocarditis is especially rare and carries significant clinical risk.
We report a 25-year-old male with partial Shone complex consisting of a parachute mitral valve, mitral stenosis, and coarctation of the aorta. The patient presented with persistent high-grade fever and was diagnosed with methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus infective endocarditis based on positive blood cultures. Transthoracic and transesophageal echocardiography revealed obstructive left-sided lesions, mitral valve pathology, and moderate aortic regurgitation. Positron emission tomography demonstrated intense hypermetabolic activity at the coarctation site, consistent with active infection and confirming a saccular aneurysm. The patient underwent prolonged intravenous cefazolin therapy followed by surgical repair. The early postoperative course was stable; however, seven months later he re-presented with recurrent fever. Repeat imaging demonstrated graft infection, vegetation on the prosthetic material, and a perforated mitral leaflet. A second course of intravenous antibiotics (cefazolin and rifampicin) was administered, followed by long-term suppressive oral therapy. Subsequent follow-up showed persistent moderate-to-severe mitral regurgitation with stable postoperative anatomy.
This case highlights a rare adult manifestation of partial Shone complex complicated by coarctation of the aorta-site methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus infection, saccular aneurysm formation, and recurrent graft-associated infective endocarditis. The clinical course underscores the importance of vigilant multimodality imaging, early multidisciplinary evaluation, and long-term follow-up in adults with complex CHD, particularly when infectious complications are present."

In the present study, we evaluated the predictive value and optimal cut-off values of LVMW parameters measured prior to TAVI that may be associated with increased mortality in AS patients. Methods: A total of 116 consecutive patients who were qualified for TAVI between March 2021 and November 2022 were evaluated. Pre-procedural LVMW indices (GWI, GCW, GWW, and GWE) were assessed and long-term survival was analysed. Survival and influencing factors were evaluated using univariate and multivariate Cox proportional hazard models, with significant factors subsequently included in cut-off analysis. Results: The median survival time following the TAVI procedure was 1404 (1143-1549) days, with a maximum observation period of 1721 days. All-cause mortality during the follow-up period reached 29%. Multivariate analysis revealed that EF, GLS, GWI, GWE and GCW before TAVI were independent predictors of all-cause mortality. We identified 1975 mmHg, 1497 mmHg and 85% as optimal cut-off values for GCW, GWI and GWE, which allow for significant stratification of patients according to risk. Conclusions: In this analysis, baseline-assessed parameters such as GLS, GWI, GWE, and GCW emerged as independent predictors of all-cause mortality. The proposed cut-off values clearly separated patient groups with different survival outcomes."

Cardiac damage staging systems may better characterize myocardial and extracardiac involvement. We aim to evaluate the presence and progression of cardiac damage across the clinical course of AS. Methods: A single-center retrospective cohort study was conducted, which included consecutive patients who ultimately underwent TAVR and had retrievable serial echocardiograms at moderate AS, first severe AS, and pre-TAVR symptomatic severe AS (2017-2021). A total of 179 patients were evaluated (mean age 82.7 [5.9] years at moderate AS; 46% male, p = 0.27). Cardiac damage was classified according to two established staging systems. Results: The median time from moderate to severe AS was 32 months (IQR 18-48). Most echocardiographic parameters deteriorated primarily at symptom onset, whereas moderate AS and first severe (asymptomatic) AS showed broadly similar profiles. However, left ventricular global longitudinal strain (LV GLS) was already impaired at the first severe stage, and right ventricular-arterial coupling (RVAc, TAPSE/sPAP) progressively worsened as AS advanced to the severe stage, independently of symptom status (LV GLS -18.1%, n = 163; -17.1%, n = 143; and -14.9%, n = 143; RVAc 1.0, n = 131; 0.8, n = 130; and 0.7, n = 130), respectively; overall p < 0.05. Both staging systems demonstrated increasing cardiac damage with AS progression. Conclusions: Cardiac damage may occur early in AS. The marked deterioration at symptom onset underscores the importance of systematic myocardial assessment and supports prospective studies to evaluate whether integrating LV GLS and RVAc as sensitive early markers of disease progression improves risk stratification."
PubMed,aortic stenosis,Percutaneous Closure of a Large-Bore Carotid Arteriotomy Using a Collagen-Based Vascular Plug.,Radoslaw Parma; Radoslaw Gocol; Joanna Nawara-Skipirzepa; Ryszard Bachowski; Wojciech Wojakowski; Damian Hudziak,10.3390/life16020292,2026-02-09,"Life (Basel, Switzerland)","Background: Inadvertent arterial cannulation during central venous catheter placement is a recognized complication with potentially serious consequences, particularly when involving large-caliber catheters. While management strategies have evolved from mandatory surgical repair to various percutaneous approaches, limited data exist regarding collagen-based vascular closure devices for large-bore carotid arteriotomies. Case Presentation: We report the case of a 59-year-old male patient with acute Stanford Type A aortic dissection who underwent emergency surgical repair of the ascending aorta. During central venous cannulation, a five-lumen Certofix Quinto catheter (12-French outer diameter) was inadvertently inserted into the left common carotid artery. Given the complexity of concurrent cardiac surgery and the large-bore nature of the arteriotomy, percutaneous closure with an 18-French MANTA vascular closure device was successfully performed following completion of the aortic repair. The procedure achieved immediate hemostasis without complications. Outcomes: The patient remained neurologically intact throughout a 12-month follow-up period. Serial duplex ultrasonography and computed tomography angiography confirmed carotid artery patency without evidence of stenosis, dissection, pseudoaneurysm formation, or thromboembolic complications. Conclusions: This case demonstrates the technical feasibility of using a collagen-based vascular closure device for percutaneous management of a large-bore carotid arteriotomy in the acute surgical setting. While the outcome was favorable in this patient, this approach represents an off-label application that requires further validation and should be reserved for carefully selected cases in experienced centers where the benefits of percutaneous closure are judged to outweigh the uncertainties of supra-aortic device deployment."
PubMed,aortic stenosis,Integrated Transcriptomic Analysis Identifies Novel Candidate Genes Associated with Calcific Aortic Valve Disease.,Jing Chen; Shichao Guo; Junming Zhu; Haiou Hu; Bing Tang; Lingchen Huang; Chenhan Zhang; Suwei Chen; Sanbao Chai; Zhiyu Qiao; Hongfeng Jiang,10.3390/genes17020246,2026-02-20,Genes,"Calcified aortic valve disease (CAVD) is a prevalent valvular disorder in the elderly and a major cause of aortic stenosis. Surgical and transcatheter aortic valve replacement remain the primary treatments for advanced CAVD; however, effective pharmacological therapies to prevent or slow disease progression are lacking. Therefore, there is an urgent need to explore potential novel candidate biomarkers and therapeutic targets.
In this study, transcriptomic data from multiple independent datasets were integrated to comprehensively characterize the transcriptional profile of CAVD. Feature genes were identified using complementary machine learning approaches, followed by functional pathway enrichment and protein-protein interaction (PPI) network analyses to uncover novel candidate genes associated with CAVD. Single-cell RNA sequencing (sc-RNA-Seq) data were further analyzed using pseudotime trajectory analysis to explore transcriptional dynamics during valve interstitial cells' (VICs) osteogenic progression. Quantitative PCR and Western blot analyses of human calcified aortic valve tissues were used for validation.
A total of 119 CAVD-associated genes were identified, primarily involved in ossification, extracellular matrix organization, and cell-substrate adhesion. Among these, the ossification-associated genes BAMBI, HAND2, and MYOC exhibited potential discriminatory power between CAVD and control samples, with notable downregulation in calcified valves. Pseudotime analysis showed that the expression of these genes gradually decreased along the transcriptional trajectory associated with osteogenic differentiation. In addition, the analysis of relative immune signatures revealed negative correlations between these genes and multiple immune signatures.
This study identifies novel candidate genes underlying CAVD pathogenesis and highlights BAMBI, HAND2, and MYOC as potential biomarkers and therapeutic targets, providing new insights into disease mechanisms and opportunities for novel interventions."

However, growing evidence supports a paradigm shift toward recognizing AS as an active metabolic and inflammatory disorder. This narrative review synthesizes experimental, translational, and clinical evidence published between 2015 and 2025 examining metabolic mechanisms linking valvular calcification and atrial remodeling in AS and discusses their clinical relevance in the context of transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR). We discussed classical pathways involving mineral metabolism and vitamin signaling, alongside emerging roles of lipid oxidation, mitochondrial dysfunction, epigenetic regulation, and gut microbiome-derived metabolites. Further, metabolomic signatures associated with disease severity and post-TAVR outcomes were reviewed, highlighting the predominantly associative nature and current limitations of these data. Although valve replacement remains the only effective therapy for advanced AS, metabolic and multi-omics insights may improve future risk stratification and mechanistic understanding. Metabolomic profiling could be integrated at multiple points in the clinical pathway for aortic stenosis and TAVR-most promisingly for pre-procedural risk stratification. The present paper focuses on an integrative framework in which valvular calcification and atrial remodeling are viewed within a broader context of metabolic dysregulation. Future research should aim to translate molecular biomarkers into real-world diagnostics and targeted interventions."

FlowVN was trained on fully sampled 4D Flow MRI datasets of healthy volunteers from one site. The model was tested on retrospective undersampled data (R = 6-22) of six normal volunteers from the same site and six from another site, prospectively undersampled data (R = 12.4-13.8) of six healthy volunteers from the second site and six patients with aortic stenosis from first Site. Performance was evaluated using nRMSE, relative and angular error, average and maximum velocity, flow rate, volumetric flow, and turbulent kinetic energy (TKE), with a Wilcoxon signed-rank test to assess the difference from ground truth.
FlowVN showed minimal sensitivity to the number of training datasets and performed well even when trained on a single dataset. FlowVN also demonstrated good generalizability across sites. No significant difference in average and maximum velocity was observed up to R = 16. Total TKE was preserved up to R = 10 in the normal volunteers, but was well preserved even at higher acceleration factors in the aortic stenosis patients. Flow volumes through the ascending and descending aorta were well preserved for all acceleration factors, although ascending aorta flow volumes for data from one site were significantly different from ground truth for AF > 16.
FlowVN accurately reconstructs highly undersampled 4D Flow MRI from multiple sites using a model trained on a single dataset, maintaining excellent quantitative image quality even at very high acceleration factors."

While hypertension often coexists with aortic stenosis, the long-term effects of transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) on blood pressure (BP), the predictors of BP changes, and their prognostic significance remain incompletely understood.
We conducted a retrospective cohort study of 1333 patients who underwent TAVI at Sheba Medical Centre between 2008 and 2023. Changes in SBP and DBP were divided into quintiles (lowest, intermediate, and highest) and assessed for associations with all-cause mortality using Kaplan-Meier survival curves and Cox proportional hazards models, adjusted for clinical and echocardiographic variables. Multinomial logistic regression identified predictors of BP changes.
The mean age was 81 years; 50% were men, and 73% had preexisting hypertension. Mean baseline SBP and DBP were 135 and 69 mmHg, respectively. Post-TAVI, SBP increased in 53% of patients, and DBP in 47%. Over a median follow-up of 4.6 years, higher post-TAVI SBP and DBP were independently associated with improved survival, after adjustment for clinical and echocardiographic confounders. Lower baseline left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) predicted increased SBP (P < 0.001), and female sex predicted increased DBP (P < 0.001). Preexisting hypertension did not predict BP changes.
Post-TAVI BP elevation is linked to better long-term survival, especially among patients with reduced baseline LVEF, and may reflect a beneficial hemodynamic response rather than comorbidity. Lower baseline LVEF and female sex are independent predictors of this response. These findings support permissive management of BP changes post-TAVI to improve patient outcomes."

Their effect in patients undergoing transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) for severe aortic stenosis (AS), however, remains unclear. This study evaluated whether SGLT2 inhibitors reduce all-cause mortality and HF hospitalisations after TAVR.
A systematic search of PubMed, ScienceDirect, Cochrane (CENTRAL), Scopus and Embase was performed through April 2025 for studies comparing post-TAVR outcomes between SGLT2 inhibitor users and non-users. Outcomes of interest included a composite of all-cause mortality or heart failure (HF) hospitalisation, along with the individual components of all-cause mortality and HF hospitalisation. All outcomes were extracted at 1 year. Pooled hazard ratios (HRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated using a random-effects model. Heterogeneity was quantified using I2 statistics. Analyses were conducted in R (version 4.4.2).
Three studies (1 RCT, 2 Observational) comprising 3187 patients met inclusion criteria. SGLT2 inhibitor use was associated with a reduced risk of the composite outcome (HR: 0.75; 95% CI: 0.65, 0.86; p < 0.01). Individually, therapy lowered all-cause mortality (HR: 0.72; 95% CI: 0.53, 0.96; p = 0.03) and HF hospitalisations (HR: 0.74; 95% CI: 0.61, 0.90; p < 0.01).
In patients with severe AS undergoing TAVR, SGLT2 inhibitors were associated with significant reductions in all-cause mortality and HF hospitalisations. These findings suggest a promising role for SGLT2 inhibitors in improving post-TAVR outcomes. However, given the limited data, larger randomised clinical trials are necessary to consolidate these findings.

Although mechanical circulatory support (MCS) can mitigate hemodynamic instability, evidence guiding the use of cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) during concomitant transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) and percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) is lacking.
The authors retrospectively reviewed 6 high-risk patients who underwent concomitant TAVR and PCI with planned MCS using CPB or venoarterial (VA)-ECMO between 2015 and 2023. Outcomes were classified according to VARC-3 criteria.
Six male patients (mean age 77.3 ± 8.3 years) underwent concomitant TAVR and PCI with planned MCS using CPB (n = 4, 2015-2020) or VA-ECMO (n = 2, 2022-2023). Complete coronary revascularization was achieved in 4 cases (66.7%). Implanted valves included 2 self-expanding and 4 balloon-expandable prostheses. The mean catheter-measured transaortic gradient decreased from 37.2 ± 17.6 mm Hg to 3.9 ± 2.1 mm Hg (P = .006). Trace (1+) paravalvular leak occurred in 4 patients (66.7%), with none 2+ or higher. There were no intraprocedural complications, neurologic events, major bleeding, vascular complications, or 30-day deaths. Three patients (50%) developed new conduction abnormalities, all without pacemaker requirement. Acute kidney injury occurred in 3 (Stage I, 50%). The mean intensive care and total hospital stays were 5.5 ± 3.5 and 8.3 ± 6.0 days, respectively.
Planned CPB or VA-ECMO support enabled safe performance of concomitant TAVR and PCI in non-surgical, high-risk patients, representing a feasible approach for selected complex cases."

Aortic valve replacement (AVR) with a biological prosthesis has become highly popular and commonly used. This study aims to assess long-term outcomes after biological AVR with regard to structural and non-structural deterioration.
In this single-centre retrospective study, 918 patients undergoing surgical AVR with a biological prosthesis at the University Hospital Frankfurt from January 2006 to July 2009 were included. The primary endpoints were freedom from reoperation and from structural and non-structural deterioration, and the secondary was long-term survival. Follow-up was completed in 95.6% with a median of 7.6 years, accounting 6610 patient-years. The mean age was 74.9 years and a median EuroSCORE II (range) was 3.34 (0.77-62.4). Twenty-two percent of surgeries were either emergent or urgent. Many patients had concomitant surgery, while coronary artery bypass grafting in 45.3% of patients was the most common. Three prosthetic valve models were used in our patient population: Carpentier Edwards Perimount (CEP) Model 2900, Model 3000 and Medtronic Mosaic (MM).
Reoperation occurred in 36 patients (3.9%) due to endocarditis (2.0%), aortic root aneurysm (0.1%), isolated or combined aortic stenosis or aortic regurgitation (1.9%). Freedom from reoperation at 5, 10 and 15 years was 97 ± 0.6%, 95.6 ± 0.8% and 90.3 ± 2.3%, respectively. Freedom from major stroke at 5, 10 and 15 years was 97.9 ± 0.0%, 96.4 ± 0.8%, and 96.1 ± 0.08%, and freedom from major bleeding event at 5, 10 and 15 years was 98.5 ± 0.4%, 95.7 ± 0.9% and 92.7 ± 2.2%, respectively. A subgroup analysis of the Carpentier Edwards (CEP) valves and the Medtronic Mosaic (MM) valves showed no significant differences regarding the primary endpoints. The overall survival at 5, 10 and 15 years was 67 ± 1.7%, 39.8 ± 1.8%, and 15.1 ± 2.2% respectively. The Kaplan-Meier survival estimator was 96 ± 2.2 months.
This study showed a good long-term survival of surgical AVR with biological prostheses in relatively high-risk and elderly patient population.

Although the Perceval sutureless valve provides larger effective orifice areas, sex-specific PPM outcomes remain unclear. This study evaluated sex-related differences in PPM incidence, severity, and early impact after Perceval AVR. (2) Methods: We retrospectively analyzed 139 patients (68 males, 71 females) who underwent Perceval AVR between 2016 and 2020. PPM was defined per Valve Academic Research Consortium-3 (VARC-3) criteria using indexed effective orifice area (EOAi) and stratified by body-mass-index (BMI) (<30 vs. ≥30 kg/m2). Echocardiography assessed hemodynamic performance. (3) Results: PPM was markedly more frequent in women than men (74.6% vs. 22.1%, p < 0.001). Among non-obese patients, 47.9% of females versus 16.2% of males developed PPM (p < 0.001). Women received smaller valves and consistently exhibited lower EOAi despite similar gradients. Postoperatively, females had reduced EOAi (0.8 vs. 0.9 cm2/m2, p < 0.001) but higher LV ejection fraction (55.8% vs. 49.5%, p = 0.004). Early clinical outcomes were comparable between sexes. (4) Conclusions: Despite favorable hemodynamics of sutureless AVR, anatomical sex differences result in persistently higher PPM rates in women, predominantly of moderate severity. Tailored strategies-including aortic root enlargement and sex-specific EOAi thresholds-may improve prosthesis selection and outcomes in female patients."

Case reports,"An 86-year-old woman with a history of hypertension, atrial fibrillation, and lacunar cerebral infarction underwent transcatheter aortic valve implantation for symptomatic severe aortic stenosis using a 23-mm SAPIEN 3 Ultra RESILIA valve (Edwards Lifesciences). As the prosthetic valve traversed a 14-F Edwards eSheath+, it sheared off the distal tip of the sheath, which became affixed to the valve. The adherent tip remained attached throughout balloon expansion and deployment, thereby impeding full expansion and producing an atypical funnel-shaped configuration. With continued balloon inflation and sustained pressure, complete expansion was achieved, and the prosthetic valve was deployed without incident.

Due to its frequently asymptomatic presentation, MR often leads to undertreatment, which can delay diagnosis. In addition, the optimal timing and choice of intervention remain unclear. The Significant Mitral Insufficiency Limburg Evaluation (SMILE) registry aims to provide a comprehensive real-world characterisation of patients with moderate-to-severe mitral regurgitation. Methods and Results: The SMILE registry is a multicentre prospective registry initiated in 2020, enrolling all consecutive patients with moderate-to-severe MR from all hospitals in Limburg, the Netherlands. Treatment approaches include surgical, catheter-based, and conservative (medical) options, with decision-making from an expert multidisciplinary team. Data are collected via Castor EDC, ensuring compliance with the General Data Protection Regulation using pseudonymisation. The co-primary endpoints are all-cause mortality and heart failure hospitalisations during the five-year follow-up. Secondary objectives include describing management strategies, characterising disease progression and cardiac remodelling, evaluating associations between baseline clinical and echocardiographic characteristics and long-term outcomes, identifying predictors of treatment success, and assessing longitudinal changes in health-related quality of life. Conclusions: The SMILE registry represents an important step towards improving MR management. Its broad data collection, including conservative care and patient-reported outcomes, provides valuable real-world insights beyond procedure-focused studies. The registry may refine intervention timing and personalise treatment strategies to enhance patient outcomes and improve their quality of life."

Ebstein's anomaly (EA), which accounts for fewer than 1% of congenital heart diseases, and atrioventricular canal defect (AVCD), present in approximately 4-5% of cases, exceptionally coexist, with this combination observed in fewer than 0.5% of patients with AVCD. We aim to report the oldest documented case of a 45-year-old female with the exceptionally rare combination of complete AVCD, EA, and right ventricular hypoplasia and to provide a concise review of these anomalies. Case presentation. Diagnosed in early childhood with a complete AVCD, pulmonary stenosis, and right ventricular (RV) hypoplasia, the patient underwent palliative surgical intervention with a modified Blalock-Taussig shunt at the age of 10 but did not receive subsequent regular follow-up. Over the ensuing 35 years, she remained largely untreated until presentation at 45 years of age with progressive exertional dyspnea, central cyanosis, and palpitations, corresponding to NYHA class III. Comprehensive multimodal imaging, including transthoracic echocardiography and cardiac magnetic resonance, revealed a complete AVCD with moderate-to-severe mitral regurgitation secondary to an anterior mitral leaflet cleft, severe tricuspid regurgitation, RV hypoplasia, and hallmark features of EA. Given the complex cardiac anatomy and the elevated surgical risk, the patient was considered inoperable, and a strategy of conservative management with multidisciplinary follow-up was implemented. Conclusions. This case highlights the exceptional longevity of a patient with the rare coexistence of complete AVCD, EA, and RV hypoplasia, surviving 45 years from diagnosis despite limited early intervention. It underscores the importance of lifelong follow-up in complex congenital heart disease and illustrates the role of multimodal imaging in assessing anatomy and guiding management when surgical options are high-risk or not feasible."

The diagnosis of an inherited cardiomyopathy has major implications for medical care of patients and relatives. We report the results of a genotype-phenotype analysis of DCM investigated in Austria.
194 patients with DCM underwent genetic testing over a period of 6 years. We analyzed the clinical and genetic characteristics of 105 DCM patients who showed a genetic variant, and compared the genetic findings and outcome measures of patients with inflammation on endomyocardial biopsy and those without.
In 51.4% (54/105) patients at least one likely pathogenic or pathogenic genetic variant (LP/P) was detected. 51 of 105 patients (48.6%) showed only variants of unknown significance (VUS). Most LP/P variants (34,3%) were detected in the TTN gene. Clinical characteristics of the most prevalent genetic subgroups (TTN, LMNA, MYH7, MYH6, DMD, SCN5A) were not significantly different. DCM patients with inflammation had significantly higher frequency of memory of infection, left bundle branch block, mitral valve insufficiency, but normal CK-MB levels. We added a case report where two family members initially were considered to have an inflammatory cardiomyopathy before a pathogenic variant in LMNA was found.
Cardiac features of DCM were not predictive of a specific genetic subgroup. We recommend applying multigene panels extensively, since a large proportion of patients without a family history or evidence of inflammation showed a genetic predisposition for DCM. However, the large number of VUS remains a challenge."

This review aims to evaluate how BA dysmetabolism acts as a central pathogenic factor in canine and feline disease. We analyze the BA pool's integrity, which depends on a specialized functional guild, primarily Peptacetobacter hiranonis, responsible for 7α-dehydroxylation. We delineate two principal pathological profiles: (1) microbial collapse, characterized by secondary bile acid (SBA) depletion and compromised farnesoid X receptor (FXR) and Takeda G protein-coupled receptor 5 (TGR5) signaling, which exacerbates inflammation in chronic enteropathy (CE), protein-losing enteropathy (PLE), and exocrine pancreatic insufficiency (EPI); and (2) hepato-biliary spillover, wherein host-induced dysfunction results in primary bile acid (PBA) excess. Recent data have linked these disruptions to skeletal health, feline renal fibrosis, cardiac remodeling in myxomatous mitral valve disease (MMVD), and neuroinflammation in epilepsy and hepatic encephalopathy. The discovery of microbially conjugated bile acids (MCBAs) and microbial extracellular vesicles (MEVs) reveals highly specific, vesicle-mediated communication pathways impacting systemic health. Diagnostic protocols should prioritize functional profiling, including the dysbiosis index (DI), serum conjugated BA analysis, and SBA/PBA ratios. Clinical management is moving beyond empirical fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT), towards precision synthetic microbial consortia (SynComs), neuroprotective BAs like tauroursodeoxycholic acid (TUDCA), and molecular postbiotics to restore the collaborative metabolome."

This study evaluated quantitative MR parameters individually and within a multiparametric framework using three-dimensional (3D) vena contracta area (VCA) as an intraoperative reference. In this single-center retrospective analysis, intraoperative echocardiographic data from 85 patients undergoing mitral valve intervention between July 2024 and June 2025 were analyzed. Regurgitant volume (RVol) and regurgitant fraction (RF) were quantified using two-dimensional proximal isovelocity surface area (PISA), a 3D volumetric method, and a Doppler-based continuity equation. Agreement was assessed by Bland-Altman analysis, and categorical concordance was assessed by Cohen's kappa for individual and multiparametric grading strategies. Agreement between individual quantitative methods was limited, with substantial bias and wide limits of agreement for both RVol and RF, resulting in poor-to-fair concordance for MR severity classification. Incorporation of RVol and RF into multiparametric grading strategies improved concordance. Compared with 3D VCA, multiparametric integration incorporating PISA-derived measures showed the best overall performance, with high accuracy and sensitivity and moderate specificity. These findings indicate limited interchangeability of standalone quantitative echocardiographic methods and support reporting the applied technique and using a multiparametric approach anchored to 3D VCA when cardiac magnetic resonance imaging is unavailable."

The C-reactive protein-albumin-lymphocyte (CALLY) index is a novel immunonutritional biomarker that integrates these pathophysiological domains; however, its prognostic value in TAVI patients has not yet been investigated. This study aimed to evaluate the association between the CALLY index and 1-year mortality after TAVI.
This retrospective observational study included 532 consecutive patients who underwent TAVI at a tertiary-care center between 2014 and 2023. Baseline laboratory parameters were obtained before the procedure, and the CALLY index was calculated as (albumin × lymphocyte count)/(C-reactive protein × 10). The primary endpoint was 1-year mortality. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis was performed to assess the discriminative ability of the CALLY index and conventional surgical risk scores. Multivariable regression analyses were used to identify independent predictors of mortality.
During the 1-year follow-up period, 85 patients (15.9%) died. Patients who died had significantly lower baseline CALLY index values compared to survivors (p < 0.001). The CALLY index demonstrated good discriminative performance for 1-year mortality (AUC: 0.797), outperforming EuroSCORE II (AUC: 0.705) and the Society of Thoracic Surgeons (STS) score (AUC: 0.619). A CALLY cut-off value of 0.45, derived using Youden's index, was associated with a more than threefold increased risk of mortality. In multivariable analysis, the CALLY index remained independently associated with 1-year mortality, along with EuroSCORE II and more than mild mitral regurgitation.
The CALLY index is a strong and independent predictor of 1-year mortality after TAVI and provides incremental prognostic value beyond conventional surgical risk scores. Given its simplicity and reliance on routinely available laboratory parameters, the CALLY index may serve as a practical tool for long-term risk stratification in patients undergoing TAVI."

Emerging evidence now implicates valvular leaflets as active contributors rather than passive bystanders in FVR pathogenesis. Systematic investigations into leaflet-specific pathomechanisms remain absent for major FVR subtypes, particularly functional mitral regurgitation (FMR) and functional tricuspid regurgitation (FTR).
The association of FVR with clinical parameters was analyzed in a heart transplantation cohort. Comprehensive microscopic pathology evaluated fibrotic remodeling in mild, moderate, and severe FMR/FTR leaflets, validated in an independent bulk RNA sequencing cohort (FMR/FTR: n=41 each). Single-cell RNA sequencing was performed on 19 FVR leaflets (FMR: 3 mild/2 moderate/3 severe; FTR: 5 mild/3 moderate/3 severe). Subsequent analyses (cluster annotation, cellular proportions, trajectory inference, and cell-cell communication) explored cellular mechanisms of fibrotic remodeling in FVR, focusing on unique and shared changes between FMR and FTR. Histopathology and bulk transcriptomics validated single-cell RNA sequencing findings. Primary valvular endothelial cells and valvular interstitial cells from FVR patients underwent pharmacological intervention. A monocrotaline-induced rat pulmonary hypertension model established FTR, followed by pharmacological treatment to assess leaflet-directed therapy efficacy.
Fibrotic leaflet remodeling scores independently predicted FMR/FTR severity with high precision and significantly improved prediction beyond anatomic anomalies. Fibrotic remodeling showed divergent mechanisms between FMR and FTR. In FMR, suppressed retinoic acid metabolism drove antifibrotic-to-neutral valvular interstitial cell transition. In FTR, impaired IFN (interferon) signaling promoted antifibrotic-to-profibrotic valvular interstitial cell transdifferentiation, worsened by endothelial-to-mesenchymal transition-derived profibrotic valvular endothelial cells. Targeted PDK4 (pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 4) upregulation or IFN signaling activation reduced FTR severity in vitro and in vivo.
Leaflet-specific organic fibrotic remodeling actively involves FVR beyond functional adaptation, with distinct fibrotic mechanisms in FMR versus FTR. PDK4 and IFN modulation demonstrate therapeutic potential for FTR."

A prospective registry study was conducted on 95 consecutive patients with severe AS, 28% of whom had moderate to severe MR. Echocardiographic data, including GLS and myocardial work parameters (global constructive work [GCW], global wasted work [GWW], and global work efficiency [GWE]), were collected prior to TAVI.
While GLS values did not significantly differ between MR severity groups, GCW and GWE showed significant variation. The lowest GCW values were observed in patients with severe MR (1483.3 ±282.7 mm Hg%) and the highest in those with moderate MR (2114.9 ±534.6 mm Hg%) (p = 0.01). Similarly, lower GWE values were observed in patients with severe MR compared to the other groups (p = 0.02). No significant differences were found for GWW (p = 0.21).
The findings suggest that while GLS remains relatively consistent across different MR severity groups, GCW and GWE tend to decrease in patients with severe MR. This observation may indicate that GCW is a more responsive marker of myocardial function in the presence of concomitant MR."

Serial echocardiographic assessments were performed at baseline, 30 min, and 2, 4, and 8 weeks post-procedure, with histological validation of myocardial fibrosis. The technique achieved 100% success with no acute mortality and enabled precise titration of regurgitation severity. Both MR groups exhibited progressive, body size-independent cardiac remodeling. Speckle-tracking revealed basal-segment-predominant longitudinal strain reduction, correlating with histologically confirmed peri-annular fibrosis. Survival was significantly lower in massive MR (40% vs. 90%, p = 0.006). This minimally invasive model reliably replicates human MR pathophysiology with high reproducibility and precise severity control, providing a robust platform for mechanistic investigation."

We conducted a retrospective cohort study using TriNetX to identify adults with mitral regurgitation who underwent surgical repair or TEER (2013-2025). Propensity score matching (PSM) balanced demographics, comorbidities, and medications. The primary outcome was all-cause mortality; the secondary outcomes included cardiovascular events.
After exclusions, 35,753 patients with mitral regurgitation were identified, including 2,165 TEER and 33,588 surgical cases; 2,029 matched pairs were analyzed. At 1 year, surgery showed lower mortality (hazard ratio [HR]: 0.78; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.64-0.96), primarily between 2 months and 1 year. Surgery was associated with higher rates of early dyspnea, atrial fibrillation, and heart failure, though heart failure could be reversed later. No significant differences were found in major adverse cardiovascular events (MACEs), stroke, acute myocardial infarction (AMI), cardiac arrest, or emergency department (ED) visits. A subgroup analysis of patients with mitral valve prolapse showed consistent results, with atrial fibrillation and heart failure occurring more frequently after surgery.
In this large cohort, surgery and TEER produced different outcomes. Early mortality was similar, but surgery improved survival after 2 months.

Cardiology,"Atrial failure is an emerging clinical syndrome that results from an underlying atrial cardiomyopathy and is characterized by impaired atrial haemodynamic and/or electrical function that is sufficient to cause symptoms, adverse clinical outcomes or both. Similar to ventricular cardiomyopathy, atrial cardiomyopathy refers to a structural, functional and/or electrophysiological tissue abnormality, whereas atrial failure denotes the stage at which it manifests clinically. Atrial failure can be classified as primary, when driven by intrinsic atrial pathology, or secondary, when atrial dysfunction arises from sustained haemodynamic or electrical stress imposed by ventricular, valvular or systemic disease. Increasing evidence indicates that atrial failure might not be merely a bystander, but a key determinant of symptoms and prognosis in cardiovascular conditions. Atrial failure can act as a primary driver of heart failure with preserved ejection fraction, promote atrial arrhythmias through adverse electrical remodelling, and potentially increase thromboembolic risk independently of atrial fibrillation. In this Review, we detail the pathophysiological mechanisms and clinical phenotypes of atrial failure and highlight the role of multimodality imaging in diagnosing and phenotyping atrial cardiomyopathy and clinical atrial failure. Finally, we summarize emerging therapeutic strategies aimed at potentially reversing atrial adverse remodelling and discuss future directions for integrating atrial failure into clinical practice."

Large randomised controlled trials have demonstrated that direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) are effective and safe for stroke prevention in patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) and treatment or prevention of venous thromboembolism. Nevertheless, for specific cardiac indications and patient characteristics, vitamin K antagonists (VKAs) rather than DOACs are either preferred, or the benefit of DOACs in comparison to VKAs remains uncertain. These include, among others, mechanical heart valves, AF associated with moderate-to-severe mitral stenosis, left ventricular or atrial thrombus, and older patients with frailty. As VKAs will continue to play a vital role in the management of patients with cardiovascular diseases in the foreseeable future, this review discusses cardiac indications and patient characteristics that necessitate the use of VKAs and general management principles of VKA therapy."

Two aortic valve models with different free-edge configurations were established, and valve motion throughout the entire cardiac cycle was simulated using a two-way fluid-structure interaction (FSI) method. Hemodynamic parameters and stress distribution characteristics were compared and analyzed. The results revealed that the curved free edge valve exhibited a significantly faster opening response than the straight free edge valve, with an approximately 13% increase in the effective orifice area (EOA) and an approximately 27% reduction in regurgitant volume. However, after valve closure, the curved free-edge model demonstrated higher stress levels across all critical regions. The free-edge configuration did not significantly alter the vortical structure within the aortic flow field; both models exhibited a flow pattern characterized by a combination of sinus vortices and wall-mounted spindle-shaped vortices. The findings indicate that a curved free edge can improve valve opening efficiency and regurgitation control, but may exacerbate stress concentration during closure, potentially increasing the risk of fatigue damage to the valve."

Cardiovascular Imaging,"The prognostic impact of vegetation size in infective endocarditis (IE) remains unclear. Our aim was to evaluate the relation between vegetation size and outcome.
Our data come from the Spanish IE registry between 2008 and 2024. From 6525 IE patients, 5,000 (76.6%) had vegetations, and 3,592 (55.1%) had documented vegetation size measurements. Patients were categorized into two groups based on maximum vegetation diameter: <10 mm (1,319 - 36.7%) and ≥10 mm (2,273 - 63.3%).
Compared to patients with small vegetations, patients with vegetations ≥10 mm were younger (68 vs. 70 years, p<0.001), had more frequent right-sided IE (8.0% vs. 4.1%, p<0.001), less prosthetic valve IE (23.9% vs. 29.9%, p<0.001), higher surgical rates (55.9% vs. 40.1%, p<0.001), more embolic events (28.0% vs. 21.4%, p<0.001), higher in-hospital (28.3% vs. 19.6%, p<0.001) and one-year mortalities (35.6% vs. 27.5%, p<0.001). Large vegetation size was an independent predictor of in-hospital mortality (odds ratio [OR] 1.6, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.3-1.9, p<0.001), embolic events (OR 1.34, 95% CI 1.15-1.55, p<0.001), and one-year mortality (hazard ratio 1.32, 95% CI 1.17-1.50, p<0.001). Vegetation size was an independent predictor of inhospital mortality in left-sided IE (OR 1.7, 95% CI 1.4-2.1, p<0.001) but not in right-sided IE (OR 1.2, 95% CI 0.7-2.3, p = 0.50).
In patients with IE, large vegetation size is independently associated with embolic events and increased mortality particularly in those with left-sided IE, suggesting the need for more aggressive management in these patients."

Transcatheter tricuspid edge-to-edge repair (T-TEER) is a minimally invasive therapy for patients with severe, symptomatic TR at high surgical risk. By approximating the valve leaflets, T‑TEER reduces regurgitant volume, improves right heart hemodynamics, and interrupts the progressive cycle of right ventricular dilation and worsening TR. Studies and registry data show that approximately 81-88% of patients treated with T‑TEER achieve a reduction of TR to moderate or less, accompanied by sustained improvements in functional status, quality of life, right heart remodeling, and reductions in heart failure-related hospitalizations. Early analyses also suggest beneficial effects on renal and hepatic function. Therefore, T‑TEER represents a safe and effective treatment option for patients with severe TR who previously had limited therapeutic options."

The impact of TR etiology on overall survival and the associated risk factors in each subgroup are not well studied.
Multisite, retrospective study evaluating survival based on TR etiology using Kaplan-Meier and Cox regression models. Stepwise approach was used to define TR etiology (≥moderate): primary (PTR; presence of a primary valvular pathology), lead associated (LTR; lead interfering with closure), and secondary TR (STR) in the setting of left-sided valvular disease, left ventricular disease, other causes of pulmonary hypertension, right ventricular disease, and atrial secondary TR.
A total of 12 899 patients were included (3% PTR, 90% STR, 7% LTR). The mean age was 68±14, 73±13, and 71±13 years, respectively (44%-55% female patients). Adjusting for age, sex, and TR severity, patients with PTR had better overall survival (PTR: reference; STR hazard ratio [HR], 1.4 [1.2-1.6], LTR HR, 1.5 [1.1-1.7]). On multivariable Cox regression, the Tricuspid Regurgitation Impact on Outcomes score was associated with mortality across all groups (P<0.05 for all). In addition, other risk factors associated with worse outcomes included pulmonary hypertension and ≥moderate right ventricular enlargement in PTR; left-sided valvular disease, pulmonary hypertension, and ≥moderate right ventricular dysfunction in STR; and left ventricular disease and ≥moderate right ventricular dysfunction in LTR.
Patients with PTR have better survival than STR and LTR. Tricuspid Regurgitation Impact on Outcomes score was associated with mortality across etiologies, whereas other risk factors are etiology specific. Improved risk profiling may enhance patient selection, treatment decisions, and outcomes."

Disease primers,"Acute rheumatic fever (ARF), the acute autoimmune sequela of group A Streptococcus infection, and its chronic life-threatening manifestation, rheumatic heart disease (RHD), which causes permanent heart valve damage, remain major drivers of preventable cardiovascular mortality and disability in low-income and middle-income countries. Since the mid-1990s, multidisciplinary and international collaborative research has yielded new insights into the role of superficial skin infections such as impetigo in ARF pathogenesis and the disease mechanisms that underlie the progression from ARF to RHD, and has explored novel treatments and delivery mechanisms in clinical trials and progressed the development of Strep A vaccines. Early detection and patient care have advanced, with revised echocardiographic screening criteria and the 2024 WHO guidelines, which provide a framework for evidence-based management and therapeutic strategies. Notwithstanding these advancements, considerable disparity persists in the care, control and treatment of advanced disease, necessitating coordinated programmes, prioritization by global agencies and local governments, and substantial involvement of those with RHD. Of note, few to no cardiac surgery programmes exist in some countries most burdened by RHD. Future research must encompass implementation studies for validated evidence-based therapies, translational technologies and applications, together with a definitive pathway to direct patient effect, to achieve the WHO target of eliminating RHD as a public health problem."

It has also been linked to shear stress-induced von Willebrand factor abnormalities that prolong closure time with adenosine diphosphate (CT-ADP). The aim of this study was to assess whether CT-ADP serves as a biomarker for mitral PVL diagnosis, follow-up, and prognosis after repair.
In this prospective study, 89 patients (27 with moderate-to-severe mitral PVL referred for closure, group 1; 31 with prosthetic mitral valves without PVL, group 2; and 31 controls without valvular disease, group 3) underwent laboratory assessment including hemolysis markers, congestion markers, and CT-ADP. Patients with PVL underwent percutaneous or surgical repair and were followed up at 3 and 12 months. ROC analysis, linear regression, and Cox models were used to evaluate the diagnostic and prognostic value of CT-ADP.
CT-ADP was prolonged in PVL patients (median, 214 seconds) vs control groups (86 seconds in group 2 and 74 seconds in group 3; P < .001). A cutoff of > 135 seconds showed excellent diagnostic accuracy (AUROC, 0.96; sensitivity 89%, specificity 97%). Postprocedural CT-ADP decreased significantly after successful repair (median decrease of 79 seconds) but remained unchanged in those with residual leaks. Elevated postprocedural CT-ADP (>155 s) identified persistent PVL and was associated with worse 1-year outcomes (HR, 21.37; P = .004), including death, heart failure or hemolysis-related readmission, and reintervention.
CT-ADP appears to be a promising biomarker for diagnosing and monitoring mitral PVL. It may add value to conventional markers by reflecting shear stress-related platelet dysfunction and predicting outcomes following PVL closure."
PubMed,valvular heart disease,Prehabilitation in frail patients undergoing cardiac valve intervention.,Luigi Cutore; Davide Capodanno,10.1016/j.pcad.2026.02.007,2026-02-24,Progress in cardiovascular diseases,"Management of valvular heart disease (VHD) has shifted from predominantly surgical approaches to widespread use of transcatheter interventions, including transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR), mitral transcatheter edge-to-edge repair (M-TEER), transcatheter mitral valve replacement (TMVR), and emerging tricuspid transcatheter valve intervention (TTVI). Although ESC/EACTS and ACC/AHA guidelines recognize frailty as a major determinant of mortality, complications, and recovery, they offer limited guidance on how to modify frailty before intervention.
Frailty is highly prevalent in VHD, particularly among transcatheter candidates, and represents a dynamic, potentially reversible syndrome driven by sarcopenia, deconditioning, malnutrition, inflammation, and psychological vulnerability. It influences symptoms, procedural selection, and recovery, exerting prognostic effects beyond valve anatomy. Prehabilitation offers a strategy to convert the preprocedural interval from passive waiting into a therapeutic opportunity. Evidence from cardiac surgery and hemodynamic interventions shows that multimodal prehabilitation (including aerobic and resistance exercise, respiratory training, nutritional optimization and psychological support) can improve functional capacity, reduce pulmonary complications, and shorten hospitalization. In TAVR candidates, early data suggest that even short programs may enhance functional performance, mitigate frailty and reduce major adverse cardiovascular events. In contrast, dedicated trials for M-TEER, TMVR and TTVI remain limited, and current practice depends on evidence from other procedural settings. Ongoing studies are testing exercise-based, nutritional, and psychological interventions, including telemedicine-supported and home-based models, while incorporating objective measures of frailty reversal.
As procedural risk declines, patients' physiological reserve becomes the principal barrier to long-term benefit. Prehabilitation may provide a scalable strategy to bridge anatomical correction with meaningful functional recovery."

This study sought to investigate the role of SPP1+ macrophages in the development and progression of AF and further elucidate the underlying mechanisms. Single-nucleus RNA sequencing was performed on right atrial tissues from 3 patients with persistent AF and 3 with sinus rhythm (all with rheumatic valvular heart disease). The results revealed significant immune cell infiltration in AF atrial tissues, with a marked increase in the proportion of SPP1+ macrophages, which exhibited the strongest intercellular communication with cardiomyocytes. Phenotypic scoring indicated that apoptosis was the dominant mode of cardiomyocyte death in AF. Immunohistochemical and Western blot analyses confirmed elevated levels of pro-apoptotic proteins (Bax, Cleaved-Caspase3) and reduced levels of the anti-apoptotic protein Bcl2 in AF tissues. In a mouse model with macrophage-specific SPP1 overexpression, increased AF inducibility and duration were observed, accompanied by enhanced cardiomyocyte apoptosis. In vitro co-culture experiments using SPP1-overexpressing RAW264.7 macrophages and HL-1 cardiomyocytes confirmed that SPP1+ macrophages could induce cardiomyocyte apoptosis. Mechanistically, KEGG and GSEA analyses identified downregulation of the PI3K/AKT pathway in AF. Treatment with the PI3K/AKT activator Recilisib reversed apoptosis and restored p-PI3K/p-AKT levels in HL-1 cells co-cultured with SPP1-overexpressing RAW264.7 macrophages. These findings demonstrate that SPP1+ macrophages accumulate in atrial tissues of AF patients and induce cardiomyocyte apoptosis by downregulating the PI3K/AKT pathway, thereby increasing AF susceptibility."

Due to its rarity, only individual case reports and a limited number of case series have been published to date. This study constitutes the most extensive comprehensive review conducted in this area. Eight factors were evaluated: age at diagnosis, sex, clinical presentation, electrocardiographic findings, imaging (ultrasound, CT, or MRI), associated cardiac anomalies, and patient outcomes.
The electronic databases PubMed and Scopus were searched from their inception until 30 October 2025. Only case reports and case series were considered for inclusion. Studies involving foetuses, autopsies, and animals were excluded. The collected data were primarily presented as percentages.
One hundred fourteen studies were found encompassing 124 patients. The mean age at diagnosis was 33.3 ± 9.4 years The most common clinical presentations were dyspnoea (44.3%) and cyanosis (29.5%). The most commonly encountered ECG changes were supraventricular tachycardia/atrial flutter/atrial fibrillation (33.3%) and right bundle branch block (22.6%). On chest X-ray, cardiomegaly was noted in 46.5%. CTD was suspected or diagnosed by echocardiography in 95.2% of cases. The diagnosis was confirmed by CT and/or MRI in 34.1% of cases. A concomitant congenital heart defect was found in 67.7%, especially in the form of all kinds of atrial septal defect (38.1%) and of right valvular and right ventricular involvement (20.1%). An outcome was reported in 97/124. Surgical correction was the treatment of choice in 51.6%. Since 1991, a percutaneous approach has been employed in selected cases (5.1%). Conservative management was the treatment of choice in 43.3%. The mortality rate was 8.2%.
The principal limitation of this systematic review lies in its reliance solely on case reports and small case series, reflecting the absence of large-scale studies on CTD. Nonetheless, it constitutes the most comprehensive analysis available to date."

In this population, frailty, comorbidity, and functional variability significantly influence prognosis. This study evaluated short-term (30-day) and long-term (1-year) mortality predictors in elderly patients with AHF treated in the emergency department (HED), considering clinical variables, comorbidities, and precipitating factors (PFs). Materials and Methods: An observational cohort study was conducted based on a secondary analysis of older patients with AHF included in the Epidemiology of Acute Heart Failure in Emergency Departments (EAHFE) registry, treated at Hospital Universitario Marqués de Valdecilla (HUMV) between 2007 and 2022. Clinical, laboratory, and PF-related variables were collected. The primary outcome was all-cause mortality at 30 days and 1 year. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were performed. Results: A total of 548 patients were included (mean age: 80.7 years), of whom 78.6% required hospitalization, mainly in the Internal Medicine department. Mortality was 11.1% at 30 days and 29.9% at 1 year. Age, valvular heart disease, dementia, and elevated creatinine levels were independently associated with higher mortality. Hypoxemia and low-output symptoms were linked to short-term mortality, while NYHA class III and anemia were associated with long-term mortality. Among PFs, acute coronary syndrome (ACS) was related to worse short-term outcomes, whereas rapid atrial fibrillation (AF) was inversely associated with long-term mortality. Conclusions: The prognostic relevance of risk factors differs between short- and long-term outcomes in older patients with AHF. Incorporating clinical characteristics and PFs into risk stratification models may support individualized management and guide follow-up strategies tailored to the geriatric profile. This multidimensional approach is essential to improve clinical decision-making and outcomes in a highly vulnerable population."

With the 2025 ESC/EACTS Guidelines lowering the age threshold for TAVI to 70 years, the focus has shifted from short-term survival to lifetime management, necessitating rigorous evaluation of device durability, coronary access, and biological valve degeneration. This review synthesizes the latest evidence-based strategies for TAVI, contrasting randomized trial data with long-term registry findings. We critically analyze the hemodynamic trade-offs between self-expandable valves and balloon-expandable valves, particularly in patients with small aortic annuli, where SEVs demonstrate superior indexed effective orifice areas and reduced rates of patient-prosthesis mismatch (SMALL-TAVI registry). We further examine the expansion of indications into complex anatomical subsets, including bicuspid aortic valves (BIVOLUTX, STABILITY) and pure aortic regurgitation, where dedicated anchoring mechanisms are required to mitigate the risk of valve migration. Procedural optimization is addressed through the ""minimalist"" TAVI pathway (BENCHMARK registry), which emphasizes conscious sedation and ultrasound-guided vascular access to reduce length of stay without compromising safety. Finally, we discuss emerging biomarkers (MMP-3, osteopontin) and the role of epicardial adipose tissue as novel predictors of structural valve deterioration, signaling a potential shift toward biological modulation of valvular disease."

Consequently, accurate prediction of this property is critical for the successful discovery and development of new drug candidates. The classical metric for assessing lipophilicity is logP, defined as the partition coefficient between n-octanol and water at physiological pH 7.4. Recently, graph-based deep learning methods have gained considerable attention and demonstrated strong performance across diverse drug discovery tasks, from molecular property prediction to virtual screening. These models learn informative representations directly from molecular graphs in an end-to-end manner, without the need for handcrafted descriptors. In this work, we propose a logP prediction approach based on a fine-tuned pre-trained GraphormerMapper model, named GraphormerLogP. To evaluate its performance, the model was tested on two datasets: one is compiled by us from publicly available sources and contains 42 006 unique SMILES-logP pairs (named GLP); the second consists of 13 688 molecules and is used for benchmarking purposes. Our comparative analysis against state-of-the-art models (Random Forest, Chemprop, CheMeleon, StructGNN, and Attentive FP) demonstrates that GraphormerLogP consistently achieves competitive or superior predictive accuracy across both datasets, attaining mean absolute error values of 0.251 and 0.269, respectively. The GLP dataset is available in the GitHub repository https://github.com/cimm-kzn/GraphormerLogP/tree/main/data.Scientific contribution This paper presents two key scientific contributions. First, we have collected and carefully curated a large and diverse dataset of molecules with measured logP values, comprising over 42 000 compounds. Second, we propose a Graphormer-based model with a task-specific fine-tuning architecture for logP prediction, tailored to leverage representations learned from reaction data. This model demonstrates high performance in benchmark studies on both established literature data and the newly compiled dataset."

This paper describes a new approach for lossless ECG compression based on a deep-learning method via an adaptive autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) model.
Raw ECG signals were denoised and preprocessed to generate beat-cells for further processing. The ARIMA model uses the individual cardiac cycles to generate model parameters, which are then compressed. In this research, the optimal model hyperparameters were predicted by a deep autoencoder followed by a multilayer perceptron neural network (MLPNN) regressor combination. The predictor was tuned offline via particle swarm optimization (PSO), which produced the reference data for MLPNN tuning.
The technique uses 46 records of mitdb under PhysioNet, including 10 major abnormal beats: H, A, V, P, L, R, a, f, F and j. Because of the adaptive nature, compression quality is high with negligible loss. No deviations in the clinical features of the reconstructed beats are found. The mean CR and PRD% values were 41.51 and 0.209%, respectively, which are superior to those reported in published research on ECG compression.
The proposed adaptive ECG compression model can be useful for real-time telemonitoring applications, efficient storage and transmission of streamlined data of critical patients under continuous monitoring."

We developed an automated AI system (SDAVFdoc) that integrates a 3D convolutional neural network with anatomical prior knowledge to both identify SDAVF and localize the fistula site in a multicenter study of 718 patients. The system sequentially segments spinal structures, localizes the fistula region using anatomical priors, and finally classifies SDAVF likelihood via DenseNet within the foramina. The draining vein cluster segmentation model, using a threshold of 42.5, achieved high accuracy in distinguishing SDAVF cases, with F1-scores ranging from 0.932 to 0.960 across test sets. The DenseNet-based fistula detection model showed a high AUC of 0.928-0.954 across test sets. Compared to technicians, the system reduced processing time from 40.75 ± 11.57 min to 1.05 ± 0.29 min (P < 0.001) and clicks from 761.80 ± 202.05 to 9.68 ± 2.12 (P < 0.001), greatly streamlining clinical workflows. This AI-driven approach enables fast, accurate screening and localization of SDAVF."

In scenarios with heterogeneous deadlines and varying workloads, SLA compliance requires efficient coordination between edge and cloud resources. However, cloud-centric scheduling and heuristic approaches tend to lack adaptability to rapidly changing system conditions and, as a result, experience long waiting times (the same applies to QoS). To tackle these issues, we present IntelliScheduler, a hybrid actor-critic deep reinforcement learning framework for adaptive task scheduling in an edge-cloud system. Our framework presents a runtime-aware state representation combined with a learning-based decision mechanism, backed by a multi-buffer experience replay architecture. Second, a learning-based optimal task scheduling (LbOTS) algorithm is developed to minimise total task execution delay by discovering optimal deployment decisions across edge and cloud computational resources using latency-aware reward modelling. We assess the proposed approach by conducting extensive simulation experiments under different workloads. We evaluate LbOTS across various experimental scenarios and report up to 13% higher normalised reward, 67% lower training loss, 52-66% lower operational cost, and 80-90% lower rejection rate compared to PSO, MBO, and MOPSObaselines, achieving approximately 15-75% better QoE. Though the current assessment is simulation-based, the adaptive learning formulation is highly relevant for application in dynamic edge-cloud scheduling scenarios."

This multicenter study aimed to quantitatively assess fibrous tissue proportion (FTP) using AI-assisted digital pathology and to explore its clinicopathological relevance across odontogenic myxoma spectrum lesions. A total of 143 surgical specimens were collected from 34 institutions, and 100 cases were included after centralized pathological review. FTP was independently estimated by two board-certified oral pathologists to generate expert reference data. Whole-slide images of Masson's trichrome-stained sections were analyzed using a multi-stage deep learning pipeline implemented within a unified digital pathology platform. Agreement between expert assessment and quantitative measurements was evaluated, and associations between FTP and clinical variables were explored. Quantitative FTP measurements showed good agreement with expert pathological evaluation and revealed substantial inter-institutional variability in pathological diagnoses. In clinicopathological analyses, higher FTP was independently associated with unilocular radiological morphology. These findings demonstrate that AI-assisted quantitative pathology provides a reproducible framework for visualizing stromal heterogeneity in odontogenic myxoma spectrum lesions and may support more consistent clinicopathological interpretation across institutions."

The system incorporates three fundamental capabilities-face recognition, image captioning, and reading online newspapers-into a voice-based platform deployable in Raspberry Pi hardware. The face recognition capability recognizes known people using deep facial embeddings and returns instant voice feedback. The image captioning module uses a transformer-based BLIP model to produce natural language descriptions of scenes captured. The online newspaper module fetches structured news content through APIs and converts it into speech through a text-to-speech engine. The voice interface is centralized for all the modules, enabling users to interact with their surroundings without their hands. The system has been tested for recognition accuracy, response time, and memory consumption on a Raspberry Pi 5. Experiments indicate that the platform operates reliably in all modules, striking a balance between computation and user-friendliness. Optimized for offline use and low-power devices, BlindSpot illustrates the practical applicability of embedded AI towards the creation of inclusive, scalable assistive technology. The authors conclude by noting potential extensions, such as object detection, multi-language support, and caregiver incorporation, making BlindSpot a fundamental model for vision-based accessibility systems of the next generation."

Population-based cancer registries systematically collect data on cancer patients in defined populations, which play a crucial role in planning and assessing cancer prevention and control strategies. While the development of cancer registration has been marked by increasing standardization of definitions and methods and the electronic processing of data, the advent of artificial intelligence (AI) offers opportunities to further reduce the labor-intensive nature of registry operations, particularly where registry resources are scarce. These include enabling the processing of large datasets, extracting complex or unstructured data patterns to support cancer registration data abstraction, and facilitating data quality and control. The analysis and dissemination of registry data are also increasingly integrating AI methodologies. This paper provides a comprehensive overview of the application of AI in cancer registration. We investigate the challenges associated with integrating AI into existing cancer registry structures, with a particular emphasis on network and computational constraints, uneven resource allocation, and potential biases and limitations within AI systems. We propose a forward-looking AI-enhanced framework for cancer registration, highlighting AI's potential to optimize efficiency in cancer registration and the use of registry data for cancer control and cancer research."

To address the challenges of expertise and time-consuming annotation for IVUS interpretation, deep learning approaches have demonstrated accurate prediction in semantic segmentation. However, the impact of noisy labels from high inter-observer variability has not been evaluated systematically.
We analyzed the effect of noisy labels on deep learning-based IVUS segmentation and proposed a clinically informed filter to assess the quality of the generated labels, thereby improving the model performance in semi-supervised learning.
When noisy labels occurred in a consistent pattern or exhibited poor boundary alignment with the ground truth, segmentation performance deteriorated substantially. In contrast, when correct outlines were preserved in half of the boundaries, the degradation in the Dice similarity coefficient was limited to 1.92%, even with error amplitudes of 20 pixels. Increasing the training dataset size mitigated the adverse effects of the noisy labels. Furthermore, a filter based on the Hausdorff distance between the union and intersection of the predictions across three consecutive frames improved the segmentation performance in self-training.
These findings provide practical guidance for building training datasets that support the development of robust deep learning models for IVUS imaging."

With the development of artificial intelligence technology, machine learning provides a new way to solve these complex problems. This paper systematically reviews the progress and application of machine learning in sports injury research. Firstly, the development of different machine learning methods in sports injury research was summarized. Secondly, we focus on five core applications of machine learning in the field of sports injury: data feature selection and dimensionality reduction, injury risk prediction, injury symptoms and signs classification, risk monitoring based on wearable devices, and imaging data analysis. Research shows that machine learning models show significant advantages in dealing with complex data patterns, improving prediction accuracy and achieving real-time dynamic intervention. However, research in related fields still faces challenges such as insufficient data quality and quantity, poor model interpretability, and barriers to multidisciplinary cooperation. Through the summary, it can be seen that future research in this field should focus on constructing standardized shared datasets, developing more interpretable models, and strengthening the cooperation and communication between multi-disciplines, and finally promoting the application of machine learning in sports injury prevention, diagnosis and rehabilitation."

The outcomes of CVD mortality among cancer patients, particularly those with breast cancer, highlight the need for early detection of CVD at the beginning of cancer treatment as cardiotoxicity can also lead to accelerated development of chronic diseases, especially in the presence of risk factors [3].
A fusion deep learning model was developed and tested. The model utilizes computed tomography (CT) scans and electronic health records (EHR) for CVD mortality prediction in breast cancer patients undergoing radiation therapy. A cohort of 23,067 patients consisting of ∼5 million CT slices and ∼600,000 EHR documents was used for the model development and testing.
Performance of the model is assessed using the AUC and accuracy at a 95% confidence level. The fusion model achieves an AUC of 0.946 [0.939---0.950], and accuracy of, 0.93 [0.92 - 0.94] at 95% confidence interval (CI).
These results show that fusion models can learn versatile representations from medical images and medical text documents and can effectively be combined for tasks like predicting CVD mortality with higher accuracy when employing the appropriate fusion strategy."

While prior studies examined longer helices for deep septal pacing, the influence of other design variables remains unclear.
Evaluate how helix design and axial force affect interventricular septum insertion efficacy.
Rigid leads were developed using helical coils with variable outer diameter, number of turns and pitch. Porcine septa (n=16) were clamped perpendicularly for insertion using an optimized rotation-response system. Leads were tested under low (30g) and high (60g) axial force conditions to represent lumenless and stylet-driven leads, respectively, and a fixed number of rotations were delivered at a constant rate. Each helix design (n=8) was tested 3x per axial force at three septal sites. Insertion depth, muscle-torque and visual feedback were recorded. Insertion was successful if depth exceeded coil length without surface entanglement. Effects of design factors were compared.
At 30g, more helix turns significantly improved insertion success (P=0.04), while fewer turns frequently produced entangled failure (P=0.04) marked by high torque variability (P<0.001). Smaller-pitch helices trended toward higher torque and success, whereas larger pitch achieved greater depth (P=0.05). Larger outer diameters also trended toward higher torque and improved success at 30g. At 60g the influence of helix design variable diminished and consistently yielded higher than at 30g.
An optimized lead rotation-to-translation system elucidates how helix geometry and axial force interact during septal insertion. These interactions are explainable using an intuitive mechanical framework which is helpful for optimizing lead design."
PubMed,deep learning,A multimodal data-based model for breast cancer diagnosis.,Huina Wang; Lan Wei; Jianqiang Li; Bo Liu; Juan Fang; Catherine Mooney,10.1016/j.cmpb.2026.109288,2026-02-23,Computer methods and programs in biomedicine,"Developing multimodal data-driven diagnostic systems has become a key clinical strategy for improving breast cancer outcomes. However, effectively modeling multimodal features remains challenging due to substantial semantic heterogeneity, scale discrepancies, and the inherent difficulty of cross-modal alignment. Although existing studies have proposed various multimodal fusion methods, most rely on direct feature concatenation or shallow integration, which fail to capture fine-grained intra-modality semantics as well as the complex interactions between histopathological and genomic modalities.
In this study, we propose a multimodal diagnostic framework based on Feature Enhancement and Semantic Collaborative Alignment (FESCA). The method incorporates a semantic-guided modality feature enhancement mechanism that effectively extracts and strengthens diagnostic cues from both pathological images and genomic data. In addition, a contrastive-learning-based cross-modal alignment strategy is introduced to map heterogeneous modalities into a unified semantic space and achieve deep semantic collaboration through contrastive optimization. To ensure robust breast cancer classification under varying modality availability, a multimodal collaborative diagnostic strategy is employed to dynamically adapt the feature representations.
We evaluate FESCA on the TCGA-BRCA dataset, and the experimental results demonstrate that it outperforms state-of-the-art methods in breast cancer classification while significantly improving both intra-modality representation quality and cross-modal semantic alignment.
To enhance accessibility and practical application, we developed a web-based breast cancer pathological staging diagnosis system to visualize and deploy the FESCA model, demonstrating a step toward clinical application and providing a benchmark for other research methods."

Protein secondary structure prediction (PSSP) is a crucial step for protein 3-D structure prediction. Recent studies that focused on deep learning methods obtained significant improvements in PSSP. In this study, a novel deep learning model called GraphUnet-SS, which is based on the U-Net architecture and employs convolutional neural networks, graph convolutional networks, and bidirectional long short-term memories, is proposed. The feature set of the model consists of PSI-BLAST position-specific scoring matrices (PSSMs), HHBlits profiles, physico-chemical properties of amino acids, structural profiles for protein secondary structure, and a NoSeq label. A graph is generated using contact map prediction to represent the interactions between amino acids, which is used as input to graph convolutional network layers. The hyperparameters of GraphUnet-SS were optimized using the Bayesian optimization technique. Experimental results show that GraphUnet-SS outperforms the existing methods, and using all layers with depth four is the most suitable version.

Scanner log data were analyzed for two periods: pre-DLR adoption (January-October 2023, six scanners) and post-DLR (January-October 2025, five scanners). Examination and sequence durations were obtained from the Siemens Healthcare Teamplay platform. Observed changes were compared with capacity increases predicted by earlier Monte Carlo simulations. The impact of shortened scan durations across different scanner utilization levels was further evaluated using a simulation. Finally, four radiologists assessed image quality to identify potential clinical limitations of DLR.
Optimized scanners demonstrated a total reduction between 4.8 and 11.1 min (11.5-27.2%) in sequence duration and 5.0-10.7 min (9.5-21.2%) in total examination time. Despite operating with one fewer scanner in 2025 (six scanners before DLR adoption, 5 scanners after), the mean hourly throughput of the entire fleet decreased by only 6.4%, indicating improved productivity per scanner. Notably, this throughput was achieved while DLR deployment and protocol optimization were still in progress, underscoring the substantial productivity benefit even at a partial implementation stage.
DLR deployment was associated with improved MRI suite productivity, enabling nearly pre-DLR throughput despite operating with one fewer scanner. The results demonstrate the utility of DLR in improving MRI productivity and support the predictive accuracy of simulation-based health technology assessment. Nevertheless, unpredictable performance, particularly in neuroimaging, where artifacts in T2-weighted sequences and reduced quality in contrast-enhanced studies were observed, limits the applicability of DLR and underscores the need for rigorous quality assurance."

Endovascular stents typically consist of a metal framework and a flexible membrane graft designed to reopen obstructed aortic segments and maintain blood flow through the true lumen. Consequently, stents are widely used to treat aortic expansion diseases and aortic occlusive stenosis. However, traditional stents have limitations in terms of adaptability to complex anatomical structures, long-term durability, biomechanical stability, and reliance on radial support force for fixation, lacking active fixation mechanisms. These shortcomings remain the primary causes of postoperative complications, significantly impacting the quality of life for patients with aortic dissection.                                                           Methods:                     The research status of the endovascular stent was discussed in depth, and the main factors for the optimal design of the stent (geometry, pattern configuration, additional fixtures, and optimization methods) were analyzed and summarized according to the complications targeted by the repair device.                                                           Results:                     The composition structure, working principle, and development status of the stent grafts under review are elaborated in detail. Stent grafts attempt to alleviate postoperative complications through three approaches: enhancing the flexibility of the stent framework, improving the fit between the vessel wall and the stent, and reducing vascular injury. Blood flow guiding channels are established to alleviate the obstruction of branch blood flow. Additional self-anchoring devices are added to adapt to the dynamic remodeling of blood vessels.                                                           Discussion:                     The effects of various factors, including geometric parameters, structural design, and parameter optimization techniques, on the optimization of stent primary mechanical performance are discussed. The current research status of functional improvement methods for stents is also summarized.                                                           Conclusion:                     Refining the quantitative relationship between stent structural parameters and mechanical performance, as well as exploring the balance criteria between flexibility and radial support force, represent promising directions for future development. These objectives necessitate further in-depth analysis and research."

With a focus on the prevalent psychological complications following the onset of this condition, this study aimed to explore the correlation between antenatal depression and Corona disease anxiety, personality traits, and postpartum depression during the COVID-19 pandemic.                                                           Materials and Methods:                     This cross-sectional descriptive-analytical study investigated women receiving care at health centers affiliated with Kerman University of Medical Sciences during the last month of their pregnancy and the postpartum period in 2022. Following the acquisition of informed consent, participants were assessed using various measures, including demographic and obstetric information, the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale, the Corona Disease Anxiety Scale (CDAS), and the NEO Personality Inventory-Revised during their third trimester of pregnancy. The same group of participants completed the Edinburgh Depression Scale and the Corona Disease Anxiety Scale (CDAS) 4-6 weeks after childbirth.                                                           Results and Discussion:                     There was a significant correlation between family income, unwanted pregnancy as perceived by both the mother and father, and antenatal depression. Additionally, marital satisfaction played a significant role in postpartum depression. Furthermore, antenatal depression was significantly associated with neuroticism, agreeableness, and physical symptoms related to Corona disease anxiety. Personality traits, with the exception of extroversion and conscientiousness, and various domains of Corona disease anxiety, excluding psychological symptoms, were also significantly associated with postpartum depression.                                                           Conclusion:                     During pandemics or epidemics, such as the COVID-19 outbreak, experiencing mental distress during pregnancy can contribute to mental health issues during the postpartum period. This risk is particularly true in individuals with unique personality traits, emphasizing the need for increased focus on mental health within prenatal care during these crises."

Kinovea, as an accessible motion-analysis software, provides both visual and quantitative feedback. However, its application in supporting technique development among beginner athletes remains insufficiently explored. Aim: This study aims to describe the use of Kinovea in biomechanics training and examine its contribution to the awareness of kinematic characteristics and movement techniques among beginner athletes. Methods: A descriptive qualitative design involved 72 beginner athletes aged 18–25 years selected through purposive sampling. Data were collected over 16 weeks through interviews, field observations, and motion video recordings analyzed using Kinovea. Kinematic data focused on joint angles, stride behavior, and movement phases during walking, running, and the flight phase. Qualitative data were analyzed using content analysis with NVivo 12, while kinematic results were interpreted descriptively to identify performance patterns and areas for technical refinement. Result: Kinematic analysis showed coordinated joint-angle patterns across all phases. Walking analysis identified arm swing angles of 50.9°–58.8° and leg separation angles of 64.3°–67.2°, indicating a stable gait rhythm. The running analysis revealed knee angles of 68.8°–69.8° and elbow angles of 87.6°–89.1°, indicating efficient propulsive mechanics. The flight phase demonstrated knee angles of 81.2°–87.8° and elbow angles of 80.4°–88.3°, suggesting effective momentum use and postural stability. These measurements supported stride-efficiency assessment and technique evaluation. Qualitative findings revealed that Kinovea enabled athletes to interpret movement phases and identify technical inefficiencies through slow-motion and frame-by-frame visualization. Conclusion: Kinovea supports basic motion analysis by providing clear kinematic information and helping beginner athletes observe and refine their movement techniques. The findings also offer practical value for coaches by enabling more precise identification of inefficient patterns and guiding targeted corrections during early-stage training."

OpenAlex,deep learning,Combating Data and Target Shifts in Visual Tasks,Zhaorui Tan,10.17638/03194353,2031-01-01,University of Liverpool,"The rapid advancement of deep learning models for visual tasks has led to significant progress in many domains. However, a key challenge remains: ensuring that models can generalize effectively to unseen samples or novel classes, especially in real-world scenarios where training data-target pairs are often limited or unavailable, and test data may exhibit shifts in both data and targets. This thesis addresses the problem of shifts across data and targets, proposing novel methods to improve model generalization and transferability in complex settings. The thesis identifies the different shift scenarios for visual tasks and presents their problem forms. The research first relaxes the static target distribution assumption in Multi-Domain Generalization (mDG) tasks, introducing the General Multi-Domain Generalization (GMDG) objective to improve generalization under varying data shifts. Specifically, Extensive experiments validate that GMDG is feasible for classification, segmentation, and regression tasks. Further considering extreme target distribution shifts where even unknown novel classes emerge, the study also explores logical regularization techniques for tasks such as Generalized Category Discovery (GCD), mDG+GCD, and Class Incremental Learning (CIL), proposing a sample-based logical regularization term (L-Reg) to enhance data-, target-, and all-shift generalization. Additionally, a partial logic framework is introduced to address challenges in CIL, enabling models to retain room for unknown classes during training. This is further extended by the Partial-Logic Regularization (PL-Reg), which improves generalization across GCD, mDG+GCD, and transferability for CIL tasks. Furthermore, the thesis proposes a novel Semantic-aware Data Augmentation (SADA) framework for cross-modality generalization in text-to-image synthesis (T2Isyn), text-image retrieval (TIR), and image-text retrieval (ITR) tasks. This framework ensures semantic preservation across text and image modalities, improving both semantic consistency and image quality in cross-modality tasks. The methods proposed in this thesis offer significant advancements in visual generalization and transfer scenarios, providing theoretical insights and practical solutions for handling data shifts, target shifts, and multi-modalities in complex scenarios. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of the proposed methods, demonstrating their superior performance across a range of tasks."
OpenAlex,deep learning,Antecedents and consequences of Green-tech FDI in emerging markets,Zhuoran Liu,10.17638/03195308,2031-01-01,University of Liverpool,"As environmental pressures intensify, attracting sustainable foreign direct investment (FDI), particularly green-tech FDI, has become a critical pathway for emerging markets to achieve environmental sustainability. However, existing research remains fragmented, offering limited insights into why green-tech FDI enters emerging markets and how it affects regional green innovation. This thesis addresses these gaps by systematically examining both the antecedents and consequences of green-tech FDI through three empirical studies using regional data from China. Study 1 and Study 2 focus on the antecedents of green-tech FDI. Study 1 examines how host-country conditions can attract green-tech FDI, highlighting the role of environmental management information disclosure (EMID) by domestic firms in reducing information gaps and strengthening green market–seeking motives. Study 2 shifts attention to the active decision-making of green-tech FDI, showing that under uncertainty, green-tech foreign investors engage in identity-based bandwagon learning by imitating peers with similar green identities, thereby mitigating investment risks. Study 3 turns to the consequences of green-tech FDI. It demonstrates that, due to the technological complexity of green innovation and limited absorptive capacity in emerging markets, green-tech FDI may generate crowding-out effects rather than purely positive spillovers. Adopting a network perspective, the study further finds that universities play a key moderating role: through broad linkages and deep collaborations, they help mitigate negative spillovers and facilitate the diffusion of green technologies. Together, the three studies advance the literature on sustainable FDI by differentiating green-tech FDI from general FDI and identifying the specific mechanisms that shape its entry decisions and local innovation outcomes. Practically, the findings provide guidance for emerging-market governments and firms on how to attract and manage sustainable investment, balance growth with environmental objectives, and strengthen local innovation ecosystems."
OpenAlex,deep learning,A UAV-Based Framework for Community-Scale Residential Building Energy Modelling in China,Mengfan Jin,10.17638/03195460,2029-01-01,University of Liverpool,"With increasing emphasis on energy efficiency and carbon emission reduction in the building sector, rapid and scalable energy modelling of existing buildings is critical for retrofit projects and policy development. Conventional surveys, data collection and energy modelling processes remain labour-intensive and impractical for large-scale applications, and energy modelling often dominates project time and cost. Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) equipped with high-resolution and infrared cameras now offer fast and safe exterior surveys, showing great potential in building energy assessments. Yet, a systematic framework for UAV integration, from image capture through processing to inputs for building energy simulation, has not been established. This research addresses these challenges by developing a structured framework for community-scale building energy modelling, which integrates UAV photogrammetry to accelerate data acquisition, reduce labour, and shorten energy modelling time for retrofit projects. The framework is designed to minimise prior data requirements while maximising automation and retaining sufficient accuracy and reliability. It also addressed systemic issues, such as the lack of data necessary to fully exploit the potential of available technologies in the context of this study. To achieve this research objective, a mixed-methodology approach, combining desk studies and fieldwork, was adopted. First, a comprehensive review of UAV-based building energy studies mapped the current applications and available tools, proposing a preliminary framework. Fieldwork then encompassed a pilot study and a detailed case study. In the pilot test, a single building was surveyed to identify an optimal toolchain for flight planning, image capture, photogrammetric reconstruction, model generation, and selection of a simulation platform. The resulting refined framework was applied to a case study of a 39-building community, and it was demonstrated that further automation was necessary. The potential for automation was then further explored. Geomatic algorithms, machine learning, and deep learning techniques were compared, and the combination that best balanced accuracy and processing time was selected for 3D model generation and window-to-wall ratio (WWR) extraction. In parallel, an archetype library of residential buildings in the Hot Summer Cold Winter (HSCW) zone in China was compiled to facilitate the assignment of thermal parameters. Finally, a reusable community-scale building energy modelling (CBEM) workflow was assembled in Grasshopper using Ladybug Tools components to process the aforementioned inputs. In conclusion, this study integrates UAV photogrammetry, GIS-based geomatic algorithms, machine learning, and graphical programming to develop an UAV-CBEM framework. The outcomes establish a foundation for scalable UAV-based building energy assessments, enhancing applicability in data-limited and large-scale settings worldwide."

OpenAlex,deep learning,Unsupervised Deep-learning Methods for Low-dose Computed Tomography Reconstruction,Ran An,10.17638/03194237,2027-01-01,University of Liverpool,"Computed tomography (CT) has become an indispensable imaging technique in medical diagnostics and industrial applications, owing to its non-invasive nature and high resolution in visualizing object internal structures. While X-ray CT (X-ray computed tomography) significantly enhances lesion detection capabilities, excessive exposure to X-ray radiation raises substantial health concerns, including elevated cancer risks and potential genetic damage. Although low-dose CT (LDCT) protocols reduce radiation safety concerns, they inevitably introduce severe noise and artifacts, which might compromise diagnostic accuracy. Recent advances in supervised deep learning approaches have demonstrated remarkable success in LDCT reconstruction. However, the reliance on paired training data severely limits their deployment in practical CT applications. This fundamental constraint highlights the critical importance of developing unsupervised reconstruction methods. Although existing unsupervised LDCT methods have made notable progress, they still face challenges requiring systematic solutions. This thesis makes three contributions to advance the field of unsupervised LDCT reconstruction: 1. Current dual-domain self-supervised LDCT denoising methods typically neglect the heterogeneity of the non-stationary Gaussian noise levels in low-dose sinograms and usually treat them as common images without appropriately controlling the denoising strength. The denoisers employed by them, which are based on classic convolutional neural networks (CNN), will lead to blurring artifacts in the reconstructed images if directly used for sinogram denoising. In addition, the denoising strength in the sinogram and image domains must be well-balanced to avoid introducing over-blurring or secondary artifacts in the reconstructed images, but existing approaches do not focus on this crucial point. To address these limitations, this thesis proposes a novel end-to-end dual-domain self-supervised framework for LDCT denoising. It employs Dropblock layers to adaptively localize the effect of convolution for sinogram denoising and sets a weighted average between the denoised sinograms and their noisy counterparts to better control the denoising strength, thus effectively reducing the blurring artifacts and leading to a well-balanced dual-domain denoising. Numerical experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and superior performance of the proposed method. 2. Existing normalizing flows (NFs)-based unsupervised LDCT reconstruction methods face challenges in both image quality and computational efficiency. On one hand, they typically utilize a two-way transformation strategy between noisy images and latent variables, which could easily lead to detail loss and secondary artifacts in the reconstructed images. On the other hand, training NFs on high-resolution CT images is computationally intensive. Although conditional normalizing flows (CNFs) can mitigate computational costs by learning conditional probabilities, existing approaches rely on labeled data for conditionalization, leaving unsupervised CNFs-based LDCT reconstruction a challenge. To tackle these issues, this thesis proposes a novel unsupervised LDCT iterative reconstruction algorithm based on CNFs. The proposed method employs a strict one-way transformation strategy during the alternating optimization in the dual spaces to prevent detail loss and secondary artifacts, and proposes a novel unsupervised conditionalization strategy for CNFs, thus achieving efficient training and inference on high-resolution images. The proposed method illustrates high-quality and relatively fast unsupervised reconstruction. Experiments across two datasets demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed method by rivaling several state-of-the-art methods. 3. Current diffusion model-based LDCT reconstruction methods solely employ the prior distributions learned from normal-dose CT data but neglect the valuable priors in low-dose data, which contain information about the characteristics of low-dose noise and artifacts. In addition, their reconstruction speed suffers from multiple sampling steps, presenting low efficiency. Breaking new ground in prior utilization, this thesis proposes a novel unsupervised LDCT iterative reconstruction algorithm based on dual denoising diffusion probabilistic models (DDPM), which leverages both normal-dose and low-dose priors. Specifically, the proposed method employs two DDPMs to learn the prior distributions from normal-dose and low-dose images, respectively, and incorporates them into a joint iterative reconstruction framework. To accelerate the reconstruction, partial diffusion sampling and single-pass deterministic reconstruction strategy are utilized in the proposed method, as well as the spaced OS-SART approaches. Experiments at different dose levels demonstrate the outstanding performance and fast speed of the proposed reconstruction algorithm. Through these innovations and contributions, this thesis addresses some significant challenges in current deep-learning-based unsupervised LDCT reconstruction methods, and proposes three novel unsupervised reconstruction algorithms. The proposed methods effectively improve the performance and efficiency of LDCT reconstruction under different unsupervised learning conditions, and provide some new perspectives and inspirations for future research."
OpenAlex,deep learning,From Sparse to Dense: Label-Efficient Weakly Supervised Segmentation for Images and Videos,Jian Wang,10.17638/03195330,2027-01-01,University of Liverpool,"Obtaining high-quality annotated data has become a primary bottleneck for training deep learning models, particularly for dense prediction tasks like semantic segmentation and video salient object segmentation. The demand for meticulous, pixel-level labeling makes fully-supervised approaches prohibitively expensive and limits their scalability. This thesis directly confronts this issue by proposing and systematically investigating a label-efficient ""sparse-to-dense'' paradigm. The core objective is to develop innovative frameworks that can learn from sparse, inexpensive weak supervision—such as image-level tags or scribbles—and intelligently propagate this minimal information to generate complete, pixel-accurate dense predictions. The major part of this thesis focuses on the ""sparse-to-dense'' challenge within Weakly Supervised Semantic Segmentation (WSSS) for images, where models learn from only image-level tags. Dominant approaches rely on Class Activation Maps (CAMs) as initial object seeds. However, CAMs inherently activate only the most discriminative object regions, leading to incomplete pseudo-labels. This gives rise to the central problem of activation densification: the critical process of expanding these sparse activations to cover the full extent of an object. Our research addresses this challenge through a progressive, multi-faceted strategy. Our exploration begins with a foundational framework (C3) designed to rectify the intrinsic flaws of initial CAMs. We propose a synergistic mutual calibration method. This method leverages the discrepancies between the two maps to generate local prototypes, which are simultaneously utilized to complete missing object parts and suppress background noise, yielding a significantly more accurate and complete initial seed. This foundational work immediately reveals the limitation of single-prototype instability and its inability to capture diverse features. Building on this foundation, we then develop architecture-specific strategies to address deeper limitations of the prototype-based approach. For Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) (C4), the use of a single prototype proves insufficient to capture significant intra-class variation. In response, we introduce an Optimal Transport (OT)-assisted framework that effectively mines multiple, diverse prototypes, thereby yielding more comprehensive activation maps. However, while C4 solves the intra-class diversity problem, the inherent local context constraint of the CNN architecture becomes the new bottleneck, fundamentally limiting the quality of globally-aware feature extraction needed for optimal multi-prototype assignment. This limitation necessitates a shift in architectural focus from CNNs to Vision Transformers. In the ViT architecture (C5), a new challenge arises where the token gap between the discriminative class token and varied patch tokens leads to incomplete activation. To bridge this gap, we leverage a tailored application of Optimal Transport, where the algorithm is tasked with learning a comprehensive proxy to ensure complete object activation. Despite these architectural advances (C3-C5), the overall WSSS performance hit a ceiling. This is fundamentally limited by the sparse supervision of class labels, which cannot provide precise boundary information. To break this ceiling, our WSSS exploration culminates in a universal enhancement strategy (C6) that transcends architecture-specific designs by leveraging Visual Foundation Models (VFMs). We resolve the conflict between the discriminative nature of initial CAMs and the VFM's need for holistic prompts. By modeling the CAM foreground as a graph and employing spectral analysis, our method intelligently selects a diverse set of prompt points that represent the overall structure of the foreground object. This guides the VFM to generate superior, boundary-aware supervision that can universally enhance any WSSS pipeline. Subsequently, the thesis extends the ""sparse-to-dense'' paradigm to the dynamic domain of video, addressing Weakly Supervised Video Salient Object Segmentation (WSVSOS) (C7) from sparse scribble annotations. In this specific context, the challenge evolves into spatio-temporal densification, which requires both full-object coverage within each frame and temporal consistency across the video sequences. To this end, we introduce the core CFMR framework, which utilizes Spatio-Temporal co-regulation. This framework is subsequently enhanced (CFMR+) by integrating the VFM guidance strategy from C6, which provides high-quality spatial priors essential for ensuring both high spatial detail and inter-frame consistency. By enforcing both intra-frame and cross-frame consistency between these two streams, our method effectively propagates the sparse initial signal to generate dense and temporally coherent saliency masks. In conclusion, this thesis presents a comprehensive and cohesive investigation into label-efficient segmentation tasks, offering a suite of innovative and effective strategies for the ""sparse-to-dense'' challenge. Our work establishes a progressive roadmap that systematically overcomes architectural and semantic limitations, culminating in highly robust and generalized densification pipelines. Our extensive experimental results on standard benchmarks validate the state-of-the-art performance of these methods, providing robust solutions to a long-standing problem in the computer vision field."

OpenAlex,deep learning,CCST-KFN: a novel unsupervised urban vegetation change detection approach for high-resolution RGB remote sensing imagery,Hong Fang; Jierui Yang; Jingxi Luo; Shanchuan Guo; Pengfei Tang; Peng Zhang; Yang Tao; Lin Cao,,2026-12-01,SHILAP Revista de lepidopterología,"Accurate detection of urban vegetation changes is essential for maintaining ecological balance and promoting sustainable urban development. Deep learning has become a leading technology for urban vegetation change detection, owing to its superior performance in feature representation and detection accuracy. High-resolution RGB remote sensing imagery has emerged as the key data source for deep learning-based urban vegetation change detection, due to its fine spatial detail and lower acquisition cost compared to high-resolution multispectral imagery. However, most of the existing urban vegetation change detection methods based on deep learning are supervised and require manually annotated training samples, limiting their automation and efficiency. In this study, we proposed a novel unsupervised urban vegetation change detection approach (CCST-KFN) for high-resolution RGB remote sensing imagery. Specifically, an advanced cross-scale change sample transfer (CCST) method was developed to automatically generate reliable high-resolution training samples. It first produces medium-resolution urban vegetation changed and unchanged samples by pre-detection, leveraging the more discriminative spectral features available in medium-resolution multispectral imagery. These samples are then mapped to the high-resolution domain guided by change information. In addition, a dedicated urban vegetation change detection network by fusing domain knowledge and change features (KFN) was designed for urban vegetation change mapping. It takes as input two high-resolution RGB images and two resampled enhanced normalized difference vegetation index images, which emphasize urban vegetation by combining near-infrared, red, and blue bands. This enables the network to effectively exploit the comprehensive features and domain knowledge of urban vegetation changes. Experiments on three typical urban datasets demonstrate that the proposed CCST-KFN identified urban vegetation changes more completely and with fewer errors compared to seven unsupervised change detection methods. Moreover, its application to a representative urban area in Nanjing City, China, further validates its practical effectiveness. Overall, the proposed CCST-KFN offers a reliable and automated solution for accurate urban vegetation change detection using high-resolution RGB remote sensing imagery, with the potential to further support urban ecological security and sustainable development."

Abstract This Project develops an urban traffic intensity prediction system using deep learning techniques, with the aim of improving mobility decision-making. Unlike other platforms focused on visualizing the current state, the proposed solution seeks to anticipate future behaviors, and is positioned as an open, replicable alternative specifically oriented towards prediction. To achieve this, a modular architecture based on the Python language has been designed, capable of integrating multiple open data sources: historical traffic records, historical weather situation data, and spatial coordinates of measurement sensors. The system applies a process of cleaning, temporal interpolation, and variable transformation, including cyclic encoding of time and spatial conversion to UTM coordinates, allowing for precise fusion between geographical and meteorological data through techniques such as inverse distance weighting (IDW). The predictive model is based on an LSTM neural network, especially adapted for multivariate time sequences. It is trained using a sliding window strategy of 32 samples (7 hours and 45 minutes) to predict traffic intensity in the next interval. The system additionally incorporates an IterableDataset mechanism to handle large volumes of training data without compromising the stability of the environment. The obtained results show robust accuracy in validation scenarios, with acceptable prediction errors (MAE and RMSE). Furthermore, an interactive web interface has been developed, allowing for the local deployment of the system, with the capacity for real-time data ingestion and direct visualization of predictions. This work demonstrates the technical and operational feasibility of applying deep learning to urban traffic analysis and lays the groundwork for its future evolution towards more generalizable, robust, and useful systems in real smart city contexts."
OpenAlex,deep learning,Deep Learning-Based Data Hiding Technique for Medical Images,Hadjer SAIDI,,2026-06-26,University of Biskra Theses Repository (University of Biskra),"This thesis introduces novel deep learning-based frameworks for secure medical image steganography, addressing the critical challenge of protecting sensitive patient information while preserving diagnostic quality. Medical images present unique security requirements due to their dual nature: containing both critical visual data for diagnosis and sensitive patient metadata, which conventional steganographic techniques do not adequately address. Our work presents two complementary approaches to this challenge. First, we develop a Mask-RCNN based framework that intelligently identifies diagnostically insignificant regions within medical images for strategic data embedding. By combining this regionaware detection with Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) embedding in the frequency domain, our method achieves remarkable imperceptibility with Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR) values exceeding 115 dB while maintaining high payload capacity. Second, we propose a clinical quality-aware convolutional neural network architecture that leverages an encoder-decoder framework for end-to-end steganography. This approach employs parallel processing paths with scaled residual learning to embed secret medical images within cover images while preserving diagnostic features. Extensive experimentation across multiple medical imaging modalities (CT, MRI) from datasets including MIDRC-RICORD-1B, and IQ-OTH/NCCD, demonstrates that our method achieves a good trade-off between payload and imperceptibility. The frameworks developed in this thesis achieve an optimal balance between embedding capacity, imperceptibility, and robust secret recovery, providing healthcare institutions with effective tools for safeguarding patient privacy while maintaining the integrity of medical diagnostics. This work significantly advances the field of medical image security and establishes a foundation for future innovations in secure healthcare information systems."
OpenAlex,deep learning,A Novel Deep-Learning-Based Approach for Estimating High-Resolution InSAR Parameters,"Dell Amore, Luca; Carcereri, Daniel; Demir, Begüm; Rizzoli, Paola",,2026-06-01,elib (German Aerospace Center),"Nowadays, SAR Interferometry (InSAR) represents one of the most powerful tools to perform complex tasks, such as retrieving Earth’s surface topography and monitoring its deformations. However, denoising strategies are crucial for the generation of reliable and high-quality InSAR products. In this framework, we propose a complete and generalized theoretical and statistical model to physically describe and simulate a noise-free interferogram, together with its corresponding noisy version, starting from the knowledge of the InSAR acquisition geometry and of the underlying topography. A deep-learning-based model is then trained in a fully-supervised manner to estimate high-resolution InSAR parameters, i.e. coherence and interferometric phase, leveraging the proposed statistical model. In particular, an accurate assessment of the network’s estimation performance is conducted by comparing it to state-of-the-art denoising filters, such as Boxcar and Phi-Net and showing the added value of the proposed theoretical modifications to the state-of-the-art literature."
