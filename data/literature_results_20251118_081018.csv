Compared with valve replacement, aortic valve repair is a better potential strategy to achieve a low rate of valve-related events and an enhanced quality of life. We herein report two cases of aortic valve repair for UAV accompanied by aneurysm of the ascending aorta. By retaining the free margin tissue and forming a neocommissure to the side of the left lateral commissure that is 180 degrees opposite and the same height, we were able to achieve bicuspidization of the UAV. A glutaraldehyde-treated autologous pericardium patch was placed along the cusp connection to the annulus to expand the aortic cusp. During the follow-up period of over 4 years, the patients showed no signs of aortic regurgitation or significant stenosis."

Lipoprotein(a) [Lp(a)] is a genetically determined lipoprotein particle, causally implicated in atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) and calcific aortic valve stenosis (CAVS). Given its genetic basis, studies have shown marked ancestry-related differences in different races and ethnicities. Lp(a) plasma concentrations vary by more than 100-fold among individuals, primarily due to LPA gene polymorphisms and the number of kringle-IV type 2 (KIV2) repeats, which define apolipoprotein(a) [apo(a)] isoform size. Individuals of African descent have the highest median concentrations, followed by South Asians, with Hispanics/Latinos and East Asians having lower levels. Admixed populations display heterogeneity reflecting genetic ancestry. Despite differences in absolute levels, the relative ASCVD risk per unit increase in Lp(a) is consistent across groups, highlighting the universal atherogenicity of elevated Lp(a). Small apo(a) isoforms are associated with higher Lp(a) concentrations and risk, though isoform size is mainly a surrogate for Lp(a) burden. Despite a strong genetic basis and disproportionate burden in some populations, ancestry-specific testing guidelines are limited and testing rates remain low. Therapies targeting LPA transcription are in development, with outcome trials underway. Integrating ancestry-informed perspectives with universal risk principles is essential for equitable prevention and treatment. Routine, one-time Lp(a) testing enables cost-effective early risk stratification as Lp(a)-directed therapies emerge."

Although their effectiveness in treating coronary artery plaques and abdominal aortic aneurysms has been reported, data on their effects on coronary artery aneurysms are limited. Herein, we report the case of a 43-year-old man with familial hyperlipidemia who presented with angina pectoris caused by a giant right coronary artery aneurysm accompanied by extensive plaques and severe stenosis. The patient underwent coronary artery bypass grafting at six anastomotic sites, and a PCSK9 inhibitor was initiated postoperatively. Five years after surgery, imaging demonstrated a gradual reduction in the size of the coronary artery aneurysm, and eight years later, the size was further reduced. This case report illustrates the rare clinical course of a coronary artery aneurysms."

Timely valve replacement, either surgical or transcatheter, significantly improves survival. This audit evaluated our transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) pathway to identify delays and implement targeted quality improvements. Methods A retrospective audit of 29 consecutive patients with severe symptomatic AS referred for TAVI at a tertiary cardiac centre was conducted. Data on three key intervals, namely, referral-to-clinic, clinic-to-multidisciplinary team (MDT) decision, and MDT-to-procedure, were extracted from hospital records. Compliance with predefined timing targets (≤6 weeks per interval, ≤18 weeks total) was assessed, along with wait-list and 30-day mortality. Descriptive statistics summarized waiting times and compliance rates. Results The mean age was 76.3±9.8 with a median of 79; 18 (62%) were male, and 25 (86%) presented in New York Heart Association (NYHA) class III/IV heart failure. The mean total referral-to-TAVI time was 155±24 days (median 155), exceeding the 126-day benchmark; only three (10%) received treatment within 18 weeks. Referral-to-clinic targets were largely met in 23 (79%) patients, but major delays occurred between clinic and MDT (mean 56 days) and MDT-to-procedure (mean 64 days). Two (6.9%) patients died while awaiting TAVI, and among the 27 who underwent TAVI, one (3.7%) died within 30 days. Conclusions This audit revealed substantial delays in the TAVI pathway, primarily due to diagnostic and scheduling bottlenecks, resulting in prolonged waiting times and avoidable adverse outcomes. A quality improvement action plan, including a rapid-access valve clinic, one-stop investigations, increased procedural capacity, and active wait-list monitoring, has been implemented. Re-audit will evaluate the impact on reducing waiting times and improving patient outcomes."

Imaging methods and practice,"Ethnic variation in aortic root anatomy may influence transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) planning and outcomes. While Asian patients are reported to have smaller aortic dimensions than their Western counterparts, data for Southeast Asians in the UK are scarce.
We retrospectively analysed all Southeast Asian patients undergoing TAVI at a large UK centre (January 2018-October 2023), matched 2:1 by age and sex to Caucasian patients. Baseline demographics, CT-derived aortic measurements, procedural details, and post-procedural outcomes were compared. Of 1230 patients undergoing TAVI, 44 Southeast Asians were matched to 84 Caucasians. Compared with Caucasians, Southeast Asians had lower BMI (25.8 ± 4.6 vs. 29.4 ± 6.5 kg/m², P = 0.001) and smaller annular areas (390.3 ± 89.5 vs. 469.4 ± 89.3 mm², P < 0.001), perimeters (71 ± 7.8 vs. 78 ± 7.6 mm, P < 0.001), and sinus heights (20.1 ± 3.2 vs. 22.6 ± 3.3 mm, P < 0.001). Indexed annular area did not differ significantly (229 ± 42.7 vs. 242 ± 41.6 mm²/m², P = 0.10). Median valve size was smaller in Southeast Asians (23 vs. 26 mm, P < 0.001). Residual aortic regurgitation (AR) post-implant was more frequent in Southeast Asians, with fewer having no AR (47.7% vs. 78.6%) and a higher proportion with mild (50.0% vs. 19.0%) or moderate AR (2.3% vs. 1.2%). Post-TAVI gradients were similar between groups.
Southeast Asian patients in the UK undergoing TAVI have smaller annular dimensions and receive smaller prostheses compared with Caucasians, partly reflecting differences in body habitus. These findings have implications for prosthesis selection, procedural planning, and lifetime valve management."

The triglyceride-glucose (TyG) index, a composite biomarker of insulin resistance and systemic inflammation, has been associated with cardiovascular diseases. However, its causal association with CAVS remains unclear. This study employs bidirectional Mendelian randomization (MR) to elucidate the potential causal relationship between the TyG index and CAVS.
Genome-wide association study) summary statistics of TyG index and CAVS were obtained from UK-biobank cohort (n = 273 368) and FinnGen database (cases = 12 418 and controls = 487 930). Two-sample MR and multiple MR analyses were conducted to evaluate the association of TyG index with CAVS. The primary method was inverse variance weighted (IVW), complemented by MR-Egger, weighted median, and sensitivity analyses to ensure robustness.
The MR analysis demonstrated a significant causal effect of the higher TyG index (per 1-unit increment of TyG index) on CAVS risk (odds ratio [OR] = 1.50, P = .007, 95% CI: 1.12-2.02). Similar causal relationships were observed for triglyceride and glucose levels with CAVS. Sensitivity analyses confirmed robustness with no evidence of horizontal pleiotropy (P > .05). This association remained statistically significant in multiple MR analyses after adjusting for potential confounders (OR = 1.64, P = .003, 95% CI: 1.18-2.28). No reverse causality from CAVS to the TyG index was detected.
This MR study provides evidence supporting the causal effect of higher TyG index on CAVS."

This study evaluates these outcomes and further examines their association with the annular size in patients.
A total of 2,699 patients who had undergone TAVI with a BE-THV at least 5 years prior to our study were analysed. A small aortic annulus (SAA) was defined as an area ≤430 mm2; any larger annuli were labelled large aortic annuli (LAA). The primary endpoints were the incidence of all-cause mortality and bioprosthetic valve failure (BVF) between the SAA and LAA groups. As a subanalysis, the primary endpoints were examined in relation to postprocedural mean pressure gradient (mPG) ≥20 mmHg, severe prosthesis-patient mismatch (PPM), and sex differences, comparing SAA and LAA each time.
Overall, 66.4% (n=1,793) of patients were categorised into the SAA group. At 7 years after TAVI, the cumulative all-cause mortality showed differences between the SAA and LAA groups (55.2% vs 58.6%), while BVF assessed by Gray's test was similar between the groups (3.3% vs 2.7%). The Cox multivariable analysis revealed no association between SAA and worse prognosis (hazard ratio 1.07, 95% confidence interval: 0.85-1.36; p=0.56). There were no significant differences in mortality or BVF regarding an mPG ≥20 mmHg, severe PPM, or sex between the SAA and LAA groups (allp>0.05).
Annular size differences were not found to influence long-term outcomes or valve durability following TAVI with a BE-THV, suggesting that other factors warrant further investigation."

There are no established data on hypoattenuating leaflet thickening (HALT) following transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) using the S3UR.
Our study aimed to elucidate the clinical features of HALT following S3UR implantation.
As a subset of the OCEAN (Optimized CathEter vAlvular INtervention)-TAVI registry, we prospectively assessed patients who underwent cardiac computed tomography (CT) 30 days after S3UR implantation. HALT and potentially relevant THV geometry were analysed using four-dimensional CT data by an independent core laboratory.
Of the 445 patients studied, HALT was detected in 95 patients (21.3%) 30 days after TAVI. The modification of the commissural attachment specific to the 20 mm and 23 mm S3UR THVs did not affect the incidence of HALT (22.1% for ≤23 mm; 20.2% for ≥26 mm; p=0.636). The hourglass-shaped THV frame (p<0.001) and asymmetricity of THV leaflets (p=0.002) were independently associated with HALT development. A trend toward higher mean aortic gradients at 30 days with greater degrees of HALT (HALT >25% vs HALT ≤25%: 10.3 [interquartile range [IQR] 7.0-13.0] mmHg vs 8.6 [IQR 6.3-11.6] mmHg; p=0.007; HALT >50% vs HALT ≤50%: 11.5 [IQR 7.0-14.3] mmHg vs 8.9 [IQR 6.3-11.9] mmHg; p=0.002) was noted.
The incidence of HALT for the S3UR was comparable with the already reported incidences for the previous-generation SAPIEN 3 THV. Given the haemodynamic impact of HALT severity and multiplicity, strategic planning to avoid deformation of the implanted THV might be required. (Clinical trial registration: UMIN000020423)."

We sought to assess the feasibility of coronary cannulation (CC) and the impact of commissural and coronary alignment on CC execution, as confirmed by post-transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) computed tomography (CT).
The CANNULATE TAVR EXPANDED study is a multicentre, prospective study which included consecutive patients who underwent transfemoral TAVI with the Evolut FX, CC, and angiography after valve deployment. Post-TAVI CT was performed to assess commissural and coronary alignment. Moderate-to-severe commissural and coronary misalignments based on the ALIGN-TAVR Consortium definition were categorised as the misalignment group. The primary endpoint was the rate of successful CC after Evolut FX implantation.
A total of 126 patients were included. CC was successful in 100% of cases for the left coronary artery (LCA) and 96.7% for the right coronary artery (RCA). Moderate-to-severe commissural misalignment was observed in 13.5%, and moderate-to-severe coronary misalignment was observed in 20.6% (LCA) and 22.2% (RCA). Misaligned LCA and RCA required significantly longer CC times. In multivariable analysis, factors associated with suboptimal LCA cannulation were coronary height (odds ratio [OR] 0.73, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.57-0.90; p=0.006) and coronary misalignment (OR 4.58, 95% CI: 1.45-14.47; p=0.009), whereas right coronary cusp width (OR 0.63, 95% CI: 0.44-0.90; p=0.007) and coronary misalignment (OR 4.64, 95% CI: 1.29-16.74; p=0.019) were identified for the RCA.
High rates of CC, and commissural and coronary alignment post-TAVI with the Evolut FX were observed in this prospective, multicentre study. Coronary misalignment was identified as the strongest predictor of suboptimal CC for both the LCA and the RCA."

Several challenges are associated with BAVs, from diagnosis and classification to interventional or surgical treatment. Transcatheter prostheses, designed to treat tricuspid aortic valves, have shown promising results in BAV anatomies. However, technical limitations, such as underexpansion, ellipticity or procedural complications, have been identified. Several issues for transcatheter procedures are still a matter of discussion.

PubMed,aortic stenosis,Fixing the rhythm in transcatheter aortic valve implantation patients: can we reduce the need for permanent pacemaker implantation?,Teodor Serban; Andrea Papa; Patrick Badertscher,10.1080/14779072.2025.2591793,2025-11-16,Expert review of cardiovascular therapy,"Transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) has revolutionized the treatment of severe aortic stenosis, yet conduction disturbances remain the most common complication. Permanent pacemaker implantation (PPI), while often necessary, may negatively impact long-term outcomes and increase healthcare burden. Identifying patients at risk of PPI and optimizing post-TAVI rhythm management is therefore of critical importance.
This Special Report reviews key predictors of conduction disturbances after TAVI, including baseline electrocardiographic features (e.g. right bundle branch block), anatomical parameters (e.g. short membranous septum), and procedural factors (e.g. valve type and implantation depth) identified by literature review. Dynamic post-procedural changes in PR interval and QRS duration are discussed as triggers for further monitoring or electrophysiological testing. The report synthesizes findings from recent multicenter studies, guideline recommendations, and emerging tools such as ECG ambulatory monitoring using artificial intelligence and the MIDAS implantation technique.
Reducing unnecessary PPI requires an individualized, risk-adapted approach that integrates imaging, ECG, and procedural planning. Dynamic post-TAVI monitoring and selective use of electrophysiological studies may help avoid overtreatment. As TAVI expands to younger and lower-risk populations, refining conduction management will be essential to optimize patient outcomes and healthcare resource utilization."

This study assessed HCRU and healthcare costs among patients with oHCM treated in real-world settings over 5 years of follow-up.
This retrospective cohort study used the Optum database (January 2013-December 2021) and included patients aged ≥18 years with ≥2 claims for oHCM and continuous health plan enrollment for ≥6 months pre-initial and post-initial oHCM claim (index date). Patients with ≥5 years of follow-up data were analyzed. All-cause and HCM-related HCRU (ambulatory visits [physician office visits and outpatient visits], emergency room [ER] visits, hospital admissions, length of stay [LOS], and pharmacy use) and healthcare costs were assessed in US dollars.
In total, 5,129 patients with oHCM were identified: 5,056 (98.6%) had an all-cause ambulatory visit and 4,669 (91.0%) had an HCM-related visit. 4,079 (79.5%) had an all-cause ER visit, and 1,499 (29.2%) an HCM-related ER visit. 2,949 (57.5%) reported an all-cause admission, and 2,232 (43.5%) an HCM-related admission. The mean (SD) per-person count of all-cause ambulatory visits was 101.0 (90.7) and 15.3 (18.7) for HCM-related ambulatory visits. Mean (SD) all-cause admissions per patient were 1.8 (3.8), and 0.9 (1.6) were HCM related. Mean (SD) all-cause LOS was 18.0 (54.7) days, and HCM-related LOS was 10.0 (39.6) days. Mean (SD) all-cause healthcare cost per patient was $181,968 (241,608), of which $67,531 (114,705) was HCM related.

Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement (TAVR) aims to immediately alleviate the aortic pressure gradient and thereby changing LV cardiac mechanics. The aim was to describe by in-vivo assessment of LV pressure-volume (PV) relationships how TAVR acutely affects LV cardiac mechanics.
In this prospective observational study in patients with severe AS, LV cardiac mechanics were evaluated with an LV conductance catheter before and after TAVR. The effects of transcatheter valve design, pre- and post-dilatation, use of rapid pacing (≥180 bpm) and LV ejection fraction (EF) were specifically addressed.
In-vivo LV PV reconstructions were obtained in 61 patients. Stroke work (SW) and pressure volume area (PVA) were significantly lower following TAVR (decrease from median (25th-75th percentile) of 10,935.6 (6,877.5-13,490.8) to 6,878.0 (4,870.8-8,613.8) mmHg/mL, p<0.001 and from 17,831.5 (12,414.9-22,416.8) to 11,024.9 (8,364.7-14,705.0) mmHg/mL, p<0.001, respectively) with stable SW/PVA ratios. Overall, end-systolic and end-diastolic pressures and volumes were significantly lower after TAVR. Arterial Elastance, as an index for LV afterload also decreased (2.66 (2.01-3.87) to 1.96 (1.25-2.72) mmHg/mL, p<0.001). LV contractility declined as illustrated by a reduction in End-systolic Elastance (2.22 (1.50-3.10) to 1.58 (1.08-2.43) mmHg/mL, p<0.001). The trends in changing LV cardiac mechanics were similar for balloon- and self-expanding valves and were not affected by pre/post dilatation, rapid pacing or LV EF.
TAVR for severe AS resulted in immediate LV unloading, lower myocardial metabolic demand and impaired contractility.

Advances,"Cardiac damage stage predicts clinical outcomes in severe aortic stenosis (AS), yet its validation in moderate AS and natural history preaortic valve replacement (AVR) and post-AVR is poorly understood.
This paper sought to: 1) determine whether index cardiac damage stage predicts cardiovascular outcomes in patients with moderate AS; and 2) describe the impact of AVR on cardiac damage stage over time.
This retrospective single-center cohort study stratified patients with moderate AS according to index cardiac damage stage. We assessed whether cardiac damage stage predicted a primary composite outcome of all-cause death and heart failure (HF) hospitalization and a secondary outcome of AVR. Changes in stage over time were also assessed.
Among 688 patients (median follow-up of 3.6 years), baseline cardiac damage stages 0, 1, 2, and 3 to 4 were evident in 25.1%, 24.1%, 41.6%, and 9.2%, respectively. Escalating baseline stage conferred an increased risk of the composite primary endpoint (incidence per 1,000 person years, stage 0: 52 [37, 72]; stage 1: 100 [77, 129], stage 2: 94 [77, 116]; stages 3 to 4: 255 [185, 352]; HR (95% CI); P < 0.001], which was mirrored in survival analyses (all-cause death and HF hospitalization: Plog-rank < 0.001). The net result of awaiting AVR (median time 3.1 years) was an accumulation of cardiac damage, which partially resolved at 1-year.
Cardiac damage stage is associated with an increasing risk of all-cause mortality and HF hospitalization in patients with moderate AS. The degree of damage accumulates as patients await AVR, which partially recovers post-AVR."

Without effective medical therapies, intervention mainly relies on timely valve replacement, although silent myocardial and valvular damage may progress before symptoms arise. Early, non-invasive detection of disease activity is a crucial unmet need.
To review circulating and mechanistic biomarkers reflecting the core pathogenic pathways of CAVD and asses their potential for early detection and patient-specific risk stratification.
Narrative review of literature focusing on traditional protein biomarkers, emerging non-coding RNAs, and extracellular vesicles (EVs) associated with lipid oxidation and inflammation, bone and mineral metabolism, extracellular matrix (ECM) remodelling, endothelial dysfunction and non-coding RNA regulation.
Traditional protein biomarkers-such as lipoprotein(a), osteopontin, fetuin-A, galectin-3 and matrix metalloproteinases-offer insights into the disease and correlate with disease burden but lack sensitivity for detecting early-stage CAVD. Emerging non-coding RNA markers, including long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) and microRNAs (like miR-30b and miR-125b), show promise as predictive and diagnostic tools by mediating key molecular pathways involved in calcification and inflammation. EVs, which carry proteins, lipids and nucleic acids across all pathogenic pathways, provide stable and comprehensive signatures that enhance risk stratification compared to conventional markers. Notably, no single biomarker has demonstrated sufficient sensitivity or specificity across all stages of the disease. Combining proteins, RNAs and EV cargo into integrative, multimodal panels-supported by proteomics and transcriptomics-provides the greatest potential for early detection and patient-specific management. However, further validation in prospective cohorts and standardization of assays are necessary before clinical implementation.
Biomarker-guided approaches could revolutionize CAVD management by enabling early detection and patient stratification before irreversible valvular damage occurs."

With recent clinical trials indicating that transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) is at least on par with surgical aortic valve replacement (SAVR) in treating lower risk patients, there has been a rise in TAVR uptake in younger, lower risk patients, leading to an increased likelihood of bioprosthetic valve degradation within a patient's lifetime. This shift in treatment has changed the landscape of interventional cardiology, incentivising the Heart Team to now plan for the initial procedure with subsequent interventions in mind. While traditional multi-slice computed tomography image-based risk assessments are sufficient for initial valve placement, they fall short in their ability to accurately predict post-procedural outcomes and future interventions. Therefore, the need to balance competing risks to optimise patient outcomes over multiple interventions requires innovation. CT-derived computational techniques are being developed to incorporate biomechanics and fluid dynamics into the risk assessment process to allow more comprehensive analysis of the risks associated with different procedures. The goal of this review is to provide an overview of computational techniques that are being developed for the purposes of optimising outcomes in both the index and valve-in-valve interventions and to give cardiologists an understanding of how they may use computational modelling as an additional tool in the lifetime management of aortic stenosis."

A multicentre cross-sectional study.
We analysed data from the Searching for Atrial Fibrillation and Early Recruitment of Heart Failure in HCM registry, collected between 2018 and 2023.
Patients with HCM (n=499) aged ≥18 years from 12 institutions (Shizuoka Prefecture, Japan) were consecutively enrolled.
Clinical parameters, along with data from a short form of the Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire (KCCQ-12), were collected. The association between each clinical parameter and the KCCQ-12 score was analysed. Clinical parameters with a significant univariable association (p<0.05) were used in a multiple regression model to investigate independent clinical parameters associated with the KCCQ-12 score. The coefficients and relative importance of each parameter included in the multiple regression model were also evaluated.
In the univariable analysis, KCCQ-12 scores exhibited significant associations with 21 clinical parameters, including sex, left ventricular morphology and the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI). The multiple regression model with 12 parameters that had a significant univariable association exhibited an adjusted R2 of 0.48. In this model, the PSQI (standardised coefficient -0.39; p<0.001), history of sustained ventricular tachycardia or fibrillation, history of atrial fibrillation (-0.23; p<0.001), female sex (-0.19; p=0.035), systolic blood pressure (0.17; p=0.040), lateral E/e prime (-0.17; p=0.049) and A wave (-0.14, p=0.049) were independently associated with the KCCQ-12 score with high relative importance.
In patients with HCM, we investigated the association between the KCCQ-12 score and various clinical parameters. PSQI, as well as known heart failure-related clinical parameters, was significantly associated with the KCCQ-12 score. Visualising the associations of various clinical parameters with the KCCQ-12 score will help physicians to consider factors linked to the decline in QOL in patients with HCM."

Eight clinical trials comprising a total of 490 pediatric patients met the inclusion criteria. Among children undergoing septal myectomy for HOCM, the pooled early and late mortality rates were 3.3% and 8.5%, respectively. Concomitant mitral valve repair was performed in 7.3% of patients. Rates of complete atrioventricular block and permanent pacemaker implantation were 9.9% and 5.1%, respectively. The mean durations of intensive care and hospital stay were 34.6 h and 12.9 days.

However, the prognostic significance of postprocedural LAP changes remains a matter of debate. We aimed to evaluate the impact of v-wave on long-term survival after TEER.
A total of 1487 patients in the large-scale, multicenter MITRA-PRO (MITRAclip PROgnosis) registry with post-mitral TEER v-wave assessment were included in this study.
After 3-years, survival was significantly reduced in patients with increased v-wave after mitral TEER, while patients with decreased v-wave showed the lowest 3-year mortality. A receiver operating characteristic analysis revealed a postprocedural v-wave >25 mm Hg as a relevant predictor of 3-year mortality following mitral TEER. Three-year mortality was significantly lower in patients with a v-wave ≤25 mm Hg indicating a postprocedural v-wave >25 mm Hg as a negative predictor of long-term survival (v-wave ≤25 mm Hg group: 34.2% versus v-wave >25 mm Hg group: 46.8%; P<0.001). Furthermore, 3-year functional outcome assessed by New York Heart Association classification was significantly better in patients with v-wave ≤25 mm Hg (v-wave ≤25 mm Hg: New York Heart Association I: 10.4%, II: 51.2, III: 33.2%, and IV: 5.3% versus v-wave >25 mm Hg: New York Heart Association I: 11.3%, II: 32.3, III: 47.6%, and IV: 8.9%; P=0.003). In both, functional and degenerative mitral regurgitation 3-year mortality was significantly higher in the v-wave >25 mm Hg group.
A postprocedural v-wave >25 mm Hg is linked to reduced long-term survival. Multimodal residual mitral regurgitation assessment including v-wave supports the interventionalist in TEER guidance and optimizing procedural results aiming for decreasing v-wave to <25 mm Hg.

This led to the hypothesis that principal strain angles determine LV functional recovery after mitral valve repair in patients with primary mitral regurgitation (PMR).
Controls (n=52) and patients with PMR with regurgitant volume defined as mild (<30 mL, n=16), moderate (30-50 mL, n=38), and severe (50 mL, n=55) had cardiac magnetic resonance with tissue tagging and 3-dimensional analysis. Fifty-four patients with PMR had presurgery and 6 (n=46), 12 (n=44), and 24 (n=25) month studies. Longitudinal, circumferential, and maximal shortening were computed along with principal strain angles (circumferential, longitudinal, and radial directions) at base, mid, and distal LV levels.
LV ejection fraction did not differ in mild, moderate, and severe PMR with similar increases in mid LV 3-dimensional radius-to-wall thickness and decrease in LV mass to volume and sphericity index versus controls. Radial longitudinal shear strain and LV mid and distal LV circumferential and longitudinal angles increased in all groups with PMR. Postsurgery LV end-diastolic volume, LV end-diastolic mass to volume and 3-dimensional radius-to-wall thickness returned to normal at 6, 12, and 24 months; however, mid LV circumferential, longitudinal, and maximal shortening decreased below normal. LV circumferential and longitudinal angles and LV sphericity index did not change from presurgery whereas LV ejection fraction post surgery correlated with decrease in LV twist at 6, 12, and 24 months.
Changes in principle strain angles occur early in PMR. The extent to which they persist after surgery may underlie the decrease in LV ejection fraction."

However, catheter malposition and inadequate venting are not uncommon because of limited visibility. Although transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) can assist in catheter monitoring, TEE-guided management strategies remain underreported. This study aimed to characterize catheter-related issues and describe effective troubleshooting approaches.
We retrospectively analyzed intraoperative TEE findings in 304 patients who underwent open-heart surgery at Kochi University Hospital, including 200 with LV venting and 104 with LA venting. TEE records of catheter-related events and corrective maneuvers were reviewed, and challenges in TEE assessment were identified.
No catheter-related injuries were observed. In the LV group, TEE identified failure of ventricular entry (n = 5), impingement on papillary muscles or the apex (n = 18), and catheter-induced mitral regurgitation (n = 11). Residual air was frequently localized distant from the catheter tip. In the LA group, misplacement into pulmonary veins (n = 9) or the left atrial appendage (LAA) (n = 2) was noted. Venting was ineffective in cases of acute LV distension during antegrade cardioplegia or due to Thebesian venous return. In some cases, deep catheter placement resulted in incomplete drainage of the right-sided LA.
Both LA and LV venting have distinct pitfalls. TEE facilitates identification and correction of catheter-related problems, but structured training in TEE assessment is essential to optimize outcomes."

We evaluated the clinical utility of the 6MWD by quantifying the gap between the expected and observed physical performance and estimating its determinants.
Outpatients with wild-type (ATTRwt)-CM were investigated. Standardized echocardiographic, laboratory and clinical assessments were performed. A regression formula derived from a healthy local population sample was applied to predict the expected 6MWD. Associations with 6MWD were analyzed by linear regression, adjusted for age and height. Explanatory multivariable models using backward elimination, regularization and clinical reasoning were calculated.
100 patients were analyzed. Their mean age was 78.7 (6.3) years and 86% were men. The mean observed 6MWD was 310 (113) m, which corresponded to about 65% of the expected performance. Significant predictors of the 6MWD were (ordered by decreasing explanatory power): high-sensitivity Troponin T, NT-proBNP, NAC disease stage, estimated glomerular filtration rate, atrial fibrillation, hemoglobin, hepatic vein dilation, mitral E-wave maximum velocity, left ventricular ejection fraction, and the tricuspid valve maximal regurgitation pressure gradient. Multivariable models yielded an R² of up to 45.9% with a root mean squared error of 82.9 m.
Physical performance as measured by the 6MWD in patients with ATTRwt-CM was remarkably compromised. Laboratory and imaging markers indicative of disease severity and congestion predicted the 6MWD in these patients. Cardiovascular markers explained a fair amount of 6MWD variability."

However, other mechanisms contributing to mitral regurgitation may coexist as a result of further structural abnormalities. SAM might occur because of the increased septal thickness alone or due to simultaneous MV or subvalvular apparatus anomalies, such as mitral leaflet elongation, papillary muscle body anomalies, accessory papillary muscles or additional papillary muscle heads. Additionally, anomalous mitral chordae or the recently described mitral-aortic discontinuity (leading to a longer anterior mitral leaflet (AML)) can contribute to abnormal physiology. A closed aortomitral angle may also contribute. During intraoperative echocardiographic assessment, it is important to thoroughly evaluate the MV and the regurgitant jet to understand the mechanism(s) that cause MR in HCM patients. Although myectomy alone is frequently enough to correct SAM, concomitant MV procedures may be needed, especially when the septum is thin (<16-18 mm) and/or there is intrinsic MV disease. Detection of concomitant regurgitation mechanisms beyond SAM can eventually be identified preoperatively, either by direct structural detection (valve prolapse), by pharmacological palliation of SAM with vasopressors and negative inotropic agents or suspected by identification of anteriorly and centrally directed regurgitant mitral jets. Surgical techniques that can be employed to contribute to SAM elimination include plication/extension/retention plasty of the AML, resection/release/reorientation of papillary muscles, division of anomalous chordae, edge-to-edge repair, or, at times, prosthetic MV replacement. If there is structural MV disease concomitant to HCM, appropriately tailored techniques to address the MV may be used. Transoesophageal echocardiography at the end of the procedure should demonstrate elimination of SAM, resolution of LVOT obstruction, and appropriate coaptation of the MV leaflets and nearly resolution of MR. Provocation with inotropes can be used to ensure no latent obstruction persists."

Case reports,"Degenerative mitral regurgitation (DMR) is associated with substantial morbidity and mortality if left untreated. While surgical repair remains the gold standard, mitral transcatheter edge-to-edge repair (M-TEER) is an established alternative for patients at high surgical risk. However, recurrent MR after initial M-TEER remains a therapeutic challenge and is associated with poor outcomes.
A 77-year-old patient presented with recurrent heart failure symptoms due to MR after prior CARILLON® device implantation for secondary MR at an external hospital in September 2019. Transoesophageal echocardiography revealed degenerative mitral valve disease characterized by a complex combination of posterior leaflet prolapse and anterior leaflet flail, resulting in a severe eccentric regurgitant jet.The patient underwent successful M-TEER with the MitraClip® system in December 2021. In June 2023, the patient was re-hospitalized for recurrent heart failure symptoms. Imaging revealed severe recurrent MR originating lateral to the implanted device. A redo M-TEER was performed using the PASCAL® system, requiring careful navigation through a narrow residual lateral orifice. The procedure resulted in a durable reduction to mild MR with sustained clinical stability at 18-month follow-up.
This case illustrates the anatomical challenges of DMR and demonstrates the feasibility and durability of redo M-TEER in high surgical risk patients with recurrent MR. It emphasizes the importance of individualized anatomical assessment and tailored device selection in complex valve anatomies."

Transcatheter edge-to-edge repair (TEER) is a viable treatment, but its long-term survival impact, particularly across sexes, remains underexplored. We aimed to assess relative survival (RS) and excess mortality (EM) in patients undergoing TEER for significant MR, with a focus on sex-based differences. Methods: We analyzed 253 patients treated with TEER between October 2015 and August 2024, stratified by sex. Observed survival (OS) was calculated using the actuarial life table method; expected survival (ES) was estimated via the Ederer II method using matched population data. Primary endpoints were RS and EM; secondary endpoints included mortality differences by MR subtype. Results: OS at 1, 2, and 3 years was 88.9%, 87.4%, and 78.9%, respectively. EM peaked in the first year (7.8%) and declined thereafter. RS was lower than in the general population, primarily due to persistently reduced RS and elevated EM in men. Women achieved RS comparable to matched peers from year one. Sex was not an independent predictor of mortality (HR 0.88, 95% CI 0.38-2.03, p = 0.771). Conclusions: In patients with significant MR undergoing TEER, EM was concentrated in the first year. Women reached RS comparable to the general population, while men showed persistent excess mortality. Sex was not independently associated with survival after adjustment."

Its prevalence and prognostic significance in athletes remain uncertain, raising important questions for pre-participation screening, eligibility for competition, and long-term follow-up. Methods: We systematically searched PubMed, Scopus, and EMBASE databases from inception through August 2025 for original studies reporting MVP prevalence in athletes, diagnosed by echocardiography or pathological assessment. Data on study characteristics, diagnostic definitions, prevalence, arrhythmias, and outcomes were independently extracted by three reviewers. Methodological quality was appraised using the National Institutes of Health Quality Assessment Tool for Observational Cohort and Cross-Sectional Studies. Results: Twelve studies published between 1987 and 2024 met inclusion criteria, enrolling 19,463 athletes from diverse sports and competitive levels. A total of 407 MVP cases were identified, corresponding to a crude pooled prevalence of 2.4%. Prevalence estimates varied substantially (0.2-20%), reflecting heterogeneity in study populations and diagnostic definitions. When all studies were pooled using a random-effects model, the overall prevalence was 2.0% (95% CI 1.2-2.8%). A sensitivity analysis restricted to contemporary, unselected athletic cohorts yielded a prevalence of 1.1% (95% CI 0.4-1.9%), closely aligning with population-based estimates. Ventricular arrhythmias were more frequent than supraventricular arrhythmias, particularly in association with bileaflet prolapse, leaflet thickening, or significant mitral regurgitation. Most athletes were asymptomatic, and only one prospective study provided long-term follow-up, confirming a generally benign prognosis, though rare adverse events (atrial fibrillation, valve surgery) were documented. Conclusions: MVP is relatively uncommon in athletes and occurs at rates similar to the general population. In most cases, prognosis is favorable and should not preclude sports participation. Nonetheless, recognition of high-risk phenotypes with arrhythmogenic potential highlights the need for individualized evaluation and tailored surveillance strategies in sports cardiology practice."

This case highlights the critical need for early diagnosis and intervention. An 18-year-old female presented with orthopnea, low-grade fever, chest tightness, and pulmonary edema. She had experienced dyspnea, weight loss, recurrent abdominal pain, and chronic anemia over the past six months. Examination revealed congested lungs, sweating, tachycardia, and laboratory findings indicative of inflammation. Echocardiography identified multiple obstructing masses in the left atrium moving into the left ventricle during diastole, causing severe mitral regurgitation. Imaging revealed old infarcts in the brain, liver, and spleen. Blood cultures were positive for Enterococcus faecalis, and empirical antibiotics were initiated. Urgent surgery was performed, including left atrial myxoma resection, mitral valve replacement with a bioprosthetic valve, left atrial appendage closure, and closure of the interatrial septum. Postoperative echocardiography confirmed normal left ventricular function and a well-functioning bioprosthetic mitral valve. The patient tolerated the procedure well and was discharged on a regimen of oral antibiotics for six weeks.
Infected cardiac myxomas, though rare, pose significant risks due to their potential for systemic embolization and severe complications. This case emphasizes the necessity of comprehensive diagnostic evaluation and timely surgical intervention to prevent catastrophic outcomes.
This case underscores the importance of a multidisciplinary approach and early surgical intervention in managing complex cases of infected cardiac myxoma with systemic embolization. Our findings reinforce the need for vigilance in diagnosing and treating such rare but life-threatening conditions."

Mitral Transcatheter edge-to-edge repair (M-TEER) has become a groundbreaking treatment option for high-risk patients ineligible for conventional surgery, with the MitraClip system standing as the most widely validated and utilized device in this field.
This study aimed to evaluate the immediate procedural outcomes and long-term clinical results of MitraClip interventions in Turkish patients with secondary mitral regurgitation. The primary objectives were to determine the rate of procedural success according to standardized Mitral Valve Academic Research Consortium (MVARC) criteria and to assess the proportion of patients achieving optimal mitral regurgitation reduction (MR ≤ 1+) at hospital discharge. The secondary objectives were to identify independent clinical, echocardiographic, and procedural predictors associated with rehospitalization for heart failure and all-cause mortality during follow-up, and to evaluate the durability of mitral regurgitation reduction and functional improvement over the medium-term follow-up period.
This retrospective study included 140 Turkish patients with moderate-to-severe (grade 3+) or severe (grade 4+) SMR who underwent MitraClip treatment between 2021 and 2024, with a median follow-up of 23.5 months (interquartile range [IQR]: 14.0–27.0). MR severity was assessed by comprehensive echocardiographic evaluation according to current guidelines, and post-procedure MR was classified as ≤ 1 + or > 1 + for outcome analyses.
The study population had a median age of 75.0 (IQR: 68.0–78.0) years, with 42.9% being female. Procedural success according to MVARC criteria was achieved in 137 patients (97.9%), while MR ≤ 1 + at discharge was observed in 95 patients (67.9%). During follow-up, 56.4% of patients required rehospitalization, and the mortality rate was 7.1%. Significant improvement in functional capacity was observed, with 88.6% of patients improving by at least one New York Heart Association (NYHA) functional class at 1-month follow-up (from 100% NYHA class III-IV at baseline to 11.4% class III, 70.0% class II, and 18.6% class I post-procedure). Multivariate analysis revealed that estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) (Hazard ratio [HR] 0.95, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.91–0.99, p = 0.03), atrial fibrillation (HR 1.62, 95% CI: 1.02–2.57, p = 0.04), and post-procedure MR severity (MR grade > 1 + vs. ≤1+) (HR 1.73, 95% CI: 1.13–2.65, p = 0.01) were associated with rehospitalization. Mortality risk was associated with lower hemoglobin (HR 0.92, 95% CI: 0.86–0.99, p = 0.04), and severe MR (HR 2.54, 95% CI: 1.09–5.92, p = 0.03).
MitraClip intervention demonstrated high procedural success rates in Turkish patients with SMR, leading to significant reduction in MR severity and improvement in NYHA functional class. While rehospitalization and mortality rates aligned with previous studies, specific clinical factors were identified as being associated with clinical outcomes.

We aimed to quantify adverse outcomes under conservative management and evaluate the association of aortic valve replacement/repair (AVR) with mortality.
Systematic searches (inception-July 2025) identified cohort studies of asymptomatic moderate/severe AR. Random-effects models estimated pooled incidence rates of adverse events; fixed-effects models were used for hazard ratios (HRs) of AVR vs conservative management.
Twenty-seven studies (4720 patients; mean age 49 years; mean follow-up 3.9 years) were included. Pooled incidence rates per 100 person-years were 1.75 (95% CI 1.27 to 2.41) for all-cause mortality, 1.29 for cardiac death, 0.29 for sudden death, 4.30 for new symptoms and 7.01 for AVR. Asymptomatic low left ventricular ejection fraction occurred in only 0.9 per 100 person-years. Mortality rates were more than double those of the general population across age groups-2.45 (1.90 to 3.18) per 100 person-years for cohorts with mean age ≥50 years versus 0.59 (0.29 to 1.21) for younger cohorts. Early AVR was associated with lower mortality (pooled HR 0.33; 95% CI 0.30 to 0.37).
Asymptomatic moderate/severe AR carries significant excess mortality irrespective of age, contradicting its historically benign reputation. Given the rarity of asymptomatic LV dysfunction, earlier intervention guided by more sensitive markers of LV damage may improve outcomes, although heterogeneity and study quality warrant cautious interpretation.

Congenital anomalies of the atrioventricular valve or septum (CAAVAS) and functionally univentricular heart (FUH) are complex subtypes of CHD, where disruptions in key molecular pathways are implicated. This study investigates the genetic burden contributing to these anomalies. This case-control study included 48 participants: 24 patients diagnosed with CAAVAS or FUH and 24 healthy controls. Whole-exome sequencing (WES) was conducted to assess genetic burden by evaluating minor allele frequencies (MAF) using gnomAD and predicting functional impact of variants with REVEL scores. A secondary filtration was performed, focusing on 349 genes associated with abnormal heart valve morphology (HP:0001654) as defined by the Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) database, to identify pathogenic variants exclusive to the case group. Genetic burden risk (GBR) analysis revealed a significantly higher median number of common variants in the case group compared to controls (p = 0.035). Genetic analysis identified variants in genes involved in contractile cardiac and cytoskeletal proteins (MYH3, ACTC1), extracellular matrix proteins (FBN1, FREM1, HSPG2), ciliary proteins (EVC2, PKD1L1), enzymes (POLG, DNASE1L3), Cell-signaling proteins (TGFB2, CCDC22) and transcription factors (NKX2-5, NONO). This study highlights the significant role of genetic burden and gene variants associated with congenital mitral and tricuspid valve anomalies. Our findings reinforce the strong genetic predisposition underlying these malformations, as evidenced by the increased genetic burden in affected individuals compared to controls without CHD."

While it is generally considered less common following successful valvular repairs without evidence of active infection, endocarditis can present in a variety of ways, including as an incidental finding in patients with stroke. Stroke in the setting of endocarditis is often caused by embolic events originating from infected valve leaflets or vegetations. Although blood cultures remain the gold standard for diagnosing infective endocarditis, negative blood cultures are not uncommon, particularly in early or indolent cases. Advanced imaging modalities, such as transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) and cardiac computed tomography (CT), play a crucial role in identifying valve abnormalities, vegetations, and other structural heart lesions that may suggest endocarditis, especially when blood cultures fail to provide a definitive diagnosis. This case report focuses on the diagnostic challenges and the role of advanced imaging in a patient with a history of prior mitral valve repair who presented with recurrent stroke events but was otherwise asymptomatic. Despite initial negative blood cultures, suggestive of early or indolent endocarditis, serial imaging with cardiac CT and TEE guided clinical decision-making and timely intervention. Dynamic changes in echogenic structures over time prompted surgical intervention before microbiologic confirmation, underscoring the importance of imaging in prosthetic valve patients who may present atypically, such as with stroke as the sole manifestation. In addition, the study explores whether stroke can be the sole presenting symptom of endocarditis in patients with valvular disease or repair. The case further emphasizes the need for high suspicion of endocarditis in patients with valvular heart disease, especially those with embolic events, and underscores the importance of timely imaging to guide management decisions. This case also provides a review of similar reports in the literature, reinforcing the role of cardiac CT and TEE in diagnosing endocarditis in patients with valvular disease and prosthetic valve repairs."

Diagnosis remains challenging, and a high index of clinical suspicion is often required. We present a 65-year-old female with a past medical history of hypertension and dyslipidemia with a chief complaint of altered mental status. She was found to have left-sided focal seizures and dysarthria. Computed tomography (CT) of the head with and without contrast, with subsequent confirmatory magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the head with contrast, revealed a 3.5 cm ring-enhancing lesion in the right frontal lobe, consistent with a brain abscess. Craniotomy and drainage yielded Streptococcus intermedius, suggesting a likely dental source. A transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE) identified a large multilobular right atrial mass and an interatrial shunt, likely a patent foramen ovale (PFO), enabling paradoxical embolization. AngioVac (AngioDynamics, Latham, NY, USA) aspiration of the right atrial mass, targeted antibiotic therapy, and guideline-directed medical therapy (GDMT) provided a multimodal treatment plan to best suit the patient's individual needs. This case illustrates the importance of considering atypical sources in brain abscesses of unclear origin. The necroinflammatory infiltrate found on pathology of the right atrial mass, in addition to abscess cultures demonstrating heavy growth of S. intermedius, suggests that the right atrial mass served as a nidus for septic embolization to the brain through the patient's PFO. Due to a critical illness on initial presentation, the patient was started on empiric antibiotics on admission. Blood cultures and cultures of the right atrial mass were subsequently negative for any organisms. It was noted by clinical history that the patient had invasive dental work approximately two weeks prior to presentation. Given the above information, the most likely cause of the patient's brain abscess was culture-negative nonvalvular bacterial endocarditis. In the absence of a mechanical valve and intravenous drug use, turbulent flow induced endothelial injury, likely exposing fibrin on the lateral wall of the right atrium. The patient was ultimately discharged with close outpatient follow-up with marked improvement in symptoms. Early recognition, advanced imaging, and multidisciplinary management, including neurosurgical intervention, cardiothoracic surgery, and infectious disease consultation, were critical for optimizing outcomes."

The Mpox infection is commonly auto-limited. However, complications, such as secondary bacterial infection, including pneumonitis and encephalitis, have been described, which can lead to death. We report the clinical evolution and autopsy findings of a patient with an atypical presentation and clinical course.
The patient had no significant past medical history and was diagnosed with community-acquired pneumonia and monkeypox virus co-infection. The studied subject developed cardiorespiratory arrest with asystole and hypoxic encephalopathy, leading to death around 72 h after hospitalization. The main macroscopic findings in the lungs were condensation associated with bronchopneumonia in the lower regions of both lungs and not thrombi in the pulmonary artery. In the heart, no myocardial abnormalities and no evidence of valvular or vascular abnormalities were observed. Congestion was found in the kidneys and liver. Moderate to severe edema along with congestion of the leptomeninges was found in the brain. The main histopathological findings were lung tissue with diffuse lympho-histiocytic infiltrate, hemorrhagic necrosis of alveolar septa, vascular congestion, and intra-alveolar edema. The perivascular lymphocytic infiltrate in Virchow-Robin spaces was suggestive of encephalic abnormalities. Differentiation between complications due to Mpox and complications associated with Mpox was a limitation due to the lack of immunohistochemical and molecular studies in tissues.
This case illustrates the severe Mpox disease that can be developed in immunocompetent, non-HIV individuals and the possible association of Mpox with other infectious diseases acquired in the community."

The TRICURE first-in-human (FIH) study evaluates the initial feasibility and clinical safety of the Topaz transcatheter tricuspid valve replacement (TTVR) system in treating TR. Featuring a novel dual-stent design, the system is specifically engineered for the unique anatomy of the tricuspid valve. It has a flexible outer stent with low radial force designed to accommodate annular dynamics and conform to the non-circular, variable shapes of the tricuspid valve, coupled to a rigid inner stent aiming to maintain valve function integrity.
TRICURE FIH is a prospective, multicentre, first-in-human study with follow-up extending to 5 years. The primary safety endpoint is a composite measure including all-cause mortality, heart failure rehospitalisation, and reintervention for failed tricuspid therapy at 30 days. The primary performance endpoint is device success, defined as a TR reduction ≥1 grade with no more than moderate TR post-procedure.
A total of 20 patients were enrolled. The procedure time (from delivery system insertion to removal) was 35±16 minutes. At 30 days, the primary safety endpoint, a composite of major adverse events, was observed in 35%, and the primary performance endpoint was successfully achieved in all patients (100%), with all patients having a TR reduction of at least 3 grades, and none of the patients having more than mild TR post-procedure. No device-related pacemaker implant was reported. An exemplary case report demonstrates complete elimination of TR and a reverse remodelling of the right ventricle of 19% at 6 months.
The TRICURE FIH study provides evidence of the feasibility and safety of a novel TTVR system. Outcomes need to be confirmed in a larger series. (ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT05126030)."

However, because of improper use by malevolent users, the legitimacy of this kind of digital content may be under threat in society. Deepfake techniques, which replace a person's face with another using computer vision and graphics, have caused a great deal of anxiety. These techniques make it simple to conceal someone's genuine identity, which highlights the necessity of having a way to confirm the legitimacy of face photos and videos. To address this difficulty, we have created a model based on deep learning that is enriched with a strategy of visual attention to distinguish real images and videos from ones that have been altered using deep-fake techniques. To create feature maps, we first extract the facial area from video frames then run it through a ResNeXt-50, CNN that has already been trained.

In this work, we propose an optimized convolutional neural network (CNN) framework enhanced by Otsu thresholding-based image segmentation for improved detection of malaria-infected cells. A dataset of 43,400 blood smear images was utilized, divided into a 70:30 ratio for training and testing. A baseline 12-layer CNN achieved 95% accuracy, which improved to 97% with the integration of EfficientNet-B7 through a hybrid parallel feature-fusion model. Further enhancement was achieved using Otsu-based segmentation, where preprocessing emphasized parasite-relevant regions while retaining morphological context in the RGB images. This approach yielded the highest accuracy of 97.96%, reflecting a ~ 3% gain over the baseline CNN. To ensure the reliability of the segmentation step, we created a manually annotated subset of 100 images and computed quantitative segmentation metrics by comparing Otsu-generated masks with reference masks. The method achieved a mean Dice coefficient of 0.848 and Jaccard Index (IoU) of 0.738, confirming that Otsu segmentation effectively isolates parasitic regions despite its simplicity. Five-fold cross-validation was also performed, yielding consistent results (94.8%, 96.9%, and 97.8%), thereby supporting the robustness of the framework. The proposed pipeline demonstrates that simple yet effective preprocessing can significantly boost CNN-based classification while maintaining interpretability and computational feasibility. These findings suggest that segmentation-driven deep learning frameworks can play a vital role in developing reliable, scalable, and cost-effective malaria diagnostic tools."

Accurate segmentation of the kidney contour is essential for estimating renal volume and constructing patient-specific anatomical models, which are vital for pre-operative planning and image-guided biopsy. Manual delineation of the kidney contour is time-consuming and prone to inter- and intra-observer variations. Addressing the development of novel methods for precise kidney boundary delineation in ultrasonic data is challenging owing to the absence or indistinctness of these boundaries. In this work, a novel segmentation method named a Caputo principal-curve-guided segmentation network (CPSN) integrated principal-curve (PC)-based vertex decision into a Caputo multiple-layer learning network was developed to boost the precision of ultrasound (US) kidney segmentation. First, an initial deep network was designed to extract the rough contour information. Second, the PC-based vertex decision block was adopted to determine the distribution order of vertices, which was subsequently used as the input of the Caputo multiple-layer training network. Third, the Caputo training network was further trained to decrease the global model error and improve alignment between predicted results and ground truth labels. Several experiments were conducted to validate the effectiveness and robustness of our method on multi-institute US kidney databases, which were proven to achieve superior performance compared to other state-of-the-art (SOTA) techniques, with Dice index (DI), Jaccard index (JI), and accuracy (ACC) values of 94.6 ± 3.2%, 93.4 ± 3.7%, and 94.1 ± 3.47%, respectively."

This is especially critical for breast cancer, one of the most common cancers among women, where early detection of abnormal tissue is crucial to improving survival rates. In this paper, we explore the application of Deep Learning techniques to segment and classify breast masses as malignant or benign using ultrasound images, aiming to support breast cancer diagnosis. We propose a modular dual-stage pipeline that first segments suspicious regions and then classifies them into benign or malignant categories. The framework is designed to flexibly integrate different backbone architectures, allowing adaptation to task- or dataset-specific requirements. Experimental results show that, within this pipeline, DeepLabV3+ with a ResNet34 encoder provided the most accurate segmentation, while lightweight classifiers such as MobileNetV3-Small and EfficientNet-B0 yielded the best classification performance. Moreover, an ablation study was conducted to tune parameters and determine their optimal configuration. Finally, our approach was tested on two breast ultrasound datasets, and the results show promising improvements in diagnostic accuracy, demonstrating the potential of our method to enhance early breast cancer detection."
PubMed,deep learning,Efficacy of MRI-based deep learning algorithm for detecting acute ischemic stroke: evaluation among diverse readers.,Jimin Kim; Se Won Oh; Ha Young Lee; Sheen-Woo Lee; Sungjun Hwang; Heiko Meyer; Stefan Huwer; Gengyan Zhao; Eli Gibson; Dongyeob Han,10.1007/s00330-025-12137-4,2025-11-17,European radiology,"The efficacy of an MRI-based deep learning algorithm (DLA) for detecting acute ischemic stroke (AIS) was evaluated across readers with diverse medical backgrounds, because DLA performance may be user-dependent.
This retrospective, multi-reader, multi-case crossover study included 407 MRI scans obtained from a single institution between April and June 2021. Nine readers with different backgrounds- radiology residents (1-2 years of radiology training), clinicians (no radiology training), and board-certified non-neuroradiologists (completed residency training)-independently read MRI scans, both with and without DLA detection probability. The ground truth was established by consensus among three neuroradiologists. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, diagnostic confidence (0-4), and inter-reader agreement were compared between the groups with and without DLA.
In total, 407 patients (mean age, 66 years ± 16; 200 men) with 95 AIS (23%) were evaluated. Clinicians had the lowest baseline performance scores. The DLA significantly improved clinicians' AUC (from 0.90 [95% CI: 0.82-0.99]; to 0.93 [0.87-0.99]; p < 0.01), sensitivity (from 0.77 [0.65-0.88]; to 0.88 [0.75-0.99]; p < 0.01), and diagnostic confidence (from 0.71 ± 1.42; to 0.83 ± 1.53; p < 0.01), and all readers' inter-reader agreement (p < 0.01). Specificity for clinicians (from 0.95 [0.86-0.99] to 0.93 [0.80-0.99]; p = 0.55) and the performance of residents and non-neuroradiologists were not significantly affected by DLA assistance.
The DLA significantly improved the performance and diagnostic confidence of clinicians, the lowest-performing readers, and the inter-reader agreement of all readers in diagnosing AIS.
Question What is the efficacy of an MRI-based deep learning algorithm in assisting various medical professionals in identifying acute ischemic stroke? Findings Among radiology residents, clinicians, and board-certified non-neuroradiologists, the algorithm significantly improved clinicians' performance and diagnostic confidence while also enhancing inter-reader agreement for all readers. Clinical relevance The deep learning algorithm significantly improves the detection performance and diagnostic confidence of clinicians, the lowest-performing readers, for acute ischemic stroke. Furthermore, the inter-reader agreement among various medical professionals has improved significantly."

Existing anomaly detection approaches often struggle with high false-positive rates, poor adaptability, and significant computational demands, compromising their real-time efficacy and scalability. To address these problems, this research presents an Anomaly Detection using Machine Learning Algorithms (AD-MLA) framework that employs a Random Forest model to accurately detect abnormal activities. The framework encompasses feature selection, data clustering, and an energy-efficient routing strategy that incorporates node energy, signal strength, hop count, and link stability. Evaluations demonstrate that AD-MLA reduces false alarms, improves detection accuracy, and operates with lower energy and computational requirements. It offers a smart, rapid, and efficient security system for real-time VANET environments, rendering it appropriate for transportation systems characterised by high reliability and safety. By integrating a Random-Forest-based anomaly detector with intelligent feature selection and an energy-efficient routing method that accounts for residual energy, signal strength, and link stability, the suggested framework systematically addresses these challenges. This approach delivers 95.33% accuracy, 96.09% recall, 94.25% computational efficiency, and 91.45% resource-use efficiency. This effectively addresses the scalability, latency, and energy challenges that previous systems have faced in incorporating blockchain technology and deep learning architectures."
PubMed,deep learning,Transformer-aided skin cancer classification using VGG19-based feature encoding.,Fallah H Najjar; Zaid Nidhal Khudhair; Farhan Mohamed; Mohd Shafry Mohd Rahim; Vei Siang Chan; Ali Hilal Ali,10.1038/s41598-025-24081-w,2025-11-17,Scientific reports,"Skin cancer is among the most widely distributed, deadliest cancers around the globe, and early diagnosis becomes vital to enhance patient survival. Deep learning has demonstrated high potential for automatic skin lesion classification. However, existing Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are still unsatisfactory in terms of dataset reliance, subjection to orientations, and the inability to model long-range global context. To solve this problem, we propose a hybrid model named the VGG19-RSPDA-ViT with the fine-grained local feature captured by VGG19 and the global context provided by Vision Transformers (ViT). The proposed RSPDA enforces rotation invariance and enriches the feature space, which further strengthens generalization on a small training set. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to systematically combine feature-map-level rotation/shift augmentation with a CNN-Transformer hybrid model for dermoscopic skin cancer detection. Performance was validated on three benchmark datasets: the Melanoma Skin Cancer Dataset of 10,000 Images (MSK10000) for binary classification and the Human Against Machine with 10,000 training images (HAM10000) and Hospital Pedro Hispano (PH2) for multi-class classification. Our model achieved accuracies of 97.9%, 97.1%, and 98.67% on MSK10000, HAM10000, and PH2 datasets, respectively, with consistently high macro-averaged precision, recall, specificity, and F1 scores across both datasets. VGG19-RSPDA-ViT outperformed existing state-of-the-art methods with superior generalization capabilities. These results demonstrate that our proposed model is effective for skin lesion classification and has significant potential for clinical application as an automated diagnostic tool in dermatology."
PubMed,deep learning,HashWave: blockchain-powered perceptual hashing for resilient audio piracy detection against signal-processing attacks in decentralized networks.,Stuti Pandey; Akhilendra Pratap Singh; Dharmender Singh Kushwaha; Ashish Pandey,10.1038/s41598-025-24016-5,2025-11-17,Scientific reports,"Audio piracy detection is increasingly complex in decentralised distribution settings, where mainstream approaches fail to ensure robustness, verifiability, or computational efficiency. Conventional Digital Rights Management (DRM) systems mainly enforce licensed access, but once content is copied or redistributed outside their control they offer little protection. Classical fingerprinting approaches such as MFCC based hashes can detect near-exact duplicates, yet they often fail under signal edits like pitch shifting, time stretching or equalisation. Deep learning embeddings improve robustness but demand heavy computation and centralised resources, making them less suitable for edge or decentralised deployments. These limitations call for a solution that is both edit resilient and verifiable. We propose HashWave, a blockchain-integrated perceptual hashing framework that combines robust audio fingerprinting with tamper-proof verification. The system fuses MFCC, chroma and chroma CENS, CQT, spectral contrast, and lightweight tempo/energy cues, applying operation-aware weighting via [Formula: see text] and constrained DTW for time-scale edits. Evaluated across GTZAN, FMA-A Dataset for Music Analysis, and MUSAN (SLR17) with over twenty signal-processing transformations, HashWave achieves AUC 0.957 and TPR@1%FPR 0.952, outperforming MFCC-only baselines and approaching deep embeddings at lower CPU cost. The blockchain layer, built on Ethereum and IPFS, ensures decentralised hash storage, duplication control, and verifiable authorship with average upload and contract execution times of 0.017 s and 0.044 s. Together, these results establish HashWave as a practical, scalable, and secure framework for piracy detection across streaming, podcasting, and Web3 ecosystems."

We address the challenges of heterogeneous data integration through a Cross-modal Attention Fusion Network (CAFN) that dynamically aligns semantic information across textual, visual, and spatiotemporal modalities. A Transformer-based joint entity-relation extraction model simultaneously identifies disaster-related entities and their relationships with 89.0% F1 score, outperforming conventional approaches by 8.7%. We further develop a spatiotemporal knowledge graph representation with specialized reasoning mechanisms that explicitly model the dynamic nature of emergency scenarios.

PubMed,deep learning,English-focused CL-HAMC with contrastive learning and hierarchical attention for multiple-choice reading comprehension.,Lina Ji; Linghua Yao; Wei Xu,10.1038/s41598-025-24031-6,2025-11-17,Scientific reports,"Multiple-choice questions constitute a critical format for assessing language application proficiency in standardized English tests, such as BEC and TOEIC. Developing explanatory content for such materials traditionally relies heavily on manual labor in test item analysis, which is labor-intensive and time-consuming. Consequently, Artificial Intelligence (AI) approaches centered on Machine Reading Comprehension for Multiple Choice (MCRC) are becoming the preferred solution for generating auxiliary educational content. This task demands models capable of profoundly understanding textual semantics and accurately identifying complex relationship patterns between passages, questions, and answer options. Although Pre-trained Language Models (PLMs) have achieved remarkable success on MCRC tasks, existing methods confront two primary limitations: (1) they remain susceptible to misclassifying highly textually similar yet semantically distant distractor options (e.g. synonymous business terms); (2) they exhibit significantly diminished accuracy when tackling questions requiring indirect reasoning or background knowledge to identify implicit answers. To address these challenges, this paper proposes Contrastive Learning-driven Hierarchical Attention Model for Multiple Choice (CL-HAMC). The proposed model innovatively employs multi-head attention mechanisms to hierarchically model the triple interactions among passages, questions, and options, simulating the progressive, multi-layered reasoning process humans undertake during problem-solving. Furthermore, it incorporates a contrastive learning strategy to sharpen the model's ability to discern nuanced semantic distinctions among answer choices. Extensive experiments on the RACE, RACE-M, and RACE-H benchmarks demonstrate that CL-HAMC achieves substantial and consistent performance gains, establishing a new state-of-the-art (SOTA) on all three datasets. Moreover, CL-HAMC exhibits competitive results on the DREAM dataset. This study provides an effective solution towards the automated processing of highly distractor-rich multiple-choice questions within the English auxiliary learning domain."

Recent research has explored the role of microRNAs (miRNAs) in these cancers by constructing miRNA-associated disease networks using bipartite graphs. Graph attention networks (GATs) have emerged as a powerful tool for predicting disease associations within such biological networks, offering enhanced accuracy in identifying potential miRNA-disease relationships. This study employs GATs to uncover and predict potential miRNA contributors to head and neck cancers. Data on miRNA-disease associations were sourced from the HMDD v4.0 database, a platform based on SQLite and Django. The head and neck neoplasms dataset included miRNA, disease, causality, category, and PubMed ID (PMID). GATs were applied to analyze the network, leveraging their ability to capture the significance and interdependencies of nodes and edges. The model used a learnable weight matrix to compute attention coefficients, normalize them, and aggregate information from neighboring nodes for edge prediction. The GAT model, integrating graph neural networks with attention mechanisms, achieved an accuracy of 83% in predicting miRNA-disease associations for head and neck neoplasms. This study highlights the potential of graph-based deep learning models, particularly GATs, in accurately predicting miRNA-disease associations. A functional enrichment analysis revealed significant involvement of miRNAs in oral cancer pathways, notably highlighting the critical roles of the TGF-beta and PI3K-Akt signaling pathways in tumor progression and cell survival. These findings offer a pathway to better understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying head and neck cancers. Future improvements in dataset size, model evaluation, and interpretability could further enhance prediction accuracy, potentially advancing diagnostic and therapeutic strategies for these cancers."

Seventy adult participants underwent tooth shade evaluation using the VITA Classic shade guide, with high-resolution intraoral images analyzed using deep learning techniques to detect, segment, and classify tooth shades. The performance metrics-namely, accuracy, precision, recall, and the F1 score-were employed to evaluate the tooth shade classification of deep learning models derived from six modified CNN architectures. The ResNet model demonstrated the most optimal results. A subsequent McNemar's test, which was utilized to make a comparison between the deep learning model and experienced dentist, yielded statistically significant results. The deep learning model provides a reliable and efficient alternative for assessing tooth shade assessment, minimizing subjectivity and outperforming experienced clinicians in accuracy."

Anteroposterior, Towne, and lateral views were included in the analysis. EfficientNetB0 served as a backbone of the deep learning model. It was enhanced with transfer learning and attention mechanisms. Extracted features were integrated into traditional classifiers such as Random Forest and XGBoost to improve classification performance. Model performance was evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, F1-score, and AUROC. External validation was conducted using data (824 images) from Incheon St. Mary's Hospital, South Korea. In the internal validation cohort, the hybrid EfficientNetB0-Random Forest model achieved the highest accuracy (0.97), with an AUROC of 0.999. External validation results showed that Random Forest achieved the best performance among classifiers, with an accuracy of 0.74 and an AUROC of 0.76.

Generally, DoS attacks are executed by forcing a victim's computer to reset and consume its sources. Distributed DoS (DDoS) is the most underlined and significant attack in today's cyber world. DDoS attacks have become a major threat on the Internet. Federated Learning (FL) is gaining attention in cybersecurity for collaboratively training deep learning (DL) models on distributed threat data without sharing raw data. However, the utilization of FL in this field is still in its early stages, with several key aspects yet to be explored. DL and machine learning (ML) enhance the ability to detect malicious traffic. Generally, DL and ML methods depend on necessary data samples for training a method using accuracy and efficacy. This manuscript proposes a Mitigating DDoS attack in Federated Learning Using Deep Reinforcement Learning and Frilled Lizard Optimization (MDDoSFL-DRLFLO) technique. The proposed MDDoSFL-DRLFLO model presents a collaborative FL approach to recognize and classify DDoS attacks quickly. At first, data normalization is performed using z-score normalization to standardize the input data within a specified range. Next, the feature selection process is implemented using an improved bacterial foraging optimization algorithm (IBFOA). In addition, the Dueling Double Deep Q-Network (D3QN) model is employed for the classification process. Finally, the hyperparameter tuning of the D3QN model is performed by using the frilled lizard optimization (FLO) approach. A wide range of experimental studies are implemented to ensure the enhanced performance of the MDDoSFL-DRLFLO method under the CICIDIS 2017 and ToN-IoT datasets. The performance validation of the MDDoSFL-DRLFLO technique portrayed a superior accuracy value of 99.52% on existing techniques under diverse evaluation measures."

Unlike conventional passive cooling, ultrasound-driven bubble actuation stabilizes boiling, prevents drying, and ensures uniform heat distribution, while nanoarray-coated micropins enhance liquid refilling via capillary forces and improve surface wettability. Experimental data were analyzed using deep neural networks (DNN), long short-term memory (LSTM) models, and statistical correlation methods (Spearman and Kendall), with interpretability provided by SHAP (DeepSHAP) and partial dependence plots (PDP). A comparison of model performance revealed that the LSTM achieved lower prediction errors than the DNN across all evaluated metrics (MAE 0.0055, SMAPE (0.8), and RMSE 0.0072), indicating its outperforming performance. SHAP and statistical analyses identified initial temperature as the most influential factor affecting heat transfer coefficient (HTC), followed by chipset material (S30-120 and stainless steel). Secondary factors include chipset configuration (SS, S30-120, S-nanorod, S-nanosheet) and nanoparticle type (SiO₂, ZnO), which significantly modulate bubble dynamics and thermal performance. PDP results highlight acoustofluidic excitation as the primary positive contributor, while flow rate and nanostructured surfaces provide moderate enhancements."

The tests were performed using the Rock Top multi-field coupling tester to investigate the changes in strength, deformation, and permeability of the sandstone across the specified temperature range. Furthermore, scanning electron microscopy (SEM) was employed to analyze the microstructure of the sandstone and its influence on mechanical properties. The results indicate that with increasing temperature, the strength of sandstone initially increases and then decreases, while the peak strain exhibits a rapid and nonlinear increase. Furthermore, the permeability of sandstone decreases initially and then increases as the temperature rises, demonstrating lower sensitivity to temperature variations compared to confining pressure. At various temperatures, the failure modes observed in sandstone consistently demonstrate typical shear slip characteristics. Moreover, at elevated temperatures, there is a significant increase in the number of cracks observed on the failure surface of sandstone. Under the action of lower temperature (25℃~65℃) the pores and micro-cracks of sandstone appear highly compact, and the new cracks are relatively few, but under the action of higher temperature (75℃~95℃), the size and number of defects in sandstone increase obviously, which is the fundamental factor that leads to the change of mechanical and permeability characteristics of sandstone. The research findings presented in this paper provide theoretical support for assessing the stability of surrounding rock in high geothermal tunnel."

These parameters need to be considered when cut-off values indicating the need for&#x0D; treatment or even surgery are established. The aim of present work is to study the relation of&#x0D; weight of the heart with age and weight of cadaver.&#x0D; Material and Methods: The study was performed in the Department of Anatomy, Shri Ram&#x0D; Murti Smarak Institute of Medical Sciences, Bareilly on 30 hearts from embalmed cadavers.&#x0D; The hearts were procured from the cadavers available in our department. The heart was&#x0D; thoroughly cleaned and measurements were taken.&#x0D; Results: The mean heart weight was 223.37 ± 57.78 g. Significant relationship between age of&#x0D; the cadaver and weight of the heart (p=0.0004), weight of cadaver and weight of heart&#x0D; (p=0.0001) was observed.&#x0D; Conclusion: The above study provides valuable data of the heart in our geographical location,&#x0D; which may be useful for cardiac surgeons and physicians."

Its causes can be divided into two large groups: those of genetic origin and those of nongenetic origin, which include infectious, toxic, and autoimmune disease causes, among others. Its natural course varies significantly based on the different etiologies and its diagnosis can influence the disease's management and prognosis. Clinical case: 29-year-old male, with a history of having suffered from Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia at the age of 4 with complete remission of the disease demonstrated at that time by bone marrow aspirate and immunophenotype, having been treated with anthracyclines. On this occasion, he attended due to the presence of sudden onset dyspnea and hemoptysis, for which in the first instance, due to the previously mentioned history, an attempt was made to rule out pulmonary thromboembolism with chest Angio tomography, which was corroborated by said study and demonstrating the presence of two intracavitary thrombi. Therefore, a transthoracic echocardiogram was performed, highlighting severe dilation of the left ventricle. Management for heart failure was adjusted based on structural alteration demonstrated by echocardiography, with favorable clinical evolution. Conclusions: The natural history of dilated cardiomyopathy is not easy to establish due to the wide heterogeneity of its etiology and the different rates of progression depending on it. In some cases, there may be functional recovery after acute myocardial damage, for example, in cardiomyopathy induced by tachycardia or in that induced by cardiotoxic drugs. In other cases, stabilization of the disease and systolic dysfunction and, in others, sudden death may be observed."

While previous research has shown that optimal patient selection is crucial for treatment outcomes, recent studies have identified a multitude of factors that independently influence mortality. Although these findings can significantly support clinical decision-making, the large number of available studies renders an overview of this topic challenging. In this review, we provide a comprehensive overview of the currently identified factors associated with increased mortality after TEER. We also summarize the current evidence on published risk scores that stratify mortality risk after M-TEER and T-TEER. We aimed to provide clinical decision-making support for optimal patient selection and referral to TEER and to identify remaining gaps in evidence."

Despite the recognized importance of hemodynamic force (HDF) in cardiology, its exploration in MR has been limited. Therefore, using a retrospective observational study design, we aimed to investigate the potential of noninvasively assessed systolic and diastolic HDF derived from 4-dimensional-flow magnetic resonance imaging (4D-flow MRI) as markers for determining MR. Method: The study cohort included 15 controls (19-61 years) and 26 MR patients (20 with primary and 6 cases with secondary MR, 33-75 years) classified into trivial-to-severe MR through cardiac MRI. The 3 T/4D-flow MRI sequence was used to assess left ventricular (LV) HDF (integral of intraventricular pressure gradients over the LV cavity) in 3 directions (lateral-septal, inferior-anterior, and apical-basal) using “Segment,” v2.2 R6410. Results: A negative coefficient for peak-systolic apical-basal HDF corresponded to decreased ejection fraction (β = −8.1, SE = 3.3, t = −2.5, P = .03), and a positive association was found between LV mass index and peak-systolic apical-basal HDF (β = 25.6, SE = 11.1, t = 2.3, P = .04). Peak-systolic apical-basal and E-wave apical-basal (diastolic HDF at E-wave time point) HDF emerged as significant predictors in detecting severe MR (Estimate = 2.2, P = .007; Estimate = 1.8, P = .015, respectively). The peak-systolic apical-basal HDF was also notably correlated with age in moderate-severe MR ( r = 0.88, P = .022). Conclusion: Mitral regurgitation affects early diastolic filling and peak systolic ejection, indicated by peak-systolic and E-wave HDF in the apical-basal direction, offering insights into dynamic flow patterns and LV remodeling. Hemodynamic force analysis could enhance risk stratification and guide therapeutic decisions, complementing traditional diagnostic methods for improved MR management."

Veeken,"Abstract Objectives Autoantibodies represent a serological hallmark of systemic sclerosis (SSc). Heart involvement in SSc patients includes diastolic dysfunction, conduction block, pericardial effusion, altered left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF), valvular pathology, as well as myocardial inflammation and/or fibrosis. To characterize the role of anti-RNA polymerase III (RNAPIII) antibody positivity in the pathophysiology of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)-related cardiac involvement in SSc patients. Method We retrospectively analyzed four SSc patients with anti-RNAPIII antibodies who developed cardiac complications after COVID-19. This study was approved by the University of Osaka Clinical Research Review Board. Results All patients were female and had been diagnosed within the past 3 years. Case 1 presented with elevated myocardial enzymes and severe cardiac injury requiring mechanical circulatory support. The diagnosis of COVID-19-related fulminant myocarditis was made. The other three patients did not have elevated myocardial enzymes but had elevated brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) or N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) and pericardial effusion or decreased LVEF and respiratory distress, suggesting the appearance of COVID-19-induced cardiac dysfunction. Conclusion Patients with anti-RNAPIII-positive SSc may have an increased risk of developing cardiac complications after COVID-19. The pathogenesis may involve angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2)-mediated mechanisms, which may include reducing ACE2 expression, leading to increased angiotensin II activity and induce cytokine storm. These results underline the importance of understanding the interplay between autoimmune diseases and infections in promoting immune-mediated cardiac injury. Further investigation is needed to characterize the role of anti-RNAPIII antibodies in the pathophysiology of COVID-19-related cardiac involvement."

In this population, frailty, comorbidity, and functional variability significantly influence prognosis. This study evaluated short-term (30-day) and long-term (1-year) mortality predictors in elderly patients with AHF treated in the emergency department (HED), considering clinical variables, comorbidities, and precipitating factors (PFs). Materials and Methods: An observational cohort study was conducted based on a secondary analysis of older patients with AHF included in the Epidemiology of Acute Heart Failure in Emergency Departments (EAHFE) registry, treated at Hospital Universitario Marqués de Valdecilla (HUMV) between 2007 and 2022. Clinical, laboratory, and PF-related variables were collected. The primary outcome was all-cause mortality at 30 days and 1 year. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were performed. Results: A total of 548 patients were included (mean age: 80.7 years), of whom 78.6% required hospitalization, mainly in the Internal Medicine department. Mortality was 11.1% at 30 days and 29.9% at 1 year. Age, valvular heart disease, dementia, and elevated creatinine levels were independently associated with higher mortality. Hypoxemia and low-output symptoms were linked to short-term mortality, while NYHA class III and anemia were associated with long-term mortality. Among PFs, acute coronary syndrome (ACS) was related to worse short-term outcomes, whereas rapid atrial fibrillation (AF) was inversely associated with long-term mortality. Conclusions: The prognostic relevance of risk factors differs between short- and long-term outcomes in older patients with AHF. Incorporating clinical characteristics and PFs into risk stratification models may support individualized management and guide follow-up strategies tailored to the geriatric profile. This multidimensional approach is essential to improve clinical decision-making and outcomes in a highly vulnerable population."

Using a prospective multicentre cohort of patients treated for IE, we compared the performance of the 2023 ESC classification to that of 2015 ESC, 2019 European Heart Rhythm Association (EHRA) and 2023 Duke-International Society for Cardiovascular Infectious Diseases (ISCVID) classifications in patients with or without cardiac implantable electronic devices (CIEDs). Methods A total of 1180 patients treated for IE between January 2017 and October 2022 were categorised as having either definite or possible/rejected IE within each classification. The gold standard diagnosis of IE was independently adjudicated by experts as ‘certain’ or not. Definite and ‘certain’ cases of IE were cross-tabulated to calculate sensitivity, specificity and accuracy. Suspicion of lead IE was defined by specific anatomical or metabolic features of cardiac lead infection on imaging; or by pulmonary embolism without valvular vegetation; or by positive culture of a lead extracted during open-heart surgery. Results In the 269 patients with CIEDs, 208 (77.3%) were adjudicated as ‘certain IE’; 2023 Duke-ISCVID and 2023 ESC classifications achieved higher sensitivity (97.1% and 93.8%, respectively) but markedly lower specificity (31.1% and 41.0%, respectively) than 2015 ESC and 2019 EHRA classifications. In the 159 patients with CIEDs and lead IE (78.6% ‘certain IE’), while sensitivity remained high for all classifications, specificity dropped for 2023 Duke-ISCVID and 2023 ESC classifications (11.8% and 32.4%, respectively), but not for 2019 EHRA classification (67.6%). In the 911 patients without CIEDs (81.0% ‘certain IE’), sensitivity was higher than 96% for all classifications and specificity was 55.5%, 52.6% and 48.0% for 2015 ESC, 2023 Duke-ISCVID and 2023 ESC classifications, respectively. Conclusions The 2023 ESC and 2023 Duke-ISCVID classifications had a higher sensitivity but a lower specificity than the 2015 ESC classification in patients with CIEDs, especially among those with lead IE. In patients with CIEDs, the 2019 EHRA classification was the most accurate."

OpenAlex,valvular heart disease,Left ventricular false tendons as incidental findings in a case of sudden cardiac death: What is their role?,Luca Cerra; Eleonora Nardi; Giovanni Aulino; Matteo Polacco; Antonio Oliva; Vincenzo Arena,10.1016/j.jflm.2025.103025,2025-11-11,Journal of Forensic and Legal Medicine,"Sudden death (SD) can be defined as the unexpected natural death of a healthy individual occurring within the first hour after the onset of symptoms or, if death is unwitnessed, within 24 h of the victim being seen in a healthy state. In people younger than 35 yo, when the cause of SD is"" cardiac"" (sudden cardiac death-SCD), it is mainly due to cardiomyopathies and channelopathies. Among the predictors of SCD, obesity (a well-established independent risk factor for cardiovascular diseases) has been found to increase arrhythmic risk (i.e., every 5-unit increment in BMI confers a 16 % higher risk of SCD). We herein describe an autoptic case of an obese 32-year-old woman (BMI of 49.9), who was discovered deceased in her bed at home. Interestingly, at the heart examination, the presence of an abnormality in the tendon apparatus of the anterior mitral valve leaflet was observed. In fact, an accessory tendon chord connecting the apex of the leaflet to the distal third of the antero-lateral papillary muscle was found in addition to an unusual retiform appearance (""web-like"") of the whole mitral valve tendon apparatus. At histological examination of the ventricular myocardium, foci of confluent interstitial and perivascular myocardiosclerosis, along with perivascular fibrosis of coronary intramyocardial were observed. According to the literature, the valvular findings observed could plausibly account for the cause of death. In particular, a fatal arrhythmia due to the above-described tendons apparatus abnormality may developed. Nevertheless, obesity, which is a well-established risk factor for adverse cardiovascular events, may have contributed independently of the accessory chordal tendon. This case underscores the intricate interplay between the existence of left ventricular false tendons (LVFTs) and an elevated risk of ventricular tachycardia. From a speculative point of view, an LVFT may induce mechanical stretch in the interventricular septum, leading to heightened automaticity and triggering premature ventricular beats or arrhythmias. Comprehensive awareness of these structural anomalies and their morphological attributes is crucial for establishing correlations with potentially fatal arrhythmias and for formulating targeted preventive interventions."

Objectives We evaluated clinical outcomes with GLP-1 RA use post-TAVI in patients with T2D. Methods We conducted a retrospective cohort study using the TriNetX network, including 25,184 adults (≥18 years) with T2D who underwent TAVI (2015-2023). Patients were stratified based on GLP1-RA initiation within 14 days post-TAVI. Baseline characteristics, comorbidities, medications, and laboratory data were balanced using 1:1 propensity score matching (PSM). Cox models estimated hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for events from one-month post-TAVI until most recent follow-up. Results PSM yielded 1,101 patients per group, with a mean age of 73 years and 39% female. Mean follow-up duration was 2.2±1.1 and 2.6±1.8 years for GLP1-RA users and non-users, respectively. GLP1-RA use was also associated higher survival probability (HR 0.708 [95% CI, 0.583-0.859]), and lower rates of all-cause hospitalization (HR 0.790 [95% CI, 0.706-0.885]), major cardiovascular events (HR 0.849 [95% CI, 0.749-0.963]), and acute heart failure exacerbation (HR 0.785 [95% CI, 0.677-0.909]), acute kidney injury (HR 0.843 [95% CI, 0.719-0.988]), and major kidney events (HR 0.665 [95% CI, 0.510-0.866]). No differences were observed in acute myocardial infarction, cerebral infarction, or cardiac arrest. Conclusions In patients with T2D undergoing TAVI, GLP1-RA use are associated with significant survival benefits and improved cardiorenal outcomes. However, these findings are limited by the observational design, high comorbidity burden, lack of data on medication compliance and specific cause of death. Prospective trials are warranted to confirm these benefits."

Pulmonary hypertension is an important and grave hemodynamic consequence of mitral stenosis. Persistent pulmonary hypertension leads to increase right heart pressure, Right Ventricular Hypertrophy (RVH) and subsequently right heart failure. There are various electrocardiographic parameters and criteria of Right Ventricular Hypertrophy (RVH) for diagnosis of pulmonary hypertension in various disease. Different ECG parameters and criteria of Right Ventricular Hypertrophy (RVH) have different predictive value for diagnosis of pulmonary hypertension in MS patient. Echocardiography is an important non-invasive investigation for diagnosis, monitoring and selection of treatment and for prediction of mortality in MS patient. Obtaining good quality of 2D echocardiography is problematic in remote areas and they are not feasible for wide spread use due to cost and availability. So, ECG may be a guide for selecting appropriate patient for further testing. Objectives: This study was planned to identify more accurate parameters of ECG for prediction of pulmonary hypertension and Right Ventricular Hypertrophy (RVH) in patients with mitral stenosis. Methodology: This cross-sectional observational study was conducted in the Department of Cardiology, DMCH, from March 2018 to February 2019. A total of 100 patients with mitral stenosis (MS) who met the inclusion and exclusion criteria were enrolled. Detailed clinical history, physical examination, and baseline investigations were recorded for all participants. The study population was divided into two groups: Group I:MS patients without pulmonary hypertension (PASP &lt; 35 mmHg). Group II: MS patients with pulmonary hypertension (PASP ≥ 35 mmHg). A 12-lead ECG and Doppler echocardiogram were performed within 24 hours of the patient’s first contact. Fourteen different ECG parameters and criteria for right ventricular hypertrophy (RVH) were assessed. Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS version 22.0 for Windows. Results: 14 patients were found in group I and 86 patients were found in group II. Among the Group-II patents 18 patients had mild pulmonary hypertension (PASP = 35 ≤ 50 mmHg), 47 patients had moderate pulmonary hypertension (PASP = 50 ≤ 70 mmHg) and 21 patients had severe pulmonary hypertension (PASP ≥ 70 mmHg). Average age of patient in group-I: was 38.71 ± 9.6 years and average age of patients in group-II was 43.8 ± 13.1 years (p = 0.16) Sex distribution was also identical between 2 groups (p = 0.92). This study showed that among the different ECG criteria for detection of RVH in mitral stenosis patients (Which is a surrogate marker for pulmonary hypertension), only a few had good predictive value. In mild pulmonary hypertension, only R in V1 ≥ 7 mm has sensitivity (66.7%), specificity (100%), PPV (100%) and NPV (37.5%). In moderate and severe pulmonary hypertension, R in V1 ≥ 7 mm, R/S in V1 &gt; 1 andR in V1+S in V5 ≥ 10 mm had good sensitivity (60.5% and 63.2%; 65.1% and 68.4%; 53.5% and 63.2% respectively), good specificity (100% and 100%; 100% and 100%; 100% and 100% respectively), good PPV (100% and 100%; 100% and 100%; 100% and 100% respectively) and NPV (19% and 22.2%; 21.1% and 25%; 16.7% and 22.2% respectively). Conclusion: The sensitivity of the ECG parameters was as a whole low to moderate in detection of pulmonary hypertension by assessing presence of RVH. However, certain ECG criteria for RVH detection in mitral stenosis patients have acceptable predictive value only in moderate to severe pulmonary hypertension."

Studies have showed trace element concentrations varied in patients with AF and may be involved in the pathogenesis of AF. However, no data is currently available for those with VHD. Methods Urine samples as well as clinical data were collected from 72 VHD patients with AF (VHDAF) and 72 VHD patients without AF (VHD) and further analyzed for a panel of trace elements: lithium, manganese, cobalt, copper, zinc, arsenic, selenium, strontium, Cadmium, mercury, thallium, lead. Quantile g-computation was adopted to explore the joint effect of the 12 trace elements on AF in this population, and internal validation was performed using 1,000 bootstrap re-samples. Results Compared with the VHD group, Sr levels were reduced, while Mn, Cu and Hg concentrations were increased in the VHDAF group. Quantile g-computation model indicated a significant association between the mixtures of the 12 urinary trace elements and AF in patients with heart valve disease (adjusted OR: 2.051; 95% CI: 1.180–3.565; p = 0.011). Positive partial effect was owing to Cu (weight: 0.43) and Hg (weight: 0.18), while negative partial effect mainly attributed to Sr (weight: 0.43) and Li (weight: 0.23). Conclusion VHDAF patients had higher Cu levels and lower Sr levels, and the two elements have been supposed to exert the largest influence on AF. Further research is needed to establish the causal relationships."

Although the initial insult is driven by autoimmune responses triggered by Group A Streptococcus infection, the sustained progression of valvular fibrosis involves a complex interplay of persistent immune activation, chronic inflammation, and, critically, long‐term mechanical stress. Mechanical forces arising from altered hemodynamics and structural valve deformation perpetuate valvular interstitial cell activation, endothelial‐to‐mesenchymal transition, and extracellular matrix remodeling, thereby driving fibrosis even after acute inflammation resolves. Current therapeutic options to halt or reverse mitral valve fibrosis are limited, with surgical repair or replacement remaining the primary interventions for advanced disease. Advancing mechanistic understanding through physiologically relevant models, coupled with early diagnostic strategies and multitargeted antifibrotic approaches, holds promise for preserving valve function. Integrating molecular insights with scalable public health measures may ultimately mitigate the global burden of rheumatic heart disease and improve outcomes for affected populations."

This review outlines the complex interplay of traditional, transplant-specific, and recipient- and donor-related risk factors that sustain a high cardiovascular burden post-transplantation. While kidney function restoration reduces uremic toxins and improves cardiometabolic parameters, new challenges arise from immunosuppressive therapies, persistent hypertension, post-transplant diabetes mellitus, and chronic inflammation. Common cardiovascular complications include coronary artery disease, heart failure, valvular disease, peripheral artery disease, and refractory hypertension. Risk stratification tools and guidelines often fail to account for transplant-specific variables, resulting in suboptimal management. Although some pharmacological strategies and careful antihypertensive regimens show promise, most evidence is extrapolated from non-transplant populations due to the lack of dedicated randomized controlled trials. Emerging therapies like SGLT2 inhibitors, GLP-1 receptor agonists and non-steroidal mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists hold potential but require further validation in this population. Moreover, sex disparities persist in access to transplantation and in post-transplant outcomes, with men generally experiencing higher cardiovascular risk but women potentially facing greater relative mortality. The review underscores the urgent need for transplant-specific cardiovascular research, personalized therapeutic strategies including precision medicine, and greater inclusion of women in research. Optimizing cardiovascular outcomes in KTRs will require multidisciplinary collaboration, rigorous evidence generation, and an integrated approach to risk prediction, prevention, and treatment."

OpenAlex,deep learning,Zāl and Simorgh as Trickster Figures: A Mythological Reinterpretation of the Shahnameh Narratives,Tohid Teymori; Tohid Teymori,,2025-12-01,DOAJ (DOAJ: Directory of Open Access Journals),"This study examines the trickster archetype within the narrative of Zāl and Simorgh in Ferdowsi’s Shahnameh. The trickster, a mythological figure characterized by ambivalence, shape-shifting, resourcefulness, and divine intervention, occupies a significant role across various cultural traditions. Drawing upon established theoretical frameworks, this research identifies Zāl and Simorgh as a trickster within Iranian mythology. The analysis focuses on key trickster attributes—including shapeshifting, wisdom, and the capacity to disrupt and reconstitute social order. Zāl, marked by his extraordinary birth and upbringing by Simorgh, embodies a liminal identity that facilitates intervention in pivotal events. Simorgh, in turn, functions as a supernatural guide and healer, contributing to the restoration of equilibrium and the revelation of hidden truths. A close reading of the Rostam and Esfandiar episode demonstrates how Zāl and Simorgh employ cunning and esoteric knowledge to challenge oppressive power structures and institute a renewed order. This study underscores the significance of the trickster archetype in Iranian mythic traditions and elucidates the roles of Zāl and Simorgh as agents of transformation and balance within the Persian cultural discourse. Keywords: Trickster, Zāl, Simorgh, Shahnameh, Mythology. IntroductionThe trickster archetype represents one of the most significant and beloved figures in world mythology, characterized by paradoxical qualities where positive attributes typically outweigh negative ones, though this balance varies across different mythological traditions. As liminal beings existing between worlds, tricksters challenge established laws, confront deities, and disrupt social and cultural norms. While often depicted as deceiving ordinary people, tricksters more importantly challenge those in positions of power, undermining the dominion of kings, heroes, and the powerful through cunning and artifice.This study examines the trickster archetype within the narrative framework of Zāl and Simorgh in Ferdowsi’s Shahnameh, positioning these figures within the broader context of Iranian mythology. The research addresses a significant gap in Iranian mythological studies, as the trickster concept, despite its prominence in global mythology, has remained largely unexplored in Persian literary scholarship. By applying established theoretical frameworks from folklore, psychoanalysis, mythology, and anthropology, this investigation seeks to illuminate the transformative roles of Zāl and Simorgh as agents of change and balance within Persian cultural discourse. Materials and MethodsThe methodological approach employs a comprehensive theoretical framework drawing primarily from the foundational works of Paul Radin and Carl Gustav Jung on the trickster archetype. Radin’s conception of the trickster as a “culture-bringer” who facilitates societal transformation from lower to higher levels of civilization provides a crucial analytical lens. Jung’s psychological interpretation, viewing the trickster as a representation of the collective unconscious and undifferentiated human consciousness retaining its animal nature, offers complementary insights into the archetype’s enduring significance.The analysis incorporates perspectives from various scholars, including Claude Lévi-Strauss’s structural approach to mythological dualities, Joseph Campbell’s hero archetype theory, and Mary Douglas’s anthropological insights on social order disruption. The study employs close textual reading of Shahnameh, focusing particularly on key episodes including Zāl’s birth and upbringing by Simorgh, and the pivotal Rostam and Esfandiar confrontation. Comparative analysis with trickster figures from other cultural traditions—including Loki from Norse mythology, Anansi from West African folklore, Coyote from Native American traditions, and Prometheus from Greek mythology—provides cross-cultural context for understanding the unique characteristics of the Iranian trickster manifestation. Research FindingsThe investigation reveals that Zāl and Simorgh collectively embody the essential characteristics of the trickster archetype within Iranian mythology. Key findings of the study include:Extraordinary Birth and Liminal Identity: Zāl’s albinism marks him as fundamentally different from birth, leading to his abandonment and subsequent raising by Simorgh. This unusual upbringing creates a liminal identity existing between human society and the supernatural realm, a defining characteristic of trickster figures.Shape-shifting and Duality: The relationship between Zāl and Simorgh demonstrates the trickster’s capacity for transformation and dual existence. Simorgh functions as both a physical being and Zāl’s spiritual essence, while Zāl himself bridges the animal, human, and divine realms.Wisdom and Problem-solving: Zāl’s renowned wisdom, acquired through Simorgh’s tutelage and his own dedicated study, enables him to serve as advisor and mediator in critical situations. His knowledge encompasses both earthly learning and supernatural wisdom, positioning him as a crucial problem-solver in times of crisis.Shamanic Attributes: Zāl exhibits shamanic characteristics through his ability to summon Simorgh via the ritual burning of the sacred feather, accessing supernatural assistance when confronting seemingly insurmountable challenges. This shamanic connection enables intervention in the natural order when necessary.Divine Intervention and Social Transformation: In the Rostam-Esfandiar episode, Zāl and Simorgh’s intervention challenges corrupt power structures represented by Goshtasp and Esfandiar’s ambitions, ultimately facilitating a restoration of proper governance and social order. Discussion of Results and ConclusionsThe findings demonstrate that Zāl and Simorgh function as a unified trickster entity, challenging oppressive power structures while maintaining cosmic and social balance. Unlike tricksters in other traditions who often act from self-interest, the Zāl-Simorgh complex operates primarily for societal benefit, distinguishing the Iranian trickster tradition. The Rostam-Esfandiar confrontation exemplifies the trickster’s role in exposing corruption and facilitating necessary social transformation. Esfandiar’s invulnerability, granted through Zoroastrian blessing, represents a sacred power corrupted by personal ambition. Zāl and Simorgh’s intervention—revealing the secret of targeting Esfandiar’s eyes with a double-headed arrow from the gaz tree—demonstrates the trickster’s function in challenging even sacred authority when it threatens social harmony. This episode reflects broader tensions between two political paradigms: the pre-Lohrasp tradition of balanced power between royal and heroic houses, and the Lohrasp-Goshtasp model concentrating all authority in the monarchy. The trickster’s intervention supports the restoration of balanced governance, suggesting Ferdowsi’s critique of absolute monarchical power. The comparative analysis reveals both universal and culturally specific aspects of the Iranian trickster. While sharing common features with global trickster figures—liminality, shape-shifting, wisdom, and social disruption—Zāl and Simorgh demonstrate unique characteristics rooted in Persian cultural values, particularly the emphasis on wisdom (kherad) and justice (dād).This study establishes Zāl and Simorgh as a distinctive trickster manifestation within Iranian mythology, contributing significantly to the theoretical understanding of the trickster archetype. The trickster archetype plays a vital but previously unrecognized role in Iranian mythological traditions, with Zāl and Simorgh embodying this function through their combined attributes and interventions. The Iranian trickster tradition emphasizes wisdom, justice, and societal benefit over the self-interested cunning often associated with tricksters in other cultures, reflecting core Persian cultural values. The Zāl-Simorgh complex serves as a mechanism for critiquing and transforming unjust power structures, particularly relevant to Ferdowsi’s historical context and his concerns about tyrannical rule. Recognition of the trickster pattern in Shahnameh opens new avenues for comparative mythological studies and a deeper understanding of Persian literary traditions. The study’s findings have implications beyond literary analysis, offering insights into mechanisms of cultural resistance, identity formation, and social transformation relevant to contemporary Iranian society. This research advances scholarship in Iranian mythology, comparative literature, and archetypal studies while demonstrating the continued relevance of ancient mythological patterns for understanding cultural dynamics and social change. Future research might explore trickster manifestations in other Persian literary works and examine the archetype’s evolution in modern Iranian literature and culture."

OpenAlex,deep learning,A Review on Efficient Trust Computational and Evaluation Based on Machine Learning,Dr Anil Kumar,,2025-11-30,Zenodo (CERN European Organization for Nuclear Research),"&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract:&lt;/strong&gt; These days, machine learning (ML) models are used across many complex fields, including bioinformatics, medicine, and other disciplines. Their black-box nature, however, may make it difficult to understand and trust the outcomes they provide. As a result, there is now a greater need for trustworthy visualisation tools to promote confidence in machine learning models. This topic has gained popularity in the visualisation community over the past few decades. To offer an overview of current research on the subject, as well as the frontiers of that study. The Internet of Things (IoT) enables billions of objects, in both physical and virtual contexts, to intelligently communicate with one another. Smartphones, for example, have evolved into valuable personal assistants and an integral part of people's daily lives and work. Machine learning, such as reinforcement learning and deep learning, is increasingly commonly used in IoT to improve performance and efficiency. Machine learning, on the other hand, has several flaws that could jeopardise the security, trust, and privacy of IoT environments. One of the most serious threats is adversarial learning, in which attackers try to trick the learning algorithm with carefully crafted training examples, leading to incorrect outputs. This Special Issue will feature cutting-edge research from academia and industry, with a focus on debates over the security, trust, and privacy issues in machine learning-based IoT.&lt;/p&gt;"
OpenAlex,deep learning,"Fruit Plant Recognition and Classification from Plant Leaves using Deep Learning, CNN Models",Ajahar Ismailkha Pathan,,2025-11-30,Zenodo (CERN European Organization for Nuclear Research),"&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract: &lt;/strong&gt;Plants are an integral part of human life, and the ability to identify a fruit plant from its leaf image is both fascinating and challenging.

OpenAlex,deep learning,A Framework for the Prediction of Eye Diseases using Deep Learning Models,Dr. Jagannibas Paul Choudhury,,2025-11-30,Zenodo (CERN European Organization for Nuclear Research),"&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract:&lt;/strong&gt; Artificial Intelligence (AI) has significantly enhanced various aspects of our lives, providing practical solutions to complex problems and narrowing the gap between real-world challenges and business needs. Within the realm of AI, innovative technologies such as machine learning and deep learning have revolutionised the way we analyse data, make informed decisions, and respond to complex situations, all with the goal of understanding and resolving them efficiently. As data generation and storage continue to expand rapidly, these technologies have become essential in managing data analytics, storage systems, and decision-making frameworks. Through digital transformation, industries are being reshaped, and global services&mdash;especially in fields such as healthcare&mdash;are being enhanced to improve the quality of human life. The eye is considered the most important sensory organ for humans, playing a vital role in their overall ability to interact with the world. Unfortunately, many individuals in both rural and urban areas suffer from eye conditions such as cataracts, glaucoma, ocular hypertension, bulgy vision, etc., that affect their vision. There are various causes, including age, diabetes, and genetic and hereditary factors. Modern lifestyles, which have led to increased use of displays for digital devices, are also a factor affecting vision. This study aims to develop a predictive model for vision-related diseases by leveraging medical data and analyzing the influence of various contributing factors using deep learning methodologies. Early detection of eye conditions is crucial to prevent serious complications, as timely diagnosis plays a vital role in ensuring effective treatment. Conducting thorough assessments to identify potential indicators of eye diseases is highly encouraged. Deep learning and artificial intelligence (AI) significantly enhance the ability to detect these illnesses at an early stage. The purpose of this research is to lay the foundation for discovering a robust and adaptable solution. Specifically, the study focuses on reviewing the classification of eye diseases using advanced deep learning models, such as Custom CNN (Convolutional Neural Network), VGG16, ResNet, InceptionV3, GoogleNet, EfficientNet B2, MobileNet, and DenseNet 121. The proposed classification framework follows a series of steps: initially, it involves gathering widely accessible datasets related to eye diseases and performing data preprocessing to ensure consistent experimental conditions. The primary objective is to train the model to accurately identify symptoms of eye diseases, rather than optimizing for a narrow subset of data. Given the success of deep learning in image classification and object recognition tasks, the research emphasizes these modern techniques over conventional handcrafted approaches.&lt;/p&gt;"

An applied research design was used to build a robust fraud detection framework. A dataset of 20,000 health insurance claims was obtained from a supplementary insurance provider, containing both legitimate and fraudulent cases. Raw relational tables — including policy, insured individuals, claims, disease registry, and branch information — were merged into a single structured dataset using SQL. Rigorous data preprocessing was performed: irrelevant variables were removed, highly correlated features were eliminated through correlation analysis, dimensionality reduction was applied via Principal Component Analysis (PCA), and extreme outliers were excluded using the interquartile range (IQR) method. All numerical features were standardized, and class imbalance was addressed by weighting fraudulent cases during training. The processed data were reshaped into sequences suitable for LSTM input and divided into training and testing sets. An LSTM model with 32 hidden units and a Sigmoid output layer was trained using the Adam optimizer and binary cross-entropy loss, with performance validated through k-fold cross-validation. The LSTM model achieved outstanding predictive performance, with an overall accuracy of 100% on the test dataset. Both fraudulent and non-fraudulent claims reached perfect precision, recall, and F1-scores. Macro and weighted averages also recorded 1.00 across all metrics, indicating the model’s ability to detect rare fraudulent events without sacrificing specificity. By combining advanced deep learning with systematic data preparation and domain-informed feature engineering, the proposed LSTM framework effectively identified complex fraud patterns in supplementary health insurance. This approach offers a scalable and reliable solution to strengthen fraud risk management and reduce financial losses in the insurance sector."

OpenAlex,deep learning,Will multimodal large language models ever achieve deep understanding of the world?,Igor Farkaš; Michal Vavrecka; Stefan Wermter,10.3389/fnsys.2025.1683133,2025-11-17,Frontiers in Systems Neuroscience,"Despite impressive performance in various tasks, large language models (LLMs) are subject to the symbol grounding problem, so from the cognitive science perspective, one can argue that they are merely statistics-driven distributional models without a deeper understanding. Modern multimodal versions of LLMs (MLLMs) are trying to avoid this problem by linking language knowledge with other modalities such as vision (Vision Language Models called VLM) or action (Vision Language Action Models called VLA) when, for instance, a robotic agent, is acting in the world. If eventually successful, MLLMs could be taken as pathway for symbol grounding. In this work, we explore the extent to which MLLMs integrated with embodied agents can achieve such grounded understanding through interaction with the physical world. We argue that closing the gap between symbolic tokens, neural representations, and embodied experience will require deeper developmental integration of continuous sensory data, goal-directed behavior, and adaptive neural learning in real-world environments. We raise a concern that MLLMs do not currently achieve a human-like level of deep understanding, largely because their random learning trajectory deviates significantly from human cognitive development. Humans typically acquire knowledge incrementally, building complex concepts upon simpler ones in a structured developmental progression. In contrast, MLLMs are often trained on vast, randomly ordered datasets. This non-developmental approach, which circumvents a structured simple-to-complex conceptual scaffolding, inhibits the ability to build a deep and meaningful grounded knowledge base, posing a significant challenge to achieving human-like semantic comprehension."

To In order to tackle these issues, this piece presents a web-based application that predicts DTIs and illustrates molecular information. The system takes drug samples and protein sequences as input and outputs molecular formula, predicted activity status with probabilities, and molecular structure visualization. Including ML and DL models, the application enables comparative evaluation of different algorithms, highlighting their strengths and limitations in order to identify most effective approach for DTI prediction. This project's primary purpose is to create reliable models for DL and ML that can precisely determine whether a medication and protein combination is active or inert. Because of this, it is feasible to forecast drug-target interactions with accuracy. Data on drug-protein interactions was acquired from ChEMBL then was pre- processed and represented using SMILES, molecular fingerprints, and ProtBERT embeddings. Multiple ML and DL models (RF, SVM, KNN, Decision Trees, Logistic Regression, Naïve Bayes, CNN, RNN) were trained, and their performance was reviewed using accuracy, precision, recall, and ROC-AUC to determine the most effective approach. Logistic Regression achieved highest performance with the highest accuracy of 96% which outperformed several deep learning approaches on this dataset, however deep learning retains advantage of automatic feature learning and may surpass machine learning when larger and more dataset available. This dual evaluation confirms our hypothesis on both sides in a much more robust way. This comparison provides hands-on experience on benefits and drawbacks of the two approaches"

Drawing on panel data from 30 provinces (2010–2023), the framework integrates dynamic efficiency modeling, spatial–temporal analysis, deep learning prediction, and model interpretability. The findings reveal: (1) EETE remains low overall, with pronounced interregional disparities. Resource utilization efficiency generally exceeds environmental governance efficiency, with provinces like Guangdong showing marked imbalance between the two stages. (2) While both stages demonstrate an upward trend, regional gaps continue to widen. Resource utilization efficiency steadily improves, but with intensifying structural divergence, whereas environmental governance efficiency lags behind and displays clear polarization. The eastern region maintains a leading position across both stages due to its superior capacity in resource allocation and coordinated governance. (3) A hybrid CNN–LSTM–Attention model delivers high predictive accuracy, projecting continuous improvement in EETE through 2035, although spatial imbalances persist. (4) SHAP-based interpretation identifies urbanization, industrial upgrading, and digital infrastructure as key drivers, while inefficiencies in green finance allocation and underutilized ecological endowments remain critical constraints. By providing a full-period, integrated assessment from historical patterns to future trajectories, this study advances the methodological frontier of EETE research and informs region-specific strategies for long-term resource coordination and adaptive environmental governance under uncertainty."
