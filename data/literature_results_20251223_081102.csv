The Sorin Soprano aortic bioprosthetic valve (Sorin Group/LivaNova, Milan, Italy) lacks reported long-term results. This study aims to establish the long-term durability of this bioprosthetic valve in a nationwide cohort.
All patients having received the Soprano bioprosthesis during aortic valve replacement in Sweden between 2005 and 2013 were included in the study. Patient characteristics, outcomes, and echocardiographic data were collected using national registries and electronic medical records. Standardized guidelines were used to assess echocardiographic data for the presence of severe structural valve deterioration.
A total of 1054 patients (mean age 73.3 years) were included, with 14.0% being ≤65 years at surgery. The Soprano bioprosthesis represented 9.5% of all implanted bioprostheses. During a mean follow-up of 8.6 ± 4.5 years, 206 patients (19.5%) developed severe structural valve deterioration. The cumulative incidence of severe structural valve deterioration at 1-, 5-, 7-, 10-, and 15 years was 0.5%, 3.1%, 7.4%, 13.7%, and 22.1% in the overall population. The cumulative incidence of structural valve deterioration-related reinterventions at 1-, 5-, 7-, 10-, and 15 years was 0%, 0.9%, 3.0%, 7.2%, and 11.5%. The 30-day mortality rate was 3.8%.
The Soprano bioprosthesis demonstrates high long-term rates of severe structural valve deterioration and deterioration-related reinterventions. These findings suggest the need for increased clinical vigilance and for more frequent echocardiographic monitoring in patients having received this bioprosthetic valve."

She was referred to our hospital to treat atrial fibrillation. Echocardiography at the initial visit incidentally revealed mitral annular calcification (MAC) involving the posterior mitral leaflet and mobile mass attached to this MAC. The high intensity echogenic mobile mass extended from the sub-valvular tissue to the papillary tendon. The differential diagnosis of this mass included a caseous calcification of the mitral annulus (CCMA), and intra-cardiac thrombus or tumor. Computed tomography imaging features were consistent with CCMA. Anticoagulation was administered for one month to rule out thrombus and to prevent systemic thromboembolism. The size of this mobile mass did not change but the severity of mitral regurgitation worsened from mild to moderate during the month. Surgical treatment was performed to prevent thromboembolism and treat mitral regurgitation. A biological mitral valve and tricuspid annular ring were implanted. The histopathologic examination of the excised mobile mass revealed fibrinous material with calcification. We report a case of CCMA that appeared in a short period of time, and the attached mobile mass was suggested to be the contents of CCMA.

We report a 18-year-old woman who presented in 2024 to a tertiary cardiac care centre in Muscat, Oman, with a history of anterolateral accessory pathway ablation who developed burning chest pain after stress. Transthoracic echocardiography revealed generalised left ventricular hypertrophy with maximal thickness in the infero-lateral wall with mid-cavity obstruction. The symptoms necessitated bisoprolol and disopyramide treatment. As there was an increased risk of sudden cardiac death due to left ventricular wall thickness of more than 30 mm and presence of excessive scarring on magnetic resonance imaging, an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator was placed. Failure of medical therapy led to a myectomy referral. Genetic testing identified a rare Titin gene mutation linked to her cardiomyopathy."

Previous studies in a mouse model of BTHS, secondary to knockdown of Tafazzin (TazKD mice), also observed perturbations in mitochondrial substrate metabolism and a hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. BTHS may be characterized by increased cardiac ketone metabolism, as myocardial protein expression of the ketolytic enzyme, β-hydroxybutyrate dehydrogenase 1 (BDH1), was markedly increased in TazKD mice. We therefore determined whether increasing ketone supply in TazKD mice may have therapeutic utility against their cardiac abnormalities.
We treated TazKD mice and their wild-type littermates with either the sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitor, empagliflozin (10 mg/kg), or a ketone ester (KE; 1719 mg/kg) once daily for 7-week, and performed ultrasound echocardiography to assess cardiac structure and function.
Treatment of TazKD mice with either empagliflozin or a KE increased circulating ketone levels. However, neither approach proved capable of alleviating the cardiac hypertrophy present in TazKD mice, as their increased left ventricular wall thickness and decreased left ventricular diameter remained comparable to that observed in vehicle control treated animals. We also observed that empagliflozin and KE treatment did not impact key markers of cardiac hypertrophy in TazKD mice.
Increasing circulating ketone levels did not alleviate the cardiac hypertrophy in TazKD mice, suggesting that such an approach would not improve outcomes in BTHS."

Observational studies and a small openlabel randomized trial have reported that vitamin K1 supplementation may reduce the progression rate of calcification and obstruction in CAS.
3PASSPORT(ACTRN12622000447752) will be a prospective, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial investigating if nutritional supplementation with 10 mg of vitamin K1 can reduce the rate of valvular calcification and haemodynamic progression in CAS. Patients identified to have mild or moderate CAS based on standard echocardiographic criteria will be randomized 1:1 to vitamin K1 10 mg per day or matched placebo, and followed-up for a mean period of 16 months, ranging from 12 to 21 months. The primary endpoint will be the difference in aortic valve calcification volume, measured by computed tomography aortic valve calcium score, from baseline to follow-up, and secondary endpoints will include the change in echocardiographic progression of CAS, including peak flow velocity, mean pressure gradient, and aortic valve area. The trial is registered with the Australian New Zealand. Clinical Trials Registry (ACTRN12622000447752). The trial has met its recruitment target of 108 participants.
PASSPORT will be prospective, randomized, double-blind clinical trial powered to demonstrate if oral supplementation with vitamin K1 reduces the progression of valvular calcification and echocardiographic severity of disease in patients with non-severe CAS. The trial results will have implications for the management of CAS, for which there is currently no medical treatment."

Since its inception in 2002, TAVR has significantly transformed the management of aortic stenosis. The treatment for TAVR procedural and device failures varies depending on the specific cause of failure. As the number of TAVR procedures increases, particularly in individuals aged 70 or younger, it is likely that we will see a rise in the number of patients needing further treatment due to degeneration of the transcatheter heart valve. Although TAVR has proved to be safe and effective, structural valve deterioration is inevitable. Even though TAVR has shown promising data of low structural valve deterioration rates up to 6 years from various clinical trials and up to 10 years in isolated series, the majority of these patients were older. But, reintervention after TAVR seems unavoidable. It may need reintervention with a second TAVR valve, or it may require surgical TAVR-explant and subsequent surgical aortic valve replacement. Also, a third option in the form of a hybrid technique, is available now. Thus, the selection of patients is crucial in choosing the appropriate initial management as it can have long-term repercussions."

This study evaluates long-term outcomes of functional TR in TAVR patients.
All patients undergoing TAVR at a single institution from 2011-2022 with complete pre- and post-TAVR echocardiogram follow-up were stratified by pre-procedure TR grade (none, mild, moderate, or severe). Primary outcomes were TR improvement or persistence/progression, and long-term survival. Time-to-event analysis and Cox proportional hazards models were used to compare long-term mortality. Median time to most recent post-TAVR echocardiogram was 12 months, and median clinical follow-up was 24 months.
Of 1,668 TAVR patients in the study cohort, 55% (925) had TR of any severity. TR persisted in 70% of these patients though few ever underwent later TR intervention. Moderate-severe TR was found in 20% (331) patients and persisted or worsened in 47% of cases. Moderate-severe TR was associated with worse unadjusted median survival when compared to patients with no-mild TR (median survival 39 vs. 62 months, p<0.001). Adjusting for age, sex, surgical risk, and other non-cardiac and cardiac comorbidities including mitral regurgitation, moderate-to-severe TR was an independent predictor of worse survival (HR 1.39, p=0.004, Figure 1).
Degree of tricuspid regurgitation is unlikely to improve following TAVR. Moderate-severe TR was a predictor of worse long-term survival. The presence of concurrent moderate or severe TR should be considered when deciding between transcatheter and surgical approaches."

The CAPRI score previously showed promising results in predicting 1-year all-cause mortality, by combining manually measured thoracic aortic calcium (TAC) volume with clinical risk factors. This study introduces an enhanced CAPRI score (eCAPRI), which automates TAC volume measurement and incorporates additional automatically extracted biomarkers from pre-operative CT scans.
TAC volume extraction was automated using a deep learning model trained on 66 patients and evaluated on 1111 CT scans. Additional automatically extracted imaging biomarkers were incorporated into the eCAPRI score, following the original methodology for biomarker selection. The eCAPRI score was trained on 765 pre-TAVI CT scans for one-year mortality prediction and then compared to CAPRI and EuroSCORE Logistic using AUC, bootstrap tests, and calibration curves on 192 CT scans.
Automated TAC segmentation achieved a mean Dice score of 0.777 ± 0.108. The eCAPRI score included body surface area (BSA)-indexed right ventricle volume, BSA-indexed pulmonary arteries max diameter, and abdominal muscles surface at L3 level in addition to automatically computed TAC volume and clinical biomarkers previously identified in the CAPRI score. On the evaluation dataset, eCAPRI showed an AUC of 0.731, outperforming CAPRI (AUC = 0.669) and EuroSCORE Logistic (AUC = 0.588) significantly (p = 0.034), with better calibration.
The eCAPRI score, combining fully automated TAC volume extraction and additional imaging biomarkers, improved one-year mortality prediction over CAPRI and EuroSCORE Logistic. It may support standardized risk stratification in TAVI patients.
Question Can an eCAPRI using imaging biomarkers from pre-operative CT scans improve the prediction of one-year mortality in patients undergoing transcatheter aortic valve replacement? Findings The eCAPRI score, integrating automated TAC volume and additional biomarkers, outperformed CAPRI and EuroSCORE Logistic in predicting one-year mortality (AUC = 0.731, p = 0.034). Clinical relevance The eCAPRI score provides a standardized approach to mortality risk assessment in transcatheter valve procedures. By improving prediction accuracy, it supports more informed clinical decisions and personalized care planning, ultimately contributing to better outcomes for patients undergoing TAVI."

Atypical forms (such as duplications, vascular rings, or functional obstructions) lie outside standard classifications and they are very uncommon. These variants can confound diagnosis and require adapted strategies.
We retrospectively reviewed 43 EA cases (2018-2021) and identified three with atypical anatomic or functional presentations. Clinical, radiologic, and endoscopic findings were analyzed. Each case demanded a bespoke diagnostic and surgical plan.
Case 1: A neonate with EA/TEF had a long esophageal duplication with an internal septum. The septum was divided and the esophagus anastomosed; although the repair was intact, the infant later died from aspiration pneumonia. Case 2: EA repair was complicated by a right aortic arch (≈6 % of EA/TEF patients). We tunneled the distal esophagus behind the arch for a thoracoscopic anastomosis. A mild stricture was dilated, and the infant tolerated full feeds. Case 3: Initial imaging suggested EA, but endoscopy showed a continuous but narrowed esophagus (likely a motility disorder). Tube feeding led to normalization by 1 month, avoiding surgery. Two infants survived with good feeding outcomes.
These cases (≈7 % of our EA cohort) illustrate that atypical EA variants require individualized management. Detailed imaging and endoscopy were critical to identify unusual anatomy. Tailored thoracoscopic techniques (such as septum resection and retro-arch anastomosis) restored continuity in two infants, while recognizing a motility obstruction in the third obviated surgery. Awareness of atypical anatomy is essential to improve outcomes.

Fractional flow reserve (FFR) may improve the identification of ischaemia-producing lesions compared to angiographic assessment alone, but data in the TAVI population are lacking.
In this multicentric, open-label, randomized, superiority trial with blind adjudication of adverse events, patients with aortic stenosis and intermediate coronary lesions undergoing TAVI were randomized 1:1 to FFR-guided or angiography-guided percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). The trial was registered at ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT03360591). All randomized patients were included in the primary analysis according to the intention-to-treat principle. The primary endpoint was a major adverse cardiac and cerebrovascular event (MACCE) at 12 months of follow-up, defined as a composite of all-cause death, myocardial infarction, ischaemia-driven target vessel revascularization, disabling stroke, or major bleeding.
A total of 320 patients were enrolled across 15 Italian centres. The median age of the patients was 86 years [interquartile range (IQR) 83-90], and the median STS score was 3% (IQR 2-5). The median SYNTAX score was 7 (IQR 5-11). FFR-guided PCI was associated with a significantly lower rate of MACCE at 12 months compared with angiography-guided PCI (8.5% vs 16.0%; hazard ratio .52; 95% confidence interval .27-.99; P = .047). The difference in the primary endpoint was primarily driven by a reduction in all-cause mortality (hazard ratio .31; 95% confidence interval .10-.96). Other components of the composite were numerically lower but not statistically significant.
In patients undergoing TAVI with intermediate coronary lesions, FFR-guided PCI was associated with a reduced risk of MACCE at 12 months. These findings support a physiology-based revascularization strategy in this frail, elderly population."
PubMed,aortic stenosis,Hemodynamic Analysis of Non-uniformly Calcified Aortic Valve Using a Partitioned Fluid-Structure Interaction Framework.,Mishal Raza-Taimuri; Ian Y Chen; Hamid Sadat,10.1007/s13239-025-00811-z,2025-12-19,Cardiovascular engineering and technology,"Calcific Aortic Valve Disease (CAVD) is a common cause for aortic stenosis characterized by the progressive calcification and stiffening of the aortic valve, often leading to significant hemodynamic changes and impaired cardiac function. Several Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulations have been conducted in the literature to provide more detailed analysis of CAVD, but are mainly reliant on uniform calcification. Also, outcomes from current clinical diagnostic techniques do not account for the effect of non-uniform calcification. The purpose of this study is to extend previous CFD simulations to non-uniformly calcified aortic valves and to evaluate the accuracy of clinical diagnostic methods under these conditions.
High-fidelity simulations of non-uniformly calcified aortic valves are performed by coupling fluid and solid solvers using a partitioned fluid-structure interaction (FSI) method for a patient-specific valve model extracted from computed tomography (CT) images. Non-uniform calcification is modelled by varying the elasticity along the leaflet, with several levels of calcification ranging from mild to severe.
Non-uniform calcification alters flow physics, leading in up to 35-50% increase in maximum jet velocity and up to 150-170% rise in TPG compared to the normal valve, significant vortex shedding, extended flow separation regions, and intensified wall shear stress (WSS) fluctuations, especially on the ventricular side of the leaflet. The results indicate that the severity of calcification cannot be accurately predicted by several clinical diagnostic methods, with only effective orifice area (EOA) and maximum opening ratio (MOR) emerging as the reliable predictors.
The progression of non-uniform calcification on the aortic valve leaflets significantly impacts both hemodynamics and leaflet mechanics, with clear alterations in flow patterns and biomechanical responses as calcification severity increases. These findings highlight the need for more accurate diagnostic techniques and may drive the development of improved clinical strategies for the management and treatment of CAVD."

TAVI's total cost was significantly higher than SAVR's (R$ 55,750.90 [52,345.30; 92,286.80] vs R$ 22,518.10 [19,130.60; 25,875.10, - p<0.001]).
In this study, TAVI displayed similar clinical outcomes compared to SAVR, while being performed on older patients with higher surgical risk. From an economic perspective, costs of TAVI treatment were significantly higher than SAVR, driven mainly by device costs, while in-hospital length of stay was significantly lower. With extended follow-up and reduced procedural costs, TAVI may become a cost-effective option in the SUS."

This retrospective study included 67 individuals who underwent isolated, elective mitral valve repair with neochordae between 2019 and 2024. Participants were divided into the RAFF (n = 36) and non-RAFF (n = 31) groups. In the RAFF technique, chordal length is determined by referencing the anterior leaflet chordae from the ipsilateral papillary muscle, with loop sets anchored to the frontal head of the papillary muscle. Leaflet resection was not performed in any case. Baseline demographics and lesion characteristics were similar between groups. The RAFF group demonstrated significantly less residual mitral regurgitation at the conclusion of surgery (p = 0.014). Use of the RAFF method was significantly associated with suppression of postoperative leaflet billowing and a lower recurrence rate of moderate or greater mitral regurgitation during follow-up. Frontal fixation of posterior leaflet neochordae, a defining feature of the technique, resulted in a significant increase in coaptation length without inducing systolic anterior motion or elevating transvalvular gradients. The method also significantly reduced aortic cross-clamp time without compromising hemodynamic performance. The RAFF technique offers a standardized and anatomically guided approach to neochordae reconstruction. It minimizes inter-surgeon variability and anatomical inconsistencies, and promotes durable mitral competence by optimizing leaflet coaptation without incurring adverse events."

In both cases, Cardiac Magnetic Resonance (CMR) clarified shunt anatomy and informed management decisions. The first patient underwent successful percutaneous closure under Digital Subtraction Angiography (DSA), while the second received conservative follow-up due to the absence of symptoms.

A recent Cardiothoracic Surgical Trials Network trial demonstrated a reduction in tricuspid regurgitation with concomitant TA, with no mortality or quality of life benefit and a significantly higher risk of permanent pacemaker placement. We sought to quantify the rate of TA in eligible patients after publication of these trial results.
Using a regional collaborative, we identified all patients between 2017 and 2023 with degenerative mitral regurgitation undergoing mitral valve repair or replacement. We included only those patients with moderate tricuspid regurgitation. Those with endocarditis, primary tricuspid regurgitation, severe tricuspid regurgitation, or an undocumented degree of tricuspid regurgitation were excluded. Our time event was the trial publication date. A 1-month washout period before and after the time of publication was used to account for change in surgeon practice.
We identified 204 patients who met inclusion criteria, with 57 patients (27.9%) undergoing surgery in the posttrial period. The rate of tricuspid repair in the pretrial group was 45.6% compared with 26.3% in the posttrial group (P = .01). Baseline demographics and comorbidities between the groups were similar. All postoperative outcomes, including operative mortality, were similar (P > .05).

Given the lack of contemporary data, we examined trends in utilization and outcomes after isolated and concomitant TV operations.
Adults undergoing TV repair/replacement were identified in the 2016-2021 National Inpatient Sample. Patients undergoing heart transplantation, ventricular assist device placement, or with endocarditis were excluded. Study cohorts were stratified based on Isolated vs concomitant TV surgery (TV-Mitral, TV-Aortic, TV-coronary artery bypass grafting [CABG]). Multivariable mixed regressions were developed to evaluate the association of concomitant surgery with major adverse events including mortality and complications, costs, and length of stay.
Of 51,940 patients, 19.2% underwent Isolated TV, 47.2% TV-Mitral, 14.6% TV-Aortic, and 19.0% TV-CABG operations. The volume of Isolated TV procedures significantly increased from 1415 in 2016 to 1830 in 2021 (P = .001). Compared with Isolated TV, patients undergoing concomitant operations were older with greater burden of comorbidities. TV-CABG and TV-Aortic patients experienced higher major adverse event rates of 67.6% and 56.5%, respectively, compared with 46.1% and 50.1% among TV-Mitral and Isolated TV (P < .001). Furthermore, TV-CABG and TV-Aortic cohorts experienced greater length of stay, costs, and nonhome discharge relative to TV-Mitral and Isolated TV, which were comparable. After adjustment, major adverse event rates significantly decreased over time among TV-CABG and remained stable among all other groups.
Utilization of isolated tricuspid surgery is rising, with comparable complications and resource use relative to concomitant mitral operations. Given the lack of improvement in postoperative morbidity over time, further optimization of tricuspid surgical timing is warranted."

Linezolid, an oxazolidinone antibiotic, is used to treat severe infections caused by Gram-positive bacteria. A fatal drug interaction of linezolid and warfarin was reported in this case, highlighting the close monitoring of international normalized ratio (INR) when co-administering these drugs.
A 62-year-old female with severe mitral stenosis (MS) and moderate mitral regurgitation (MR) was diagnosed with mitral valve vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus (VRE) infective endocarditis (IE) (the diagnosis was made based on clinical presentation, positive blood cultures, and echocardiographic evidence fulfilling the modified Duke criteria) AF, and acute kidney injury (AKI). The AKI was resolved during the hospital stay. The patient was on the valvular surgery list and was discharged on oral linezolid and warfarin. The patient was on follow-up compliance with restricted diet through INR online services, and INR was also monitored through the well-established INR clinic. Ten days postdischarge, she presented with worsening dyspnea, bruising, hematuria, abdominal distension, and bilateral leg swelling. On admission, she was on rapid AF, severe metabolic acidosis, hyperkalemia, and coagulopathy (INR 12). Given her adherence to warfarin and the absence of other interacting factors, the coagulopathy was suspected to be due to a warfarin-linezolid interaction. Despite management with IV vitamin K and fresh frozen plasma (FFP), she developed refractory AKI, hyperkalemia, and multiorgan failure, leading to death.
This case highlights the potential for severe coagulopathy when warfarin and linezolid are co-administered and underscores the importance of close and frequent INR monitoring."

However, limited data is currently available in pediatric population, partially due to increased technical challenges in this subgroup of patients.
From December 2018 through December 2024, 63 patients with oHCM aged 5 to 18 years underwent conventional septal myectomy (CSM, n=28) or transapical beating-heart septal myectomy (TA-BSM, n=35). All patients had clinical and multimodality imaging evaluations before operation and at follow-up.
Two groups of patients had largely similar baseline clinical characteristics. The median age of patients was 14 (IQR: 11-16) years, and 18 of them (28.6%) were female. The median preoperative left ventricular outflow tract (LVOT) gradient was 58 (IQR: 32-85) mmHg. Around 55.6% of the patients had more than moderate mitral regurgitation (MR, CSM n=12, TA-BSM n=23). Both approaches demonstrated equivalent efficacy for eliminating LVOT obstruction, with a median postoperative LVOT gradient of 8 and 10 mmHg (p=0.852) in the CSM and TA-BSM groups, respectively. The degree of MR decreased to ≤ mild upon follow-up in 9 (75% of 12) in the CSM group, and 20 (87% of 23) in the TA-BSM group (p=0.223). Compared to those in the CSM group, patients in the TA-BSM group experienced shorter durations of surgery (1.0 vs 5.5 hours, p<0.001), mechanical ventilation (3.6 vs 20.5 hours, p<0.001), and ICU stay (23.2 vs 56.5 hours, p=0.001), with less 24-hour drain outputs (100 vs 250 mL, p<0.001). The median weight of resected myocardium was much greater following TA-BSM than that in the CSM group (p=0.013). Two post-CSM patients received permanent pacemaker implantation due to atrioventricular block. One patient required intraoperative thoracoscopic mitral repair due to mitral chordae tendineae fracture during TA-BSM and was discharged from hospital in normal condition. No 30-day mortality or septal perforation occurred in either group of patients.
TA-BSM is a simple, safe, and effective septal reduction treatment for pediatrics with oHCM. Compared with CSM, reduced surgical trauma in the TA-BSM group led to quicker postoperative rehabilitation and recovery. More importantly, with real-time transesophageal echocardiographic guidance and evaluation, the TA-BSM approach can help to overcome the technical difficulties posed by a narrowed transaortic exposure in CSM in pediatric patients."

VWD is the most common inherited bleeding disorder, significantly complicating surgical procedures due to impaired hemostasis. Surgical treatment of patients with VWD, particularly in the context of cardiovascular surgery involving CPB, requires an individualized approach. This includes the optimization of von Willebrand factor (vWF) and factor VIII (FVIII) levels, which are critical to preventing perioperative bleeding. The article describes the perioperative anesthetic management of the patient, emphasizing the importance of hemostasis monitoring, an individualized approach, and personalized dosing of replacement therapy to ensure effective treatment and minimize the risk of bleeding and thromboembolic complications.
A 36-year-old male (181 cm, 92 kg) with type 2 von Willebrand disease and a history of childhood cardiac surgery (atrial septal defect repair, right ventricular outflow tract reconstruction) was admitted for elective aortic valve replacement with a bioprosthesis due to severe aortic regurgitation. Echocardiography revealed residual ventricular septal defect shunting, aortic root dilation, moderate mitral regurgitation, and cusp prolapse. The patient had a significant bleeding history and laboratory evidence of low vWF antigen/activity and FVIII deficiency. Perioperative management included ultrasound-guided vascular access, balanced general anesthesia, moderate hypothermic cardiopulmonary bypass, antifibrinolytic therapy, and tailored hemostatic replacement with vWF concentrate, FVIII, cryoprecipitate, platelets, and plasma. The patient was extubated 6 h after surgery, required minimal transfusion support, and recovered without hemorrhagic or thromboembolic complications. He was discharged on postoperative day 10 in good condition.
Proper management of the perioperative period is identified as a complex challenge for anesthesiologists, requiring a clear understanding of therapeutic mechanisms and their impact on coagulation."

Surgical sponges remain the most frequently retained items, with gauze marker strand retention being an uncommon mechanism.
A 69-year-old male with severe mitral regurgitation and triple-vessel coronary artery disease underwent mitral valve replacement with coronary artery bypass grafting. All surgical counts were verified as correct at the conclusion of surgery. Postoperative chest radiography, however, revealed two linear radio-opaque foreign bodies near the left lower sternum. Mediastinal re-exploration identified two radio-opaque strands, measuring 3.0 cm and 2.0 cm, attached to the left lower chest wall near the internal mammary artery stump. These were confirmed to be detached marker strands from Raytec gauzes. The patient's recovery was uneventful and he was discharged well.
This case illustrates that retained gauze fragments can occur despite correct counts due to fragmentation of radiopaque markers. Surgeons and operating room nurses should inspect gauzes for integrity, maintain vigilance when manipulating sponges in confined operative fields, and consider adjunct technologies such as radiofrequency or barcode tracking. In high-risk surgeries, postoperative imaging may be warranted even with accurate counts to ensure patient safety."

Although the disease most commonly affects the respiratory and lymphatic systems, extrapulmonary manifestations involving the brain and heart also occur. Neurosarcoidosis may cause dysfunction of the cranial nerves, meninges, peripheral nerves, or the pituitary system. Cardiac sarcoidosis may lead to arrhythmias, cardiomyopathy, or heart failure. These specific diagnoses can be challenging because they may masquerade as isolated pathologies. In this clinical vignette, we present a rare case of systemic sarcoidosis with concomitant neurological and cardiac involvement. CASE REPORT A woman in her late 50s with a history of bilateral anterior uveitis presented with stroke-like symptoms. Initial workup was negative for stroke, but imaging identified a prevascular mediastinal lymph node and moderate mitral regurgitation. Lumbar puncture results were consistent with neurosarcoidosis, and steroids initiation led to symptom improvement. The patient subsequently exhibited non-sustained ventricular tachycardia, and further investigation revealed findings consistent with cardiac sarcoidosis. An implantable cardioverter-defibrillator was placed. The patient continued steroids and immunosuppressive therapy with favorable results. CONCLUSIONS Diagnosis of systemic sarcoidosis can be difficult because of its variable presentation. This challenge is enhanced when uncommon organs such as the brain and heart are affected. Thorough evaluation is therefore essential when evaluating systemic diseases."

This study evaluated whether the effects of M-TEER on clinical outcomes vary by baseline health status, as measured by the Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire (KCCQ), and assessed the impact of M-TEER on health status post-randomization.
The RESHAPE-HF2 trial included patients with symptomatic HF and moderate-to-severe vSMR (mean effective regurgitant orifice area .25 cm2; 14% >.40 cm2, 23% <.20 cm2). The impact of baseline KCCQ-clinical summary score (CSS) on the effect of M-TEER on clinical outcomes was assessed using Cox proportional hazards models. Changes post-randomization in health status and responder analyses were performed to assess the odds ratio (OR) of improvement and deterioration in KCCQ scores.
Among 505 patients, M-TEER reduced cardiovascular death or HF hospitalization risk [hazard ratio (HR): .71 (.48-1.05), .50 (.29-.85), and .73 (.38-1.41)] across KCCQ-CSS tertiles of <38.9, 38.9-66.1, and >66.1, respectively (P-trend = .53). Similar results were seen for total HF hospitalization (P-trend = .48). M-TEER improved KCCQ-CSS, total symptom score, and overall summary score at 1, 6, 12, and 24 months compared to medical therapy alone (P < .05 at all time points). More patients in the M-TEER arm experienced a ≥5-point [OR 3.38 (2.09-5.45)], ≥10-point [OR 3.12 (1.93-5.02)], and ≥15-point [OR 3.25 (1.94-5.45)] improvement, and less patients had a ≥5-point deterioration [OR .34 (.19-.57)] in KCCQ-CSS at 6 months. Similar results were seen across other KCCQ domains and all time points.
In patients with HF and moderate-to-severe vSMR, M-TEER showed a consistent trend towards a lower risk of HF hospitalization, with or without cardiovascular death, across all KCCQ-CSS tertiles and improved health status over time."

We retrospectively analyzed 278 echocardiograms from 185 participants (118 SCD patients, mean age 12.2 years; 67 age- and sex-matched controls, mean age 11.8 years) obtained between 2015 and 2023. Among the SCD cohort, 66.1% had the HbSS genotype, 9.3% had HbSβ°-thalassemia, and 17.8% had HbSβ⁺-thalassemia; the majority (83.9%) were on hydroxyurea. Compared to controls, SCD patients had significantly lower, but still normal, GLS (-21.5% vs. -22.3%; p < 0.001), along with significantly larger chamber diameters, elevated mitral valve E velocity, E/A ratio, and tricuspid regurgitation maximal velocity. Prior stroke (β = 0.9) and avascular necrosis (β = 1.51) were independently associated with worse GLS. The different genotypes did not exhibit significant difference in GLS. The strain values did not correlate with hemolysis markers, suggesting that other mechanisms may underlie myocardial impairment. A significant age-related decline in GLS was detected, with an inflection point at approximately 9.9 years. Longitudinal analysis of LV strain in the SCD cohort demonstrated a small decline from -21.6% to -21.2% over a 3.7-year follow-up period. Finally, pediatric SCD patients exhibit significant cardiac remodeling and diastolic dysfunction with preserved, yet lower, LV GLS, underscoring the need for further research in this population."

To investigate characteristics, management and outcomes of patients with native MR referred to HVCs.
Between January 2017 and May 2021, all patients with MR referred to seven French HVCs for medico-surgical evaluation were included. Individual management was left to the local interdisciplinary HVC. Patients eligible to mitral valve (MV) intervention were compared with those deemed ineligible and left on medical therapy. The primary endpoint was 2-year all-cause mortality.
After exclusion for treatment refusal or non-MV surgery, a total of 823 patients were analysed: 662 eligible versus 161 ineligible to MV intervention. Among the 662 eligible patients, 382 (57.7%) underwent transcatheter edge-to-edge repair, 215 (32.5%) MV surgery, 40 (6.0%) transcatheter MV replacement and 25 (3.8%) were either on the waiting list at the end of follow-up (n=12) or had died before intervention (n=13). Ineligible patients had higher surgical risk scores (median EuroSCORE II 4.2% vs. 3.3%; P=0.003; median Society of Thoracic Surgeons mortality risk score 4.3% vs. 3.5%; P=0.023) and more advanced left ventricular (LV) impairment (mean LV ejection fraction 49.7% vs. 56.6%; P<0.001). At 2years, all-cause mortality was significantly higher in ineligible versus eligible patients (36.3% vs. 18.0%; P<0.0001).

The combined strategy of transcatheter edge-to-edge repair of mitral valves and percutaneous mechanical circulatory support devices to treat high-risk patients with severe mitral regurgitation and cardiogenic shock has not been evaluated in randomized controlled trials.
In this multicenter registry we aimed to assess the outcomes (all-cause mortality, other important secondary outcomes included freedom from 30-day cardiac death or cardiac readmission, 30-day all-cause mortality, 30-day cardiovascular mortality, and 30-day MACE events) of the combined strategy of Transcatheter Edge-to-Edge Repair of Mitral Valve and Percutaneous Mechanical Circulatory Support Device to Treat High-Risk Patients with Severe Mitral Regurgitation and Cardiogenic Shock.
This multicenter registry retrospectively evaluated all consecutive patients who presented with severe MR, had persistent cardiogenic shock (CS) despite appropriate therapy (including mechanical circulatory support [MCS]), were turned down for surgery due to operative risk from acuity at presentation, and were considered for TEER by a heart team.
Twenty-one consecutive patients with severe acute or acute-on-chronic MR (anatomy suitable for M-TEER) and CS who were undergoing TEER after surgical turndown were included. Mean age was 63 years (SD ± 12.4), 71 % males, mean Society of Thoracic Surgeons Score predicted risk of mortality (STS-PROM) was 20.1 ± 19.2 % (range: 3.1 to 82), 71 % required mechanical ventilation, 52 % had pulmonary edema, 48 % had index acute myocardial infarction (AMI), 19 % required dialysis, 100 % had Impella™ in place. Immediate procedural outcomes included 100 % technical success, MR grade 1.2+ (mild, p < 0.001), and no events for device-device interaction were observed. The primary outcome of in-hospital all-cause mortality was 4.7 % (1 death from multiorgan failure). All-cause mortality at 30 days was 14 %, and three patients died. The procedural success rate was 81 %, with one readmission for DVT that was treated with oral anticoagulation, and none of the patients required mitral valve reintervention at 30-day follow up.

Untreated, severe MR may result in adverse cardiac remodeling, atrial fibrillation (AF), and heart failure. A 45-year-old male with a history of AF presented with heart failure symptoms. Transesophageal echocardiogram revealed a myxomatous mitral valve with anterior leaflet prolapse, severe MR, and massively dilated left atrium (LA). A computerized tomography scan found severe LA dilation up to 17.8 cm. The patient underwent mitral valve replacement, tricuspid valve repair, and LA reduction. MR is known to result in LA dilation due to increased LA volume and pressure. While large LA sizes have been reported, they are often related to congenital conditions and rarely grow to the size identified in this case. AF and LA dilation both predict adverse outcomes, increasing the risk of thrombus formation in such a large chamber."

We developed a fully automated method to reduce FP by integrating automated in-scan anatomic segmentation and removal of background and venous voxels into hybrid heuristic-DL pipelines. Two DL models, CPM-Net, and a deformable 3D convolutional neural network-transformer hybrid (3D-CNN-TR), trained with 1,186 open-source CTAs (1,373 annotated aneurysms) were integrated into an automated pipeline with heuristic post-processing modules comprising 5 combinations of an open-source brain mask and novel DL-based artery-vein separation modules which create artery, vein, and cavernous venous sinus (CVS) segmentation masks from unlabeled CTA data. FPs that do not overlap with the brain mask and/or overlap with vein or vein-more-than-artery masks were eliminated. Each pipeline was tested on 143 held-out private and 843 publicly available CTAs with 218 and 1027 annotated aneurysms, respectively. On our private dataset, CPM-Net yielded 139 true-positives (TP), 79 false-negative (FN), 126 FP, while 3D-CNN-TR yielded 179 TP, 39 FN, 182 FP. FPs were commonly extracranial (CPM-Net 27.3%; 3D-CNN-TR 42.3%), venous (CPM-Net 56.3%; 3D-CNN-TR 29.1%), arterial (CPM-Net 11.9%; 3D-CNN-TR 53.3%), and non-vascular (CPM-Net 25.4%; 3D-CNN-TR 9.3%) structures. Method 5 (combination of brain and vein-more-than-artery mask) performed best, reducing FP by 70.6% (89/126) and 51.6% (94/182) without reducing TP, lowering the FPR from 0.88 to 0.26, and from 1.27 to 0.62 for CPM-Net and 3D-CNN-TR, respectively. On the public RSNA dataset, CPM-Net yielded 791 TP, 236 FN, 748 FP, 0.89 FPR; while 3D-CNN-TR yielded 940 TP, 87 FN, 1552 FP, 1.84 FPR. Method 1 (enhanced brain mask) performed best at preserving TP, removing 1 and 4 TP for CPM-Net and 3D-CNN-TR, respectively, while removing 31.4% (235/748) and 33.8% (524/1552) of FP. Method 5 eliminated 57.9% and 43.8% of FP, but removed 24 and 25 TP from CPM-Net and 3D-CNN-TR output, respectively. Integration of interpretable, anatomy-based, background and vein removal modules into a fully automated DL-based aneurysm detection pipeline improved model performance on two external test datasets. This suggests that heuristic-DL hybrid pipelines created by integrating in-pipeline domain-informed heuristic post-processing with DL may increase performance and clinical acceptance of radiology domain AI."

This study introduces a deep learning model for diagnosing NPC using only non-contrast MRI, reducing the need for gadolinium-based contrast agents (GBCA). This approach helps avoid safety concerns related to GBCA deposition, while also shortening scan times and reducing costs. In this study, we propose an innovative deep learning model for NPC diagnosis using only non-contrast MRI, reducing the need for gadolinium-based contrast agents (GBCA). This approach not only mitigates potential safety concerns associated with residual GBCA deposition but also reduces scan time and examination costs. The study consisted of three phases. Firstly, a novel knowledge distilled modality fusion model is developed using a cohort of 854 cases and tested its performance on an internal set (257 cases, AUC = 0.95) and an independent external set (277 cases, AUC = 0.86). Secondly, the proposed method was compared with: (1) Non-contrast MRI without model improvement (Baseline 1) and (2) current virtual-contrast enhancement-based NPC diagnosis using three state-of-the-art methods (Baselines 2-4). The proposed model consistently outperformed Baselines 1 on both internal dataset (AUC: 0.95 vs. 0.93) and external test set (AUC: 0.86 vs. 0.82). Additionally, it surpassed Baselines 2-4, achieving performance gains of 6.7%, 69.8%, and 28.6% in AUC, over three state-of-the-art methods. Thirdly, the effectiveness of this model was evaluated through a fully crossed multi-reader, multi-case study involving 13 readers from 6 hospitals. The results showed that with AI assistance, readers could diagnose NPC using only non-contrast MRI, achieving results that were not inferior to contrast-enhanced imaging (AUC: 0.90 vs. 0.93, p<0.01). In conclusion, this study demonstrated the model's potential as a safe, cost-effective, and GBCA-free option for NPC diagnosis in clinical practice."

Timely and accurate detection, particularly in the critical early stages characterized by subtle lesions, is paramount for effective disease management. However, existing solutions often struggle with the complexities of real-world field environments (e.g., variable lighting, occlusions, complex backgrounds), computational constraints on edge devices, and limited generalizability across diverse disease types and plant species. To address these challenges, this study proposes a novel lightweight deep learning framework specifically designed for robust rice leaf disease detection. Our key innovations include: (1) A Multi-branch Large-kernel Fusion Depthwise (MLFD) module enhancing multi-scale contextual feature extraction critical for identifying subtle early lesions; (2) A Multi-scale Dilated Transformer Attention (MDTA) module integrating spatial and channel attention mechanisms to improve feature representation under complex conditions; (3) A Lightweight Detection Head (Lo-Head) optimized with grouped and depthwise convolutions, drastically reducing model complexity without sacrificing accuracy. Crucially, extensive experiments demonstrate the framework's superior performance. On a dedicated rice leaf disease dataset, it achieves a mean Average Precision mAP@0.5:0.95 of 62.62%, outperforming state-of-the-art lightweight detectors including YOLOv5n (56.73%), YOLOv8n (57.41%), YOLOv10n (56.14%), and the baseline YOLOv11n (60.85%), while maintaining low computational demands (6.3 GFLOPs, 2.66M parameters). Significantly, rigorous generalization experiments validate the model's exceptional transferability. Evaluated on independent datasets encompassing potato and tomato leaf diseases, the proposed framework consistently surpasses comparable models in mAP@0.5:0.95, demonstrating its robust capability to detect diseases across different plant species. This combination of high accuracy, computational efficiency, and remarkable cross-crop generalizability positions our framework as a highly promising tool for practical deployment on resource-limited edge devices (e.g., drones, field sensors) in smart agriculture systems, enabling proactive disease surveillance and precision control strategies across diverse crops."

This study aimed to develop an MRI-based deep learning model for predicting P53-mutated HCC.
A total of 312 HCC patients who underwent gadolinium-enhanced MRI and were pathologically confirmed between January 2018 and December 2023 were retrospectively enrolled. Participants were randomly divided into training and test dataset at an 8:2 ratio. We developed an EfficientNetV2-based deep learning model, constructing arterial phase (AP) model, portal venous phase (VP), T2-weighted imaging (T2WI), hepatobiliary phase (HBP) single-sequence model, and combined models to predict P53 mutation status. Model performance was evaluated using the area under the curve (AUC), accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, precision, and F1 score as metrics. Differences in AUC values were compared using Delong's test.
A total of 312 pathologically confirmed HCC patients (age: 56 ± 9 years; male = 240) were included, with a training dataset (n = 249) and test dataset (n = 63).Among single-sequence models, the HBP model demonstrated superior diagnostic performance (AUC = 0.715) compared to T2WI, AP, and VP models. The multiphase combined model (T2WI + AP + VP) significantly outperformed single-sequence models, achieving AUCs of 0.982 (95% CI: 0.959-1.000) in the training dataset and 0.914 (95% CI: 0.819-1.000) in the test dataset. However, incorporating the HBP sequence into the combined model (T2WI + AP + VP + HBP) did not further improve diagnostic performance (P > 0.05).

The classification and detection of white blood cells (WBC) are indispensable for the diagnosis of hematologic diseases such as leukemia, but manual classification is time-consuming and susceptible to subjectivity. This paper introduces a new framework that integrates multi-CNN feature fusion with fuzzy logic-based Evaluation Based on Distance from Average Solution (EDAS) for automatic classification and detection of WBCs. The method combines aspects of DenseNet121, MobileNetV2, and ResNet101 to obtain varied morphological features, tackling intraclass variation and imaging inhomogeneity. A fuzzy EDAS model prioritizes the fused features for better interpretability and robustness in clinical decision-making. Using the Kaggle Blood Cell Images dataset of 8013 images of neutrophils, eosinophils, monocytes and lymphocytes, the suggested approach obtained an overall precision of 99.79%, precision, sensitivity and F1 scores greater than 99.70% for all types of WBC. In contrast to individual CNN models (see, e.g., DenseNet121: 95.28%, ResNet101: 81.85%), the combined model performs much better, especially for difficult classes such as neutrophils. The fuzzy EDAS method also guarantees robust model classification in an uncertain situation and is therefore appropriate for clinical settings. It minimizes diagnostic delay, improves scalability in low-resource scenarios, and facilitates quick screening for blood diseases. Future development will address real-time implementation and verification on varied datasets to ensure generalizability."
PubMed,deep learning,A fault classification scheme based on protective agents for microgrid with parameters impact analysis.,Saman Esmaeilbeigi; Hossein Kazemi Karegar; Abolfazl Najar,10.1038/s41598-025-28178-0,2025-12-22,Scientific reports,"With the increasing use of microgrids, fault identification remains a significant challenge for microgrid protection. Overcurrent protection is the most widely used type of protection in the grids. Also, deep neural networks (DNNs) are used as suitable solutions to improve fault classification accuracy. However, some parameters can affect the performance of the deep learning-based fault detection and location (FDL) schemes. This paper presents a protective agent (PA)-based fault classification method using intelligent electronic devices (IEDs) and hybrid DNNs along with various parameters' impact investigation. First, an FDL scheme based on two types of DNNs (single and hybrid types of layers) and PAs will be presented. Then, we analyze various overcurrent-based protection scenarios and their different parameters' impact on the proposed scheme. In the next stage, the impact of different parameters including adding laterals to the microgrid, adding IEDs to the protection plan, improving the structure of the DNNs, protection scheme structure, and data transfer type on the proposed scheme are investigated in a data analysis and a comprehensive sensitivity analysis. The results demonstrate that the lowest and highest accuracy of the proposed algorithm in the studied scenarios in the fault detection section is 95.54% and 99.96%, in the fault type and phase detection section, is 95.56% and 99.86%, and for the fault location error is 6.51% and 1.27%, respectively. In all scenarios, due to the use of hybrid DNNs with two types of layers, the accuracy of DNN-2 was higher than DNN-1. Also, the results in the sensitivity analysis show that despite the high accuracy of the proposed scheme, some parameters significantly impact the accuracy of the DNNs outputs. We performed simulations using three software: DIgSILENT Power Factory, MATLAB, and Python (with Tensorflow and Keras libraries)."

To gain deeper insights into the model's predictive mechanisms, we conducted an interpretability analysis, calculating and evaluating the contribution scores of different genomic regions to the prediction outcomes. Through further exploration of these contribution scores, we identified several critical genomic regions that significantly influence the prediction of gene expression levels. Notably, these regions frequently encompass transcription factor binding sites. Moreover, based on the analysis of contribution scores, we successfully identified several experimentally validated regulatory elements. This study not only enhances our understanding of gene regulatory mechanisms in tomatoes but also provides novel insights and methodologies for future research in crop genetic improvement and functional genomics."

Specifically: compared with Reader 2, specificity (93.5% vs. 88.0%), PPV (65.8% vs. 50.0%), and accuracy (93.0% vs. 87.7%) were higher. Although Reader 3 originally demonstrated higher NPV (98.4% vs. 95.8%) and AUC (0.954 vs. 0.837) without CAD, these differences were no longer significant when Reader 1 used AI-CAD. Across all readers, AI-CAD reduced the mean reading time by an average of 25 s (p < 0.001). Inter-observer agreement after AI-CAD use (BI-RADS κ: 0.279 → 0.363; biopsy recommendation κ: 0.666 → 0.736) showed no statistically significant difference.

The dataset comprised 626 panoramic radiographs from children aged 6.0 to 13.8 years (320 males, 306 females; mean age = 9.88 years). Two expert dentists annotated each radiograph according to the Demirjian stages of seven mandibular teeth. In the first phase, three architectures-ResNet-18, EfficientNetV2-M, and Swin V2 Base-were trained separately for males and females to extract high-dimensional feature representations. Images were preprocessed via intensity quantization, histogram equalization, segmentation, and resizing to standardized 224 × 224 pixel inputs. From the fully connected layer of the Swin V2 Base model, 512 features were extracted for each tooth, and the concatenation of seven teeth yielded a 3584-dimensional feature vector per subject. These feature vectors were then used for regression analysis to predict chronological age on a day-level scale. In the second phase, nine machine learning regression models-LightGBM, RandomForest, ExtraTrees, GradientBoosting, XGBoost, KNN, SVR, MLP, and Gaussian Process Regression-were trained using the extracted features. Pairwise t-test analysis revealed ExtraTrees as the most statistically significant model. For this model, RMSE and MAE were 6.98 and 5.18 months for females, and 6.55 and 5.01 months for males. SHAP-based analysis highlighted the second molar (M2) and first premolar (P1) as the most influential features for females, and the first premolar (P1) and second molar (M2) for males. This automated pipeline enhances age prediction accuracy, reduces observer variability, and provides a reliable tool for clinical and forensic dental age estimation. Future work will explore dataset expansion, multimodal integration, and refined model architectures."

PubMed,deep learning,A novel sub-differentiable hausdorff loss combined with BCE for MRI brain tumor segmentation using UNet variants.,Gurugubelli Visalakshi; Laavanya Mohan,10.1038/s41598-025-33136-x,2025-12-22,Scientific reports,"Brain tumor segmentation is a crucial yet complex task in medical image analysis, playing a vital role in accurate diagnosis and treatment planning. However, it faces several inherent challenges: (1) class imbalance, where tumors occupy a minimal portion of MRI scans, leading models to favor healthy tissue; (2) low sensitivity to small or irregular tumors, resulting in high false negatives; and (3) limitations of standard loss functions, which often fail to properly emphasize tumor boundaries.TraditionalHausdorff Loss, despite its effectiveness in boundary alignment, suffers from non-differentiability and high sensitivity to outliers, leading to unstable optimization and poor boundary predictions. To address these challenges, we propose a novel Sub-Differentiable Hausdorff Loss (SDHL), which introduces a smooth, differentiable formulation enabling stable gradient-based learning and robust boundary alignment. Furthermore, to balance fine boundary precision with accurate tumor region segmentation, we introduce a novel SDHL combined with BCE loss. This combination leverages SDHL's boundary sensitivity and BCE's region accuracy, resulting in sharper tumor boundaries and more complete segmentation outcomes. This study presents a deep learning-based brain tumor segmentation pipeline utilizing various UNet-derived architectures including UNet, UNet+, VNet, UNet++, and Attention UNet, all trained using the proposed loss functions. The models evaluated using performance metrics such as Accuracy, Precision, Recall, Dice Score, and Intersection over Union (IoU). Among the tested configurations, Semantic segmentationmetricsofAttention UNet with SDHL + BCE outperformed all others, achieving 99.71% accuracy, 91.06% precision, 91.85% recall, 90.16% Dice score, and 80.78% IoU. The integration of the proposed loss functions significantly improves segmentation quality, addressing key challenges and offering a robust solution for brain tumor segmentation in medical imaging.Additionally, the Attention UNet model demonstrated strong consistency across evaluation metrics, achieving 97.92% accuracy, 98.76% precision, 98.05% recall, 98.57% F1-score, and a Matthews correlation coefficient of 93.41%, indicating robust and reliable performance."
PubMed,deep learning,Using synthetic data for pretraining partial discharge detection in overhead transmission lines.,Lukáš Klein; Jan Fulneček; Ondřej Kabot; Jiří Dvorský; Lukáš Prokop,10.1038/s41598-025-32642-2,2025-12-22,Scientific reports,"Accurate detection of partial discharges (PDs) in medium-voltage overhead transmission lines is critical for preemptive maintenance and avoiding costly outages, yet it is challenged by scarce labeled data and pervasive electromagnetic interference. This paper investigates a hybrid simulation-and-data-driven framework in which synthetically generated PD signals are used to pretrain deep neural networks and are subsequently fine-tuned on a limited set of real overhead-line measurements. The synthetic pipeline systematically varies PD repetition rates, amplitude distributions, vegetation-contact scenarios, and noise conditions, producing diverse time-series and spectrogram-like representations that approximate real operating environments. We conduct a comprehensive ablation study across multiple architectures-Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), a Vision Transformer (ViT), and a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network-and analyze their sensitivity to granular sweeps of synthetic-data parameters. CNN-based models decisively outperform ViT and LSTM counterparts on the spectrogram-based classification task, while ViT and LSTM fail to learn meaningful representation. For the successful CNNs, pretraining on carefully parameterized synthetic datasets-particularly those reflecting higher PD activity, such as our Datasets 3 and 4-consistently improves downstream performance on real data, boosting the Matthews Correlation Coefficient (MCC) on imbalanced, cost-sensitive test sets by roughly 10-20% compared with training from scratch. At the same time, we show that poorly aligned synthetic data can degrade generalization, underscoring the need for accurate noise calibration and domain-aligned simulation. Overall, the results confirm that (i) architectural choice is pivotal for PD detection in overhead lines and (ii) well-designed synthetic data is a powerful, practical lever for achieving reliable and cost-effective PD monitoring when real labeled data are limited."

With a focus on the prevalent psychological complications following the onset of this condition, this study aimed to explore the correlation between antenatal depression and Corona disease anxiety, personality traits, and postpartum depression during the COVID-19 pandemic.                                                           Materials and Methods:                     This cross-sectional descriptive-analytical study investigated women receiving care at health centers affiliated with Kerman University of Medical Sciences during the last month of their pregnancy and the postpartum period in 2022. Following the acquisition of informed consent, participants were assessed using various measures, including demographic and obstetric information, the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale, the Corona Disease Anxiety Scale (CDAS), and the NEO Personality Inventory-Revised during their third trimester of pregnancy. The same group of participants completed the Edinburgh Depression Scale and the Corona Disease Anxiety Scale (CDAS) 4-6 weeks after childbirth.                                                           Results and Discussion:                     There was a significant correlation between family income, unwanted pregnancy as perceived by both the mother and father, and antenatal depression. Additionally, marital satisfaction played a significant role in postpartum depression. Furthermore, antenatal depression was significantly associated with neuroticism, agreeableness, and physical symptoms related to Corona disease anxiety. Personality traits, with the exception of extroversion and conscientiousness, and various domains of Corona disease anxiety, excluding psychological symptoms, were also significantly associated with postpartum depression.                                                           Conclusion:                     During pandemics or epidemics, such as the COVID-19 outbreak, experiencing mental distress during pregnancy can contribute to mental health issues during the postpartum period. This risk is particularly true in individuals with unique personality traits, emphasizing the need for increased focus on mental health within prenatal care during these crises."

We conducted two key analyses: 1. Mixed effect logistic regression was used to check the relationship between the variables and COVID-19 severity. 2. Mixed effect linear regression was used to check the relationship between the variables and the length of stay in the hospital.                                                           Results:                     The findings indicated that the most important risk factors for the severity of COVID-19 were heart diseases (OR=1.67,95%CI:1.20-2.30), increasing age (OR=2.23 for age&gt;54, 95%CI:1.70- 2.90), male gender (OR=1.47,95%CI:1.10-1.96), respiratory diseases other than asthma, and frequency of admission (OR=1.60,95%CI:1.20-2.15). All patients who underwent readmission experienced a shorter duration of hospitalization during their subsequent admission (OR=0.94,95%CI:0.91,0.96) and had a higher mortality rate (30% within 14 days, 26.6% between 14-90 days). Patients readmitted at intervals of 14-90 days and greater than 90 days exhibited lower disease severity compared to those readmitted within the 0-14 day period.                                                           Conclusion:                     Examining readmissions, the severity of COVID-19, and the length of hospital stay in affected patients are important factors for planning and allocating resources for COVID-19 management and treatment. These factors can help policymakers develop effective clinical guidelines for hospitalization or outpatient treatment of COVID-19 patients and contribute to reducing the burden of disease in the community."

Kinovea, as an accessible motion-analysis software, provides both visual and quantitative feedback. However, its application in supporting technique development among beginner athletes remains insufficiently explored. Aim: This study aims to describe the use of Kinovea in biomechanics training and examine its contribution to the awareness of kinematic characteristics and movement techniques among beginner athletes. Methods: A descriptive qualitative design involved 72 beginner athletes aged 18–25 years selected through purposive sampling. Data were collected over 16 weeks through interviews, field observations, and motion video recordings analyzed using Kinovea. Kinematic data focused on joint angles, stride behavior, and movement phases during walking, running, and the flight phase. Qualitative data were analyzed using content analysis with NVivo 12, while kinematic results were interpreted descriptively to identify performance patterns and areas for technical refinement. Result: Kinematic analysis showed coordinated joint-angle patterns across all phases. Walking analysis identified arm swing angles of 50.9°–58.8° and leg separation angles of 64.3°–67.2°, indicating a stable gait rhythm. The running analysis revealed knee angles of 68.8°–69.8° and elbow angles of 87.6°–89.1°, indicating efficient propulsive mechanics. The flight phase demonstrated knee angles of 81.2°–87.8° and elbow angles of 80.4°–88.3°, suggesting effective momentum use and postural stability. These measurements supported stride-efficiency assessment and technique evaluation. Qualitative findings revealed that Kinovea enabled athletes to interpret movement phases and identify technical inefficiencies through slow-motion and frame-by-frame visualization. Conclusion: Kinovea supports basic motion analysis by providing clear kinematic information and helping beginner athletes observe and refine their movement techniques. The findings also offer practical value for coaches by enabling more precise identification of inefficient patterns and guiding targeted corrections during early-stage training."

Case Series and Literature Review,Giovanni Balestrucci; Vitaliano Buffa; Maria Teresa Del Canto; Maria Chiara Brunese; Salvatore Cappabianca; Alfonso Reginelli,10.3390/hearts7010002,2025-12-22,Hearts,"Mitral annular disjunction (MAD) is a structural abnormality of the mitral valve increasingly detected with advanced cardiac imaging, particularly cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR). However, the clinical impact of different degrees of disjunction and the lack of standardized measurement criteria remain controversial. This study aimed to describe a series of patients with MAD assessed by CMR and to discuss, in the context of current literature, potential cut-off values that may distinguish physiological from pathological MAD. We retrospectively identified all CMR examinations performed at our institution over a 6-month period in which MAD was visible in at least two cine steady-state free precession (SSFP) projections. For each patient, we recorded MAD extent, presence of mitral valve prolapse/regurgitation, late gadolinium enhancement (LGE) pattern, and main clinical presentation. Nine patients (mean age 57 years; 5 men) were included. Larger MAD distances (&gt;4 mm) were frequently associated with non-ischemic LGE in the basal lateral wall and with valvular abnormalities, whereas smaller disjunctions (≤3 mm) were often observed in patients without significant structural disease. Non-ischemic LGE was present in 6/9 patients, all with MAD &gt; 5 mm. These observations, together with published data, support the hypothesis that small degrees of MAD may represent a frequent anatomical variant, while more extensive disjunction, especially when associated with fibrosis, may indicate a pathological substrate for arrhythmias. Standardized CMR-based criteria and validated MAD cut-off values are needed to improve risk stratification and to incorporate MAD assessment into routine clinical practice."

Objective: to evaluate IS predictors in patients with moderate or severe AS, which will help identify high-risk groups and optimise stroke prevention. Material and methods . A retrospective review of data from the hospital information system for case-control analysis was conducted at one of the Federal Centers for Cardiovascular Surgery. Inclusion criteria: moderate or severe AS, patient age ≥18 years. Exclusion criteria: moderate or severe mitral stenosis, moderate or severe mitral regurgitation. Logistic regression was used to determine IS predictors. Odds ratio (OR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated for each of the significant risk factors. Results . The study included 208 patients with AS (the main group consisted of 51 patients with a history of IS or transient ischemic attack). The median age of patients was 68 [62.0; 72.0] years, the proportion of men was 53.8%. According to the multivariate analysis, the following predictors of cerebral ischemic events were identified: male gender (OR 2.739; 95% CI 1.048–7.156, p=0.040), extra-, intracranial stenosis &gt;50% (OR 2.488; 95% CI 1.089–5.686, p=0.031), aortic arch atheromas (OR 5.947; 95% CI 1.179–29.994, p=0.031), the result of the CHA2DS2VASc scale with an increase of 1 point (OR 4.030; 95% CI 1.912–8.499, p&lt;0.001). Conclusion. Supra-cardiac atherosclerosis (extraand intracranial atherosclerosis, aortic atheromas) is the main predictor of IS in patients with AS, which determines the need for its assessment in order to optimise patient treatment."

As such, this study aimed to further evaluate the diagnostic utility of ePLAR in a large cohort of patients with PHTN. Methods and Results All RHCs between 2018-2023 across three tertiary centers were retrospectively reviewed. Patients with PHTN were characterized as pre-capillary or post-capillary (isolated or combined). Concurrent ePLAR was calculated. ROC analysis evaluated the accuracy of ePLAR in detecting pre-capillary PHTN. Overall, 2235 patients had PHTN by RHC, mean age 63.5 ± 14.7 years, 53.5% male. Of these, 43.3% had pre-capillary PHTN. ROC analysis demonstrated ePLAR to have good accuracy in detection of pre-capillary PHTN (AUC 0.760), with a cutoff of 0.20m/s demonstrating a sensitivity and specificity of 77% and 60% respectively. This persisted on sensitivity analysis for contemporaneous investigations and for right ventricular function. Conclusions In this large cohort, ePLAR was validated as an accurate tool for identifying patients with pre-capillary PHTN. This widely available, non-invasive, and reproducible parameter can have an important role in the work up of PHTN and may guide the need for invasive testing."

Methods: This prospective single-center cohort study included 101 patients with chronic heart failure (mean age 62 ± 15.5 years; 70.3% male) with paroxysmal or persistent drug-refractory atrial fibrillation who underwent atrioventricular node ablation and CRT-D implantation. All patients received optimal medical therapy before and after undergoing the procedure. Predictors of 5-year mortality were assessed using exploratory machine-learning methods, including random forest and Shapley additive explanations. Results: During 5-year follow-up, 13 cardiovascular deaths were recorded. Five key predictors of mortality were identified: left ventricular ejection fraction, 6 min walk distance, mean pulmonary artery pressure, systolic relaxation coefficient, and degree of mitral regurgitation. The exploratory predictive model showed high accuracy (92%) in terms of classifying the outcomes. Conclusions: Atrioventricular node ablation (AVNA) combined with CRT-D was associated with the observed long-term clinical outcomes observed in patients with drug-refractory tachysystolic atrial fibrillation. The exploratory machine learning analysis identified key mortality-associated factors, which may support future efforts in personalized risk stratification and hypothesis generation. The combination of AVNA and CRT-D was associated with the observed long-term outcomes in this real-world cohort."

Advances in endoscopic visualization and surgical instrumentation have enhanced precision while minimizing trauma, improving both functional and esthetic outcomes. This study presents a single-center experience with total endoscopic mitral valve repair (MVR) performed using two- or three-dimensional video-assisted technology. Methods: Between October 2022 and September 2025, 239 patients underwent total endoscopic MVR at our institution. Demographic, operative, and postoperative data were collected and analyzed. Results: Median age was 63 years, with 64.4% male. Median logistic EuroSCORE and EuroSCORE II were 2.53 and 0.83, respectively. Most patients were NYHA class II (54.4%), and 47.7% had pulmonary hypertension. Mitral annuloplasty was performed in 99.2% of cases; 78.6% received Gore-Tex chordae, 6.3% underwent posterior leaflet resection, and 11.7% edge-to-edge repair. Conversion to sternotomy occurred in 0.4%. In-hospital mortality was 1.3%; stroke occurred in 0.4%. Postoperative atrial fibrillation developed in 26.8%, while major complications such as sepsis (2.1%) and renal failure requiring dialysis (1.3%) were infrequent. Median ventilation time was 5 h, ICU stay was 2 days, and hospital stay was 7 days. Pre-discharge echocardiography showed ≤mild regurgitation in 99.2%. Conclusions: Total endoscopic MVR using two- or three-dimensional video assistance is safe, feasible, and yields excellent clinical, functional, and cosmetic results, with low morbidity and rapid recovery."

Hoopes; Vakhtang Tchantchaleishvili,10.1111/aor.70056,2025-12-18,Artificial Organs,"ABSTRACT Background Microaxial devices provide effective short‐term hemodynamic support in patients with cardiogenic shock or during high‐risk procedures. However, there is a paucity of data regarding device‐associated valvular complications. We sought to pool existing data to understand its incidence, management, and outcomes. Methods An electronic search was conducted in October 2024 to identify studies reporting microaxial device–associated valvular complications that did not resolve with device explantation. A total of 26 case reports and case series, representing 27 patients, were included. Patient‐level data were extracted for analysis. Results The median age was 50 years [IQR 34–65], and 78% (21/27) were male. The indications for microaxial support were cardiogenic shock (85.2%, 23/27), coronary bypass grafting (7.4%, 2/27), and high‐risk percutaneous coronary intervention (7.4%, 2/27). The most commonly used devices were the Impella 5.0 (41%, 11/27) and Impella CP (22%, 6/27). Aortic regurgitation (AR) developed in 67% of patients (18/27). Mitral regurgitation (MR) developed in 33% (9/27) of patients, all of which were severe. The median duration of microaxial support was 10 [3–15] days. Overall, 74% (20/27) of patients underwent surgical management, 11% (3/27) underwent transcatheter treatment, and 15% (4/27) were managed nonoperatively. In‐hospital/30‐day mortality was 11% (3/27), including two deaths among patients with MR (22%) and one in a patient with AR (5.6%) with a pre‐existing bioprosthetic aortic valve ( p = 0.19). When considering the patients with only native valves and excluding the bioprosthetic aortic valve, mortality was significantly higher among MR patients compared to those with AR (MR: 22%; AR: 0%, p = 0.04). At a median follow‐up of 183 [30–365] days, overall survival was 89% (24/27). Conclusion AR was more common than MR; however, all MR cases were severe. MR may be associated with worse outcomes. Surgical management appears to be the most frequently employed strategy for valvular injury."

Cavalcante; Jyothy Puthumana; Akhil Narang; Judy Hung; James D. Thomas; Lauren S. Ranard; Vera H. Rigolin,10.1001/jamacardio.2025.4561,2025-12-17,JAMA Cardiology,"Importance Primary mitral regurgitation (MR) is a prevalent valvular lesion. Current American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association guidelines include class I recommendations for intervention for severe primary MR at the onset of symptoms, significant left ventricular (LV) enlargement (end-systolic dimension ≥40 mm), or dysfunction (ejection fraction ≤60%), with a class IIA recommendation for mitral valve repair when performed at an experienced surgical center. Recent data suggest a survival penalty when waiting for class I surgical guideline indications, and novel markers of decompensation are under investigation. Observations Comprehensive assessment of MR severity using echocardiography is critical, and when warranted, cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) is complementary. Assessment of LV size and function, as well as serial changes in both, is crucial for determining timing of surgery. New-onset atrial fibrillation, left atrial enlargement, pulmonary hypertension, and exercise-induced changes in LV function should also be considered in borderline scenarios. The roles of LV volumes, global longitudinal strain, CMR-derived measures of myocardial dysfunction, and cardiac biomarkers are worthy of further investigation regarding consideration for early surgical intervention. Conclusions and Relevance A more refined approach incorporating assessment of extravalvular cardiac injury, novel imaging markers, and biomarkers is needed to optimize surgical timing in primary MR. Further research is warranted to validate these emerging parameters and refine guidelines to improve patient outcomes."

However, some patients with severe aortic stenosis exhibit eccentric remodeling with enlarged left ventricular cavities, enabling a normal flow, low ejection fraction ( NF ‐ LEF ) phenotype. We assessed the prevalence, hemodynamic characteristics, and post‐transcatheter aortic valve implantation outcomes of NF ‐ LEF . Methods In this substudy of the COMPARE‐TAVI 1 trial, 979 patients undergoing transfemoral transcatheter aortic valve implantation were stratified by left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) (&lt; or ≥50%) and stroke volume index (&lt; or ≥35 mL/m 2 ) into 4 groups: normal flow, normal LVEF, NF‐LEF, low flow, normal ejection fraction, and low flow, low ejection fraction. Results NF‐LEF was observed in 10.7% of patients. Reduced LVEF was associated with previous myocardial infarction, pacemakers, New York Heart Association class &gt;2, atrial fibrillation, moderate or worse mitral regurgitation, and larger left ventricular cavities ( P &lt;0.001) with eccentric hypertrophy ( P =0.004). Compared with low‐flow, low‐ejection fraction, patients with NF‐LEF more frequently had moderate or worse aortic regurgitation ( P =0.007), whereas low flow, low ejection fraction showed poorer diastolic indices, suggesting diastolic dysfunction with high left ventricular filling pressures. Patients with low flow, normal ejection fraction were the most symptomatic and showed less improvement in 6‐minute walk distance at 1 year compared with normal flow, normal ejection fraction. During follow‐up, both low‐flow groups demonstrated significant increases in stroke volume index ( P &lt;0.001), whereas LVEF also improved among patients with reduced LVEF ( P &lt;0.001). Conclusions NF‐LEF is a prevalent aortic stenosis phenotype characterized by preserved flow despite reduced LVEF, likely driven by eccentric remodeling with moderate or worse aortic regurgitation and more favorable diastolic properties, with similar survival and time‐to‐event outcomes across phenotypes after transcatheter aortic valve implantation at long‐term follow‐up. Despite higher comorbidity burdens, patients with NF‐LEF showed functional and clinical improvements comparable with normal flow, normal ejection fraction, indicating a severe aortic stenosis phenotype."

Borger; Patrick Perier,10.1093/ejcts/ezaf461,2025-12-17,European Journal of Cardio-Thoracic Surgery,"Abstract OBJECTIVES Mitral annular disjunction (MAD) is a structural abnormality of the mitral annulus fibrosus, associated with myxomatous leaflet degeneration, mitral valve prolapse (MVP), and ventricular arrhythmias. The combination of annular dilatation and abnormal annular motion increases mechanical stress on the mitral leaflets, triggering the degenerative process. METHODS This review summarizes the major pathophysiologic, diagnostic and therapeutic measures for the treatment of patients with MAD and an indication for mitral surgery. RESULTS The diagnosis is primarily based on non-invasive imaging techniques. Echocardiography is the first choice due to its ability to assess real-time mitral valve function. Cardiac Computed tomography and Magnetic Resonance Imaging provide more comprehensive information on the extend of MAD and the presence of calcifications. Indications for surgical mitral valve treatment are based on current recommendations. In cases with MAD and moderate mitral regurgitation, early intervention may be advocated in the presence of arrhythmogenic MVP. Long-term outcomes after treatment are assessed through multimodal imaging and electrocardiogram monitoring. A ring annuloplasty is an important cornerstone of treatment. Stabilization of the mitral annulus abolishes functional prolapse and increases the antiarrhythmic effect of mitral surgery. However, postoperative arrhythmic burden may persist in some cases, requiring continuous monitoring and sometimes an additional device therapy. CONCLUSIONS MAD represents a complex anatomical and functional entity associated with diagnostic challenges and rhythm abnormalities. Although the current indications for surgical treatment follow the recommendations for treatment of primary mitral regurgitation, early treatment may be important especially in patients with arrhythmias."

Understanding the mechanism of MR, whether primary, due to intrinsic valve abnormalities, or secondary, resulting from atrial or ventricular remodeling, is essential for optimal management. Echocardiography, particularly advanced modalities such as three-dimensional imaging and strain analysis, plays a central role in this process. It allows accurate quantification of MR severity, detailed characterization of valve and ventricular anatomy, and assessment of remodeling, all of which are critical for determining the optimal timing for intervention. Beyond diagnosis, echocardiography is indispensable in guiding therapy selection: it informs surgical planning by defining leaflet pathology for repair versus replacement strategies, and directs transcatheter interventions by guiding interatrial septal puncture, catheter orientation, and device deployment in real time. While surgery remains the gold standard for primary MR, transcatheter approaches including edge-to-edge repair and emerging mitral valve replacement are increasingly relevant, particularly in patients at high surgical risk or with complex anatomy. This review emphasizes the pivotal role of echocardiography in the pre-procedural assessment of MR, highlighting its ability to integrate anatomical, functional, and hemodynamic information to guide patient-tailored therapeutic strategies and optimize outcomes within a Heart Team framework."

It examines the potential treatment for sickle cell anaemia and other chronic or acute diseases like myocardial infarction, angina, CHF, hypertension, rheumatic heart disease, ischemic mitral regurgitation, cardiomyopathy, platelet aggregation, oxidative stress, endothelial dysfunction, and thrombotic conditions. The review examines the potential of Terminalia arjuna leaf gall in SCD treatment, identifying its main bioactive compound, 5-Hydroxymethylfurfural, known for its anti-sickling properties. Galls form when plants react to insect attacks, notably from Trioza fletcheri in T. arjuna. Studies indicate that extracts from Terminalia arjuna exhibit significant anti-sickling effects. While the pharmacological potential of these extracts is promising, further clinical studies and safety assessments are necessary to validate efficacy and standardisation for therapeutic use. The review examines how Arjuna bark decoction has been used in the Indian subcontinent for centuries to manage anginal pain, hypertension, congestive heart failure, and dyslipidemia. While its potential in cardiovascular diseases warrants further study, recent literature highlights its anti-ischemic, antioxidant, hypolipidemic, and antiatherogenic effects, primarily due to its beneficial phytoconstituents like triterpenoids and flavonoids. Arjuna has shown promise in treating ischemic cardiomyopathy, with no serious side effects reported; however, long-term safety remains unclear. Its role in coronary prevention still needs exploration."

OpenAlex,mitral regurgitation,Three-Dimensional Echocardiographic Approach to Mitral Valve After Transcatheter Edge-to-Edge Repair,Rishi Kumar; Serena S. Dasani; Kara G. Fields; Guillem Roca; Lauren Cornella; Douglas C. Shook; Charles Nyman; Sula Nasra; Chinyere Archie; Pinak Shah; Stanton K. Shernan; Sergey Karamnov,10.1213/ane.0000000000007756,2025-12-15,Anesthesia & Analgesia,"BACKGROUND: Evaluation of the mitral valve during transcatheter edge-to-edge repair (TEER) for management of mitral regurgitation is commonly guided by intraprocedural interventional transesophageal echocardiography (TEE). The risk of iatrogenic mitral stenosis (MS) remains a concern, particularly in patients requiring multiple clips, since the mitral valve orifice area (MVA) is reduced. The value of conventional flow-based echocardiographic methods to rule out MS is limited by intraprocedural and general anesthesia (GA)-induced hemodynamic variability. This retrospective study introduces the novel adaptation of a 3-dimensional (3D) Orifice Area (3DOA) technique to evaluate post-TEER MVA. We evaluated the degree of agreement between MVAs derived via TEE 3DOA, TEE pressure half-time (PHT), and postprocedure transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) PHT with patients awake. METHODS: TEE and TTE images from 20 adult patients with severe mitral regurgitation undergoing a TEER (MitraClip, Abbott) procedure were retrospectively reviewed. MVAs obtained by MTEE 3DOA and TEE PHT under GA were compared to those acquired with TTE PHT with patients awake. Agreement was assessed via calculation of Bland–Altman 95% limits of agreement and Lin’s concordance correlation coefficients, both with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). RESULTS: There was good agreement between TEE 3DOA-derived MVA measurements under GA and TTE PHT-derived MVA measurements in awake patients, as reflected by Bland–Altman (lower limit of agreement: −.0.45 [95% CI, −.58 to −.31] and upper limit of agreement: 0.26 [95% CI, 0.12–0.4]), and an excellent concordance correlation coefficient value (0.95 [95% CI, 0.86–0.98]). In contrast, agreement between TEE PHT-derived MVA and TTE PHT-derived MVA was weak, with much broader limits of agreement (lower limit of agreement: −1.6 [95% CI, −2.19 to −1.02] and upper limit of agreement: 1.43 [95% CI, 0.84–2.01]) and a weak concordance correlation coefficient value (0.46 [95% CI, 0.02–0.75]). CONCLUSIONS: In this retrospective cohort study, we demonstrated excellent agreement between TEE-3DOA-derived MVA under GA and TTE PHT-derived MVA in awake patients, but not between TEE versus TTE PHT. These findings warrant further validation in larger patient datasets to assess the utility of 3D echocardiographic approaches in evaluating MVA after TEER."
