The role of angiographic lesion characteristics in predicting this discordance remains unclear.
To identify angiographic predictors of FFR/iFR discordance and define distinct angiographic phenotypes using unsupervised machine learning.
This prospective, single-center registry evaluated 401 intermediate coronary lesions from 221 patients with severe AS (aortic valve area < 1.0 cm2, mean gradient >40 mmHg) using FFR and iFR. Quantitative coronary angiography measured percent diameter stenosis (%DS), lesion length (LL), and other parameters. The primary outcome was FFR/iFR discordance. Receiver operating characteristic and decision curve analyses evaluated %DS predictive utility. K-means clustering was applied to %DS and LL to identify lesion phenotypes.
FFR/iFR discordance occurred in 30 lesions (7.5 %), exclusively as FFR-negative/iFR-positive pattern. Higher %DS was the only independent angiographic predictor of discordance (adjusted OR 1.35 per 10 % increase; 95 % CI 1.12-1.64; p = 0.002), with modest discriminative ability (AUC = 0.69). Cluster analysis identified three phenotypes: Cluster 0 (High %DS [median 75.0 %]/Intermediate LL [median 15.0 mm], n = 103); Cluster 1 (Low %DS [median 49.0 %]/Short-Intermediate LL [median 13.6 mm], n = 220); and Cluster 2 (Intermediate %DS [median 63.5 %]/Long LL [median 32.4 mm], n = 78). Discordance incidence was highest in Cluster 0 (16.5 %) versus Clusters 1 (2.7 %) and 2 (9.0 %) (p < 0.001).
In severe AS, FFR/iFR discordance manifests solely as FFR-negative/iFR-positive pattern. While %DS modestly predicts this mismatch, unsupervised clustering reveals that ""High %DS / Intermediate Length"" lesions primarily drive physiological discordance, identifying cases where iFR may overestimate severity due to AS-related hemodynamics."

Case reports,"Fibrin-associated large B-cell lymphoma (FA-LBCL) is a rare disorder, but its role in transcatheter valve failure is unknown. This report describes the first documented case of FA-LBCL in a transcatheter aortic valve.
A 62-year-old man with a prior transcatheter aortic valve replacement presented with symptomatic severe aortic stenosis. Histopathologic analysis of the explanted valve revealed FA-LBCL as the primary cause of valve failure.
This case established a neoplastic process as a cause of structural valve degeneration (SVD) in transcatheter valves. It highlights that FA-LBCL should be included in the differential diagnosis of transcatheter aortic valve replacement failure, for which surgical explantation can be both diagnostic and curative.
This is the first report that documents FA-LBCL causing SVD of a transcatheter bioprosthetic valve.
FA-LBCL represents a cause of SVD in transcatheter bioprosthetic valves. This diagnosis should be considered in cases of premature valve failure."

Case reports,"Balloon entrapment during transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) is a rare but serious complication, especially in patients with severe valve calcification.
A 78-year-old woman with symptomatic severe aortic stenosis (peak velocity 7.23 m/s, preserved left ventricular ejection fraction 70%) underwent TAVR. After valve deployment, the balloon became entrapped within the prosthesis. Controlled postdilation was performed to disrupt the valve frame mesh, successfully releasing the balloon. The patient recovered well; at nearly 3 years of follow-up, she remains asymptomatic without rehospitalization for heart failure or neurologic events.
This case highlights the role of controlled postdilation as a safe and effective bailout strategy for balloon entrapment during TAVR. Reviewing the literature, balloon entrapment is rare but potentially life-threatening, and prompt recognition with appropriate technical solutions is critical for favorable outcomes.
Balloon entrapment during TAVR is rare but can be effectively managed with controlled postdilation, particularly in patients with severe calcification. Ensuring correct guidewire position in the left ventricle, confirmed by multiple fluoroscopic views, helps prevent balloon entrapment by avoiding passage through the stent mesh."

Suboptimal valve seating can elevate the transvalvular pressure gradient, while valve orientation and size may produce flow jets that impinge on the ascending aorta, potentially weakening the vessel wall. Such hemodynamic complications can compromise valve performance and patient outcomes. This study presents a computational fluid dynamics framework, derived from medical CT images, for preprocedural hemodynamic assessment of aortic valve replacement. The framework minimizes user input and delivers rapid results, enabling efficient evaluation of valve types, orientations, and their hemodynamic impact. The results demonstrate that non-optimal implantation angles substantially increase pressure drop across the valve, thereby imposing higher workload on the heart. This automated and efficient simulation framework demonstrates strong potential for clinical application, supporting precise planning and execution of valve implantation procedures to improve patient care."

We conducted a network meta-analysis to compare the efficacy and safety of transcatheter aortic valves in aortic stenosis patients.
A systematic search of PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane was conducted. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that included adult patients with aortic stenosis undergoing TAVR, which compared clinical efficacy and safety between any of the transcatheter aortic valves, were included. Random effects meta-analysis was employed.
A total of 4687 patients from 9 RCTs were included. Sapien XT had a significantly higher risk of stroke compared to Sapien 3 RR = 31.38 (95% CI: 1.12 to 876, p = 0.043), while other devices showed no significant differences. Evolut had a significantly increased risk of permanent pacemaker placement compared to Sapien 3 RR = 1.36 (95% CI: 1.07-1.74, p = 0.013). No significant differences were observed between valves for any of the other analyzed outcomes.
While most TAVR devices showed comparable safety profiles, Evolut was associated with increased pacemaker implantation risk. The higher stroke risk with Sapien XT should be interpreted with caution.

The current report from the LANDMARK trial describes clinical outcomes, hemodynamic performances, and quality of life at 1 year.
This open-label, noninferiority trial enrolled 768 participants across 31 hospitals in Europe, New Zealand, and Brazil. Participants were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive either a Myval THV series or a contemporary THV (SAPIEN or Evolut series). The composite endpoint at 1 year included all-cause mortality, all strokes, and procedure- or valve-related hospitalizations. Clinical efficacy was defined as freedom from the composite endpoint. As recommended in Valve Academic Research Consortium-3, the previous composite endpoint combined with the assessment of quality of life at baseline and 1 year with the 12-Item Short Form Health Survey was reported as an extended composite endpoint. The noninferiority hypothesis was prespecified for the assessment of the primary endpoint at 30 days. Considering the specific 1-year composite endpoints of Valve Academic Research Consortium-3 and the event rate of 27.23% derived from recent studies, an a posteriori descriptive and exploratory noninferiority hypothesis was introduced with a noninferiority margin of 10.89%. The analysis was performed in the intention-to-treat population.
The mean age was 80 years, 48% were women, and the median Society of Thoracic Surgeons Predicted Risk of Mortality score was 2.6%. There was no significant difference in the Kaplan-Meier estimates of freedom from the composite endpoint at 365 days (Myval THV 87.0% vs contemporary THVs 86.9%). The Myval THV series was noninferior to the contemporary THVs for the composite endpoint (difference: -0.1%; 1-sided 95% CI: 3.9%; Pnoninferiority < 0.0001). Similarly, there were no significant differences in freedom from the extended composite endpoint (80.5% vs 77.3%; difference: 3.2%; 95% CI: -2.9% to 9.2%; P = 0.33).
In the treatment of symptomatic severe native aortic stenosis, the clinical and hemodynamic outcomes of the Myval THV series were comparable to those of contemporary THVs for the 1-year composite of all-cause mortality, all strokes, or procedure- or valve-related hospitalizations.

Commonly used therapeutics include diuretics for CHF and antithrombotics 2 to reduce the risk of arterial thromboembolism (ATE), which do not directly affect myocardial function. This review summarizes the evidence for the use of pimobendan, a phosphodiesterase III inhibitor and calcium channel sensitizer, in feline cardiomyopathies. Potential benefits of pimobendan in cats include improved left ventricular systolic and diastolic function, reduced platelet aggregation, reduction in left atrial size, and improved left atrial and auricular systolic function.Drug details:Pimobendan is indicated for the treatment of CHF in conditions associated with systolic dysfunction (including dilated cardiomyopathy, restrictive cardiomyopathy, arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy and some cases with non-specific phenotypes) and has been used in the treatment of CHF secondary to hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. A dosage of pimobendan of 0.25 mg/kg PO q12h is generally well tolerated, and an approved oral solution is now available in the UK, EU, USA, Japan and Australia, which may facilitate administration in some cats; it should be noted, however, that pimobendan is not licensed for use in cats and marketing authorizations may vary between countries. Adverse events are uncommon with pimobendan but include gastrointestinal upset (anorexia, vomiting), transient changes in heart rate and possible worsening arrhythmias at higher doses. The use of pimobendan is contraindicated in cats with fixed obstructions of the left or right ventricular outflow tract (ie, congenital heart disease - pulmonic or aortic valvular stenosis).
This article reviews the use of pimobendan in cats for primary care veterinarians and includes practical case examples that reflect the typical use and recommendations for usage of pimobendan by the authors."

This study aims to elucidate the relationship between VAPB and aortic valve calcification at both tissue and cellular molecular levels, exploring potential regulatory mechanisms.
The expression levels of VAPB in calcified valve tissues were assessed using immunohistochemical analysis. Osteogenic differentiation and calcification levels of valve interstitial cells (VICs) were evaluated by alizarin red staining, calcium content quantification, and the detection of the osteogenic markers. Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) was used to identify downstream pathways regulated by VAPB, immunoblotting was used to detect the expression of key molecules of SMAD signaling, and immunoprecipitation was performed to detect interactions between VAPB and SMAD1/5/9.
VAPB expression was significantly upregulated in the aortic valve leaflets of patients with CAVD. VICs with VAPB overexpression exhibited a significant increase in calcium content (p < 0.001) and upregulation of osteogenic markers RUNX2, osteocalcin, and osteopontin (p <0. 01). Conversely, VAPB knockdown reduced osteogenic differentiation in VICs. Furthermore, VAPB overexpression led to the enhanced expression of p-SMAD1/5/9 through activation of the SMAD signaling pathway (p < 0.05), while inhibition of the SMAD pathway abrogated the pro-calcification effects of VAPB. Dual immunofluorescence staining demonstrated colocalization of VAPB with SMAD1/5/9, and immunoprecipitation confirmed an interaction between VAPB and SMAD1/5/9.
The findings indicate that VAPB promotes osteogenic differentiation in aortic valve interstitial cells by activating the SMAD signaling pathway."

We reviewed adult patients undergoing MV surgery at our Clinic between January 2000 and December 2024. MAC was identified on preoperative imaging, and operative strategy prioritized repair when feasible and employed conservative debridement when necessary. Patients with MAC were matched 1:1 with patients without MAC using a propensity score.
Among 11,350 MV operations with or without concomitant procedures, 1,603 patients (14.1%) had MAC, the median age was 72.6 years [interquartile range (IQR), 65.3-78.6 years], 54.8% were female. In the MAC cohort, 21% of patients had a prior sternotomy. Concomitant aortic valve replacement (AVR) and coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) were performed in 32% and 24% of cases, respectively. Compared with propensity-matched controls, MAC patients did not exhibit significantly prolonged cardiopulmonary bypass times (115 vs. 112 minutes, P=0.485) or aortic cross-clamp durations (86 vs. 81 minutes, P=0.273). The 30-day hospital readmission rate was significantly higher among MAC patients (15.9% vs. 9.9%, P<0.001). Although 30-day mortality was elevated in the MAC group (5.8% vs. 4.2%), the difference was not statistically significant (P=0.171). In a subgroup analysis of matched groups undergoing primary isolated MV surgery, early mortality was 2.7% in patients with MAC and 0.5% in patients without MAC (P=0.111). Long-term, 10-year survival was significantly lower in MAC patients (43.6%) compared to matched controls (49.6%, P<0.001).
In this large single-center series, patients with MAC often had associated aortic valve and coronary artery disease, and 21% of them were undergoing a second procedure. Compared to matched patients without MAC, long-term survival was reduced in patients with MAC. This experience highlights the importance of accurate preoperative assessment and tailored surgical strategy to achieve acceptable outcomes of MV surgery in the presence of MAC."

The framework aims to generate robust, transferable video representations that enhance downstream performance across diverse echocardiogram datasets and clinical scenarios. Leveraging the publicly available MIMIC-IV-ECHO dataset, we employ an advanced masked auto-encoding strategy with 85% mask ratio to pre-train our echo-video encoder without requiring manual annotations. To further improve the learned representations, we introduce Spatial-Temporal Fusion Network (STF-Net), which integrates spatial and temporal correlations from the learned video representations through dual pathways that process joint and disjoint space-time features. Echo-Vision-FM demonstrated outstanding performance in heart function diagnosis, achieving an accuracy of 0.905, an F1 score of 0.941, and an Area Under the Curve (AUC) of 0.931 on EchoNet-Dynamic dataset, while reaching an AUC of 0.849 for aortic stenosis diagnosis on TMED dataset. In cardiac morphological value estimation, Echo-Vision-FM outperformed state-of-the-art models, achieving a mean absolute error of 3.87% and an r² value of 0.825 in left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) prediction on EchoNet-Dynamic dataset. The model also showed substantial improvements in estimating end-systolic and end-diastolic volumes, with r² values of 0.782 and 0.742, respectively. On the CAMUS dataset, our end-to-end approach achieved a Pearson correlation coefficient of 86.49% for LVEF estimation, significantly outperforming traditional segmentation-based methods while eliminating the need for intermediate post-processing steps. Incorporating STF-Net resulted in further performance improvements across all tasks, with consistent gains observed when combined with both randomly initialized and pre-trained encoders. Echo-Vision-FM provides a powerful, scalable approach to echocardiogram analysis, with significant potential for clinical diagnostics and research, demonstrating robust cross-institutional generalizability and data efficiency in low-resource settings."

However, individual patient data (IPD) was not used and the possibility of biases not considered.
A systematic review of randomized clinical trials (RCTs) whose primary outcome was mortality and unplanned cardiac hospitalization. IPD data was reconstructed, permitting calculation of time varying risks. Bayesian analyses, with vague priors, were performed for each trial and combined in a meta-analysis.
Four RCTs were identified. The pooled average long-term primary outcome was hazard ratio (HR) 0.52 (95% credible interval (CrI) 0.25 - 0.93) and the predicted HR for the next study was HR 0.52 (95% CrI 0.13 - 1.87) with increased uncertainty from between study heterogeneity. Only the EARLY_TAVR trial showed improved outcomes in year one (HR 0.33, 95% CrI 0.24 - 0.46), driven by a 142% increase in the crossover rate compared to previous trials. A one-year landmark analysis, that eliminates possible early unblinding bias, showed no long term AVR benefit for any individual study or for the pooled result (RR 0.59, 95% CI 0.20 - 1.40).
One-year landmark analysis showed no definitive longer-term benefit for early AVR compared to CS in asymptomatic AS. The early TAVR benefit is possibly the result of performance bias. Further research is required before early AVR for asymptomatic AS can become the new standard of care."

Cardiothoracic imaging,"Purpose To compare the performance of cardiac CT-derived hybrid aortic valve area (AVA) and planimetry, in combination with aortic valve calcium (AVC) or AVC density (AVCd), for assessing low-gradient aortic stenosis (LGAS). Materials and Methods This retrospective analysis included patients with LGAS (mean gradient < 40 mm Hg) who underwent echocardiography and cardiac CT from November 2018 to March 2022. The performance of absolute and indexed hybrid AVA and planimetry, combined with either absolute AVC or AVCd, was compared by time-to-event analysis and outcome classification ability. Results A total of 215 patients (mean age, 79.2 years ± 8.4 [SD]; 118 male patients) were included in the study. Of these, 74.4% (160 of 215) experienced a composite outcome of valve intervention or all-cause mortality during follow-up. Specifically, 11% (23 of 215) underwent surgical aortic valve replacement, 59% (126 of 215) underwent transcatheter aortic valve replacement, and 15% (32 of 215) died. The median follow-up duration was 478 days (IQR, 283-716 days). Indexed AVA measures performed better than absolute AVA. All models showed comparable discrimination, as measured by Harrell C statistic. The highest performing model was indexed AVA calculated using left ventricular outflow tract area derived from minimum CT diameter combined with absolute AVC (hazard ratio, 2.29; 95% CI: 1.66, 3.15; P < .001; C statistic, 0.60). The lowest performing model was absolute AVA planimetry with AVCd (hazard ratio, 1.62; 95% CI: 1.19, 2.22; P = .002; C statistic, 0.55). Conclusion Diagnostic strategies involving hybrid AVA and AVC or AVCd demonstrated comparable performance in LGAS assessment. Indexed hybrid AVA measures performed better alone or in combination with AVC compared with the absolute AVA measures.

Recently, artificial intelligence (AI)-based screening using non-invasive and widely available modalities such as electrocardiography (ECG) and chest x-ray(CXR) has gained increasing attention for valvular heart disease. However, single-modality approaches have inherent limitations, and in clinical practice, multimodality assessment is common. In this study, we developed a multimodal AI model integrating ECG and CXR within a cooperative learning framework to evaluate its utility for earlier detection of AS.
We retrospectively analyzed 23,886 patient records from 7,483 patients who underwent ECG, CXR, and echocardiography. A multimodal model was developed by combining a 1D ResNet50-Transformer architecture for ECG data with an EfficientNet-based architecture for CXR. Cooperative learning was implemented using a loss function that allowed the ECG and CXR models to refine each other's predictions. We split the dataset into training, validation, and test sets, and performed 1,000 bootstrap iterations to assess model stability. AS was defined echocardiographically as peak velocity ≥2.5 m/s, mean pressure gradient ≥20 mmHg, or aortic valve area ≤1.5 cm2.
Among 7,483 patients, 608 (8.1%) were diagnosed with AS. The multimodal model achieved a test AUROC of 0.812 (95% CI: 0.792-0.832), outperforming the ECG model (0.775, 95% CI: 0.753-0.796) and the CXR model (0.755, 95% CI: 0.732-0.777). Visualization techniques (Grad-CAM, Transformer attention) highlighted distinct yet complementary features in AS patients.
The multimodal AI model via cooperative learning outperformed single-modality methods in AS detection and may aid earlier diagnosis and reduce clinical burden."

PubMed,aortic stenosis,Development of a standardized ovine aortic stenosis model: a pathomimetic platform for TAVI evaluation and durability testing.,Yan Zhu; Nana Qin; Jie Hou; Baoyin Li; Fangxu Liu; Xin Jiang; Zhuo Chen; Xiongtao Lin; Xiaohang Tong; Xufeng Wei; Dejian Li; Mengsi Hu,10.3389/fcvm.2025.1663130,2025,Frontiers in cardiovascular medicine,"Transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) has gained widespread clinical acceptance owing to its minimally invasive approach and enhanced postoperative recovery. This study developed a standardized ovine aortic stenosis (AS) model through surgical implantation of a circular bioengineered annular stent in the aortic root, creating a reproducible pathomimetic platform for TAVI evaluation. Following hemodynamic stabilization, TAVI procedures were performed to systematically assess mid-to-long-term valve functionality and calcification progression.
AS model was established in 11 sheep using extracorporeal circulation assistance technology. Following hemodynamic stabilization (2-4 weeks), TAVI was performed. The modeled sheep were divided into two groups to monitor valve conditions at 3 months (n = 6) and 6 months (n = 5), respectively. Additionally, a non-modeled control group was established, with valve conditions assessed at 3 months (n = 2) and 6 months (n = 1). Preoperative ultrasound data, collected on the day of TAVI, which served as the baseline. Key hemodynamic parameters including blood flow velocity, transvalvular pressure gradient, and left ventricular ejection fraction were measured at 30, 90, and 180 days postoperatively, in accordance with Valve Academic Research Consortium-3 (VARC-3), to evaluate temporal changes in hemodynamics. The effects of the AS model on valve function were further analyzed by integrating final histopathological findings and calcification degree outcomes.
Successful AS model establishment was achieved in all 11 sheep, with significant increases in mean transvalvular pressure gradient (Δ+17.98 ± 12.71 mmHg) and peak flow velocity observed post-modeling (Δ+ 2.23 ± 0.38 m/s). Post-TAVI evaluation demonstrated progressive hemodynamic normalization, achieving pre-modeling levels (1.72 vs. 6.91 mmHg, P = 0.058/0.80 vs. 1.51 m/s, P = 0.065) at 180-day follow-up. LVEF remained stable throughout the experimental period. Histopathological analysis indicated comparable calcification burden between 90 and 180 days (Calcium Content: P = 0.7459 and Calcification Score: P = 0.5455).
The surgically induced ovine AS model effectively replicates clinically relevant hemodynamic perturbations while maintaining excellent procedural feasibility. TAVI in this model achieves complete hemodynamic normalization without accelerating bioprosthetic valve degeneration or calcification. This standardized preclinical platform enables rigorous evaluation of TAVI device performance and durability, providing robust scientific validation for translational applications."
PubMed,aortic stenosis,Clinical outcomes of monitored anesthesia care vs. general anesthesia in transfemoral transcatheter aortic valve implantation: a single-center retrospective study.,Haoran Zhang; Tao Chen; Bo Yu; Donghui Zhang,10.3389/fcvm.2025.1652045,2025,Frontiers in cardiovascular medicine,"Transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) has become a preferred treatment for severe aortic stenosis in high-risk patients. In China, general anesthesia (GA) remains the standard; however, monitored anesthesia care (MAC) offers a less-invasive alternative. In this study, we compared the outcomes between MAC and GA in transfemoral TAVI.
We retrospectively analyzed the data from 106 consecutive patients (54 MAC, 52 GA) who underwent TAVI at a The Second Affiliated Hospital of Harbin Medical University from January 2021 to November 2023. MAC involved administration of a combination of local anesthesia with dexmedetomidine/remifentanil sedation, whereas GA involved endotracheal intubation. We compared procedural metrics, complications, and lengths of hospital stays.
The baseline characteristics were comparable between the groups (mean age: 70.3 ± 7.3 years, 46% with reduced ejection fraction). The MAC group showed shorter procedure times (102 ± 25 vs. 145 ± 42 min, p < 0.0001) and hospital stays (10.5 ± 3.7 vs. 14.1 ± 5.1 days, p < 0.0001), compared with the GA group. Safety outcomes were similar between the groups: 30-day mortality (5.8% vs. 7.4% in the MAC and GA groups, respectively, p = 0.734), stroke (1.9% in both groups), and major vascular complications (3.8% vs. 5.6%). The GA group had higher valve-in-valve rates (13% vs. 1.9%, p = 0.024) and postoperative hypotension (4 vs. 0 patients), compared with the MAC group. Pacemaker implantation was more frequent in the MAC group vs. the GA group (13% vs. 3.8%, p = 0.229).
The use of MAC for TAVI is comparably safe to using GA, with potential advantages in recovery speed and resource utilization. A heart team approach, including cardiac anesthesiologists, is critical for optimal patient selection."

Kinovea, as an accessible motion-analysis software, provides both visual and quantitative feedback. However, its application in supporting technique development among beginner athletes remains insufficiently explored. Aim: This study aims to describe the use of Kinovea in biomechanics training and examine its contribution to the awareness of kinematic characteristics and movement techniques among beginner athletes. Methods: A descriptive qualitative design involved 72 beginner athletes aged 18–25 years selected through purposive sampling. Data were collected over 16 weeks through interviews, field observations, and motion video recordings analyzed using Kinovea. Kinematic data focused on joint angles, stride behavior, and movement phases during walking, running, and the flight phase. Qualitative data were analyzed using content analysis with NVivo 12, while kinematic results were interpreted descriptively to identify performance patterns and areas for technical refinement. Result: Kinematic analysis showed coordinated joint-angle patterns across all phases. Walking analysis identified arm swing angles of 50.9°–58.8° and leg separation angles of 64.3°–67.2°, indicating a stable gait rhythm. The running analysis revealed knee angles of 68.8°–69.8° and elbow angles of 87.6°–89.1°, indicating efficient propulsive mechanics. The flight phase demonstrated knee angles of 81.2°–87.8° and elbow angles of 80.4°–88.3°, suggesting effective momentum use and postural stability. These measurements supported stride-efficiency assessment and technique evaluation. Qualitative findings revealed that Kinovea enabled athletes to interpret movement phases and identify technical inefficiencies through slow-motion and frame-by-frame visualization. Conclusion: Kinovea supports basic motion analysis by providing clear kinematic information and helping beginner athletes observe and refine their movement techniques. The findings also offer practical value for coaches by enabling more precise identification of inefficient patterns and guiding targeted corrections during early-stage training."
