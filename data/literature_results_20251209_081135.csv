PubMed,aortic stenosis,Negative expansion resistance (NER) phenomenon predicts hemodynamically non-significant coronary lesions.,Ahmet Tas; Ilke Kara Tas; Yaren Alan; Kim H Parker; Tim P van de Hoef; Murat Sezer; Jan J Piek,10.1038/s41598-025-29670-3,2025-12-08,Scientific reports,"Revascularization decision for intermediate stenoses necessitates consideration of their hemodynamic impact. We report the use of distal coronary pressure (Pd) above proximal aortic pressure (Pa) during the early expansion period as a visual dichotomous marker (negative expansion resistance, NER) for rapid clinical decision-making. Simultaneous pressure and velocity signals were used to calculate instantaneous wave-free ratio (iFR), fractional flow reserve (FFR), hyperemic stenosis resistance (hSR), and to identify the NER. NER was defined as the Pd > Pa during the early-expansion period, which refers to early-decompression of coronary circulation marked by pressure decay (dP/dt < 0) coinciding the time-window of reduced ejection phase of systole to early diastole. Classification performance of NER was evaluated against iFR, FFR and hSR. Out of 475 lesions with mean diameter stenosis of 61% ± 16% from 388 patients with chronic coronary syndrome (CCS), 46%(217/475) exhibited the NER-phenomenon. Of these, 96% (209/217) had an iFR above 0.89(NPV = 0.96[95%CI 93-98] PPV = 0.47[95%CI 41-54]) indicating hemodynamically non-significant lesions. 94%(204/217) of the NER( +) lesions had an hSR below 0.80(NPV = 0.94 [95%CI 90-97] PPV = 0.36[95%CI 30-42]), and 88%(191/217) had an FFR above 0.80 (NPV = 0.88[95%CI 83-92] PPV = 0.53[95%CI 46-59]), indicating non-flow limiting lesions. Of 8 lesions with NER despite an abnormal iFR, only 1 had abnormal hSR, whereas 7 had normal hSR. Of 162 lesions with abnormal FFR, iFR identified 53 (33%) as 'normal' whereas NER was present in 26 (16%) of these cases.NER was associated with instantaneously stronger coronary decompression wave(8.0 ± 11.2 vs 5.5 ± 10.1 10.kW.m-2.s-2 p:0.016) and higher flow acceleration(195 ± 204 vs 106 ± 182 cm.s-2 p < 0.001). In conclusion, the NER, visually recognized by resting pressure tracings, rules out flow-limiting lesions in CCS with high certainty, offering a simple first-line evaluation for clinical decision-making, and warrants prospective clinical studies."
PubMed,aortic stenosis,Ambulatory General Anesthesia for Dental Treatment in a Patient With Williams Syndrome and Supravalvular Aortic Restenosis: A Case Report.,Yukako Tsutsui; Hitomi Izumikawa; Miyuki Itakura; Katsuhisa Sunada,10.2344/24-0032,2025-12-09,Anesthesia progress,"Williams syndrome (WS) is a genetic disorder marked by intellectual disability, distinctive craniofacial features, dental abnormalities, and congenital heart defects, particularly supravalvular aortic stenosis-a narrowing above the aortic valve. Patients with WS are at increased risk of perioperative sudden cardiac death, necessitating thorough cardiovascular assessment. Additionally, craniofacial anomalies such as micrognathia and retrognathia may lead to difficult airway management and often require awake intubation. However, awake intubation and hospitalization can be distressing for patients with WS due to their developmental challenges. These facts indicate the importance of identifying during the preoperative assessment for ambulatory general anesthesia those at low risk for cardiovascular complications and airway difficulties. This case report details the successful anesthetic management of a 9-year-old boy with WS undergoing ambulatory general anesthesia for dental treatment by maintaining a balance between myocardial oxygen supply and demand to minimize cardiovascular fluctuations and by paying careful attention to managing his airway. Our case highlights the feasibility and safety of ambulatory general anesthesia for patients with WS, minimizing hospitalization stress and ensuring patient safety."

HCM phenotype cases were defined as cats with echocardiographic findings of a maximum left ventricular wall thickness (LVWT) ≥6 mm on at least one presentation. TMT was defined as an increased LVWT ≥6 mm on at least two presentations, a subsequent decrease in LVWT of more than 25% within 6 months, no subsequent increase in left atrial-to-aortic root ratio (LA/Ao) ≥20% from baseline, and a fractional shortening ≤30%. A total of 145 cats had HCM phenotypes. Among cats that underwent serial echocardiography (n = 53), 16 were diagnosed with TMT and 34 with HCM. At presentation, the maximum LVWT was 8.3 ± 1.7 mm in cats with TMT, and decreased to 5.4 ± 0.9 mm after a median of 3.5 months [1-6 months]. Two cats initially classified as TMT were later identified as TMT on HCM based on persistent LV thickening, and all cats with TMT survived until the time of publication. The prevalence of TMT may be higher than expected when including asymptomatic TMT and TMT on HCM. Clinicians should be aware of the possibility of dynamic changes in myocardial thickness in cats."

However, the interpretation of variants, especially those of uncertain significance (VUSs), remains challenging for laboratories and clinicians. In April 2024, the ClinGen Cardiomyopathy Variant Curation Expert Panel (VCEP) adapted the ACMG/AMP criteria for eight of the sarcomeric genes (MYH7, MYBPC3, TNNI3, TNNT2, TPM1, ACTC1, MYL2, and MYL3), providing a refined framework for variant interpretation in these genes. This retrospective study re-evaluated 69 VUSs identified in 84 HCM patients between 2017 and 2024, aiming to resolve uncertainty and reduce the VUS rate.
Here, two groups of curators reinterpreted variants with the most recent data using the Cardiomyopathy VCEP specifications until a consensus was reached. To streamline the process, we created a semiautomated decision support tool based on these gene-specific rules.
The application of the Cardiomyopathy VCEP specifications resulted in the reclassification of 17.4% (N = 12/69, 95% CI: 10.2%-28.0%) of VUS, whereas the new data alone were not sufficient. Out of the reclassified variants, 91.7% (N = 11/12) were downgraded to benignity (involving 17 patients), and 8.3% were upgraded to pathogenicity (involving one patient), with a mean reclassification time of 68.3 months, corresponding to 5.7 years. The most applied criteria were related to population (PM2 = 55%; BA1/BS1 = 16%), bioinformatic prediction (PP3 = 45%; BP4 = 25%), and critical domains (PM1 = 21%). However, most codes suffer from a lack of evidence (segregation data, functional assays, and case-control studies). When comparing this curation with classifications in public databases, 13.3% (N = 8/60) and 16.2% (N = 11/68) of variants listed as having inconclusive significance in ClinVar and CardioClassifier were, respectively, reclassified in this study.
Using gene-specific ACMG/AMP criteria reduces the rate of VUS, increasing diagnostic yield, and informing clinical management in the context of HCM. Nonetheless, ongoing efforts to generate evidence and promote standardization remain essential to improve variant interpretation."

Patients with cirrhosis frequently experience exacerbated AS symptoms due to the hyperdynamic circulatory state induced by portal hypertension, which masks early AS signs, resulting in delayed diagnosis. The coexistence of AS and liver disease significantly complicates management, particularly for those awaiting liver transplantation (LT), where untreated AS can increase perioperative morbidity and mortality. This review examines the pathophysiology, clinical manifestations, and management of AS in cirrhotic patients, with a focus on implications for LT candidates. Available treatment options, including surgical aortic valve replacement and transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR), are discussed, with TAVR emerging as a preferred approach due to favorable outcomes in high-risk patients. We also explore the potential role of TAVR as a bridge to LT, with case reports showing promising, albeit anecdotal, success in restoring LT candidacy. Limitations in current perioperative risk assessment tools, which inadequately address the unique risks faced by cirrhotic patients undergoing cardiac procedures, highlight the need for multi-disciplinary care and further research to improve outcomes of patients with concomitant end-stage liver disease and AS."
PubMed,aortic stenosis,Severe cardiac valvular calcification in two Chinese brothers with mandibuloacral dysplasia type A: a case report.,Yi Guo; Xinyi Zhang; Yanfei Meng; Qiuzhe Guo; Xiaoqi Wang,10.3389/fcvm.2025.1657197,2025,Frontiers in cardiovascular medicine,"Mandibuloacral dysplasia type A (MADA) is a rare progeroid syndrome associated with mutations in the Lamin A/C (LMNA) gene, primarily affecting skeletal, cutaneous, and adipose tissues. While certain LMNA gene mutations are known to cause cardiomyopathy and conduction system disease, severe early-onset calcific valvular heart disease is not conventionally considered a typical feature of MADA. This report describes two brothers from a consanguineous Han Chinese family who presented with classical MADA phenotypes alongside severe, early-onset cardiac valvular calcification. Genetic investigation revealed that both affected brothers carried a homozygous missense mutation, c.785A > G (p.Glu262Gly), in the LMNA gene. The elder brother, aged 41, successfully underwent transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) due to severe aortic valve stenosis. This finding represents the first association, to our knowledge, between the homozygous LMNA c.785A > G (p.Glu262Gly) mutation and significant severe early-onset cardiac valvular calcification manifesting as a prominent feature within the MADA phenotype, thus expanding the clinical spectrum associated with MADA and this specific LMNA variant. This case highlights a potentially underrecognized cardiovascular manifestation in MADA patients and underscores the importance of comprehensive cardiac assessment in affected individuals, particularly those from consanguineous families."

Workup excluded acute coronary syndrome, pulmonary embolism, aortic dissection, and mesenteric ischemia. CT angiography revealed severe proximal celiac trunk stenosis, an ectatic descending thoracic aorta, bilateral renal cysts, emphysema, and a hepatic hypodensity. Further evaluation demonstrated non-obstructive coronary disease, possibly related to endothelial dysfunction. This case highlights the diagnostic complexity of back pain and chest pain in elderly patients with other comorbidities, emphasizing the importance of distinguishing incidental vascular findings from clinically significant pathology. A multidisciplinary approach involving cardiology, vascular surgery, gastroenterology, pulmonology, and nutrition services was required to optimize care."

Thus, following the expansion of TAVR use and constant improvements in TAVR platforms and implantation techniques, implementation has been extended to special population groups that were previously underrepresented in clinical trials. This review evaluates the role of TAVR in patients with unique clinical considerations, including those with active malignancies, psychiatric disorders, and advanced organ dysfunction. By examining current literature, we provide insights into the safety, efficacy, appropriateness, and specific challenges associated with TAVR in these patient groups."
PubMed,aortic stenosis,Mitral Valve Repair for Mitral Regurgitation Associated with Antiphospholipid Syndrome: A Case Report.,Masaru Yoshikai; Hisashi Sato; Nagi Hayashi; Kouta Shimauchi; Naoyo Nishida,10.70352/scrj.cr.25-0470,2025,Surgical case reports,"Antiphospholipid syndrome (APS) is a multisystem autoimmune disorder of hypercoagulability, characterized by arterial and venous thrombosis, recurrent fetal losses, thrombocytopenia, and circulating antiphospholipid antibodies. Among valvular manifestations associated with APS, mitral regurgitation (MR) is the most common, followed by aortic regurgitation. Surgical interventions for APS-related valvular diseases carry high perioperative morbidity and mortality. There are no established guidelines regarding the surgical management of APS-related MR.
A 46-year-old man underwent mitral valve repair for severe MR. Histopathological examination of the vegetation on the mitral valve revealed nonbacterial thrombotic endocarditis, and in combination with laboratory findings, the MR was diagnosed as associated with APS. Leaflet thickening and fusion progressed postoperatively, leading to moderate-to-severe MR and mitral stenosis within 2 years.
In cases where MR is the initial presentation of APS, preoperative diagnosis of APS can be challenging. Detailed, frame-by-frame transesophageal echocardiographic evaluation may aid in the preoperative identification of subtle valvular abnormalities suggestive of APS. When thrombocytopenia and a prolonged activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT) are identified during preoperative evaluation for valvular heart disease, tests for lupus anticoagulant, anticardiolipin antibody, and anti-β2 glycoprotein I antibody should be performed, and consultation with hematologists is recommended. Valve repair for MR associated with APS, which preserves valvular tissue that may become diseased in the future, is likely to result in poor outcomes."

Moreover, limited evidence exists regarding the outcomes of patients with very LG severe AS following transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI).
We aimed to elucidate the prognosis of patients with very LG severe AS after TAVI and the influence of flow status.
Data were retrospectively collected from the OCEAN-TAVI multicenter registry in Japan, including patients with severe AS who underwent TAVI.
In total, 7103 patients were classified into three groups based on their baseline mean pressure gradient (MPG): very LG (MPG ≤ 20 mmHg), LG (20 < MPG < 40 mmHg), and high-gradient (HG) (MPG ≥ 40 mmHg). The primary endpoint was a composite of all-cause mortality and hospitalization for heart failure. During a median follow-up period of 741 days, the composite endpoint was reached in 2081 patients. Patients with very LG severe AS had a higher prevalence of comorbidities. Kaplan-Meier analysis showed that very LG severe AS was associated with significantly lower event-free survival compared to that with LG and HG severe AS. Multivariable Cox regression analysis identified very LG severe AS as an independent poor prognostic indicator, regardless of the flow state. Moreover, within the very LG severe AS group, a low body mass index and myocardial infarction history were associated with worse outcomes.
This study indicates that patients with very LG severe AS have worse prognoses compared to those with LG or HG severe AS following TAVI, regardless of the flow state."

Diastolic dysfunction (DD) has been reported in up to 54.4 % of TAVR patients (predominantly grade 1) and severe (grade 3) DD in ~13.4 % in prior cohorts and predicts poor outcomes. N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-pro-BNP), a marker of ventricular stress, shows promise in enhancing risk assessment. This study evaluates NT-pro-BNP's utility in detecting DD and predicting outcomes in severe AS patients with preserved EF undergoing TAVR.
This retrospective study included 1594 patients with severe AS (aortic valve area < 1 cm2) and EF ≥50 % undergoing TAVR at Cleveland Clinic (2016-2020). Of these, 784 had complete echocardiographic DD data. Pre- and post-TAVR NT-pro-BNP levels, clinical, and echocardiographic parameters were analyzed. DD was classified using Mitral valve (MV) E/e', tricuspid regurgitation (TR) velocity, and left atrial volume index (LAVi). The Youden Index determined the optimal NT-pro-BNP cut-off, with outcomes assessed via Kaplan-Meier and Cox regression analyses.
NT-pro-BNP correlated with DD severity, with a cut-off of 802 pg/mL (sensitivity 62.3 %, specificity 54.1 %) identified. Higher NT-pro-BNP tertiles were linked to worse baseline characteristics (e.g., NYHA III/IV 65.7 %-82.5 %, p = 0.02) and echocardiographic DD markers (e.g., LAVi 37.61-50.14 mL/m2, p < 0.001). Post-TAVR, NT-pro-BNP >802 pg/mL predicted increased mortality, heart failure hospitalizations, and prolonged length of stay (p < 0.001), with Cox regression confirming NT-pro-BNP as an independent predictor (OR 1.645, 95 % CI: 1.244-2.174).
NT-proBNP should be considered a complementary biomarker of DD and predicts adverse outcomes in severe AS patients with preserved EF undergoing TAVR, supporting its integration into pre-procedural risk stratification to optimize management."

Currently available lipid-lowering pharmacotherapies have limited effects on elevated levels of Lp(a) and several new therapies are in development to lower Lp(a).
This article reviews the novel therapies in development to reduce Lp(a) in patients with elevated levels. These were identified by a PubMed search and mainly focus on the drugs that are at an advanced stage of development.
The N-acetylgalactosamine (GalNAc)-conjugated antisense oligonucleotide (ASO) pelacarsen and the small-interfering RNA (siRNA) agents olpasiran, lepodisiran and zerlasiran have all been shown to be safe and effective in lowering Lp(a) levels between 80% and almost 100%. Pelacarsen, olpasiran, and lepodisiran are being tested in phase 3 cardiovascular outcome studies and the first results may be available in 2026. Muvalaplin is a small molecule given orally once daily and reduces Lp(a) by up to 65%. It is also being assessed in a cardiovascular outcome study. It will be essential to identify what baseline level of Lp(a) is needed and what degree of Lp(a) lowering is required to produce a cardiovascular benefit and whether aggressive lowering of Lp(a) has any adverse effects."

Publicly available trial information (ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT06861361) was reviewed, and the design was benchmarked against the minimum expected methodological standards for generating practice-changing evidence in patients with very long life expectancy (LE) following SAVR. The appraisal domains included objectives and study endpoints; selected non-inferiority (NI) margins; adequacy of follow-up for late events; statistical analysis plans and handling of crossovers/missing data; consistency of surgical comparators; and prespecified sub-groups.
Several major concerns were identified: (1) co-primary safety/efficacy composites mix hard adverse events (death, stroke) with softer outcomes, with rehospitalization likely to dominate; (2) limited duration primary follow-up (30 days/1 year), with only optional survaillance beyond 5 years, inadequate for durability and late hazards; (3) wide NI margins (7%-8%) that could accept clinically meaningful inferiority; (4) an unclear statistical analysis plan; (5) a device-specific TAVI arm versus heterogeneous SAVR comparator; and (6) up to 25% bicuspid anatomy without stratified randomization or powered analyses. Collectively, these choices markedly increase the risks of type I error, and misinterpretation in a population with likely crossing hazard curves and a long median LE comparable to that of the age-matched general population after SAVR.
In order to generate guideline-informing evidence for extending TAVI to younger patients with severe AS, the trial should prioritise hard adverse endpoints, tighten NI margins, mandate extended follow-up, standardise the surgical comparator, and adequately power the bicuspid subgroup. Without these revisions, continuing the study under the current protocol risks yielding biased, non-guideline informative results."

Between November 2020 and November 2022, 142 patients with a small aortic valve annulus underwent AVR at Wuhan Asia Heart Hospital, with 73 patients in mechanical group and 69 in biological group. All patients met the surgical criteria for AVR. Baseline data, historical diseases, preoperative and follow-up echocardiographic results, and surgical-related data were shown in this study.
All patients successfully underwent surgery. In the mechanical valve group, four perioperative deaths occurred due to multiple organ failure, respiratory and cardiac arrest and circulatory failure. After one-year follow-up, hemodynamic parameters improved in both groups compared with preoperative values. Although the mechanical valve group demonstrated lower peak pressure gradients and maximum velocity compared with the bioprosthetic valve group in the follow-up period (P < 0.05), the bioprosthetic valve group exhibited shorter Intensive Care Unit (ICU) stay(3.6 ± 2.5d vs. 5.3 ± 7.9d, P < 0.001 ) and cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) times (178.1 ± 89.0 min vs. 192.4 ± 124.3 min, P = 0.032), and fewer postoperative complications at the one-year follow-up (4.3% vs. 14.9%, P = 0.026). No cerebrovascular events, valve dysfunction, or structural valve degeneration were observed in either group during the follow-up period.
Both mechanical and bioprosthetic valves showed excellent short-term outcomes in small aortic annulus patients. Bioprosthetic valves were comparable to mechanical valves, with potential benefits in reducing ICU stay, CPB time, and complications. For elderly patients, bioprosthetic valves are a safe and effective alternative in small aortic annulus AVR."

Epilepsy incurs a higher risk for developing CVD with an odds ratio of 2.25. CVDs can influence the function of the brain, and many brain diseases are linked with CV dysfunction, in a resiprocal relationship (neurocardiac axis). In patients with epilepsy, interactions along this neuro-cardiac axis appear to be involved in CVDs, such as hypertension and cardiac arrhythmias including atrial fibrillation, long QT syndrome, catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia, and sudden cardiac death (SCD) in epilepsy. Heart-brain interactions may comprise 2 wide categories: CV effects of neurological disease and neurological effects of CVD. The pathogenesis of neurogenic CV effects may involve a neurogenic cascade where sudden shifts in autonomic balance lead to an exaggerated catecholamine release. This can occur in acute neurological conditions such as ischemic stroke, intracranial hemorrhage, and epilepsy. Cardiovascular complications comprise the stroke-heart syndrome, neurogenic pulmonary edema and cardiomyopathy, Takotsubo syndrome, cardiac arrhythmias, and SCD. Specific areas of the brain, such as the insular cortex, play key roles in cardiac autonomic regulation, and disorders involving these areas have greater effects on the CV system. On the other hand, CV conditions can adversely influence the neurological system. Atrial fibrillation and intracardiac thrombus can cause cardioembolic strokes, whereas heart failure and severe aortic stenosis might account for cognitive impairment. This neuro-cardiac axis is herein detailed and the heart-lung-brain interactions in patients with epilepsy are pictorially illustrated. The epileptogenic and anti-epileptogenic medications and the results of reports of meta-analyses on the CV outcomes of patients with epilepsy are tabulated."

This meta-analysis aims to compare the clinical outcomes of TAVR in IC versus non-IC patients. A comprehensive search was conducted across PubMed, EMBASE, and Cochrane Central for randomized controlled trials and observational studies that compared outcomes between IC and non-IC patients undergoing TAVR. Primary outcomes included 1-year all-cause, cardiovascular (CV) and non-CV mortality. Secondary outcomes included new permanent pacemaker implantation (PPI) and major periprocedural complications. 4,478 patients in seven studies (mean age 80.5 years, 7.64% IC) were included in the analysis. As compared with non-IC patients, IC patients exhibited a similar 30-day death rate (Odds Ratio (OR) 1.62; 95% Confidence Interval (CI) 0.68 - 3.98; p=0.297), but significantly higher 1-year all-cause mortality (OR 2.39; 95% CI 1.55 - 3.70; p < 0.001). Notably, IC patients demonstrated a lower risk of CV death (OR 0.24; 95% CI 0.10 - 0.59; p = 0.002) but a higher risk of non-CV death (OR 4.16; 95% CI 1.70 - 10.18; p = 0.002). There was no difference in the rate of new PPI or major periprocedural complications. In conclusion, TAVR is a safe and effective treatment strategy in IC patients, with similar short-term mortality and increased medium-term mortality risk as compared with non-IC patients.

The primary outcome was the association between cardiac damage stages and all-cause mortality under medical surveillance.
Of 4026 patients (median age, 72 [61-80] years), 78% had moderate AR, 11% had moderate-severe, and 11% had severe AR. Cardiac damage was present in 87% of patients: 14% in stage 1, 53% in stage 2, 18% in stage 3, and 2% in stage 4. In a multivariable model, including age, sex, AR severity, and Charlson Comorbidity Index, cardiac damage stages were associated with mortality. Adjusted hazard ratios were 1.42 (95% CI, 1.04-1.96) for stage 1, 1.58 (95% CI, 1.21-2.06) for stage 2, 2.78 (95% CI, 2.10-3.67) for stage 3, and 5.34 (95% CI, 3.67-7.76) for stage 4. Adding cardiac damage staging to multivariable models improved predictive accuracy for mortality, increasing the concordance statistics from 0.73 (95% CI, 0.71-0.75) to 0.76 (95% CI, 0.74-0.77).
Cardiac damage is present in nearly 90% of patients with moderate or greater AR and is associated with increased mortality, highlighting the need for a more comprehensive evaluation of cardiac structure and function beyond the aortic valve and left ventricle."

Symptom-based referral often occurs after the onset of adverse ventricular remodeling, whereas earlier surgery may improve long-term outcomes but introduces procedural risk. This article synthesized contemporary evidence to delineate optimal strategies in this intermediate-risk population. In aortic stenosis, randomized trials including RECOVERY and AVATAR demonstrate that early surgical aortic valve replacement reduces heart failure events and may improve survival. In aortic and mitral regurgitation, observational data associate early intervention, triggered by mild symptoms or subclinical ventricular dysfunction, with improved survival and preservation of cardiac function. Emerging modalities such as global longitudinal strain and natriuretic peptide biomarkers enhance risk stratification in asymptomatic individuals. Prosthesis selection is primarily informed by patient age, comorbidity burden, and anticoagulation tolerance. Mechanical valves confer superior durability and lower reoperation risk in younger patients. Bioprosthetic valves are increasingly favored in older adults due to compatibility with transcatheter valve-in-valve reintervention and avoidance of lifelong anticoagulation. Comparative cohort studies and meta-analyses suggest a survival benefit for mechanical valves up to approximately 65-to-70 years of age, beyond which the benefit diminishes due to competing mortality risks. Evidence supports timely surgical referral in mildly symptomatic patients, particularly in the presence of early imaging or biomarker evidence of ventricular dysfunction. Individualized decision-making through multidisciplinary heart team evaluation remains essential. Further investigations are warranted to define long-term prosthetic durability and the role of early surgery in valvular regurgitation."

A systematic search on PubMed, Embase, Scopus, and Web of Science was conducted, covering studies published from their inception up to February 2024. Peer-reviewed studies that used echocardiograms to screen for cardiac abnormalities were included. Nine thousand five hundred fifty-four cases met the inclusion criteria and were included in the final data synthesis. A meta-analysis was performed to calculate the pooled prevalence of cardiac abnormalities and a 95% confidence interval (CI). Results were divided into subgroups to reveal the prevalence of each cardiac abnormality for further consideration.
7.5% had cardiac abnormalities. Valvular diseases are the most common cardiac abnormalities. Tricuspid regurgitation (TR) is the most prevalent, accounting for 24.4% of cases. This is followed by mitral regurgitation (MR) at 17%, mitral valve prolapse (MVP) at 8%, aortic regurgitation (AR) at 3.8%, and pulmonary insufficiency at 1.9%. In addition, other valvular diseases collectively make up 22% of the findings. Congenital heart diseases (CHD) were also included in the results, with atrial septal defect (ASD) being the most prominent at 1.5%, followed by ventricular septal defect (VSD) at 1.4%, and other CHD comprising 2.5%. Pulmonary hypertension accounts for a substantial portion of the results, representing 16.8%. A dilated aortic root and pericardial effusion were observed in 2.4% and 0.9% of cases, respectively.
Cardiovascular abnormalities are prevalent in patients with idiopathic scoliosis. This highlights the need for thorough cardiovascular screening of these patients before surgical intervention."

Cardiovascular Imaging,"Doppler-echocardiography is the primary imaging modality for the evaluation and follow-up of valvular heart devices. This article highlights the unique pitfalls associated with these devices, including imaging challenges and flow dynamics, which often push echocardiography to its limits. The use of a multimodality imaging approach including cardiac computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance, and positron emission tomography-CT is recommended to confirm the diagnosis of prosthetic valve dysfunction (PVD), quantify its severity and determine its mechanism and etiology. Thus, the distinction between non-structural and structural PVD is important to make by assessing: i) the morphology and mobility of the valve leaflets; ii) the changes in valve hemodynamic parameters during echocardiographic follow-up. Algorithms are also proposed to assess the presence and severity of residual valve regurgitation and iatrogenic stenosis following mitral or tricuspid transcatheter edge-to-edge repair. This article aims to enhance the understanding of imaging challenges and to propose solutions for clinicians managing patients with valvular heart disease devices."

We studied 41 consecutive patients who received elective isolated mitral valve repair for severe mitral regurgitation in a minimally invasive manner via a completely endoscopic platform and who underwent cardiopulmonary exercise testing in our institution between February 2018 and August 2019. There were 21 asymptomatic (group A) and 20 symptomatic (group S) patients. Physiological assessment was performed by cycle ergometer cardiopulmonary exercise testing pre-operatively and at approximately 6 months post-operatively.
Mean age was 59 ± 11.6 years and 24 patients were male (58.5%). Overall, there was no significant change in peak oxygen consumption or anaerobic threshold after surgical repair. There were no intergroup differences in terms of peak oxygen consumption, anaerobic threshold, ventilation/carbon dioxide production, or gas exchange ratio. There were no intergroup differences in any transthoracic echocardiographic variable except for post-operative left atrial dimension (group A: 35.2 ± 5.9 vs. group S: 39.8 ± 6.2, p = 0.01).

These mechanisms demand divergent strategies because inotropes and afterload reduction that may help pump failure can aggravate obstruction, whereas preload reduction that aids congestion can worsen gradients if LVOTO is present. This review synthesizes epidemiology, mechanisms, imaging pathways, hemodynamic phenotypes, management, special contexts, outcomes, and research priorities of MR in TTS using only the provided peer-reviewed sources. Transthoracic echocardiography anchors diagnosis by identifying SAM, quantifying MR, and measuring left ventricular outflow tract (LVOT) or intracavitary gradients, while transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE), cardiovascular magnetic resonance imaging (CMR), left ventriculography, and myocardial contrast echocardiography (MCE) provide complementary insights when acoustic windows are limited or when postoperative differentials must be adjudicated. Right ventricular involvement denotes a higher‑risk phenotype with more functional regurgitation and worse short-term outcomes, reinforcing the need for meticulous preload and afterload management. In patients with obstruction, therapy focuses on beta-blockers, careful volume expansion, and vasoconstrictors to restore stability. For patients with tethering-dominant MR, the priority is decongestion and customized afterload reduction. If shock persists despite these measures, temporary mechanical circulatory support can be used to bridge patients to recovery."

Despite the prevalence of TR, this condition remains undertreated due to the absence of effective medical therapy and high surgical risk. However, tricuspid transcatheter edge-to-edge repair (T-TEER) using the TriClip system has emerged as a new approach, offering a minimally invasive alternative for patients with symptomatic severe TR and prohibitive surgical risk. Thus, this comprehensive review outlines a step-by-step approach to TriClip implantation, encompassing anatomical and pathophysiological foundations, patient selection criteria, imaging protocols, and procedural techniques. Emphasis is placed on the critical role of transesophageal echocardiography for device guidance, leaflet grasping, and confirmation of procedural success. Moreover, key intra-procedural challenges and troubleshooting strategies are discussed in detail, along with post-procedural management, including antithrombotic therapy, imaging surveillance, and functional assessment. Comparative insights between TriClip and the PASCAL system are provided, highlighting technical and clinical differences, as well as implications for device selection. The emerging role of combined mitral and tricuspid TEER using a single steerable guide catheter is also explored, supported by early data suggesting the safety and efficacy of this combination. Evidence from randomized trials and real-world registries supports the safety, feasibility, and durability of TriClip-based T-TEER. Notably, as experience and technology continue to evolve, T-TEER is positioned to become a cornerstone in the management of functional TR in high-risk populations."

Dextrocardia (1-2/20,000 incidence) and interruption of the inferior vena cava are rare structural abnormalities that complicate vascular access and catheter navigation during catheter ablation.
We report the case of a 39-year-old Chinese woman with persistent atrial fibrillation, dextrocardia, interruption of the inferior vena cava (with azygos continuation to the superior vena cava), severe mitral regurgitation, and pulmonary hypertension who underwent catheter ablation in the fluoroless catheterization laboratory. After thorough preoperative imaging assessment, we decided to perform the procedure through the right femoral vein and the left internal jugular vein approaches. Intracardiac echocardiography combined with the three-dimensional electroanatomic mapping method facilitated real-time visualization of the fossa ovalis and transseptal needle positioning without fluoroscopy. We safely completed the transseptal puncture by using this method. Pulmonary vein isolation and posterior wall box isolation were performed using a SmartTouch Surround Flow catheter, despite limited catheter maneuverability due to anatomical constraints. Successful sinus rhythm restoration was achieved without complications. At 3-month follow-up, the patient remained asymptomatic with a reduced left atrial diameter (57.7 mm to 51.2 mm) and stable sinus rhythm on electrocardiography. Integration of intracardiac echocardiography, three-dimensional electroanatomic mapping, and multidisciplinary planning enabled precise catheter ablation in the patient with complex anatomy.
The results support fluoroless techniques as a viable option for atrial fibrillation ablation in challenging congenital anomalies, minimizing radiation exposure while maintaining procedural success."

While several models have been developed to predict myocardial growth in MR, they often neglect key concurrent adaptive mechanisms that influence both the pattern and severity of LV dilation. This study presents a unified finite element framework to systematically evaluate the individual and combined contributions of fiber reorientation (FR) and baroreflex regulation to LV growth and remodeling, along with the effects of myocardial material property changes associated with the acute and chronic phases of MR. A healthy baseline model and multiple MR models were simulated, each incorporating different combinations of these mechanisms. The growth model that included both FR and baroreflex most accurately reproduced clinical measurements of LV geometry, myocardial mass, and pressure-volume loops. Excluding either FR or baroreflex consistently led to underestimation of myocardial growth and less realistic LV shapes. Importantly, FR was essential for capturing the increased chamber sphericity observed in MR, while baroreflex significantly influenced the extent of dilation and pressure compensation. Phase-dependent changes in myocardial material properties further modulated remodeling patterns, capturing distinct features of acute and chronic disease stages. These findings highlight the critical role of integrating concurrent physiological mechanisms to reliably predict cardiac adaptation in MR and provide new insights into the drivers of remodeling patterns observed in patients. This comprehensive approach offers a valuable framework for evaluating therapies that target distinct aspects of cardiac adaptation.

Although typically asymptomatic and often discovered incidentally, persistent left superior vena cava may complicate central venous catheter placement and transesophageal echocardiography confirmation during cardiac surgery. Unrecognized persistent left superior vena cava can lead to misinterpretation of guidewire position, unnecessary catheter manipulation, and procedural delays.
A 65-year-old white woman (body mass index 26 kg/m2; American Society of Anesthesiologists physical status III) with severe degenerative mitral regurgitation, hypertension, and well-controlled type 2 diabetes mellitus presented for elective mitral valve repair. After uneventful induction of general anesthesia, a right internal jugular central venous catheter was placed under ultrasound guidance without resistance, arrhythmia, or abnormal waveform. Intraoperative transesophageal echocardiography-using standard bicaval, midesophageal four-chamber, and midesophageal long-axis views-failed to visualize the guidewire or catheter tip within the superior vena cava or right atrium despite correct placement technique and a normal central venous pressure waveform. Given stable hemodynamics and appropriate venous return, the catheter was secured in place, and mitral valve repair proceeded without incident. Postoperative contrast-enhanced computed tomography identified a persistent left superior vena cava draining into an enlarged coronary sinus, accounting for the atypical guidewire trajectory. The central line remained functional throughout, and the patient was extubated on postoperative day 1. She experienced an uncomplicated recovery and was discharged home on postoperative day 4.
When transesophageal echocardiography fails to confirm central venous catheter position despite proper technique, rare anatomical variants such as persistent left superior vena cava should be considered. Employing targeted transesophageal echocardiography interrogation of the coronary sinus and adjunctive imaging modalities can facilitate prompt recognition. Awareness of persistent left superior vena cava prevents unnecessary catheter manipulation, reduces procedural delays, and enhances patient safety during cardiac surgery."

Academic tertiary care medical center.
Nine children underwent robot-assisted cardiac surgery from 2022 to 2024. Indications for operation included atrial septal defect (n = 8) and mitral valve regurgitation with concomitant Marfan syndrome (n = 1).
Eight patients underwent atrial septal defect closure; 1 patient underwent mitral valve repair.
Mean (SD) age was 13.1 (2.5) years, mean (SD) weight was 48.5 (20.3) kg, and mean (SD) body mass index was 21.7 (5.4) kg/m2. Mean (SD) operative time was 388.2 (40.7) minutes, fibrillation time was 92.4 (25.8) minutes, and cardiopulmonary bypass time was 192.1 (31.3) minutes. None of the patients required 1-lung ventilation based on surgeon preference, and most patients (77.8%) were extubated in the operating room. The median (IQR) intensive care unit length of stay was 45 (26) hours, and the median (IQR) hospital stay was 3 (2.5) days. One patient required conversion to median sternotomy due to aortic insufficiency in the setting of Marfan syndrome and aortic root dilation. One patient required a reoperation due to bleeding following an emesis episode in the intensive care unit. There were no mortality events.
Robot-assisted cardiac surgery is well tolerated in appropriately selected pediatric patients, including children as small as 24 kg. Our experience suggests that the success of this approach is predicated upon a center with institutional experience and multidisciplinary collaboration. Furthermore, it is critical that the anesthesiologist understands the unique anatomic, airway, monitoring, positioning, and surgical considerations that are unique for this patient population."

Mitral regurgitant fraction (MR%) has not been systematically reported in relation to other echocardiographic variables in myxomatous mitral valve disease (MMVD).
Echocardiograms from 237 small-breed dogs with MMVD that included calculation of MR% were identified retrospectively. Mitral regurgitant fraction, monodimensional and bidimensional variables, estimates of filling pressure, forward flow, left ventricular early inflow outflow index (LVEIO), tricuspid regurgitant velocity, and systolic blood pressure are reported in preclinical MMVD and at the onset of American College of Veterinary Internal Medicine stage C congestive heart failure (C-CHF). The relationship of MR% to other variables is described and correlations determined. The discriminatory ability of variables in diagnosing stage C-CHF was evaluated with receiver operating characteristic analysis.
All echocardiographic variables correlated to MR% by univariable analysis (all P values<0.0001). The LVEIO (ρ = 0.81), left atrial volume indexed to body weight (ρ = 0.76), and left ventricular end-diastolic volume indexed to body weight (ρ = 0.76) showed the strongest correlations. Patients with stage C- CHF had a median MR% of 83% (interquartile range: 79-85%).

In congenital heart disease (CHD), AVVR is a major determinant of clinical outcomes. For these patients, surgery often poses high risk, underscoring the importance of percutaneous therapy. However, data supporting TEER in patients with CHD remain limited.
The objectives of the study were to examine the outcomes of TEER in CHD patients across several centers and to discuss the procedural considerations.
We conducted a retrospective review of atrioventricular TEER procedures performed on CHD patients across 5 medical centers. We analyzed patient demographics, procedural details, immediate (30 days), and intermediate (6-month) outcomes.
A total of 20 patients with various CHD diagnoses underwent TEER, of which 18 reached the 6-month follow-up. The median age was 49.3 (Q1-Q3: 37.0-59.8) years and 40.0% were females. All cases were performed on the systemic circulation, 60.0% were tricuspid valves. All patients presented with symptomatic 3+ or 4+ degree AVVR at baseline, which was reduced to mild-to-moderate (1+ to 2+) in 19 patients (95.0%) at 30 days (P < 0.001). One death (5.0%) occurred in the first 30 days due to intractable heart failure; rates of NYHA functional class III-IV were reduced from 18 (90.0%) of the patients at baseline to 10.5% at 30 days.
TEER for carefully selected patients with CHD and severe AVVR was safe and effective with notable improvements in regurgitation and clinical symptoms. Our findings highlight important considerations for planning and implementation of TEER in this patient population."

Primary mitral regurgitation (MR) results from structural abnormalities of the valve apparatus (e.g., leaflet prolapse, chordae rupture), often due to myxomatous degeneration or congenital defects. Secondary MR arises from left ventricular remodeling (e.g., after myocardial infarction or heart failure), leading to functional valve incompetence despite normal valve structure. The choice of treatment depends on the degree of valve regurgitation and the severity of the patient's clinical symptoms. The focus herein is on discussing the anatomy of the mitral valve, the pathophysiology of regurgitation, and diagnostic methods. The qualification process is then outlined for invasive treatment and various methods of mitral valve repair, including new minimally invasive techniques.

However, MVP may also present with ventricular arrhythmias (VA) or sudden cardiac death (SCD). The arrhythmic form of MVP and the complicated course of this condition are closely associated with mitral annular disjunction (MAD). MAD alters the anatomical integrity of the mitral annulus and is thought to contribute to leaflet degeneration and myocardial fibrosis, creating a substrate for malignant arrhythmias. The most common complications associated with MVP and MAD include progressive mitral valve regurgitation, left ventricular hypertrophy and an increased risk of SCD. Cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) imaging is the most sensitive modality for detecting MAD and myocardial fibrosis and is thus essential for early diagnosis and risk stratification. This review aims to enhance recognition of MAD, summarize current diagnostic and risk assessment strategies, and provide clinical context through two cases of patients with arrhythmic MVP and MAD."

Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) is frequently used in biomedical engineering to simulate blood flow patterns under various conditions.
We developed a standardized workflow for individualized CFD analyses to predict postinterventional mitral valve gradients and residual regurgitation following TEER.
Twenty patients with severe mitral regurgitation (MR) from two high-volume centers underwent full-cycle cardiac computed tomography before intervention. Based on the specific valve morphology, individualized CFD simulations were performed to calculate MR volumes prior to intervention and estimate hemodynamics after M-TEER.
CFD analyses (mean age 80 ± 4 years, 55% male) showed excellent correlation between baseline proximal isovelocity surface area (PISA)-based MR volumes, median 40 ml [interquartile range (IQR): 30-49 ml], and CFD-based calculation, median 30 ml (IQR: 27-54 ml; R = 0.917; P < 0.001), as well as between baseline effective regurgitant orifice area (EROA) assessed in transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) and CFD-measured EROA (R = 0.869; P < 0.001). After device implantation, the correlation between intraprocedural TEE-measured and CFD-estimated residual MR (R = 0.949; P < 0.001) and EROA (R = 0.841; P < 0.001) remained robust. Median postinterventional diastolic pressure gradient (TEE) was 2.8 mmHg (IQR: 1.7-4.0), which closely correlated with the CFD-estimated gradient of 1.4 mmHg (IQR: 2.3-4.5, R = 0.905; P < 0.001).
This is the first study to use a standardized CFD workflow for MR evaluation in patients undergoing TEER. In the future, CFD-based analyses may serve as a key diagnostic tool for procedural planning of TEER."

The aim of present work is to study the relation of&#x0D; weight of the heart with age and weight of cadaver.&#x0D; Material and Methods: The study was performed in the Department of Anatomy, Shri Ram&#x0D; Murti Smarak Institute of Medical Sciences, Bareilly on 30 hearts from embalmed cadavers.&#x0D; The hearts were procured from the cadavers available in our department. The heart was&#x0D; thoroughly cleaned and measurements were taken.&#x0D; Results: The mean heart weight was 223.37 ± 57.78 g. Significant relationship between age of&#x0D; the cadaver and weight of the heart (p=0.0004), weight of cadaver and weight of heart&#x0D; (p=0.0001) was observed.&#x0D; Conclusion: The above study provides valuable data of the heart in our geographical location,&#x0D; which may be useful for cardiac surgeons and physicians."

Crossref,deep learning,Integration of Biomechanics and Digital Technology: Using Kinovea for Motion Analysis and Learning for Beginner Athletes,Muhammad Nur Hudha; Riezky Maya Probosari; Annisa Nur Khasanah; Supurwoko; Salsabila Kholifahtun Nisa’; Gifran Rihla Gifarka Latief,10.58524/jcss.v4i2.890,2029-11-29,Journal of Coaching and Sports Science,"Background: The integration of biomechanics with digital motion-analysis technologies has introduced new approaches for examining movement efficiency, kinematic characteristics, and technical patterns in walking and running activities. Kinovea, as an accessible motion-analysis software, provides both visual and quantitative feedback. However, its application in supporting technique development among beginner athletes remains insufficiently explored. Aim: This study aims to describe the use of Kinovea in biomechanics training and examine its contribution to the awareness of kinematic characteristics and movement techniques among beginner athletes. Methods: A descriptive qualitative design involved 72 beginner athletes aged 18–25 years selected through purposive sampling. Data were collected over 16 weeks through interviews, field observations, and motion video recordings analyzed using Kinovea. Kinematic data focused on joint angles, stride behavior, and movement phases during walking, running, and the flight phase. Qualitative data were analyzed using content analysis with NVivo 12, while kinematic results were interpreted descriptively to identify performance patterns and areas for technical refinement. Result: Kinematic analysis showed coordinated joint-angle patterns across all phases. Walking analysis identified arm swing angles of 50.9°–58.8° and leg separation angles of 64.3°–67.2°, indicating a stable gait rhythm. The running analysis revealed knee angles of 68.8°–69.8° and elbow angles of 87.6°–89.1°, indicating efficient propulsive mechanics. The flight phase demonstrated knee angles of 81.2°–87.8° and elbow angles of 80.4°–88.3°, suggesting effective momentum use and postural stability. These measurements supported stride-efficiency assessment and technique evaluation. Qualitative findings revealed that Kinovea enabled athletes to interpret movement phases and identify technical inefficiencies through slow-motion and frame-by-frame visualization. Conclusion: Kinovea supports basic motion analysis by providing clear kinematic information and helping beginner athletes observe and refine their movement techniques. The findings also offer practical value for coaches by enabling more precise identification of inefficient patterns and guiding targeted corrections during early-stage training."
