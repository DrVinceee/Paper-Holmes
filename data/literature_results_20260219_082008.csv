PubMed,aortic stenosis,Influence of breathing-induced motion on hemodynamics following fEVAR with renal stenting.,Alessandra Corvo; Stéphane Avril; Alberto Aliseda; Stéphan Haulon; Fanette Chassagne,10.1007/s10439-026-04024-w,2026-02-18,Annals of biomedical engineering,"Fenestrated EndoVascular Aneurysm Repair (fEVAR) has been demonstrated to be an excellent treatment for complex abdominal aortic aneurysms. In addition to the aortic endograft, bridging stent-grafts (SG) are deployed within the renal arteries, resulting in rare but serious renal complications. This study aims to assess renal artery hemodynamic changes post-fEVAR, including the effect of respiration-induced renal deformation.
Pre-fEVAR models were segmented from CT scans (patients involved in clinical trial NCT04724863), while post-fEVAR models were created from structural simulations that included respiratory-induced deformation. Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulations applied inflow velocity waveforms at the supraceliac aorta and Windkessel boundary conditions at the outlets. A dynamic mesh was implemented to reproduce renal deformation during breathing, and inspiration and expiration static configurations were analyzed.
Post-fEVAR reduction in renal artery flow was detected, together with recirculation regions near the SG protrusions into the aorta. Higher time-averaged wall shear stress was observed in the unstented section of the renal arteries. The comparison between static and dynamic mesh simulations reveals that renal artery motion has negligible effect on the flow. Finally, velocity fields were compared to metrics used clinically to assess renal stenosis, to build a model for the prediction of renal complications in silico.
This study evaluates the impact of renal stenting on flow, accounting for respiratory-induced deformation. It shows a minimal influence on overall hemodynamics, but significant reduction of renal flow post-fEVAR. Future studies should evaluate a patient cohort who experienced renal complications to correlate CFD metrics with post-operative clinical outcomes."

This systematic review and critical appraisal synthesizes the applications of computer vision in vascular surgery. MEDLINE, Embase, Web of Science and Cochrane CENTRAL were searched from inception to June 28, 2024. Vascular diseases studied, data sources, methods and outcomes were recorded. Critical appraisal was conducted using the PROBAST and TRIPOD+AI guidelines. Overall, 288 studies were included with an exponential rise from 2017 onwards. The majority of studies addressed aortic pathologies (33%), carotid stenosis (30%), and foot ulcers (25%), while few focused on peripheral artery disease (6%). Most were observational using retrospective (81%) or prospective data (15%), and one clinical trial was included. Dice coefficient (51%) and accuracy (36%) were the most commonly reported performance metrics with infrequent use of AUROC (17%). Only 15% of studies had a low risk of bias and overall adherence to the TRIPOD+AI checklist was relatively poor at 57%. Overall, we suggest greater attention to peripheral artery disease; for dice coefficient and AUROC to be used in segmentation and discrimination tasks, respectively; and for the TRIPOD+AI statement to be consulted early on during model development."

In this retrospective single-centre study, 129 consecutive patients with echocardiographically confirmed severe aortic stenosis (mean age, 83.1 ± 6.3 years; 46 men, 83 women) underwent same-session ECG-gated (3 mm) and Non-ECG-gated (5 mm) non-contrast CT between 21 March 2020 and 16 April 2025. AVC was quantified using Agatston and volume methods. Agreement between non-gated and gated scores was assessed by Pearson correlation, Bland-Altman analysis, and Deming regression. Diagnostic performance for sex-specific Agatston thresholds (≥2000 units men, ≥1300 units women) was evaluated using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis.
Volume scores on non-ECG-gated CT correlated more strongly with ECG-gated CT scores than Agatston scores (r = 0.95 vs. 0.69, P < 0.001). Bland-Altman analysis demonstrated substantial negative bias and proportional error for Agatston scores (mean difference, -921.1 units; limits of agreement, -2900.8 to +1058.6), while volume scores showed minimal bias and no proportional error (+16.5 mm3; -648.5 to +681.4). Deming regression confirmed closer agreement for volume scores (slope, 1.02; R2 = 0.90). ROC analysis showed higher area under the curve values for volume scores (0.976 for men, 0.975 for women) than for Agatston scores (0.946 and 0.967, respectively).
Non-ECG-gated CT enables reliable quantification of aortic valve calcium in severe aortic stenosis. Volume scoring demonstrates superior agreement and diagnostic performance compared with Agatston scoring, supporting its use as a robust, density-independent metric for opportunistic assessment of AVC on routine chest CT."

Case reports,"A myocardial bridge causes a specific intraluminal flow pattern and can affect endothelial function, response to vasoactive agents, development of atherosclerosis and a patient's prognosis. Additionally, the reliability of preoperative functional assessment, including fractional flow reserve (FFR) and reasonable patient's selection for myotomy or coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) may be controversial.
A 63-year-old man presented with shortness of breath. Echocardiography revealed severe aortic regurgitation and left ventricular dilatation. Coronary angiography revealed a myocardial bridge in the anterior descending artery (LAD) without atherosclerosis. The myocardial bridge caused 75% stenosis in systole due to compression and kinking, and 25% stenosis in diastole by visual assessment, with a FFR of 0.80 and instantaneous wave-free ratio of 0.88. Quantitative assessment showed a minimal luminal diameter of 0.79 mm in systole, corresponding to 72.7% stenosis. A median sternotomy was performed. Following aortic cross-clamping and aortic valve replacement, the myocardial bridge was completely divided. However, the unroofed segment appeared thin and diffusely spastic. The unroofed segment of the LAD was longitudinally incised and enlarged using a free right internal thoracic artery (ITA) patch, which was ∼25 × 12 mm. There were no post-operative complications. Post-operative coronary angiography confirmed the enlargement of the unroofed segment. Vascular remodelling caused normalization of the diameter 6 months later.
Myotomy concomitant with patch plasty using the ITA can be effective and durable option for myocardial bridges, particularly when expected CABG patency may be suboptimal because of moderate diastolic stenosis or a distal myocardial bridge location."

Zeitschrift fur Gefasskrankheiten,"Background: To evaluate safety, technical success, and long-term outcomes of endovascular therapy (EVT) in severely calcified aortoiliac occlusive disease (AIOD), focusing on lesion characteristics and the presence of coral reef aorta (CRA). Patients and methods: This single-center retrospective study included 216 patients with angiographically confirmed calcified abdominal aortic stenosis (mean PACSS 3.7 ± 0.8) treated with EVT between 2005 and 2023. Of these, 33 patients had coral reef aorta (CRA). Patients were stratified by lesion location and CRA presence. Primary endpoints were 30-day adverse events and technical success (residual stenosis <30%). Secondary endpoints were major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE), major adverse limb events (MALE), and all-cause mortality. Cox regression identified predictors of outcome. Results: Technical success was achieved in 81.9%. Thirty-day mortality was 0.5%. At 10 years, freedom from MACE was significantly lower in patients with non-bifurcation abdominal aortic stenosis (56% vs. 76%; aHR 2.13, p < .05) and lowest in CRA (30% vs. 71%; aHR 3.17, p < .05). Independent predictors of MACE were CRA, chronic total occlusion (aHR 3.38, 95% CI 1.57-7.29), critical limb-threatening ischemia (aHR 3.67, 95% CI 1.74-7.75), and age (aHR 1.06 per year, 95% CI 1.01-1.11). MALE was more frequent in patients with peripheral arterial disease (aHR 2.07, 95% CI 1.12-3.81), CRA (aHR 2.51, 95% CI 1.17-5.40), and current smokers (aHR 5.10, 95% CI 1.23-21.0). Conclusions: CRA and non-bifurcation abdominal aortic stenosis are associated with reduced long-term freedom from MACE after EVT. These findings define high-risk subgroups within calcified AIOD and highlight the prognostic value of anatomical lesion characteristics for treatment planning and follow-up."

The aim of the study is to assess procedural and clinical outcomes of transfemoral TAVR in patients with and without unfavorable aortic root anatomy and receiving Evolut PRO/PRO+ or SAPIEN 3 Ultra devices in contemporary clinical practice.
Patients enrolled in the multicenter OPERA-TAVI registry were considered. Patients were compared using propensity score matching according to the presence or absence of unfavorable anatomical characteristics of the aortic root [bicuspid aortic valve (BAV), moderate-to-severe left ventricular outflow tract calcifications, horizontal aorta]. Primary endpoints were Valve Academic Research Consortium (VARC)-3 device success and early safety. The secondary endpoint was a composite of 1-year all-cause death, disabling stroke and heart failure rehospitalization.
Among a total of 1815 patients, 629 patients (34.7%) had at least one unfavorable characteristic. After adjustment, 624 matched pairs of patients were compared.VARC-3 device success (85.3% vs. 92.0%, P < 0.001) and early safety (72.9% vs. 79.6%, P = 0.006) were lower in patients with unfavorable characteristics. The secondary composite endpoint was higher in patients with unfavorable anatomical characteristics (Kaplan-Meier estimates 15.3 vs. 12.0%; Plogrank = 0.019). Among patients with unfavorable anatomical characteristics, BAV alone was associated with early safety [odds ratio 2.15, 95% confidence interval 1.04-4.70, P = 0.05].
Patients undergoing transfemoral TAVR had lower rates of device success and early safety in the presence of unfavorable anatomical characteristics, along with worse 1-year clinical outcomes. However, BAV was associated with higher early safety in this context."

Subsequently, the number of nonagenarians affected by severe aortic stenosis and requiring transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) is expected to increase. Next-day discharge (NDD) after TAVR has been explored in several studies, demonstrating its feasibility and safety but no data in elder populations have been reported so far.
The aim of this study was to evaluate the safety of NDD following TAVR in nonagenarians. From November 2011 to May 2024, a total of 104 nonagenarian patients underwent transfemoral TAVR at our institution and 32 of them (31.7%) were discharged the day after the index procedure. NDD patients were compared to patients discharged later. The primary endpoints were device success and early safety according to Valve Academic Research Consortium-3 (VARC-3) criteria.
After propensity score matching, 29 well balanced pairs of patients were selected. At 30 days, NDD patients showed a higher early safety (93.1% vs. 69.0%; P = 0.04) and similar device success compared to those discharged later (89.7% vs. 100%; P = 0.48). No differences in all-cause death (3.4% vs. 17.2%; P = 0.20) and rehospitalization (13.8% vs. 13.8%; P = 1.00) were reported in NDD and no-NDD patients at 1 year.
In conclusion, NDD after TAVR has been shown to be a safe and effective strategy also in nonagenarian recipients, in which a shorter length of stay may help to avoid hospitalization-related complications."

Here, we present the first data indicating a role for caldesmon-1 (CALD1) in calcified aortic valve disease (CAVD) pathogenesis. Analysis of publicly available single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) datasets revealed that CALD1 shows prominent upregulation in aortic valve stenosis (AS) cases when compared to normal subjects. Histological examination demonstrated that CALD1 protein expression is elevated in calcified AS valves and co-localises with α-smooth muscle actin (a myofibroblast biomarker) and vimentin, indicating its association with activated valvular interstitial cells (VICs). Bioinformatic analysis showed that CALD1-positive cells predominantly synthesize extracellular matrix components, including COL1A1. Functional experiments using CALD1-depleted VICs revealed that CALD1 is required for maintaining spindle-shaped morphology, actin polymerisation, and proliferative capacity. Moreover, CALD1 loss significantly impaired osteoblast differentiation and attenuated VIC calcification. Bulk RNA-seq combined with pathway analysis demonstrated that CALD1-mediated actin polymerisation positively regulates key osteogenic and valvulopathy-related genes, including RUNX2 and ALPL. Collectively, these findings identify CALD1 as a novel regulator of VIC phenotypic plasticity and osteogenic transition during CAVD progression, providing mechanistic insight and a target for potential AS therapy."
PubMed,aortic stenosis,Barthel index in TAVR patients - a novel use of an old score.,Magda Haum; Lukas Weyde; Julius Steffen; Julius Fischer; Kornelia Löw; Sebastian Sadoni; Hans Theiss; Konstantin Stark; Konstantinos Rizas; Jörg Hausleiter; Steffen Massberg; Simon Deseive,10.1007/s00392-026-02854-1,2026-02-17,Clinical research in cardiology : official journal of the German Cardiac Society,"Transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) has become a well-established therapy for aortic stenosis (AS). With rising TAVR numbers, appropriate patient selection becomes more important. Identifying patients with the highest long-term benefit from the procedure is especially challenging in this elderly patient cohort. Barthel Index (BI) is a commonly used tool to assess the patients' capability of activities of daily life.
In this single-center study, we analyzed BI of patients receiving TAVR for severe symptomatic AS at our center in 2018 and 2019. BI had been collected by nursing personnel during clinical routine and 475 patients could be analyzed. Median BI was 90 points and was used as cut-off to define two groups of patients: lesser frail patients with higher BI (≥ 90; n = 255) and more frail patients with lower BI (< 90; n = 220). Patients with lower BI were older (83 vs. 80 years; p < 0.01) with higher surgical risk score (STS-score 4.1% vs. 2.5%; p < 0.01), and worse renal function (CKD in 49.5% vs. 31.8%; p < 0.01). Long-term survival differed significantly: only 117 patients (53.1%) in the low BI group were still alive 4-years after TAVR vs. 204 patients (80.0%) in the higher BI group. Further analyses revealed that combining STS score and BI significantly improved mortality prediction (C index for STS score 0.626; C index for combined STS score and BI 0.683; p < 0.01).
This is the first analysis evaluating the prognostic value of BI on long-term survival after TAVR. Albeit assessing only the patient's functional status and no detailed medical history, BI is a strong discriminator for frail patients. Moreover, it allows identification of patients at higher risk of mortality within the first 4 years after TAVR and should therefore be considered for evaluation of patients with severe AS."

It focuses on indications, imaging-guided sizing, operative technique, outcomes, and complications to clarify where SuAVR meaningfully complements or substitutes conventional surgical aortic valve replacement and transcatheter aortic valve implantation.
Modern studies show SuAVR consistently shortens cardiopulmonary bypass and cross-clamp times by 25-50%, produces low discharge gradients and larger effective orifice areas, and is particularly advantageous in elderly patients, small annuli, redo operations, and concomitant procedures. Routine multidetector-row computed tomography perimeter sizing and meticulous annular decalcification have reduced clinically relevant paravalvular leak to low single digits, whereas higher implantation and conservative ballooning have lowered permanent pacemaker implantation rates toward single digits. Mid-term durability is encouraging, with 95-97% freedom from structural valve deterioration and 94-97% freedom from reintervention at 5  years. Conduction-system injury, transient thrombocytopenia, and residual pacemaker risk remain the principal trade-offs.
With Heart-Team selection and standardized computed tomography-first workflows and implant technique, SuAVR is a valuable surgical option that expands minimally invasive and complex surgical candidacy. Definitive adoption requires randomized long-term comparisons and standardized pacemaker-avoidance protocols."

To identify the key predictors associated with hospital readmission in older adults after TAVR.
This retrospective study analyzed the clinical data of 558 older adults who underwent TAVR between 2018 and 2023 at a tertiary hospital in Seoul. Statistical analyses included descriptive statistics, chi-square tests, and logistic regression using Statistical Package for Social Sciences 29.
Of the 558 patients, 21.7% were readmitted. Significant predictors included male sex, hospital stay exceeding 10 days, high N-terminal pro B-type natriuretic peptide levels, and elevated age-adjusted Charlson comorbidity index scores.
This study emphasizes the role of patient severity in predicting readmission after TAVR in older adults. Key risk factors include elevated cardiac biomarkers, high comorbidity, prolonged hospitalization, and male sex. Integrating these into discharge planning may enhance nurse-led interventions and support safer care transition."

No medical therapy halts aortic stenosis progression, and aortic valve replacement remains the only curative option. Managing asymptomatic patients is challenging because of a persistent risk of sudden death, and the potential for irreversible myocardial damage if intervention is delayed, but also because aortic valve replacement carries procedural risks and long-term prosthesis-related complications. Functional assessment, especially exercise testing, is essential as it can identify a substantial proportion of ""falsely asymptomatic"" patients who will benefit from timely aortic valve replacement. Accurate assessment of aortic stenosis severity is crucial, with echocardiography as the cornerstone, although additional imaging modalities may be required in selected cases. Modern risk stratification integrates markers of subclinical myocardial dysfunction, haemodynamic compromise and procedural risk. Although observational studies and randomized trials suggest that early aortic valve replacement may reduce adverse events in selected low-risk patients, results are heterogeneous and methodological concerns remain. Meta-analyses have shown reductions in unplanned hospitalizations but no clear survival benefit with early intervention. Current guidelines recommend aortic valve replacement for classical indications, such as symptom onset or reduced ejection fraction, and suggest early aortic valve replacement only in carefully selected asymptomatic patients with low procedural risk. Shared decision-making within a multidisciplinary heart valve team remains essential, taking into account patient preferences, co-morbidities, life expectancy and lifestyle. Close follow-up with regular echocardiography and functional testing is critical to optimize timing and outcomes."

The myocardium responds through a sequence of mechanical and biological processes that initially preserve wall stress and cardiac output but eventually become maladaptive, leading to fibrosis, loss of contractile reserve and clinical heart failure. Integrating myocardial fibrosis assessment and staging frameworks into clinical decision-making may support earlier valve replacement, even before conventional triggers such as symptoms or reduced ejection fraction, to prevent irreversible myocardial damage in patients with severe/significant AS. Advances in imaging biomarkers - including cardiac magnetic resonance-derived late gadolinium enhancement, extracellular volume quantification and strain analysis - allow for more personalized risk stratification and may help identify which patients with asymptomatic severe AS stand to benefit most from earlier intervention. Beyond the valve procedure itself, adjunctive pharmacological strategies, such as antifibrotic therapies, renin-angiotensin system blockade, neprilysin inhibition and metabolic modulators, are being explored to address persistent fibrotic and metabolic remodelling that valve replacement alone cannot reverse. Equally important is the optimal treatment of concomitant cardiovascular comorbidities such as hypertension, coronary artery disease and atrial fibrillation, which may aggravate myocardial remodelling and blunt the benefits of valve replacement if left untreated."

As TAVI indications continue to expand to include younger patients, it is essential to systematically document redo TAVI procedures to better understand their long-term efficacy and safety. This study aimed to compare outcomes between redo TAVI and first TAVI procedures using a propensity score-matched analysis.
To compare the long-term clinical outcomes, including death, stroke and procedural adverse events, between redo TAVI and first TAVI procedures using a propensity score-matched analysis.
A retrospective analysis was conducted using the TriNetX database, identifying adults (≥18years) with severe aortic stenosis who underwent TAVI (2012-2024). Redo TAVI required an interval of ≥12months. Propensity score matching was performed using all baseline characteristics listed in Table 1, with outcomes assessed over 36months.
After matching, 446 patients were included in each cohort. No statistically significant difference was observed in the annual rates of all-cause death (11.3% vs 8.7%; hazard ratio 1.20, 95% confidence interval 0.86-1.68), ischaemic stroke (hazard ratio 2.07, 95% confidence interval 0.99-4.35) or major bleeding (hazard ratio 1.41, 95% confidence interval 0.99-2.02) between the redo TAVI and first TAVI groups. Pacemaker implantation (hazard ratio 0.25, 95% confidence interval 0.12-0.51), new-onset atrial fibrillation (hazard ratio 0.44, 95% confidence interval 0.24-0.79) and hospitalization for heart failure (hazard ratio 0.64, 95% confidence interval 0.41-0.99) were significantly lower in the redo TAVI group.
No statistically significant difference was observed in all-cause death, ischaemic stroke or major bleeding between the redo TAVI and first TAVI groups. Conversely, redo TAVI was associated with significantly lower rates of permanent pacemaker implantation and heart failure rehospitalization. These findings support the integration of redo TAVI as an essential component within a comprehensive lifetime treatment strategy for managing bioprosthetic aortic valve dysfunction."

We aimed to develop and internally validate a clinical risk score to accurately stratify this risk.
Using data from the nationwide, multicentre FRANCE-TAVI registry, we developed a clinical predictive risk score for 30-day ischaemic stroke post-TAVI using multivariable logistic regression analysis. The model was internally validated through cross-validation techniques.
Among 62,747 patients, 1712 (2.7%) experienced ischaemic stroke within 30 days. Nine clinical predictors were identified: female sex, age >85 years, weight <60kg, symptomatic status, history of stroke or transient ischaemic attack, multiple (i.e. >1) episodes of acute heart failure, severe mobility reduction, diabetes and creatinine clearance <60mL/min. The resulting scoring model demonstrated good accuracy (Brier score 0.18), moderate discrimination (C-index 0.63) and excellent calibration as assessed by calibration plots, calibration-in-the-large and calibration slope. The score categorized patients into low - (90.2% of the population), intermediate - (8.0%) and high-risk (1.8%) groups. Observed stroke rates increased progressively across these groups, from 2.25% in the low-risk group to 6.51% in the intermediate-risk group and 10.10% in the high-risk group.
This newly developed STRAT score is a clinical, practical and effective tool for predicting early ischaemic stroke in patients undergoing TAVI. It was derived and internally validated in the FRANCE-TAVI registry and may help tailor preventive strategies. Further studies are necessary to externally validate this score and evaluate its impact on clinical decision-making."

Ascertaining whether gestational elevations in LVOT gradients are transient haemodynamic responses that regress postpartum, or predictors of disease progression or adverse outcomes, is critical.
A retrospective, observational study was conducted between 2009 and 2023 in two tertiary centres. Clinical and echocardiographic data were collected preconception, antenatally, and postpartum. Key measurements included peak and mean LVOT gradients, left ventricular ejection fraction, and aortic valve area. The primary endpoint was the need for postpartum intervention, while the secondary endpoints were a composite of adverse clinical outcomes and postpartum intervention.
A total of 78 women with LVOTO (109 pregnancies) were included. Gestational increases in LVOT gradients were transient, regressing to baseline levels postpartum for most. Postpartum intervention was required in 11% of pregnancies within a median of 6.3 (4.4-9.2) years. Predictors of the primary endpoint were baseline LVOTO severity (HR = 29.6, p < 0.01), antenatal LVOTO severity (HR = 21.1, p < 0.01), and postpartum LVOTO severity (HR = 18.3, p < 0.01). While patients with inherently severe LVOTO at baseline (n = 8, 10%) had a significantly increased risk of postpartum intervention, those with transiently severe LVOTO during pregnancy did not.
Pregnancy causes an increase in LVOT gradients but no significant disease progression warranting either antenatal or postpartum intervention, except in patients who had severe LVOTO preconception. The development of pregnancy-specific echocardiographic thresholds for severity is a critical need to prevent misdiagnoses and optimise maternal outcomes."

Population health and outcomes,"The overall impact of the introduction of transcatheter aortic valve replacement (AVR) on the prognosis of the entire population with severe aortic stenosis has not been evaluated.
We analyzed 2 multicenter registries that consecutively enrolled patients with severe aortic stenosis before and after the introduction of transcatheter AVR in Japan (CURRENT AS [CURRENT AS, Contemporary Outcomes After Surgery and Medical Treatment in Patients With Severe Aortic Stenosis] Registry-1: 2003-2011; Registry-2: 2018-2020). Data were derived from hospital electronic health records. The primary outcome was 1-year all-cause mortality. Secondary outcomes included hospitalization for heart failure, cardiovascular death, and noncardiovascular death. we Multivariable Cox proportional hazards models were adjusted for age, sex, body mass index, hypertension, current smoking, diabetes on insulin therapy, prior myocardial infarction, prior symptomatic stroke, atrial fibrillation or flutter, aortic or peripheral vascular disease, creatinine level, hemodialysis, anemia, liver cirrhosis (child B or C), malignancy currently under treatment, chronic lung disease (moderate or severe), coronary artery disease, peak aortic jet velocity, any combined moderate or severe valvular disease, and tricuspid regurgitation pressure gradient.
A total of 6645 patients (Registry-1: 3448 patients, and Registry-2: 3197 patients) were included. Patients in Registry-2 were older than those in Registry-1 (81.7 versus 77.8 years), and an initial AVR strategy was more frequently selected (49.9% versus 31.3%). The cumulative 1-year incidence and adjusted risk of 1-year all-cause mortality were lower in Registry-2 than in Registry-1 (10.2% versus 16.0%, P<0.001, hazard ratio, 0.55 [95% CI, 0.47-0.63]). In contrast, the incidence and adjusted risk of hospitalization for heart failure did not differ between Registry-2 and Registry-1 (8.5% versus 9.0%, P=0.66, hazard ratio, 0.88 [95% CI, 0.75-1.04]).
The overall 1-year mortality outcome of patients with severe aortic stenosis improved in the posttranscatheter AVR era compared with the pretranscatheter AVR era, with no noticeable improvement in hospitalization for heart failure."
PubMed,aortic stenosis,Six-Year Outcomes After Transcatheter vs Surgical Aortic Valve Replacement in Low-Risk Patients With Aortic Stenosis.,John K Forrest; Steven J Yakubov; G Michael Deeb; Michael J Reardon; Evolut Low Risk Trial Investigators,10.1016/j.jacc.2026.02.5063,2026-02-16,Journal of the American College of Cardiology,"The Evolut Low Risk trial enrolled patients with severe aortic stenosis at low surgical risk. Annual follow-up is planned for 10 years, evaluating the composite of all-cause mortality or disabling stroke and key secondary endpoints.
Our prespecified objective was to report the 6-year clinical outcomes of transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) vs surgery from the Evolut Low Risk trial. Given an increase in reintervention rates at 6 years, we performed additional analyses in available 7-year data.
Low-risk patients with severe symptomatic aortic stenosis were randomized to TAVR or surgery from 2016-2019. Prespecified analyses at 6 years included annual follow-up of clinical outcomes reported as Kaplan-Meier estimates with log-rank test. Because the trial enrolled patients over several years, at the time of data lock, a majority of patients had completed 7-year follow-up. Given an increased reintervention rate at 6 years in the TAVR arm, we performed additional analysis of 7-year data available at the time of the database lock. Reintervention rates are reported as cumulative incidence.
A total of 1,414 patients underwent an attempted implantation (730 TAVR, 684 surgery). At 6 years, the composite endpoint of all-cause mortality or disabling stroke was 23.3% for TAVR and 20.4% for surgery (difference: 2.8% [95% CI: -1.9% to 7.6%]; P = 0.43). All-cause mortality with vital status sweep at 6 years was 23.3% (95% CI: 20.6%-26.4%) for TAVR and 20.2% (95% CI: 17.4%-23.3%) for surgery (P = 0.24). The reintervention rate at 6 years was 5.5% for TAVR and 3.3% for surgery (sHR: 1.66 [95% CI: 0.96-2.86]; P = 0.07). Using available 7-year follow-up (555 TAVR and 480 surgery), the reintervention rate for TAVR was 9.8% and for surgery was 6.0% (sHR: 1.68 [95% CI: 1.10-2.58]; P = 0.02). In the TAVR and surgery groups, the rate of reintervention for regurgitation was 5.6% vs 1.6% (sHR: 3.39 [95% CI: 1.62-7.07]; P < 0.001) and the rate of reintervention for stenosis was 3.6% vs 3.5% (sHR: 1.14 [95% CI: 0.61-2.15]; P = 0.70).
The 6-year results from the Evolut Low Risk trial show no significant difference in the composite endpoint of all-cause mortality or disabling stroke. At 6 and 7 years, the TAVR arm had a higher reintervention rate compared with surgery, driven by an increased incidence of aortic regurgitation.

We aimed to compare early and up to 6-month clinical and hemodynamic outcomes of SU-AVR versus transfemoral TAVI.
All consecutive patients undergoing SU-AVR (n = 53) or TAVI (n = 245) between 2014-2023 were retrospectively analyzed. Propensity score matching (1:1 nearest neighbor, no replacement) generated 53 balanced pairs.
Paravalvular leak was more frequent after TAVI and was driven by mild leaks (40.0% vs. 13.3%; P = 0.019), while moderate-to-severe paravalvular leak was low and comparable (6.7% vs. 3.3%; P = 0.646). TAVI demonstrated lower transvalvular gradients compared to SU-AVR (P = 0.004); other 6-month echocardiographic parameters, including left ventricular ejection fraction and pulmonary artery pressure, were comparable. Permanent pacemaker implantation rates were comparable. Early mortality did not differ between the SU-AVR and TAVI groups (13.5% vs. 5.7%; P = 0.173). TAVI was associated with shorter hospitalization (median 5.2, interquartile range 3.7-7.3 vs. 8.7, interquartile range 6.3-11.9 days; P <0.001).
In selected high-risk patients, SU-AVR and TAVI showed complementary early profiles. Individualized Heart Team-based decision-making remains essential."

Endovascular stents typically consist of a metal framework and a flexible membrane graft designed to reopen obstructed aortic segments and maintain blood flow through the true lumen. Consequently, stents are widely used to treat aortic expansion diseases and aortic occlusive stenosis. However, traditional stents have limitations in terms of adaptability to complex anatomical structures, long-term durability, biomechanical stability, and reliance on radial support force for fixation, lacking active fixation mechanisms. These shortcomings remain the primary causes of postoperative complications, significantly impacting the quality of life for patients with aortic dissection.                                                           Methods:                     The research status of the endovascular stent was discussed in depth, and the main factors for the optimal design of the stent (geometry, pattern configuration, additional fixtures, and optimization methods) were analyzed and summarized according to the complications targeted by the repair device.                                                           Results:                     The composition structure, working principle, and development status of the stent grafts under review are elaborated in detail. Stent grafts attempt to alleviate postoperative complications through three approaches: enhancing the flexibility of the stent framework, improving the fit between the vessel wall and the stent, and reducing vascular injury. Blood flow guiding channels are established to alleviate the obstruction of branch blood flow. Additional self-anchoring devices are added to adapt to the dynamic remodeling of blood vessels.                                                           Discussion:                     The effects of various factors, including geometric parameters, structural design, and parameter optimization techniques, on the optimization of stent primary mechanical performance are discussed. The current research status of functional improvement methods for stents is also summarized.                                                           Conclusion:                     Refining the quantitative relationship between stent structural parameters and mechanical performance, as well as exploring the balance criteria between flexibility and radial support force, represent promising directions for future development. These objectives necessitate further in-depth analysis and research."

Number of GDMT medications at follow-up was less in patients who did not have MR/TR regression (vs who did) and in patients who developed MR/TR (vs who did not). On subgroup analysis, patients with NYHA class I/II received similar number of GDMT and had similar rate of MR and TR regression and development vs patients with NYHA III/IV. However, patients with mildly reduced EF received less GDMT medications vs patients with moderately reduced EF and experienced less MR regression.                                                           Conclusion                     In patients with a recent diagnosis of HFrEF receiving contemporary GDMT, the majority of patients with ≥moderate secondary MR and TR achieved regression of MR/TR, and the minority of patients without significant baseline MR/TR developed ≥moderate regurgitation at follow-up."

With a focus on the prevalent psychological complications following the onset of this condition, this study aimed to explore the correlation between antenatal depression and Corona disease anxiety, personality traits, and postpartum depression during the COVID-19 pandemic.                                                           Materials and Methods:                     This cross-sectional descriptive-analytical study investigated women receiving care at health centers affiliated with Kerman University of Medical Sciences during the last month of their pregnancy and the postpartum period in 2022. Following the acquisition of informed consent, participants were assessed using various measures, including demographic and obstetric information, the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale, the Corona Disease Anxiety Scale (CDAS), and the NEO Personality Inventory-Revised during their third trimester of pregnancy. The same group of participants completed the Edinburgh Depression Scale and the Corona Disease Anxiety Scale (CDAS) 4-6 weeks after childbirth.                                                           Results and Discussion:                     There was a significant correlation between family income, unwanted pregnancy as perceived by both the mother and father, and antenatal depression. Additionally, marital satisfaction played a significant role in postpartum depression. Furthermore, antenatal depression was significantly associated with neuroticism, agreeableness, and physical symptoms related to Corona disease anxiety. Personality traits, with the exception of extroversion and conscientiousness, and various domains of Corona disease anxiety, excluding psychological symptoms, were also significantly associated with postpartum depression.                                                           Conclusion:                     During pandemics or epidemics, such as the COVID-19 outbreak, experiencing mental distress during pregnancy can contribute to mental health issues during the postpartum period. This risk is particularly true in individuals with unique personality traits, emphasizing the need for increased focus on mental health within prenatal care during these crises."

Method:                     This cross-sectional study was conducted in Kerman, Iran. Data were collected from patients who visited Afzalipour Hospital in Kerman more than twice during the COVID-19 epidemic from the end of February 2020 to March 21, 2021. We conducted two key analyses: 1. Mixed effect logistic regression was used to check the relationship between the variables and COVID-19 severity. 2. Mixed effect linear regression was used to check the relationship between the variables and the length of stay in the hospital.                                                           Results:                     The findings indicated that the most important risk factors for the severity of COVID-19 were heart diseases (OR=1.67,95%CI:1.20-2.30), increasing age (OR=2.23 for age&gt;54, 95%CI:1.70- 2.90), male gender (OR=1.47,95%CI:1.10-1.96), respiratory diseases other than asthma, and frequency of admission (OR=1.60,95%CI:1.20-2.15). All patients who underwent readmission experienced a shorter duration of hospitalization during their subsequent admission (OR=0.94,95%CI:0.91,0.96) and had a higher mortality rate (30% within 14 days, 26.6% between 14-90 days). Patients readmitted at intervals of 14-90 days and greater than 90 days exhibited lower disease severity compared to those readmitted within the 0-14 day period.                                                           Conclusion:                     Examining readmissions, the severity of COVID-19, and the length of hospital stay in affected patients are important factors for planning and allocating resources for COVID-19 management and treatment. These factors can help policymakers develop effective clinical guidelines for hospitalization or outpatient treatment of COVID-19 patients and contribute to reducing the burden of disease in the community."

Kinovea, as an accessible motion-analysis software, provides both visual and quantitative feedback. However, its application in supporting technique development among beginner athletes remains insufficiently explored. Aim: This study aims to describe the use of Kinovea in biomechanics training and examine its contribution to the awareness of kinematic characteristics and movement techniques among beginner athletes. Methods: A descriptive qualitative design involved 72 beginner athletes aged 18–25 years selected through purposive sampling. Data were collected over 16 weeks through interviews, field observations, and motion video recordings analyzed using Kinovea. Kinematic data focused on joint angles, stride behavior, and movement phases during walking, running, and the flight phase. Qualitative data were analyzed using content analysis with NVivo 12, while kinematic results were interpreted descriptively to identify performance patterns and areas for technical refinement. Result: Kinematic analysis showed coordinated joint-angle patterns across all phases. Walking analysis identified arm swing angles of 50.9°–58.8° and leg separation angles of 64.3°–67.2°, indicating a stable gait rhythm. The running analysis revealed knee angles of 68.8°–69.8° and elbow angles of 87.6°–89.1°, indicating efficient propulsive mechanics. The flight phase demonstrated knee angles of 81.2°–87.8° and elbow angles of 80.4°–88.3°, suggesting effective momentum use and postural stability. These measurements supported stride-efficiency assessment and technique evaluation. Qualitative findings revealed that Kinovea enabled athletes to interpret movement phases and identify technical inefficiencies through slow-motion and frame-by-frame visualization. Conclusion: Kinovea supports basic motion analysis by providing clear kinematic information and helping beginner athletes observe and refine their movement techniques. The findings also offer practical value for coaches by enabling more precise identification of inefficient patterns and guiding targeted corrections during early-stage training."

OpenAlex,deep learning,Combating Data and Target Shifts in Visual Tasks,Zhaorui Tan,10.17638/03194353,2031-01-01,University of Liverpool,"The rapid advancement of deep learning models for visual tasks has led to significant progress in many domains. However, a key challenge remains: ensuring that models can generalize effectively to unseen samples or novel classes, especially in real-world scenarios where training data-target pairs are often limited or unavailable, and test data may exhibit shifts in both data and targets. This thesis addresses the problem of shifts across data and targets, proposing novel methods to improve model generalization and transferability in complex settings. The thesis identifies the different shift scenarios for visual tasks and presents their problem forms. The research first relaxes the static target distribution assumption in Multi-Domain Generalization (mDG) tasks, introducing the General Multi-Domain Generalization (GMDG) objective to improve generalization under varying data shifts. Specifically, Extensive experiments validate that GMDG is feasible for classification, segmentation, and regression tasks. Further considering extreme target distribution shifts where even unknown novel classes emerge, the study also explores logical regularization techniques for tasks such as Generalized Category Discovery (GCD), mDG+GCD, and Class Incremental Learning (CIL), proposing a sample-based logical regularization term (L-Reg) to enhance data-, target-, and all-shift generalization. Additionally, a partial logic framework is introduced to address challenges in CIL, enabling models to retain room for unknown classes during training. This is further extended by the Partial-Logic Regularization (PL-Reg), which improves generalization across GCD, mDG+GCD, and transferability for CIL tasks. Furthermore, the thesis proposes a novel Semantic-aware Data Augmentation (SADA) framework for cross-modality generalization in text-to-image synthesis (T2Isyn), text-image retrieval (TIR), and image-text retrieval (ITR) tasks. This framework ensures semantic preservation across text and image modalities, improving both semantic consistency and image quality in cross-modality tasks. The methods proposed in this thesis offer significant advancements in visual generalization and transfer scenarios, providing theoretical insights and practical solutions for handling data shifts, target shifts, and multi-modalities in complex scenarios. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of the proposed methods, demonstrating their superior performance across a range of tasks."
OpenAlex,deep learning,Antecedents and consequences of Green-tech FDI in emerging markets,Zhuoran Liu,10.17638/03195308,2031-01-01,University of Liverpool,"As environmental pressures intensify, attracting sustainable foreign direct investment (FDI), particularly green-tech FDI, has become a critical pathway for emerging markets to achieve environmental sustainability. However, existing research remains fragmented, offering limited insights into why green-tech FDI enters emerging markets and how it affects regional green innovation. This thesis addresses these gaps by systematically examining both the antecedents and consequences of green-tech FDI through three empirical studies using regional data from China. Study 1 and Study 2 focus on the antecedents of green-tech FDI. Study 1 examines how host-country conditions can attract green-tech FDI, highlighting the role of environmental management information disclosure (EMID) by domestic firms in reducing information gaps and strengthening green market–seeking motives. Study 2 shifts attention to the active decision-making of green-tech FDI, showing that under uncertainty, green-tech foreign investors engage in identity-based bandwagon learning by imitating peers with similar green identities, thereby mitigating investment risks. Study 3 turns to the consequences of green-tech FDI. It demonstrates that, due to the technological complexity of green innovation and limited absorptive capacity in emerging markets, green-tech FDI may generate crowding-out effects rather than purely positive spillovers. Adopting a network perspective, the study further finds that universities play a key moderating role: through broad linkages and deep collaborations, they help mitigate negative spillovers and facilitate the diffusion of green technologies. Together, the three studies advance the literature on sustainable FDI by differentiating green-tech FDI from general FDI and identifying the specific mechanisms that shape its entry decisions and local innovation outcomes. Practically, the findings provide guidance for emerging-market governments and firms on how to attract and manage sustainable investment, balance growth with environmental objectives, and strengthen local innovation ecosystems."
OpenAlex,deep learning,A UAV-Based Framework for Community-Scale Residential Building Energy Modelling in China,Mengfan Jin,10.17638/03195460,2029-01-01,University of Liverpool,"With increasing emphasis on energy efficiency and carbon emission reduction in the building sector, rapid and scalable energy modelling of existing buildings is critical for retrofit projects and policy development. Conventional surveys, data collection and energy modelling processes remain labour-intensive and impractical for large-scale applications, and energy modelling often dominates project time and cost. Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) equipped with high-resolution and infrared cameras now offer fast and safe exterior surveys, showing great potential in building energy assessments. Yet, a systematic framework for UAV integration, from image capture through processing to inputs for building energy simulation, has not been established. This research addresses these challenges by developing a structured framework for community-scale building energy modelling, which integrates UAV photogrammetry to accelerate data acquisition, reduce labour, and shorten energy modelling time for retrofit projects. The framework is designed to minimise prior data requirements while maximising automation and retaining sufficient accuracy and reliability. It also addressed systemic issues, such as the lack of data necessary to fully exploit the potential of available technologies in the context of this study. To achieve this research objective, a mixed-methodology approach, combining desk studies and fieldwork, was adopted. First, a comprehensive review of UAV-based building energy studies mapped the current applications and available tools, proposing a preliminary framework. Fieldwork then encompassed a pilot study and a detailed case study. In the pilot test, a single building was surveyed to identify an optimal toolchain for flight planning, image capture, photogrammetric reconstruction, model generation, and selection of a simulation platform. The resulting refined framework was applied to a case study of a 39-building community, and it was demonstrated that further automation was necessary. The potential for automation was then further explored. Geomatic algorithms, machine learning, and deep learning techniques were compared, and the combination that best balanced accuracy and processing time was selected for 3D model generation and window-to-wall ratio (WWR) extraction. In parallel, an archetype library of residential buildings in the Hot Summer Cold Winter (HSCW) zone in China was compiled to facilitate the assignment of thermal parameters. Finally, a reusable community-scale building energy modelling (CBEM) workflow was assembled in Grasshopper using Ladybug Tools components to process the aforementioned inputs. In conclusion, this study integrates UAV photogrammetry, GIS-based geomatic algorithms, machine learning, and graphical programming to develop an UAV-CBEM framework. The outcomes establish a foundation for scalable UAV-based building energy assessments, enhancing applicability in data-limited and large-scale settings worldwide."

OpenAlex,deep learning,Unsupervised Deep-learning Methods for Low-dose Computed Tomography Reconstruction,Ran An,10.17638/03194237,2027-01-01,University of Liverpool,"Computed tomography (CT) has become an indispensable imaging technique in medical diagnostics and industrial applications, owing to its non-invasive nature and high resolution in visualizing object internal structures. While X-ray CT (X-ray computed tomography) significantly enhances lesion detection capabilities, excessive exposure to X-ray radiation raises substantial health concerns, including elevated cancer risks and potential genetic damage. Although low-dose CT (LDCT) protocols reduce radiation safety concerns, they inevitably introduce severe noise and artifacts, which might compromise diagnostic accuracy. Recent advances in supervised deep learning approaches have demonstrated remarkable success in LDCT reconstruction. However, the reliance on paired training data severely limits their deployment in practical CT applications. This fundamental constraint highlights the critical importance of developing unsupervised reconstruction methods. Although existing unsupervised LDCT methods have made notable progress, they still face challenges requiring systematic solutions. This thesis makes three contributions to advance the field of unsupervised LDCT reconstruction: 1. Current dual-domain self-supervised LDCT denoising methods typically neglect the heterogeneity of the non-stationary Gaussian noise levels in low-dose sinograms and usually treat them as common images without appropriately controlling the denoising strength. The denoisers employed by them, which are based on classic convolutional neural networks (CNN), will lead to blurring artifacts in the reconstructed images if directly used for sinogram denoising. In addition, the denoising strength in the sinogram and image domains must be well-balanced to avoid introducing over-blurring or secondary artifacts in the reconstructed images, but existing approaches do not focus on this crucial point. To address these limitations, this thesis proposes a novel end-to-end dual-domain self-supervised framework for LDCT denoising. It employs Dropblock layers to adaptively localize the effect of convolution for sinogram denoising and sets a weighted average between the denoised sinograms and their noisy counterparts to better control the denoising strength, thus effectively reducing the blurring artifacts and leading to a well-balanced dual-domain denoising. Numerical experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and superior performance of the proposed method. 2. Existing normalizing flows (NFs)-based unsupervised LDCT reconstruction methods face challenges in both image quality and computational efficiency. On one hand, they typically utilize a two-way transformation strategy between noisy images and latent variables, which could easily lead to detail loss and secondary artifacts in the reconstructed images. On the other hand, training NFs on high-resolution CT images is computationally intensive. Although conditional normalizing flows (CNFs) can mitigate computational costs by learning conditional probabilities, existing approaches rely on labeled data for conditionalization, leaving unsupervised CNFs-based LDCT reconstruction a challenge. To tackle these issues, this thesis proposes a novel unsupervised LDCT iterative reconstruction algorithm based on CNFs. The proposed method employs a strict one-way transformation strategy during the alternating optimization in the dual spaces to prevent detail loss and secondary artifacts, and proposes a novel unsupervised conditionalization strategy for CNFs, thus achieving efficient training and inference on high-resolution images. The proposed method illustrates high-quality and relatively fast unsupervised reconstruction. Experiments across two datasets demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed method by rivaling several state-of-the-art methods. 3. Current diffusion model-based LDCT reconstruction methods solely employ the prior distributions learned from normal-dose CT data but neglect the valuable priors in low-dose data, which contain information about the characteristics of low-dose noise and artifacts. In addition, their reconstruction speed suffers from multiple sampling steps, presenting low efficiency. Breaking new ground in prior utilization, this thesis proposes a novel unsupervised LDCT iterative reconstruction algorithm based on dual denoising diffusion probabilistic models (DDPM), which leverages both normal-dose and low-dose priors. Specifically, the proposed method employs two DDPMs to learn the prior distributions from normal-dose and low-dose images, respectively, and incorporates them into a joint iterative reconstruction framework. To accelerate the reconstruction, partial diffusion sampling and single-pass deterministic reconstruction strategy are utilized in the proposed method, as well as the spaced OS-SART approaches. Experiments at different dose levels demonstrate the outstanding performance and fast speed of the proposed reconstruction algorithm. Through these innovations and contributions, this thesis addresses some significant challenges in current deep-learning-based unsupervised LDCT reconstruction methods, and proposes three novel unsupervised reconstruction algorithms. The proposed methods effectively improve the performance and efficiency of LDCT reconstruction under different unsupervised learning conditions, and provide some new perspectives and inspirations for future research."
OpenAlex,deep learning,From Sparse to Dense: Label-Efficient Weakly Supervised Segmentation for Images and Videos,Jian Wang,10.17638/03195330,2027-01-01,University of Liverpool,"Obtaining high-quality annotated data has become a primary bottleneck for training deep learning models, particularly for dense prediction tasks like semantic segmentation and video salient object segmentation. The demand for meticulous, pixel-level labeling makes fully-supervised approaches prohibitively expensive and limits their scalability. This thesis directly confronts this issue by proposing and systematically investigating a label-efficient ""sparse-to-dense'' paradigm. The core objective is to develop innovative frameworks that can learn from sparse, inexpensive weak supervision—such as image-level tags or scribbles—and intelligently propagate this minimal information to generate complete, pixel-accurate dense predictions. The major part of this thesis focuses on the ""sparse-to-dense'' challenge within Weakly Supervised Semantic Segmentation (WSSS) for images, where models learn from only image-level tags. Dominant approaches rely on Class Activation Maps (CAMs) as initial object seeds. However, CAMs inherently activate only the most discriminative object regions, leading to incomplete pseudo-labels. This gives rise to the central problem of activation densification: the critical process of expanding these sparse activations to cover the full extent of an object. Our research addresses this challenge through a progressive, multi-faceted strategy. Our exploration begins with a foundational framework (C3) designed to rectify the intrinsic flaws of initial CAMs. We propose a synergistic mutual calibration method. This method leverages the discrepancies between the two maps to generate local prototypes, which are simultaneously utilized to complete missing object parts and suppress background noise, yielding a significantly more accurate and complete initial seed. This foundational work immediately reveals the limitation of single-prototype instability and its inability to capture diverse features. Building on this foundation, we then develop architecture-specific strategies to address deeper limitations of the prototype-based approach. For Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) (C4), the use of a single prototype proves insufficient to capture significant intra-class variation. In response, we introduce an Optimal Transport (OT)-assisted framework that effectively mines multiple, diverse prototypes, thereby yielding more comprehensive activation maps. However, while C4 solves the intra-class diversity problem, the inherent local context constraint of the CNN architecture becomes the new bottleneck, fundamentally limiting the quality of globally-aware feature extraction needed for optimal multi-prototype assignment. This limitation necessitates a shift in architectural focus from CNNs to Vision Transformers. In the ViT architecture (C5), a new challenge arises where the token gap between the discriminative class token and varied patch tokens leads to incomplete activation. To bridge this gap, we leverage a tailored application of Optimal Transport, where the algorithm is tasked with learning a comprehensive proxy to ensure complete object activation. Despite these architectural advances (C3-C5), the overall WSSS performance hit a ceiling. This is fundamentally limited by the sparse supervision of class labels, which cannot provide precise boundary information. To break this ceiling, our WSSS exploration culminates in a universal enhancement strategy (C6) that transcends architecture-specific designs by leveraging Visual Foundation Models (VFMs). We resolve the conflict between the discriminative nature of initial CAMs and the VFM's need for holistic prompts. By modeling the CAM foreground as a graph and employing spectral analysis, our method intelligently selects a diverse set of prompt points that represent the overall structure of the foreground object. This guides the VFM to generate superior, boundary-aware supervision that can universally enhance any WSSS pipeline. Subsequently, the thesis extends the ""sparse-to-dense'' paradigm to the dynamic domain of video, addressing Weakly Supervised Video Salient Object Segmentation (WSVSOS) (C7) from sparse scribble annotations. In this specific context, the challenge evolves into spatio-temporal densification, which requires both full-object coverage within each frame and temporal consistency across the video sequences. To this end, we introduce the core CFMR framework, which utilizes Spatio-Temporal co-regulation. This framework is subsequently enhanced (CFMR+) by integrating the VFM guidance strategy from C6, which provides high-quality spatial priors essential for ensuring both high spatial detail and inter-frame consistency. By enforcing both intra-frame and cross-frame consistency between these two streams, our method effectively propagates the sparse initial signal to generate dense and temporally coherent saliency masks. In conclusion, this thesis presents a comprehensive and cohesive investigation into label-efficient segmentation tasks, offering a suite of innovative and effective strategies for the ""sparse-to-dense'' challenge. Our work establishes a progressive roadmap that systematically overcomes architectural and semantic limitations, culminating in highly robust and generalized densification pipelines. Our extensive experimental results on standard benchmarks validate the state-of-the-art performance of these methods, providing robust solutions to a long-standing problem in the computer vision field."

Abstract This Project develops an urban traffic intensity prediction system using deep learning techniques, with the aim of improving mobility decision-making. Unlike other platforms focused on visualizing the current state, the proposed solution seeks to anticipate future behaviors, and is positioned as an open, replicable alternative specifically oriented towards prediction. To achieve this, a modular architecture based on the Python language has been designed, capable of integrating multiple open data sources: historical traffic records, historical weather situation data, and spatial coordinates of measurement sensors. The system applies a process of cleaning, temporal interpolation, and variable transformation, including cyclic encoding of time and spatial conversion to UTM coordinates, allowing for precise fusion between geographical and meteorological data through techniques such as inverse distance weighting (IDW). The predictive model is based on an LSTM neural network, especially adapted for multivariate time sequences. It is trained using a sliding window strategy of 32 samples (7 hours and 45 minutes) to predict traffic intensity in the next interval. The system additionally incorporates an IterableDataset mechanism to handle large volumes of training data without compromising the stability of the environment. The obtained results show robust accuracy in validation scenarios, with acceptable prediction errors (MAE and RMSE). Furthermore, an interactive web interface has been developed, allowing for the local deployment of the system, with the capacity for real-time data ingestion and direct visualization of predictions. This work demonstrates the technical and operational feasibility of applying deep learning to urban traffic analysis and lays the groundwork for its future evolution towards more generalizable, robust, and useful systems in real smart city contexts."
OpenAlex,deep learning,Deep Learning-Based Data Hiding Technique for Medical Images,Hadjer SAIDI,,2026-06-26,University of Biskra Theses Repository (University of Biskra),"This thesis introduces novel deep learning-based frameworks for secure medical image steganography, addressing the critical challenge of protecting sensitive patient information while preserving diagnostic quality. Medical images present unique security requirements due to their dual nature: containing both critical visual data for diagnosis and sensitive patient metadata, which conventional steganographic techniques do not adequately address. Our work presents two complementary approaches to this challenge. First, we develop a Mask-RCNN based framework that intelligently identifies diagnostically insignificant regions within medical images for strategic data embedding. By combining this regionaware detection with Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) embedding in the frequency domain, our method achieves remarkable imperceptibility with Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR) values exceeding 115 dB while maintaining high payload capacity. Second, we propose a clinical quality-aware convolutional neural network architecture that leverages an encoder-decoder framework for end-to-end steganography. This approach employs parallel processing paths with scaled residual learning to embed secret medical images within cover images while preserving diagnostic features. Extensive experimentation across multiple medical imaging modalities (CT, MRI) from datasets including MIDRC-RICORD-1B, and IQ-OTH/NCCD, demonstrates that our method achieves a good trade-off between payload and imperceptibility. The frameworks developed in this thesis achieve an optimal balance between embedding capacity, imperceptibility, and robust secret recovery, providing healthcare institutions with effective tools for safeguarding patient privacy while maintaining the integrity of medical diagnostics. This work significantly advances the field of medical image security and establishes a foundation for future innovations in secure healthcare information systems."

However, denoising strategies are crucial for the generation of reliable and high-quality InSAR products. In this framework, we propose a complete and generalized theoretical and statistical model to physically describe and simulate a noise-free interferogram, together with its corresponding noisy version, starting from the knowledge of the InSAR acquisition geometry and of the underlying topography. A deep-learning-based model is then trained in a fully-supervised manner to estimate high-resolution InSAR parameters, i.e. coherence and interferometric phase, leveraging the proposed statistical model. In particular, an accurate assessment of the network’s estimation performance is conducted by comparing it to state-of-the-art denoising filters, such as Boxcar and Phi-Net and showing the added value of the proposed theoretical modifications to the state-of-the-art literature."
