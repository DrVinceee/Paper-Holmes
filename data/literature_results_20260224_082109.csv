Heart failure,"Guidelines acknowledge that discordant low-gradient (LG) aortic stenosis (AS) may be severe, but verifying this can be challenging. Right heart catheterization during exercise is considered the gold standard for evaluating ventricular hemodynamics. No invasive studies have compared the hemodynamic response of discordant LG and severe AS during exercise. The aim of this observational study was to describe exercise hemodynamics in patients with asymptomatic discordant AS and left ventricular ejection fraction ≥50%.
Patients with aortic valve area ≤1.5 cm2 underwent right heart catheterization at rest and during maximal exercise, measuring pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (PCWP), cardiac output (CO), and the PCWP/CO-slope. Patients were stratified into 3 groups: discordant LG AS (aortic valve area ≤1.0 cm2 and mean gradient <40 mm Hg); moderate AS (aortic valve area >1.0 cm2); and high-gradient (HG) severe AS (aortic valve area ≤1.0 cm2 and mean gradient ≥40 mm Hg).
Among 86 patients, 17 (20%) had discordant LG, 49 (57%) moderate, and 20 (23%) HG severe AS. The median PCWP/CO-slope was significantly steeper in discordant LG (3.3 [interquartile range, 2.1-4.3] mm Hg/L/min) and HG severe AS (2.7 [1.9-3.4] mm Hg/L per minute) compared with moderate AS (1.9 [0.7-2.8] mm Hg/L per minute), P=0.004. In a regression model adjusted for age, sex, and rest PCWP, systemic arterial compliance and AS severity were significantly associated with the PCWP/CO-slope. Furthermore, patients with discordant LG AS had a leftward-upward shift in the PCWP/CO-curve.
Discordant LG and HG severe AS had similar hemodynamic responses to exercise with steeper PCWP/CO-slope than in moderate AS, suggesting that discordant LG AS is a severe form of AS. In addition, the left upwards shift in PCWP/CO-curve for discordant LG compared with HG severe AS indicates that this group also has heart failure with preserved ejection fraction physiology.

Since the first-in-human procedure in 2002, TAVI has gained global acceptance owing to its favorable clinical outcomes and faster recovery than those associated with surgical aortic valve replacement. Landmark trials have demonstrated the noninferiority or superiority of TAVI across high-, intermediate-, and low-surgical risk populations, leading to guideline endorsement as a recommended option for appropriately selected patients across all surgical risk groups. Furthermore, long-term follow-up data support the durability of contemporary TAVI devices. Beyond its current established indications, TAVI is being explored for broader applications such as asymptomatic severe AS, moderate AS with heart failure, and pure aortic regurgitation; however, these uses remain investigational and are not yet part of formal guidelines. This review summarizes TAVI's historical evolution, pivotal clinical trial evidence, and procedural innovations that have enabled its widespread use. We explore Korea-specific experiences with TAVI implementation, highlighting national registry data, healthcare policy considerations, and institutional adoption. Future perspectives include long-term device performance, lifetime valve management strategies, and the integration of artificial intelligence into transcatheter valve therapy."

While double valve surgery (DVS) remains the gold standard, its high operative risks have led to investigating novel strategies, chiefly transcatheter interventions. Due to the lack of commercially available transcatheter devices for MS, numerous high-risk patients undergo isolated transcatheter aortic valve replacement (I-TAVR). The long-term efficacy and durability of this single-valve approach in a multivalvular stenotic setting is not well established.
Retrospective analyses of consecutive patients treated for concomitant severe AS and moderate-to-severe MS at a single institution (2015-2025), divided according to treatment strategy (DVS vs I-TAVR). Propensity-score matching accounted for baseline differences, while univariable and multivariable analyses evaluated factors associated with recurrent heart failure (HF) readmissions.
Ninety-seven patients underwent DVS and 129 I-TAVR. Both before and after propensity score matching, no differences were observed in short- nor mid-term incidence of all-cause mortality (unmatched, p = 0.078; matched, no events) nor stroke (unmatched, p = 0.783; matched, p = 1.00). However, I-TAVR was found to be associated with greater HF rehospitalizations (unmatched, p = 0.001; matched, p = 0.006). The univariable and multivariable analyses demonstrated I-TAVR to be an independent risk factor for HF rehospitalization, in both the unmatched and matched populations.
In patients with high-grade concomitant AS and MS, addressing only AS with I-TAVR is an independent predictor of HF readmissions. While I-TAVR remains a valid therapeutic option in high-risk patients with high-grade multivalvular stenosis, DVS should be considered as the preferred treatment option in any patient that can tolerate surgery.

Cerebral embolic protection devices (CEPD), including filter-based and deflection-based systems (Sentinel and TriGUARD), aim to reduce embolic complications; however, their clinical benefit remains uncertain. This study evaluated the efficacy and safety of CEPD during TAVR using trial sequential analysis (TSA) and the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) framework.
Randomized controlled trials (RCTs comparing TAVR with and without CEPD were identified through four electronic databases from inception to April 2025. Primary outcomes were all-cause mortality, major adverse cardiovascular and cerebrovascular events (MACCE), stroke, and disabling stroke. Pooled risk ratios (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated. TSA was conducted with a 5% type I error and 80% power.
Nine RCTs including 11,876 patients were analyzed. CEPD use showed no significant reduction in mortality, MACCE, stroke, or disabling stroke. Secondary and subgroup analyses yielded consistent findings. TSA demonstrated that the accrued evidence was insufficient to confirm a clinical benefit.
Current evidence does not support the routine use of CEPD during TAVR, given the lack of significant benefit in key clinical outcomes.

Developed by a multidisciplinary Heart Team including patient representatives, the guidelines emphasize patient-centered ""lifetime"" management, shared decision-making, and treatment at high-volume expert Heart Valve Centers, especially for complex surgical and transcatheter procedures. The scope has been broadened to address cancer and radiation-associated VHD, cardiogenic shock and acute heart failure, multiple and mixed VHD, and sex-specific issues. Key changes in indications for imaging, treatment, and follow-up of VHD are discussed in the perspective of evidence-based medicine. Key updates include earlier intervention in severe, high-gradient, asymptomatic aortic stenosis, refined age thresholds favoring transfemoral transcatheter aortic valve implantation, and its use in bicuspid aortic stenosis and aortic regurgitation in high-risk or inoperable patients. Recommendations for secondary mitral regurgitation (MR) distinguish atrial from ventricular mechanisms and upgrade mitral transcatheter edge-to-edge repair to class I in selected cases of ventricular secondary MR. At the same time, surgery remains first-line for primary MR, with defined triggers for early repair and emerging roles for transcatheter edge-to-edge repair and transcatheter mitral valve implantation in high-risk patients. The document also strengthens guidance on tricuspid interventions, structured assessment of right ventricular dysfunction, and simplifies antithrombotic strategies, including restricted use of dual antiplatelet therapy after transcatheter aortic valve implantation in patients without another indication for oral anticoagulation. Implementing these recommendations should streamline care pathways and reduce the burden of VHD."

We report the case of a 55-year-old woman with severe symptomatic aortic stenosis who underwent elective mechanical aortic valve replacement. Preoperative echocardiography showed preserved ventricular dimensions with low-normal systolic function. Due to technical difficulties during mini-sternotomy, a prolonged aortic cross-clamp time was required with repeated cardioplegia. Failure to wean from cardiopulmonary bypass was followed by complete left ventricular akinesia, immobile left-sided valves, and minimal right ventricular activity despite maximal support. Full sternotomy revealed a rigid, non-compliant myocardium consistent with SHS. Central veno-arterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation was instituted without myocardial recovery. The patient died from multiorgan failure on postoperative day three. SHS results from profound myocardial ischemia, causing adenosine triphosphate depletion, calcium overload, and irreversible actin-myosin binding. Prevention, achieved through meticulous myocardial protection and strict minimization of ischemic time, remains the only effective strategy against this devastating and irreversible complication of cardiac surgery."

Case reports,"Transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) is an effective and safe treatment for severe aortic stenosis. Despite advancements reducing complications, rare life-threatening events like ventricular perforation remain significant challenges. This case details the management of an acute left ventricular perforation during TAVI.
A 74-year-old woman with symptomatic severe bicuspid aortic stenosis underwent transfemoral TAVI. Sudden haemodynamic collapse occurred during the device delivery. Transoesophageal echocardiography demonstrated massive pericardial effusion, attributed to guidewire-induced left ventricular perforation. The patient maintained haemodynamic stability with pericardial drainage on cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB). However, pericardial effusion recurred after transitioning from CPB to extracorporeal membrane oxygenation support. Cardiac surgeons repaired the laceration at the apex and achieved haemostasis through minimally invasive left anterior thoracotomy, successfully resolving the intraoperative crisis and rescuing the patient.
This case illustrates that ventricular perforation/rupture during TAVI, while rare, constitutes a fatal complication. To mitigate this risk, enhanced preoperative risk stratification and intraprocedural monitoring for left or right ventricular perforation/rupture are imperative. Prompt recognition and intervention-including pericardiocentesis, CPB initiation, and surgical haemostasis-are critical upon occurrence. Innovatively employing minimally invasive left anterior thoracotomy for repair in this case significantly reduced surgical trauma, facilitating rapid postoperative recovery."

Case reports,"Cardiac masses encompass a broad differential, including benign tumours, malignancies, and pseudotumours. Accurate diagnosis requires integration of clinical context, patient characteristics, lesion location, and imaging features. In select cases, tissue characterization is necessary. We describe a case of a rapidly enlarging interatrial mass following transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI).
A 70-year-old man underwent TAVI for severe low-flow, low-gradient aortic stenosis. Preprocedural imaging revealed an incidental interatrial mass consistent with lipomatous hypertrophy of the atrial septum (LHAS). Six months later, the mass showed significant interval growth, raising concern for malignancy. Multimodality imaging, including cardiac magnetic resonance imaging and FDG positron emission tomography yielded indeterminate results. An echocardiography-guided biopsy was performed, and histopathologic analysis confirmed LHAS with intralesional haemorrhage likely incurred during the TAVI procedure.
While LHAS is typically benign and stable or slowly progressive, rare cases may present with atypical features and rapid growth, mimicking malignant cardiac tumours. This case represents the first reported instance of LHAS with haemorrhagic expansion."

Patients who underwent TAVR for severe symptomatic native AS with preserved left ventricular ejection fraction (≥50%) from 2012 to 2022 at our center were included. The cohort was divided into 3 different hemodynamic AS groups: high-gradient aortic stenosis (HGAS) (aortic valve mean gradient [AVMG] ≥40 mm Hg, aortic valve [AV] peak velocity ≥4 m/s, and AV area ≤1 cm2), NFLG (stroke volume index ≥35 mL/m2, AVMG <40 mm Hg, AV area ≤1 cm2), and pLFLG (stroke volume index <35 mL/m2, AVMG <40 mm Hg, AV area ≤1 cm2). The primary outcome was all-cause mortality at 1 and 5 years.
Totally, 1683 patients (929 HGAS, 344 pLFLG, and 410 NFLG) were included; median age was 82.8 (77.2-87.2) years. At 1 year, mortality was higher among patients with pLFLG AS (15.5%) compared with HGAS (10.8%, P = .05). Although NFLG AS had a higher mortality than HGAS at 1 year, this did not reach statistical significance (15.9% vs 10.8%, respectively; P = .06). There was no significant difference in survival between the 3 groups at 5 years post-TAVR.
In patients who undergo TAVR, those with a pLFLG pattern of AS have a worse 1-year survival, but similar 5-year survival when compared with traditional HGAS AS. There was no significant difference in survival in patients with NFLG AS when compared with HGAS at 1 and 5 years post-TAVR."

This study aimed to evaluate whether markers of right-sided extravalvular damage improve STS-PROM's performance in predicting 1-year mortality post-TAVR for patients with low-flow, low-gradient AS.
Four hundred ten patients with valve area ≤1.0 cm2, stroke volume index ≤35 mL/m2, and mean gradient <40 mm Hg who underwent TAVR were retrospectively stratified into low (<4%), moderate (4%-8%), and high (>8%) STS-PROM risk groups. Performance of an enhanced logistic regression model incorporating both STS-PROM and right-sided extravalvular damage (defined as moderate+ pulmonary hypertension, moderate+ tricuspid regurgitation, or right ventricular systolic dysfunction) was assessed using receiver operating characteristic curves, net reclassification index (NRI), and integrated discrimination index (IDI).
Right-sided extravalvular damage was independently associated with increased 1-year mortality (OR, 2.45; 95% CI, 1.34-4.46; P < .01). Model fit improved with its addition (Δχ2 = 8.68, P < .01), and discrimination increased (IDI = 0.02, P = .01). NRI analysis showed improved survivor classification (non-event NRI = 0.10, P < .01). The largest gain was in moderate-risk patients (area under the curve, 0.46-0.67; P = .06).
Markers of right-sided extravalvular damage conferred meaningful prognostic value in low-flow, low-gradient AS by correcting the STS-PROM score's tendency to overestimate post-TAVR mortality. The added value of these markers was most pronounced in moderate-risk patients, for whom existing tools appear least reliable. These markers may improve patient selection for TAVR and merit evaluation in other severe AS phenotypes."

The choice between these two strategies is guided by the age and clinical profile of the patient. Our study aims to verify the hypothesis that including health-related quality of life (HRQL) as an outcome measure may be relevant to therapeutic choice.
This prospective observational study included 806 patients aged 65-80 years who received either SAVR or TAVI. HRQL was assessed using the SF-12 questionnaire before and after the procedure (1-4 years of follow-up). Propensity score matching was applied to account for baseline differences between groups, resulting in two matched groups of 92 patients each. A subgroup of 80 patients received a neurocognitive function assessment before the procedure and at 2-3 months of follow-up.
At 1-year follow-up, no significant differences were observed between SAVR and TAVI in terms of the mental and physical components of the SF-12, with both procedures resulting in significant improvements in HRQL in both the prematching and propensity-matched populations. In the prematching population, at 4-years follow-up and after adjustment for potential confounders, the cumulative risk of HRQL deterioration did not differ significantly between SAVR and TAVI for the mental component (hazards ratio 1.03, 95% confidence interval 0.69-1.56, P = 0.881), while it was significantly higher (hazards ratio 1.89, 95% confidence interval 1.02-3.59, P = 0.045) for the physical component in the TAVI group. After propensity score matching, these results were confirmed, with no significant differences in the mental component (hazards ratio 1.14, 95% confidence interval 0.65-2.00, P = 0.640) and a significantly higher risk of worsening in the physical component in the TAVI group (hazards ratio 3.91, 95% confidence interval 1.46-10.5, P = 0.007). Early cognitive impairment was associated with a significantly higher risk of deterioration in the mental component at 1-year follow-up (relative risk 3.2, 95% confidence interval 1.18-8.94, P = 0.023).
In a real-world scenario, no differences in quality of life were observed between SAVR and TAVI at 1-year follow-up; conversely, at 4-year follow-up, the physical component of HRQL appeared to be better preserved in patients undergoing SAVR."

Conscious sedation is preferred to preserve spontaneous respiration and patient cooperation. Dexmedetomidine, a selective α2-adrenergic agonist, provides sedation, analgesia, and sympatholysis with minimal respiratory depression, making it suitable for high-risk TAVI patients.
We retrospectively analyzed 53 patients who underwent TAVI under dexme-detomidine-based sedation at a single center between January and July 2025. Patients received an initial loading dose of dexmedetomidine (1 μg/kg over 15 minutes) and fen-tanyl (1 μg/kg), followed by dexmedetomidine infusion (0.2-1.2 μg/kg/h) to achieve a Ramsay Sedation Score of 3-4 and bispectral index (BIS) 70-80. Hemodynamic param-eters were recorded at baseline (T0), post-loading (T1), 10 minutes post-loading (T2), and end of procedure (T3). Hemodynamic compromise was defined as a >30% decrease in systolic or mean arterial pressure(MAP) <65 mm Hg.
The mean age was 76.4 ± 7.3 years, with 58.5% female; all patients were ASA III-IV. Mean arterial pressure (MAP) remained above 65 mm Hg at all time points, with the greatest decrease at T2. Systolic and MAP reductions were consistently below the 30%threshold. Postoperative complications included pacemaker implantation in 2 patients, transient contrast-induced nephropathy in 1, and temporary inotropic support in 4. No anesthesia-related respiratory complications occurred.
Dexmedetomidine combined with fentanyl provides safe and effective sedation for TAVI, maintaining hemodynamic stability and spontaneous respiration. This sedation protocol minimizes perioperative risks and may improve procedural safety in high-risk patients."

We retrospectively evaluated 139 consecutive patients who underwent TAVR with a balloon-expandable valve. The predicted valve-to-sinotubular junction (VTSTJ) length and calcium volume of each coronary cusp were measured on pre-procedural CT. The observed VTSTJ length was assessed on post-procedural CT. High SS risk was defined as VTSTJ < 2.0 mm in either the right or left coronary cusp. Pre-procedural CT classified 78 patients into the high predicted SS (PSS) risk group; 77 (98.7%) showed a high observed SS (OSS) risk on post-procedural CT. Among the 61 patients classified as having low PSS risk, 44 (72.1%) were found to have high OSS risk post-TAVR. In this subgroup, patients with high OSS risk had a significantly higher proportion of non-coronary cusp calcium volume (NCC-CV) compared to those with low OSS risk (median 48.7% [interquartile range (IQR): 42.1-55.2] vs. 39.2% [IQR: 33.7-45.4]; p = 0.004).

Hemoglobin (Hb) levels are physiologically different in males and females, and sex differences are increasingly recognized to play an important role in the prognosis of many cardiovascular diseases, including aortic valve stenosis. We aimed to evaluate the prognostic role of preoperative anemia, RDW, and periprocedural transfusions in TAVI patients followed up to 2 years, especially focusing on sex-related differences. 609 patients (median age 83 years, 53.9% females) undergoing TAVI at Verona University Hospital between March 2010 and June 2019 were retrospectively evaluated. Anemia before TAVI was highly prevalent (55.0%) in our population, mostly mild to moderate. Females were less anemic than males (48.8% versus 62.3%, p = 0.001) but experienced more vascular complications and were more frequently transfused within 30 days of the procedure (43.3% versus 28.8%, p < 0.001). Overall, anemic patients at baseline had a 2-year survival lower than non-anemic patients (Log-rank 5.915, p = 0.015). Similarly, patients with baseline RDW > 15% had reduced survival at 2 years compared to patients with normal RDW (Log-rank 14.038, p < 0.001). Grouping for sex, these differences only persisted in males. Multivariable analyses showed that hematological variables, such as periprocedural transfusions and RDW, were significant predictors of 2-year mortality in males but not in females. Our study highlights significant sex-related differences in the role of hematological parameters as independent predictors of 2-year mortality after TAVI."

Secondary endpoints were a composite of completed cardiac specialty visit or aortic valve replacement (AVR) within 90 days, and AVR within 6 months. Analyses compared pre- and post-nudge cohorts using propensity score matching and multivariable logistic regression models. A difference-in-difference analysis was conducted to evaluate whether the nudge's effect differed by referring provider specialty (cardiac vs. non-cardiac).
5,009 patients (mean age 78±11 years, 57% men, 88% White, 69% symptomatic) were identified. After propensity score matching (Total n=3,840, Pre-nudge: 2,560 patients, post-nudge: 1,280 patients), referral to cardiac specialty care increased from 94% pre-nudge to 97% post-nudge (p<0.001), and the composite outcome improved from 89% to 93% post-nudge (p=0.003). Among non-cardiac specialty providers, all three outcomes of referral (89% to 96%, p<0.001), composite outcome (83% to 88%, p=0.017) and AVR within 6 months were higher post-nudge (33% to 39%, p=0.016). In the multivariable logistic regression model of the full-cohort, the nudge was independently associated with higher odds of referral (aOR 1.62, 95% CI 1.15-2.30; p=0.006) and composite outcome (aOR 1.40, 95% CI 1.10-1.79; p=0.007), with a significant interaction indicating that the effect was most pronounced among non-cardiac specialty providers (p<0.001).
A non-interruptive, scalable, EHR-embedded nudge within echocardiography reports improved referral to cardiac specialty care and treatment in patients with newly diagnosed severe AS, particularly among non-cardiac specialty providers. These findings support the role of non-interruptive, automated nudges in standardizing guidelines-based care in severe AS."

This study used bidirectional, multivariable, and mediation MR to comprehensively analyze the associations between different VC subtypes and HF as well as its subtypes from multiple perspectives. Accessible genome-wide association study (GWAS) data of VC were included, covering coronary artery calcification (CAC), abdominal aortic calcification (AAC), and calcific aortic valve stenosis (CAVS). Accessible public GWAS data of HF were also included, covering overall heart failure (HFall), ischemic heart failure (IHF), non-ischemic heart failure (ni-HF) recently published in Nature Genetics, and GWAS data of ni-HF with reduced ejection fraction (ni-HFrEF) and ni-HF with preserved ejection fraction (ni-HFpEF) which were classified based on ejection fraction.
After sensitivity analysis and multiple correction, the following findings were obtained: (1) VC significantly increases the risk of HF. Specifically, CAC, AAC, and CAVS all significantly increase the risks of HFall and IHF; only CAVS is associated with an increased risk of ni-HF, while CAC and AAC have no impact on ni-HF; VC has no impact on ni-HFrEF or ni-HFpEF. (2) HF also promotes the progression of VC, indicating a bidirectional causal relationship between the two. Specifically, HFall and IHF significantly increase the risks of CAC and AAC; IHF increases the risk of CAVS; no reverse causal relationship is found between ni-HF (including its subtypes) and VC. (3) After two-step MR and multivariable MR correction, atrial fibrillation (AF) is found to partially mediate the causal effect of CAVS on HFall, with a mediation proportion of 21.65%.
This study reveals a bidirectional causal relationship between VC and HF through two-sample bidirectional MR, suggesting that early detection and management of VC are conducive to the prevention and treatment of HF, especially in high-risk populations such as those with ischemic heart disease. Controlling HF also helps delay the progression of VC and improve vascular status, which is the cornerstone of the prognosis of various cardiovascular diseases. Mediation analysis identifies AF as an important mediating factor, suggesting that screening and intervention of AF may be the key link to block the ""VC → AF → HF"" pathway, providing new genetic evidence for the prevention and treatment of HF."

Cardiovascular Imaging,"Aortic stenosis (AS) is characterized by fibrotic and calcific remodeling of the valve, but their sex- and morphology-specific contributions to disease severity remain incompletely characterized.
This cross-sectional analysis enrolled 448 AS patients with preserved flow (left ventricular ejection fraction ≥50%, stroke volume index >35 mL/m²) who underwent comprehensive echocardiography and cardiac CT, severity was classified by both peak aortic jet velocity and indexed aortic valve area (AVA), and stratified by sex and valve morphology (bicuspid [BAV] or tricuspid [TAV] aortic valve). Mean age was 64.6±10.1 years, 48.2% were female, and 54.5% had BAV. Calcification metrics showed consistent, significant correlations with peak aortic jet velocity (e.g., √Calcific volume density : R = 0.571, P<0.001) and indexed AVA (R = -0.466, P<0.001) across all subgroups. In contrast, fibrotic volume density demonstrated minimal or non-significant correlations with severity indices and lacked a proportional association across severity stages. Pronounced sex- and morphology-specific patterns were observed. Specifically, in severe AS classified by both peak aortic jet velocity and indexed AVA, women with BAV had higher fibrotic volume density than men (P=0.017 and 0.062), while men exhibited greater calcification (Both P<0.001). Among TAV patients, men had higher calcific volume density (Both P<0.001) and similar fibrotic volume density (P=0.792 and 0.923) than women.
Valvular calcification is the tissue component more strongly and consistently associated with disease severity in AS, irrespective of whether assessed by peak aortic jet velocity or indexed AVA. Fibrosis represents a distinct phenotypic feature, particularly prominent in women with BAV."

Pediatric patients with mitral regurgitation (MR) grade ≥ 2 who received MV repair between January 2019 and July 2024 were retrospectively reviewed. MV repair failure was defined as a composite of postoperative functional MV failure, heart transplantation, or death. MV morphology and related parameters were assessed using two- and three-dimensional echocardiography. A total of 309 pediatric patients were included, with a median age of 15.50 (6.00, 52.30) months; 164 (53.1%) were male. During a follow-up of 6.93 (1.37, 14.67) months, 11.97% cases experienced MV repair failure. The underdeveloped chordae tendineae (hazard ratio (HR) = 3.69, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.46 to 9.33; P = 0.006) and elevated mitral valve annulus area index (MVAI) (HR = 1.23, 95% CI = 1.07 to 1.40; P = 0.003) were identified as two independent preoperative echocardiographic predictors. The significantly dilated mitral annulus, measured with MVAI exceeding 8.73 cm2/m2, was established as the clinically significant threshold for predicting MV repair failure. Sensitivity analyses revealed a more pronounced predictive effect of MVAI in the isolated MR group (HR = 1.84, 95% CI = 1.19 to 2.85; P = 0.006).
For pediatric patients with MR grade ≥ 2, echocardiography identified underdeveloped chordae tendineae and significantly dilated mitral annulus may serve as crucial preoperative predictors for risk stratification of MV repair failure.
• In pediatric populations with mitral regurgitation, MV repair is generally preferred, yet it remains one of the most technically demanding and less predictable congenital cardiac surgeries.
• Preoperative underdeveloped chordae tendineae and enlarged annulus (MVAI > 8.73 cm2/m2) are strong predictors of MV repair failure in pediatric patients, particularly those with isolated MR. These findings support performing repair early, before substantial annular remodeling occurs."

We compared Custodiol in minimally invasive mitral valve repair to repetitive cold blood cardioplegia in open mitral valve repair.
We retrospectively evaluated 98 consecutive patients who underwent minimally invasive mitral valve repair with Custodiol and 70 consecutive patients who underwent open mitral valve repair with repetitive cold blood cardioplegia at our institution between January 2015 and December 2024. The primary endpoints were creatine kinase-myocardial band (MB) levels and left ventricular ejection fraction determined by echocardiography pre- and post-surgery.
Maximum creatine kinase-MB levels within 48 h post-surgery were significantly lower in the minimally invasive group than in the open repair group, both in the overall cohort (45.0 vs. 60.7 U/L; p <0.001, respectively) and after excluding patients who underwent Maze procedure or pulmonary vein isolation (42.4 vs. 50.0 U/L; p = 0.009, respectively).

Cardiovascular Imaging,"Percutaneous mitral commissurotomy (PMC) is the reference treatment for rheumatic mitral stenosis (MS). In high-income countries, mitral valve calcification is frequent. Computed tomography (CT) enables Mitral Valve Calcium Scoring (MVCS), but its prognostic value in rheumatic MS has not been prospectively evaluated. The CALCIMIT study assessed the reproducibility and prognostic value of the MVCS by CT on immediate and long-term outcomes after PMC.
In this prospective multicenter study, patients underwent non-contrast cardiac CT before PMC. MVCS was quantified using Agatston's method. The primary endpoint was good immediate result (GIR), defined as final mitral valve area ≥1.5 cm² with ≥50% increase and ≤2/4 mitral regurgitation (MR). The secondary endpoint was long-term event-free survival (death or mitral reintervention). Between 2016 and 2019, 172 consecutive patients (mean age 56±15 years; 78% women) were included. According to CT, 113 patients (66%) had mitral calcification. GIR of PMC was achieved in 54.7% of patients. Independent predictors of GIR included lower CT-based MVCS, lower NYHA class, and lower baseline MR grade. MVCS was also independently associated with long-term survival free of mitral reintervention (HR 1.54, 95% CI 1.07-2.21; p=0.019). A threshold of 385.5 Agatston Units predicted both immediate and late outcomes. Interobserver reproducibility was excellent (calcification detection: Kappa 0.987; MVCS correlation: r=0.999).
CT-derived MVCS provides independent, reproducible prognostic information for immediate and long-term outcomes after PMC, beyond conventional echocardiographic scores. Integrating MVCS into preprocedural assessment may improve patient selection for PMC."

Sacubitril-valsartan (S/V), an angiotensin receptor-neprilysin inhibitor (ARNI), has demonstrated superiority over enalapril in reducing morbidity and mortality in HFrEF. Its mechanism of action includes promoting LV reverse remodeling (LVRR), but the comprehensive effect on both LVRR and secondary MR, particularly using advanced three-dimensional (3D) echocardiography, requires further elucidation.
To evaluate the effect of 1-year S/V therapy on LVRR and the severity of secondary MR in patients with HFrEF, utilizing both two-dimensional (2D) and 3D echocardiographic parameters.
This prospective, single-center study included 80 patients with HFrEF (LVEF ≤ 40%) initiated on S/V. Comprehensive 2D and 3D transthoracic echocardiography was performed at baseline 6 months, and 1 year of treatment. LVRR was assessed by changes in LV volumes (EDVI, ESVI), LVEF, and LV mass index (LVMI). MR severity was quantified using the effective regurgitant orifice area (EROA). Paired statistical tests (t-test or Wilcoxon signed-rank test) were used for pre- and posttreatment comparisons. Correlation and multivariable linear regression analyses were performed to identify predictors of LVRR.
After 1 year of S/V therapy, patients with HFrEF demonstrated marked and consistent improvements in both MR and (LV) structure and function. EROA decreased from 0.36 ± 0.08 cm2 to 0.24 ± 0.09 cm2 (-34.6%, p < 0.001), accompanied by reductions in regurgitant volume (RV) (-32.6%, p < 0.001) and regurgitant fraction (-30.8%, p < 0.001). LVRR was evidenced by significant increases in LVEF (3D: +42.1%, p < 0.001, Cohen's d = 2.63) and reductions in LVEDV (-18.0%, p < 0.001) and LVESV (-31.8%, p < 0.001), as well as a 14.7% decrease in LVMI (p < 0.001). Correlation analysis revealed that MR improvement closely paralleled LV remodeling, with ΔEROA strongly associated with reductions in LVESVI (r = 0.774, p < 0.001), LVEDVI (r = 0.558, p < 0.001), and LVEF improvement (r = -0.781, p < 0.001). Multivariable regression identified lower baseline LVEF (3D) as the strongest independent predictor of LVRR (β = -2.304, p < 0.001) CONCLUSIONS: S/V therapy induces significant and comprehensive LVRR and a marked reduction in secondary MR severity in HFrEF patients. The strong correlation between these two effects suggests that MR improvement is primarily driven by LVRR. Lower baseline LVEF is a powerful predictor of the magnitude of LVRR."

Artificial intelligence (AI) offers a mechanism to broadly deliver expert-level precision and standardize measurements, yet AI for comprehensive automated measurements in pediatric and congenital heart disease (CHD) echo remains underdeveloped.
We created EchoFocus-Measure, an AI platform that automatically extracts 18 quantitative parameters and 10 qualitative assessments from full echo studies. The method extends a multi-task, view-agnostic architecture (PanEcho) with a study-level transformer to prioritize diagnostically informative views. Training (80%) and internal testing (20%) were performed on echos from Boston Children's Hospital (BCH), with external evaluation on outside referral studies. Left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) was the primary endpoint.
The internal cohort included 11.4 million videos from 217,435 echos (60,269 patients; median age 8.5 years; median LVEF 61%), and external validation encompassed 289,613 videos from 3,096 echos (2,506 patients; median age 3.5 years; median LVEF 62%). For LVEF, EchoFocus-Measure exhibited a median absolute error (MAE) of 2.8% internally and 3.8% externally, maintaining accuracy across infants (MAE 3.2%) and complex CHD lesions (e.g., MAE 4.0% for L-loop transposition of the great arteries). EchoFocus-Measure improved upon the PanEcho benchmark (MAE 7.5% for infants; 13.1% for L-loop transposition). Discrepant case (>50 th percentile error) adjudication of LVEF demonstrated that model errors (MAE 2.4%) were within human variability (MAE 3.7%). For qualitative measures, EchoFocus-Measure performed well internally (AUROC 0.88-0.95) and modestly externally (AUROC 0.73-0.86). Explainability analyses highlighted model focus on clinically appropriate echo views for LVEF estimation (apical four-chamber, parasternal short/long) and mitral regurgitation assessment (apical four-chamber color Doppler, parasternal short/long color Doppler).
EchoFocus-Measure delivers rapid and reliable automated echo measurements across ages and lesions within diverse internal and real-world external cohorts, serving as a step toward scalable, global access to high-quality pediatric cardiovascular care."

Case reports,"Conductor externalization is a recognized mechanism of transvenous lead failure. In left-ventricular (LV) coronary-sinus (CS) leads, irreversible electrical failure requiring extraction is uncommon. Conduction system pacing with left bundle branch area pacing (LBBAP) can provide a physiological alternative when CS re-implantation is not feasible.
A 67-year-old man with non-ischaemic cardiomyopathy and reduced LV ejection fraction (EF) secondary to infective endocarditis with severe aortic/mitral regurgitation underwent bioprosthetic aortic valve replacement with mitral repair and cardiac resynchronization therapy-defibrillator implantation in 2021 after drug-associated torsade de pointes and ventricular fibrillation arrest. He underwent transcatheter edge-to-edge mitral repair in June 2024. At routine review in October 2024, he was clinically well and asymptomatic; LV lead testing showed very high impedance (>3000 Ω), threshold 5.75 V at 1.0 ms, and intermittent loss of capture. Chest radiography showed stable lead position. At revision in March 2025, the extracted LV lead displayed conductor externalization, and CS re-implantation was precluded by a small, unwireable anterolateral branch. LBBAP was implanted with low capture threshold and stable sensing; the generator was replaced without complications. At 1-month follow-up, the LV EF was 20-25% (previously 10-15% in 2024); by August 2025 he was New York Heart Association (NYHA) class I and euvolaemic with stable weight.
This case demonstrates persistent electrical failure in LV CS lead with extraction-confirmed conductor externalization, contrasts with prior reports of electrically silent or transient disturbance, and supports LBBAP as a practical physiological option when CS re-implantation is not feasible."

She was referred for mitral valve repair with the intention of valve preservation. Initial transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) suggested that the regurgitation was due to a ruptured chordae resulting in prolapse of the A2 segment. Intraoperative inspection following atriotomy revealed an aberrant chordae tendineae inserting anomalously into the left atrial wall, which was contributing to the A2 prolapse. The aberrant chordae was excised and replaced with polytetrafluoroethylene (Gore-Tex) neochords. A mitral annuloplasty ring was placed to complete the repair. Intraoperative transesophageal echocardiography confirmed excellent valve function with only minimal residual regurgitation. The patient had an uneventful recovery and was discharged on the fourth postoperative day. Aberrantly inserted chordae tendineae are an exceedingly rare finding and may lead to significant valvular dysfunction.

While mild TR often stabilizes after mitral correction, management of moderate and severe TR in this context remains controversial due to limited evidence and applicability of guidelines largely derived from degenerative etiologies. This review synthesizes current data on diagnostic strategies, surgical decision-making, and outcomes in rheumatic TR.
A comprehensive literature search was performed across PubMed, Google Scholar, and OMNI databases (2010-2024) using the keywords ""rheumatic mitral disease,"" ""tricuspid regurgitation,"" and ""management."" Eligible studies included clinical trials, case series, reviews, and meta-analyses focusing on TR associated with rheumatic mitral disease. Data was extracted and critically appraised for study design, population, and outcome relevance.
Evidence for managing TR in rheumatic mitral disease primarily stems from retrospective cohorts and small prospective studies, with few randomized trials. Predictors of TR progression include annular dilation (>21 mm/m²), right ventricular dysfunction, pulmonary hypertension, and atrial fibrillation. Mild TR generally regresses following mitral surgery and is managed conservatively. For moderate TR, concomitant repair may prevent late progression and improve hemodynamics, though risks of postoperative arrhythmia and pacemaker implantation persist. Severe TR warrants surgical correction, preferably rigid ring annuloplasty, while valve replacement is reserved for advanced calcific disease. Emerging transcatheter therapies show promise for high-risk patients but lack robust rheumatic-specific data.
Optimal management of TR in rheumatic mitral disease requires individualized, Heart Team-based decision-making due to limited high-quality evidence. Future research should prioritize multicenter trials comparing repair, replacement, and transcatheter approaches, integrating advanced imaging for risk stratification and addressing access disparities in resource-limited settings."

Initial examination revealed hypotension, tachycardia, and pulsus paradoxus. Imaging demonstrated a large right pleural effusion, a small anterior pericardial effusion, and echocardiographic tamponade. After bedside thoracentesis, echocardiographic findings of tamponade resolved, and the patient's symptoms improved. In this patient, a large pleural effusion caused tamponade physiology rather than a pericardial effusion. Increased intrathoracic pressure can impair cardiac filling and result in tamponade physiology, and thoracentesis can resolve tamponade physiology even without pericardiocentesis. This case highlights the importance of recognizing extracardiac factors that may cause cardiac tamponade and warrant a tailored diagnostic and therapeutic approach."

Demographic, clinical, and echocardiographic features were documented and analysed.
All five chart review cases were female. Four of them had fatal adverse events. Four of them were aged > 18 years. All had clinical evidence of heart failure (HF) and echocardiographically advanced RHD, including severe tricuspid regurgitation (TR) and moderate to severe pulmonary hypertension (PHTN). Case 1 was 24 years old with severe mitral stenosis (MS). Case 2 was 19 years old with severe mitral regurgitation (MR). Case 3 was 14 years old with moderate to severe aortic regurgitation (AR) and moderate to severe MR. Case 4 was 43 years old with severe MS and moderate MR. Case 5 was 16 years old with moderate-severe MS, severe MR and atrial fibrillation. Four had received BPG before the event with no previous adverse reaction. None of our cases met the Level 1 Brighton criteria consistent with anaphylaxis. There were four deaths, three skin rashes, and one anaphylactic shock reported from the six RHD cases from the online survey.
We hypothesise that the coexistence of severe valve lesions with concomitant advanced HF may be an essential risk factor in BPG injection-related deaths rather than the presence of severe valve lesions alone. Heart failure and a failure of the compensatory mechanisms in BPG injection-related adverse circulatory reactions in advanced RHD with HF could be one of the major causes of these deaths. According to the literature, we recommend that patients with advanced RHD receive special attention regarding secondary BPG prophylaxis. For the introduction of less painful BPG injection, like the subcutaneous technique, further research is needed."
PubMed,mitral regurgitation,Mechanisms of mitral valve development and disease.,Enshi Wang; Bin Zhou,10.3389/fcvm.2026.1773671,2026,Frontiers in cardiovascular medicine,"The mitral valve apparatus comprises the annulus, valve leaflets, chordae tendineae, and papillary muscles, forming an integrated biomechanical unit essential for unidirectional blood flow. The leaflets and chordae are primarily derived from endocardial cells, and damage to these structures results in either mitral stenosis or mitral regurgitation, depending on the underlying pathology. This review compares three major mitral valve diseases, rheumatic mitral stenosis, congenital mitral stenosis, and myxomatous mitral valve prolapse, to highlight their distinct etiologies, molecular mechanisms, and structural endpoints. Rheumatic mitral stenosis is an acquired immune-mediated disease triggered by Group A streptococcal infection, in which molecular mimicry leads to autoantibody formation and chronic inflammation. Immune-cell infiltration and cytokine release drive the progression of leaflet fibrosis, commissural fusion, calcification, and pronounced chordal shortening, ultimately culminating in fixed obstruction. Large-scale genetic studies have not identified strong causal genes, instead revealing associations with immune-related risk loci, while valve-specific epigenetic mechanisms are poorly explored. Congenital mitral stenosis arises from developmental abnormalities of the mitral valve complex during embryogenesis and is classified into four anatomical subtypes. Due to its low incidence, the condition remains the least studied at the molecular and genetic levels. In contrast, myxomatous mitral valve prolapse is a degenerative, polygenic disorder driven by aberrant TGFβ-dependent endothelial-to-mesenchymal transformation, valve interstitial cell activation, and extracellular matrix remodeling. Genetic studies have identified multiple causal genes, including FLNA, DCHS1, DZIP1, and TNS1, underscoring its mechano-genetic origin. Despite their distinct causes, immune-mediated, developmental, and degenerative/genetic, all three diseases converge on progressive structural failure of the MV apparatus. Notably, pathological remodeling of the chordae plays a decisive role in disease progression and the need for surgical intervention. A deeper understanding of both shared and disease-specific mechanisms, particularly valve- and chordae-specific molecular regulation, is essential to advance translational research in mitral valve disease."

Atrial fibrillation (AF) has been identified as a cause of functional MR and TR, but the arrhythmia may also occur as a consequence of the valvular dysfunction. Data on the success of restoring sinus rhythm (SR) and subsequent MR/TR improvement remain limited. This study reports findings from the prospective Berlin-FMTR registry, which included patients with AF and newly diagnosed moderate or worse functional MR or TR undergoing cardioversion or ablation.
Eighty patients (46% male, median age 73.7 years) with persistent AF and at least moderate MR or TR underwent rhythm control via cardioversion or catheter ablation. Follow-up assessments were conducted at 3 and 12 months. After a mean of 11.6 ± 9 months, 45 patients (56%) remained in SR. At 12 months, 56% of patients with baseline moderate or worse MR improved to mild MR. Among those in SR, this rose to 77% versus 38% with AF recurrence. Only patients in SR showed significant improvements in LVEF, left atrial size, and heart failure symptoms. Similarly, 54% of patients with at least moderate TR at baseline improved to mild TR at 12 months. Among those maintaining SR, 70% showed TR improvement, compared to 35% with recurrent AF. Right ventricular function (TAPSE, RV diameter/volume) improved only in those in SR.
Restoring and maintaining SR led to significant reductions in MR and TR severity and cardiac remodeling. These findings support rhythm control as a key therapeutic strategy in patients with AF and functional MR/TR."

Inadequate healthcare systems, combined with costly treatments, impose a high economic burden, with growing challenges in the public healthcare arena. The demand for equitable access to specialised services is high in a country where most of the population relies on public healthcare services.
This study investigated the shortcomings and possible solutions to expedite referral for appropriate diagnosis and therapy.
In a sub-analysis performed on 2 523 first-time echocardiography referrals to a tertiary-care hospital, cardiac abnormalities were diagnosed in 74% of patients. Most significant were valvular disorders (33%) and secondary pulmonary hypertension (19%). More than a third of patients presented with severe valvular disease, indicative of progressive heart disease and late referral. Almost a half (44%) of patients with cardiomyopathy presented with severely impaired left ventricular systolic function at first referral (left ventricular ejection fraction <30%), suggesting missed diagnosis and/or late referral.
The study demonstrated a high demand for echocardiographic services from secondary regional and district hospitals in central South Africa. Late referrals can be attributed to long travelling distances and the number of regional hospitals. The availability of echocardiographic screening could fill the void in the current healthcare system to expedite diagnosis and effective referral."

In thoracic aortopathy, aortic medial elastin fiber fragmentation initially leads to microcalcification but later declines with progressive loss of elastin content and reduced structural integrity.
To determine whether aortic microcalcification detected using fluorine F 18-labeled [18F]-sodium fluoride positron emission tomography (PET) is associated with future aortic diameter expansion.
This prospective longitudinal cohort study was conducted in tertiary care centers across Scotland from April 4, 2019, to September 15, 2023. Participants included patients with a bicuspid aortic valve. Data analysis was performed from May 21, 2024, to March 4, 2025.
Hybrid [18F]-sodium fluoride PET and computed tomography.
Baseline ascending aortic [18F]-sodium fluoride uptake was measured as mean tissue to background ratio. The primary outcome was ascending aortic diameter expansion during 24 months on cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).
Seventy-six patients with a bicuspid aortic valve (mean [SD] age, 52.6 [7.5] years; 57 [75.0%] male) underwent baseline [18F]-sodium fluoride PET and MRI. Fifty-six patients underwent follow-up MRI after a median of 723 (IQR, 515-787) days. There was an inverse correlation between baseline ascending aortic [18F]-sodium fluoride uptake and annual change in diameter (Pearson r = -0.37; P = .005), which remained after adjustment for confounders in multivariable regression analysis. Ascending aortic [18F]-sodium fluoride was not correlated with baseline diameter (Pearson r = 0.08; P = .50) but was moderately correlated with baseline ascending aortic stiffness index (Pearson r = 0.38; P < .001).
In this cohort study of patients with a bicuspid aortic valve, the most rapid aortic growth was seen in those with low [18F]-sodium fluoride ascending aortic uptake, indicating reduced aortic wall integrity. High ascending aortic [18F]-sodium fluoride uptake was associated with a stiffer and slow-growing ascending aortic phenotype. These findings suggest that [18F]-sodium fluoride PET imaging represents a promising new noninvasive approach to identify a microcalcified disease phenotype in thoracic aortopathy among patients with a bicuspid aortic valve."

Case reports,"Congenitally corrected transposition of the great arteries (CCTGA) is a rare congenital heart disease characterized by atrioventricular (AV) and ventriculoarterial discordance, allowing near-normal circulation without early surgical correction. However, long-term complications such as valvular dysfunction, systemic right ventricular (RV) failure, and pulmonary hypertension are common. Management becomes particularly challenging in patients with prior interventions, where anatomical complexity and elevated surgical risk limit therapeutic options.
We present the case of a 47-year-old Chinese female diagnosed with CCTGA who had previously undergone surgical implantation of a bioprosthetic valve in the systemic AV position in her home country. She presented with significant deterioration in functional capacity, and imaging revealed severe dysfunction of the surgical prosthesis, characterized by severe mixed valvular disease, aneurysmal dilation of the left atrium, and severe systemic RV dysfunction. A multidisciplinary team assessment determined that the patient was at high surgical risk, leading to the decision to perform a percutaneous valve-in-valve implantation. An Edwards SAPIEN® 26 mm bioprosthetic valve was successfully implanted, yielding excellent haemodynamic results without complications. The patient was discharged 24 h post-procedure with significant clinical improvement.
Although percutaneous interventions for systemic tricuspid valve disease have been described, they typically involve native valves and remain anecdotal. To date, no published reports have documented valve-in-valve implantation in a systemic AV prosthesis in a patient with CCTGA. This case illustrates the feasibility and safety of such an approach in a high-risk patient, offering a valuable alternative to surgical replacement and potentially delaying the need for heart transplantation."

We aimed to study the differentiative and predictive value of 90 inflammatory and immunomodulatory related proteins in idiopathic and hereditary PAH (IPAH/HPAH) and systemic sclerosis-associated PAH (SSc-APAH). Cohort 1 comprised patients with SSc-APAH (n = 36), IPAH/HPAH (n = 54) and healthy controls (n = 55). Cohort 2 comprised SSc patients without PAH (n = 15) and SSc-APAH (n = 15), with blood samples both ~6 years before, and at PAH diagnosis. This cohort was used for internal validation and to predict future development of PAH in SSc. Cohort 3 comprised connective tissue disease (CTD) APAH (n = 19) and IPAH (n = 20), and was used for external validation. Plasma protein levels were measured with proximity extension assay. In cohort 1, we found that higher IL-27 differentiated PAH patients from controls (odds ratio (OR) = 1.24; area under the curve (AUC) = 0.94), whereas higher TNFRSF4 differentiated SSc-APAH from IPAH/HPAH (OR = 1.14; AUC = 0.82), and controls (OR = 1.30; AUC = 0.99). In cohort 2, GDF-15 and PSP-D were higher in female SSc patients that would develop vs those that wouldn't develop PAH, and predicted PAH-development ~6 years before diagnosis (OR = 1.24; AUC = 0.78 and 1.22; 0.73, respectively). Using equivalence testing, levels of IL-27, GDF-15 and PSP-D were equivalent (p = 0.0072, p = 0.0048 and p = 0.00076) in cohort 3 and 1. In conclusion, GDF-15 and PSP-D emerged as promising potential biomarkers in early screening and prediction of future PAH development in SSc, whereas IL-27 and TNFRSF4 appeared promising in diagnosis and subtype differentiation of PAH and SSc-APAH."

The phenotypic classification of patients with HFpEF to guide etiology-specific therapeutic strategies represents a rational approach to address the current dilemma. However, the clinical outcomes of HFpEF under different etiological classifications remain poorly understood. Here, we assessed the clinical outcomes of HFpEF patients across different etiological phenotypes, based on a novel classification system comprising five categories: vascular-related, cardiomyopathy-related, right heart/pulmonary-related, valvular/rhythm-related, and extracardiac disease-related HFpEF. Data from the Chinese Cardiovascular Association Database-Heart Failure Center Registry (2017-2021) were analyzed, including 51,466 hospitalized HFpEF patients with 1-year follow-up. Significant differences in baseline characteristics and clinical outcomes were observed among phenotypes. Patients with right heart/pulmonary-related, valvular/rhythm-related, and extracardiac disease-related HFpEF showed a higher incidence of adverse outcomes. Specifically, the right heart/pulmonary-related and valvular/rhythm-related phenotypes were associated with increased heart failure rehospitalization, while extracardiac disease-related HFpEF was linked to higher cardiovascular mortality. Prognostic risk factors also varied across phenotypes. In conclusion, 1-year outcomes exhibit significant variations across HFpEF phenotypic subgroups. Future studies should explore whether phenotype-specific personalized treatment strategies can improve clinical outcomes, especially in high-risk phenotypes."

No pharmacological therapies currently exist to halt or reverse progression, reflecting the complex and poorly understood pathophysiology. A hallmark of CAVD is extracellular matrix (ECM) remodeling and accumulation of proteoglycans such as chondroitin sulfate (CS). CAVD is also recognized as an inflammatory disease, with emerging evidence implicating neutrophils and their extracellular traps (NETs) as active contributors to disease progression. However, the impact of CS enrichment on neutrophil behavior remains unclear. Here, we developed a disease-inspired 3D ECM hydrogel model to investigate how ECM composition regulates neutrophil function and NET formation. Human neutrophils were encapsulated in type I collagen hydrogels enriched with CS, mimicking healthy and diseased valve tissue. CS enrichment impaired neutrophil effector functions, including actin cytoskeleton remodeling and NETosis. Neutrophils in CS-rich matrices showed disrupted actin dynamics, reduced chromatin decondensation, and diminished histone H3 citrullination, resulting in suppressed NET release in response to NADPH oxidase-dependent and calcium-mediated stimuli. These findings identify CS enrichment as a regulator of neutrophil function through disruption of actin cytoskeleton remodeling. Beyond CAVD, this study highlights the importance of ECM composition in modulating immune responses."

Its ability to provide real-time, detailed images of cardiac anatomy and function is essential for guiding both surgical and percutaneous cardiac interventions, the majority of which require the use of general anesthesia. The profound cardiac physiological changes that accompany general anesthesia can affect echocardiographic parameters and thereby potentially hamper accurate assessment. Next to anesthesia, mechanical ventilation also introduces hemodynamic changes in atrial, ventricular, and valvular function that further complicate echocardiographic interpretation. Of particular concern are changes in valvular regurgitant flow patterns and transvalvular gradients, which are critical for correct clinical diagnosis and treatment. Understanding the nuanced effects of anesthesia and mechanical ventilation on echocardiographic parameters is paramount for clinicians involved in cardiac care, including cardiologists, echocardiographers, anesthesiologists, intensivists and cardiac surgeons. Appropriate echocardiographic assessment under these conditions not only ensures accurate diagnosis, but also informs therapeutic strategies and guides intraoperative decision making and procedural planning.

Here, to address this limitation, we developed a linear-nonlinear subspace model that identifies the most informative sensory dimensions captured by a CNN. A CNN was trained on single-neuron data recorded from auditory cortex of ferrets during presentation of a large natural sound set. Each neuron's linear tuning subspace was computed by applying dimensionality reduction to the gradient of CNN output relative to input. Subspace projections were combined nonlinearly to predict neural activity. The resulting model was functionally equivalent to the CNN. Analysis of trained models showed that responses of local neural populations sparsely tiled a shared stimulus subspace. Encoding properties also differed between cell types and layers, reflecting their position in the cortical circuit. More generally, these results establish a framework for interpreting deep-learning-based encoding models."

However, race information in electronic health records is often missing/inconsistently documented, limiting the ability to construct representative cohorts or assess algorithmic bias. This study evaluates model performance and fairness in predicting race from clinical text.
We compared four transformer-based deep learning models with a hierarchical convolutional neural network designed to capture the multilevel structure of clinical narratives. A two-phase active learning framework guided annotation of a primary care database. A fairness-aware loss function was applied to mitigate disparities across racial groups. Each model was trained with and without fairness-aware optimization. Performance and equity were evaluated using 10-fold cross-validation and subgroup audits across race, sex, age, and their intersections.
Here we show that the hierarchical convolutional neural network achieves higher accuracy and performance equity than transformer models (macro F1 = 98.4%). Fairness constraints enhance parity across most transformer architectures, but degrade hierarchical model performance and cause one clinical model to collapse toward majority predictions, demonstrating that fairness interventions are highly model dependent. Persistent disparities across race, sex, and age indicate that inequities reflect architectural limitations and systemic biases.
This study demonstrates that fairness can be integrated into clinical language models, though effects vary by model type. Architectures aligned with clinical text structure inherently promote fairness, yet mixed fairness constraint outcomes highlight the need for tailored interventions. Persistent demographic disparities show that algorithmic bias often reflects upstream documentation inequities.

PubMed,deep learning,Infrared ship target detection algorithm PEW_YOLOv8 in complex environments.,Tingkai Dong; Menglin Zhu; Gaofeng Tang,10.1038/s41598-026-40574-8,2026-02-23,Scientific reports,"In the infrared ship detection task under complex environments, issues such as high rates of missed and false detections occur due to noise, occlusion, and the indistinct features of small targets. To address these problems, this paper proposes a ship target detection algorithm, PEW_YOLOv8, based on YOLOv8. Firstly, the FFA-Net algorithm is used for image pre-processing to improve the contrast and clarity of the images. Secondly, the PGIG-Backbone network is designed. Through multi-path fusion technology, it ensures that features at different scales can complement each other, enhancing the detail expression ability of small targets. Subsequently, the enhanced multi-scale attention neck network, EMA-Neck, is designed. By means of the attention mechanism, it suppresses background noise, enhances feature information related to the target, and improves the distinguishability between the target and the background. Finally, the WIoU Loss is introduced. Through a more comprehensive method of evaluating bounding boxes, the model can better handle inter-target overlaps, occlusions, and other interferences in complex scenes. Under the same experimental conditions, compared with YOLOv8, the PEW_YOLOv8 algorithm achieves a detection accuracy of 92.2% on the Raytron Technology infrared ship dataset, increasing mAP50 and mAP50:95 by 3.9% and 3.1% respectively."

PubMed,deep learning,The rise of artificial intelligence in respiratory primary care and pulmonology: a scoping review.,Joan B Soriano; Sara Lumbreras,10.1038/s41533-026-00487-5,2026-02-24,NPJ primary care respiratory medicine,"Artificial intelligence (AI) is rapidly advancing respiratory disease management, from diagnosis to population lung health. This scoping review synthesizes the most promising uses of AI in respiratory medicine, with a particular focus on pulmonologists and family physicians interested in lung health. In diagnostics, deep-learning systems streamline chest-imaging workflows by triaging radiographs, detecting COVID-19 pneumonia, and classifying lung nodules on CT. In pulmonary function testing, algorithms detect technical errors and classify spirometric patterns, some claiming to outperforming pulmonologists. Acoustic analysis of cough, breathing, and speech captured on smartphones or wearables offers non-invasive decision support. For monitoring and prediction, AI helps shorten weaning from mechanical ventilation and guides closed-loop strategies for acute respiratory distress. In chronic care, connected devices integrated with environmental data help to forecast asthma and COPD exacerbations, while telehealth and predictive models enable earlier, more personalized interventions. Additional gains are emerging in paediatrics, sleep medicine, lung ultrasounds, and public health. Realizing these benefits will require rigorous multicentre validation and real-world evidence. It will also require proactive bias detection and mitigation with inclusive sampling and equity audits. High-quality, interoperable data and explainable models are needed to enable human oversight. Practical issues such as digital literacy, device access, and usability for children, older adults, and other vulnerable populations also matter for applications requiring patient interaction. With sustained collaboration among clinicians, engineers, AI experts, industry, regulators, and scientific societies, AI can increase the time invested in a satisfactory clinician-patient relationship. With all likelihood, AI can also measurably improve efficiency and accuracy across multiple domains of respiratory care."

However, current datasets often suffer from data sparsity and a bias toward right-handed signs. To support this effort, we present Sign4all, a dataset for Spanish Sign Language (LSE), specifically designed for Isolated Sign Language Recognition (ISLR). The dataset is composed of 7,756 high-resolution RGB video recordings and their corresponding skeletal keypoints, covering 24 signs related to daily activities, more specifically a vocabulary centered in the catering field. Unlike sparse lexicons, Sign4all adopts a high-density approach, providing an average of 323 samples per sign to facilitate data-intensive deep learning models. Moreover, the dataset provides a handedness balance, with equal representation of left- and right-handed signs for every sign to support handedness invariance. Each sample was manually segmented, temporally normalized and preprocessed through spatial normalization to guarantee consistency and compatibility with different deep learning pipelines. Technical validation using Transformer and skeletal models demonstrates the dataset's integrity and the need of providing pre-computed augmentation splits. All data is formatted in widely supported file types (AVI for video, HDF5 for keypoints), enabling direct use in machine learning frameworks such as TensorFlow or PyTorch."

In this study, we show that the synthesizability of MPEAs across broad compositional and structural spaces can be predicted using a physical model that expresses the total energy of any MPEA as a linear combination of energies from lower-dimensional subsystems. The model is validated with a large computational dataset and supported by the experimental synthesis of multiple MPEAs, achieving mean absolute errors near or below 7 meV/atom on a density functional theory dataset of 135,791 MPEAs spanning 28 metals and up to ten components. Its accuracy is comparable to state-of-the-art deep learning models while maintaining interpretability through cluster-expansion theory. Moreover, we show that the stability of high-entropy alloys can be predicted using a linear combination of energies from lower-dimensional systems with low errors, indicating a flatter energy landscape at high compositional complexity."

Here, using the same healthy multi-national cohort, we applied deep learning methods to 4205 fetal brain scans from 18-27 weeks' gestation, to produce an extensive, quantitative description of the growth of 16 fetal brain structures associated with satisfactory domain-specific neurodevelopmental scores at 2 years of age. The methodology, which is publicly available, takes less than 10 seconds per scan. We define 28 region-specific, functionally relevant, normative growth trajectories, a ratio between the relative volumes of the insular (rILV) and parietal (rPLV) lobes reflecting asynchronous maturation of fetal brain regions, and introduce a fetal brain maturation index that quantifies biological age and deviations from chronological age. Finally, the very low percentage of variance explained by between site differences (0.6% to 5.8% of the total variance) reinforces a fundamental biological principle: fetal growth and development across populations with diverse ancestries is similar provided that environmental constraints on growth are minimal."

The development of isoform-selective inhibitors, however, confronts substantial challenges because of the pronounced structural conservation across HDAC isoforms. This study developed a high-efficiency drug screening pipeline primarily leveraging artificial learning (AI) models and molecular simulation techniques, and further evaluated the biological activity of computationally prioritized compounds through enzymatic inhibition assays and cellular experiments. The structurally novel compound Cmpd.16 was successfully identified, exhibiting promising inhibitory activity against HDAC8 (IC50 = 0.16 ± 0.01 μM) and moderately inhibited HCT116 cell proliferation mainly through the induction of apoptosis and G2/M phase cell cycle arrest. Subsequently, molecular dynamics simulations were employed to investigate the binding conformation of Cmpd.16 within the active pocket, and the key residues identified through free energy decomposition further elucidated the drug-target binding mode. Collectively, Cmpd.16, featuring 1H-pyrazolo[3,4-b]pyridine scaffold, was discovered via an efficient screening workflow, offering valuable insights to guide the rational design of HDAC8-targeted agents."

Plaques were classified as stable or vulnerable using standardized ultrasound criteria. The dataset was stratified and divided into training, validation, and test sets at a 6:2:2 ratio, with strict patient-level separation to prevent data leakage. Four You Only Look Once models (versions 7, 8, 9, and 10) were trained under identical conditions. Performance was evaluated using mean average precision at various intersection-over-union thresholds as well as precision, recall, and F1 score.ResultsYou Only Look Once version 9 showed the best overall performance, achieving the highest mean average precision at intersection-over-union thresholds of 0.5 and 0.95 in the validation set. Similar results were observed in the test set, with superior detection accuracy for both stable and vulnerable plaques. You Only Look Once version 9 also achieved the highest precision, recall, and F1 score.ConclusionThe You Only Look Once version 9-based framework enables accurate and efficient carotid plaque detection and classification, supporting real-time assessment of plaque vulnerability and the prevention of ischemic stroke."
PubMed,deep learning,Rapid response teams for new leaders: a narrative review of global evidence and implementation strategies with a focus on Japan.,Akiko Ogawa; Yoko Tsuchiya; Ikue Sakemi; Nobuo Kutsuna,10.1136/bmjoq-2025-003949,2026-02-23,BMJ open quality,"Rapid response systems (RRSs) are designed to detect and treat physiological deterioration before cardiac arrest occurs. Since 2020, Japan has seen a rapid increase in RRS adoption; however, most new team members have not received formal training in critical care. This review synthesises international and Japanese evidence supporting implementation and training for new members.
PubMed, Web of Science and Ichushi Web were searched for English or Japanese studies evaluating adult RRSs (January 2010-April 2025). We included 47 records (43 comparative and 4 systematic reviews); the national guideline was not included.
Mature RRSs were associated with a 35% relative reduction in unexpected in-hospital cardiac arrests and a 12% decrease in all-cause hospital mortality. However, the evidence is not uniformly positive-systematic reviews and multicentre analyses reported no significant mortality benefit-and outcome heterogeneity limits comparability. Effective programmes share three key features: (1) single-parameter activation criteria augmented by early-warning scores; (2) tiered response models for advanced practice nurses and (3) audit-feedback cycles with dashboards. Crew resource management, in situ simulation and mindfulness-based self-leadership approaches may be associated with reduced decision latency. Emerging tools like deep-learning prediction algorithms, continuous wearable monitoring and tele-support systems may expand coverage but require governance. Common barriers include limited night-time staffing, cultural reluctance to escalate care and medicolegal ambiguity; targeted education and registry-driven feedback mitigate challenges.
Well-structured RRSs improve outcomes beyond traditional code-blue models. Aligning activation thresholds, multidisciplinary competencies and data-driven quality improvement cycles with local resources may help new Japanese rapid response team members develop resilient, high-performing services."

This retrospective, self-controlled study included patients with PACD who underwent IOP-lowering surgery at Beijing Tongren Hospital. Retinal vascular parameters were quantitatively measured from fundus photographs before and after surgery using a validated deep learning-based analysis system. Main outcomes included retinal arteriolar and venular calibre, tortuosity, fractal dimension (FD), segment number (N_seg) and vascular density. Linear mixed-effects models, adjusted for age, follow-up interval and PACD subtype, assessed associations between IOP reduction magnitude and vascular parameter changes.
Among 126 eyes (112 patients), surgery decreased IOP from 35.0±9.9 to 16.7±5.7 mm Hg (p<0.001). Venous FD increased from 1.52±0.06 to 1.53±0.05 (p=0.003), N_seg from 123.50 (IQR: 61.75-182.50) to 153.00 (88.50-185.00) (p=0.007), vessel area density (VAD) from 6.13±1.56 to 6.50±1.34 (p=0.006) and vessel skeleton density (VSD) from 1.24±0.35 to 1.35±0.31 (p=0.003). Vessel calibre and tortuosity showed no significant changes. IOP reduction magnitude was independently associated with changes in venous FD (p=0.023), N_seg (p=0.031), VAD (p=0.012) and VSD (p=0.030).
Surgical IOP reduction in PACD patients produces selective retinal venous alterations with increased complexity and density. These pressure-responsive changes may provide complementary, non-invasive information regarding vascular response after surgery."

Besides cardiac-induced flow pulsation, respiration is known to modulate arterial and venous blood flow in the brain. Quantification of the respiratory flow modulation (RFM) holds potential to further our insights into vascular coupling and improve our understanding of cerebral circulation in general.
A 5D phase-contrast flow MRI framework was developed to volumetrically quantify RFM by resolving velocity vector fields over the cardiac and respiratory cycle, with high spatial (0.82∼mm isotropic) and cardiac (55∼ms) resolutions, using two respiratory states whilst accounting for variable physiological RFM delays, with a reasonable acquisition time (20∼min at 60∼bpm). Recent advances in deep learning-based image reconstruction and analysis methods are incorporated to facilitate the approach.
The 5D flow MRI framework was validated in 10 healthy volunteers with reference to fully sampled respiratory-resolved 2D flow MRI orthogonal to the internal carotid artery (ICA), yielding Pearson correlation coefficients of 0.97 and 0.90 and biases of and 0.09% and 1.77% for RFM of mean velocity magnitude and amplitude, respectively. The value of cerebrovascular 5D flow MRI is demonstrated using full-field spatially resolved RFM quantification of mean velocity and velocity amplitude, revealing a high physiological intra-subject variability.
Cerebrovascular 5D flow MRI enables the study of full-field respiratory flow modulation holding potential of furthering our understanding of cerebral circulation."

Endovascular stents typically consist of a metal framework and a flexible membrane graft designed to reopen obstructed aortic segments and maintain blood flow through the true lumen. Consequently, stents are widely used to treat aortic expansion diseases and aortic occlusive stenosis. However, traditional stents have limitations in terms of adaptability to complex anatomical structures, long-term durability, biomechanical stability, and reliance on radial support force for fixation, lacking active fixation mechanisms. These shortcomings remain the primary causes of postoperative complications, significantly impacting the quality of life for patients with aortic dissection.                                                           Methods:                     The research status of the endovascular stent was discussed in depth, and the main factors for the optimal design of the stent (geometry, pattern configuration, additional fixtures, and optimization methods) were analyzed and summarized according to the complications targeted by the repair device.                                                           Results:                     The composition structure, working principle, and development status of the stent grafts under review are elaborated in detail. Stent grafts attempt to alleviate postoperative complications through three approaches: enhancing the flexibility of the stent framework, improving the fit between the vessel wall and the stent, and reducing vascular injury. Blood flow guiding channels are established to alleviate the obstruction of branch blood flow. Additional self-anchoring devices are added to adapt to the dynamic remodeling of blood vessels.                                                           Discussion:                     The effects of various factors, including geometric parameters, structural design, and parameter optimization techniques, on the optimization of stent primary mechanical performance are discussed. The current research status of functional improvement methods for stents is also summarized.                                                           Conclusion:                     Refining the quantitative relationship between stent structural parameters and mechanical performance, as well as exploring the balance criteria between flexibility and radial support force, represent promising directions for future development. These objectives necessitate further in-depth analysis and research."

With a focus on the prevalent psychological complications following the onset of this condition, this study aimed to explore the correlation between antenatal depression and Corona disease anxiety, personality traits, and postpartum depression during the COVID-19 pandemic.                                                           Materials and Methods:                     This cross-sectional descriptive-analytical study investigated women receiving care at health centers affiliated with Kerman University of Medical Sciences during the last month of their pregnancy and the postpartum period in 2022. Following the acquisition of informed consent, participants were assessed using various measures, including demographic and obstetric information, the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale, the Corona Disease Anxiety Scale (CDAS), and the NEO Personality Inventory-Revised during their third trimester of pregnancy. The same group of participants completed the Edinburgh Depression Scale and the Corona Disease Anxiety Scale (CDAS) 4-6 weeks after childbirth.                                                           Results and Discussion:                     There was a significant correlation between family income, unwanted pregnancy as perceived by both the mother and father, and antenatal depression. Additionally, marital satisfaction played a significant role in postpartum depression. Furthermore, antenatal depression was significantly associated with neuroticism, agreeableness, and physical symptoms related to Corona disease anxiety. Personality traits, with the exception of extroversion and conscientiousness, and various domains of Corona disease anxiety, excluding psychological symptoms, were also significantly associated with postpartum depression.                                                           Conclusion:                     During pandemics or epidemics, such as the COVID-19 outbreak, experiencing mental distress during pregnancy can contribute to mental health issues during the postpartum period. This risk is particularly true in individuals with unique personality traits, emphasizing the need for increased focus on mental health within prenatal care during these crises."

Method:                     This cross-sectional study was conducted in Kerman, Iran. Data were collected from patients who visited Afzalipour Hospital in Kerman more than twice during the COVID-19 epidemic from the end of February 2020 to March 21, 2021. We conducted two key analyses: 1. Mixed effect logistic regression was used to check the relationship between the variables and COVID-19 severity. 2. Mixed effect linear regression was used to check the relationship between the variables and the length of stay in the hospital.                                                           Results:                     The findings indicated that the most important risk factors for the severity of COVID-19 were heart diseases (OR=1.67,95%CI:1.20-2.30), increasing age (OR=2.23 for age&gt;54, 95%CI:1.70- 2.90), male gender (OR=1.47,95%CI:1.10-1.96), respiratory diseases other than asthma, and frequency of admission (OR=1.60,95%CI:1.20-2.15). All patients who underwent readmission experienced a shorter duration of hospitalization during their subsequent admission (OR=0.94,95%CI:0.91,0.96) and had a higher mortality rate (30% within 14 days, 26.6% between 14-90 days). Patients readmitted at intervals of 14-90 days and greater than 90 days exhibited lower disease severity compared to those readmitted within the 0-14 day period.                                                           Conclusion:                     Examining readmissions, the severity of COVID-19, and the length of hospital stay in affected patients are important factors for planning and allocating resources for COVID-19 management and treatment. These factors can help policymakers develop effective clinical guidelines for hospitalization or outpatient treatment of COVID-19 patients and contribute to reducing the burden of disease in the community."

Kinovea, as an accessible motion-analysis software, provides both visual and quantitative feedback. However, its application in supporting technique development among beginner athletes remains insufficiently explored. Aim: This study aims to describe the use of Kinovea in biomechanics training and examine its contribution to the awareness of kinematic characteristics and movement techniques among beginner athletes. Methods: A descriptive qualitative design involved 72 beginner athletes aged 18–25 years selected through purposive sampling. Data were collected over 16 weeks through interviews, field observations, and motion video recordings analyzed using Kinovea. Kinematic data focused on joint angles, stride behavior, and movement phases during walking, running, and the flight phase. Qualitative data were analyzed using content analysis with NVivo 12, while kinematic results were interpreted descriptively to identify performance patterns and areas for technical refinement. Result: Kinematic analysis showed coordinated joint-angle patterns across all phases. Walking analysis identified arm swing angles of 50.9°–58.8° and leg separation angles of 64.3°–67.2°, indicating a stable gait rhythm. The running analysis revealed knee angles of 68.8°–69.8° and elbow angles of 87.6°–89.1°, indicating efficient propulsive mechanics. The flight phase demonstrated knee angles of 81.2°–87.8° and elbow angles of 80.4°–88.3°, suggesting effective momentum use and postural stability. These measurements supported stride-efficiency assessment and technique evaluation. Qualitative findings revealed that Kinovea enabled athletes to interpret movement phases and identify technical inefficiencies through slow-motion and frame-by-frame visualization. Conclusion: Kinovea supports basic motion analysis by providing clear kinematic information and helping beginner athletes observe and refine their movement techniques. The findings also offer practical value for coaches by enabling more precise identification of inefficient patterns and guiding targeted corrections during early-stage training."

To achieve this aim the following research questions were postulated: <br/><br/>- What do the natural course and treatment pathways of severe aortic stenosis in children look like? Can watchful waiting be an alternative to immediate intervention (Chapter 2)? <br/>- What characterizes long-term outcome after surgical repair of valvar aortic stenosis, supravalvular aortic stenosis or aortic valve regurgitation in children (Chapters 3 and 5)? <br/>- What characterizes long-term clinical outcome after surgical aortic valve replacement with currently available valve substitutes for aortic valve disease in children (Chapter 4)? <br/>- What characterizes long-term outcome after reconstructive surgical treatment options for aortic valve disease in nonelderly adults, such as aortic valve repair and the Ross procedure (Chapters 6, 7 and 8)? <br/>- How can microsimulation be optimally implemented to better support the lifetime management of patients diagnosed with heart valve disease (Chapter 9)?<br/>"

Witkowski; Wojciech Bombała; Michał Kosowski; Piotr Kübler; Krzysztof Aleksandrowicz; Ewa Anita Jankowska; Marcin Protasiewicz,,2026-02-22,MDPI (MDPI AG),"Background: Left Ventricle Myocardial Work (LVMW) has shown utility in assessing patients with aortic stenosis (AS) in recent studies. In the present study, we evaluated the predictive value and optimal cut-off values of LVMW parameters measured prior to TAVI that may be associated with increased mortality in AS patients. Methods: A total of 116 consecutive patients who were qualified for TAVI between March 2021 and November 2022 were evaluated. Pre-procedural LVMW indices (GWI, GCW, GWW, and GWE) were assessed and long-term survival was analysed. Survival and influencing factors were evaluated using univariate and multivariate Cox proportional hazard models, with significant factors subsequently included in cut-off analysis. Results: The median survival time following the TAVI procedure was 1404 (1143&ndash;1549) days, with a maximum observation period of 1721 days. All-cause mortality during the follow-up period reached 29%. Multivariate analysis revealed that EF, GLS, GWI, GWE and GCW before TAVI were independent predictors of all-cause mortality. We identified 1975 mmHg, 1497 mmHg and 85% as optimal cut-off values for GCW, GWI and GWE, which allow for significant stratification of patients according to risk. Conclusions: In this analysis, baseline-assessed parameters such as GLS, GWI, GWE, and GCW emerged as independent predictors of all-cause mortality. The proposed cut-off values clearly separated patient groups with different survival outcomes."
OpenAlex,aortic stenosis,Severe Aortic Stenosis Concealed by a Negative History in Pregnancy: A Case Report Emphasizing the Diagnostic Cornerstones of History and Physical Examination,Milad Masaeli; Shamin Ghobadi; Mohammad Kazem Rezaei Hoseinabadi,10.18502/crcp.v10i4.21108,2026-02-21,Case Reports in Clinical Practice,"Pregnancy concurrent with severe underlying cardiac disease presents a substantial risk to maternal and fetal well-being. Despite routine antenatal screening, patients may occasionally deny or be unaware of critical cardiac histories, complicating perioperative management and leading to catastrophic decompensation. We report the case of a 22-year-old primigravida admitted for labor with intrauterine fetal demise (IUFD). The initial history was non-contributory, and the physical examination was unremarkable. Following an uncomplicated delivery and regional analgesia, the patient experienced sudden hemodynamic collapse, seizure, and pulmonary edema, necessitating emergent intubation and intensive care. Subsequent echocardiography revealed previously undiagnosed severe aortic stenosis (AS) with a mean pressure gradient of approximately 100 mmHg. This case highlights how severe, compensated pathology can be masked by patient denial, underscoring the indispensable role of a meticulous history and physical examination as the primary diagnostic tool in obstetric anesthesia, regardless of self-reported symptoms"
OpenAlex,aortic stenosis,Reclassifying Aortic Stenosis Severity: Combined Energy Loss Index and Global Longitudinal Strain Assessment Identifies Subgroups with Differential Myocardial Function and May Improve Risk Stratification in Aortic Stenosis,Ahmed Abdelmohsen Zayed; Michel El Khoury; Bahy Abofrekha; Oluwakorede Akele; Hadi Itani; O. Khayat; Abdelrahman Abouelnas; Nadim Zaidan; Kevin Schesing,10.3390/medsci14010103,2026-02-20,Medical Sciences,"Background: Traditional echocardiographic assessment of aortic stenosis (AS) using aortic valve area (AVA) may overestimate severity due to pressure recovery phenomena, while subclinical myocardial dysfunction remains undetected despite preserved ejection fraction. This study evaluated whether energy loss index (ELI)—which accounts for pressure recovery—demonstrates superior correlation with global longitudinal strain (GLS), a marker of subclinical myocardial dysfunction, compared to conventional AVA-based classification in patients with moderate-to-severe AS and preserved left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF). Methods: This retrospective single-center study analyzed 149 patients with moderate-to-severe AS (AVA &lt; 1.5 cm2) and LVEF &gt; 50% from 2015 to 2019. Among 97 patients with severe AS by AVA (&lt;1.0 cm2), ELI was calculated using the formula ELI = (AVA × Aa)/(Aa − AVA) ÷ BSA, where Aa represents sinotubular junction cross-sectional area. Patients with ELI ≥ 0.6 cm2/m2 were reclassified as moderate AS. Spearman correlation assessed relationships between AVA, ELI, and GLS. Multivariable linear regression models determined independent predictors of myocardial dysfunction, adjusting for age, body surface area, hypertension, LVEF, and mean pressure gradient. Results: ELI reclassified 28 of 97 patients (29%) from severe to moderate AS. Reclassified patients had significantly better myocardial function, with less impaired GLS (−15.0 ± 3.9% vs. −12.1 ± 5.0%, p = 0.013) and higher LVEF (60.1 ± 6.2% vs. 56.5 ± 9.1%, p = 0.017) compared to non-reclassified patients. In the overall cohort, ELI demonstrated stronger correlation with GLS than AVA (r = −0.307, p = 0.0003 vs. r = −0.209, p = 0.0115). Critically, among patients with severe AS by AVA criteria, ELI maintained significant correlation with GLS (r = −0.443, p = 0.0003) while AVA showed no correlation (r = −0.144, p = 0.159). In multivariable analysis, ELI independently predicted GLS (β = 5.847, 95% CI: 2.85–8.84, p = 0.0002; adjusted R2 = 0.289), whereas AVA did not (β = 2.234, 95% CI: −1.08 to 5.55, p = 0.188; adjusted R2 = 0.234). When both parameters were included simultaneously, only ELI remained significant (p = 0.0024). Conclusions: In this retrospective cohort, ELI-based reclassification identified a subgroup of patients with less severe myocardial dysfunction as measured by GLS and LVEF, and ELI demonstrated superior correlation with subclinical myocardial dysfunction compared to AVA. These findings suggest ELI may provide a more physiologically reflective assessment of hemodynamic burden in AS with preserved LVEF. However, the absence of systematic symptom assessment and clinical outcome data represents critical limitations. Prospective studies with standardized symptom evaluation, longitudinal follow-up, and adjudicated clinical endpoints are required to determine whether ELI-based reclassification improves risk stratification and clinical decision-making before this approach can be recommended for routine practice."
OpenAlex,aortic stenosis,Challenges in Timely Management of Severe Aortic Stenosis: A Multicentre Analysis of Delayed TAVI Referrals and Gender Disparities,A Cascone; Francesco Federico; Giulia Ghizzoni; Ciro Vella; Barbara Bellini; Giulia Botti; Marco Ancona; Luca Ferri; Filippo Russo; Thomas Lescure; A E Laffond; Nicole Karam; Ignacio Cruz‐González; Matteo Montorfano; Alaide Chieffo,10.1093/ehjvshd/xwag009,2026-02-20,European Heart Journal - Valvular and Structural Heart Disease,"Abstract Background Gender-related disparities in diagnosis and referral to transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) remain incompletely understood. Aims This study aims to assess sex-related differences in diagnostic and therapeutic delays to TAVI and to explore sex-related disparities in management and clinical characteristics of patients with severe aortic stenosis (AS). Methods and results This multicentre, observational study included 519 patients (46.1% women) with severe symptomatic AS referred for TAVI in 2023 across three European centres. Outcomes were assessed according to VARC-3. Female-specific clinical history was systematically collected. Women were older, with higher surgical risk (STS Score: 4.5 [3.0-6.6] vs 2.8 [1.7-4.0], p&amp;lt;0.001) and more advanced symptoms (NYHA functional class III-IV 87 vs 77,p=0.014). Aortic annulus dimensions and valve area were smaller in women (both p&amp;lt;0.001). Women experienced longer delays from symptom onset to diagnosis (3 [0-9] vs 1 [0-4] months, p&amp;lt;0.001), with notable inter-centre variability. However, time from diagnosis to TAVI was similar (3 [1-5] vs 2.5 [1-4.5] months, p=0.220). In-hospital mortality (2.5% vs 1.8%, p=0.555), bleeding, major vascular complications and conduction disturbances did not differ by sex. At six months functional status improved significantly; mortality (4.1% vs 5.3%, p=0.685), rehospitalisation and device success (84.6% vs 85.8%, p=0.252) were comparable between sexes. Female-specific characteristics, including pregnancy, gynaecological history and hormone therapy, were not significantly associated with clinical outcomes. Conclusions Women faced longer diagnostic delays, indicating persistent sex-based disparities in timely recognition of severe AS. Nevertheless, clinical outcomes after TAVI were similar between sexes supporting comparable treatment effectiveness."

The DurAVR transcatheter heart valve is designed to reproduce native leaflet shape and restore flow. Methods In a prospective study, patients with symptomatic severe aortic stenosis underwent transthoracic echocardiography and cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) before TAVR with DurAVR and at six months. Post-implant findings were compared with age-, sex-, and haemodynamics-matched controls without aortic valve disease. Ascending aortic flow displacement (FD) and flow reversal ratio (FRR) were quantified using phase-contrast imaging. Haemodynamic correlates of LV mass regression post-DurAVR were explored using multivariable analysis. Results One hundred and forty-one participants were studied with CMR (aortic stenosis, 60; DurAVR, 46; controls, 35). Thirty-nine patients had paired baseline and 6-month data. Compared to baseline, DurAVR reduced indexed FD (4.0±1.2 to 3.5±0.8 %/cm², P&amp;lt;0.005) and indexed FRR (3.9±1.0 to 2.6±0.7 %/cm², P&amp;lt;0.0001). Post DurAVR, indexed FD was comparable to controls (3.5±0.8 vs 3.5±1.3 %/cm², P=0.81) and indexed FRR approached control values (2.5±0.7 vs 2.2±0.8 %/cm², P=0.06). Left ventricular mass regressed by 18% (P&amp;lt;0.0001). In regression (R2=0.43), left ventricular mass regression was independently associated with the change in the mean transaortic gradient (relative contribution 68%, P=0.005) and change in systolic FRR (relative contribution 26%, P=0.03). Conclusion DurAVR THV implantation restored ascending aortic flow towards native physiology and was accompanied by left ventricular reverse remodelling at six months. Larger comparative studies should determine whether normalised post-implant flow translates into improved patient outcomes."

Higher incidences of aortic valve stenosis have been observed not only in clonal hematopoiesis of indeterminate potential (CHIP) but also in monoclonal gammopathy of unknown significance (MGUS). However, studies investigating the outcome after transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) in MGUS are lacking. Investigate overall survival in MGUS patients after TAVI. We used the federated real-world data platform TriNetX to identify MGUS patients undergoing TAVI. Patients were divided into cohorts based on presence of MGUS, age or comorbidities and matched using the TriNetX propensity score matching tool. Overall survival was assessed after 1, 3 and 5 years. We identified 58,796 patients with TAVI procedure. Of these, 1039 patients (1.8%) were identified with co-occurring MGUS. Our study shows superior overall survival for patients without MGUS after TAVI in the overall cohort (HR:0.792 CI95% 0.657, 0.954, p = 0.014) and > 75 years of age (HR:0.797, CI95% 0.660, 0.961, p = 0.017) at the 5-year timepoint. 5-year overall survival did not differ in younger MGUS patients (< 75 years) or patients with co-occurring chronic kidney disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or heart failure (p > 0.05). In this real-world analysis in patients with MGUS undergoing TAVI, MGUS was associated with inferior outcomes after TAVI, especially for older (> 75 years) patients. Five-year overall survival did not differ among patients with common comorbidities. Our results suggest that MGUS may be linked to worse overall long-term survival following TAVI and highlights the need for further interdisciplinary cardiooncology research. Given the key methodological limitations, the present results should be considered as hypothesis-generating."

OpenAlex,aortic stenosis,Integrated Transcriptomic Analysis Identifies Novel Candidate Genes Associated with Calcific Aortic Valve Disease,Jing Chen; Shichao Guo; Junming Zhu; Haiou Hu; Bing Tang; Lingchen Huang; Chenhan Zhang; suwei Chen; Sanbao Chai; Zhiyu Qiao; Hanqiao Jiang,10.3390/genes17020246,2026-02-20,Genes,"Background: Calcified aortic valve disease (CAVD) is a prevalent valvular disorder in the elderly and a major cause of aortic stenosis. Surgical and transcatheter aortic valve replacement remain the primary treatments for advanced CAVD; however, effective pharmacological therapies to prevent or slow disease progression are lacking. Therefore, there is an urgent need to explore potential novel candidate biomarkers and therapeutic targets. Methods: In this study, transcriptomic data from multiple independent datasets were integrated to comprehensively characterize the transcriptional profile of CAVD. Feature genes were identified using complementary machine learning approaches, followed by functional pathway enrichment and protein–protein interaction (PPI) network analyses to uncover novel candidate genes associated with CAVD. Single-cell RNA sequencing (sc-RNA-Seq) data were further analyzed using pseudotime trajectory analysis to explore transcriptional dynamics during valve interstitial cells’ (VICs) osteogenic progression. Quantitative PCR and Western blot analyses of human calcified aortic valve tissues were used for validation. Results: A total of 119 CAVD-associated genes were identified, primarily involved in ossification, extracellular matrix organization, and cell–substrate adhesion. Among these, the ossification-associated genes BAMBI, HAND2, and MYOC exhibited potential discriminatory power between CAVD and control samples, with notable downregulation in calcified valves. Pseudotime analysis showed that the expression of these genes gradually decreased along the transcriptional trajectory associated with osteogenic differentiation. In addition, the analysis of relative immune signatures revealed negative correlations between these genes and multiple immune signatures. Conclusions: This study identifies novel candidate genes underlying CAVD pathogenesis and highlights BAMBI, HAND2, and MYOC as potential biomarkers and therapeutic targets, providing new insights into disease mechanisms and opportunities for novel interventions."

Abdelsattar; Taha Abd-ElSalam Ashraf Taha,10.1186/s12872-026-05558-6,2026-02-19,BMC Cardiovascular Disorders,"The optimal revascularization strategy for low-risk patients with severe aortic stenosis (AS), transcatheter (TAVI) versus surgical aortic valve replacement (SAVR), remains a subject of ongoing debate, particularly regarding long-term outcomes. We aimed to synthesize the evidence on the comparative safety and efficacy of TAVI and SAVR in this population. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis, searching PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, and Cochrane Library until March 2025. We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and comparative observational studies enrolling low-risk patients with severe AS. Primary outcomes were all-cause mortality and stroke, analyzed at different time points. Data were pooled using random-effects models, with subgroup analyses based on study design. Thirty studies, including 48,210 patients, were included. TAVI was associated with a significantly lower risk of 30-day mortality (Relative Risk [RR] 0.66, 95% CI 0.50–0.76) and 30-day stroke (RR 0.70, 95% CI 0.53–0.92). However, in the overall analysis, SAVR was favored for one-year mortality (RR 1.11, 95% CI 1.01–1.21), with equipoise in long-term follow-up. TAVI significantly reduced the risks of 30-day major bleeding (RR 0.38, 95% CI 0.21–0.70) and atrial fibrillation (RR 0.41, 95% CI 0.22–0.76). Conversely, TAVI was associated with a persistently higher risk of permanent pacemaker implantation (RR 2.44 at 30 days, 95% CI 1.76–3.40) and paravalvular leakage (RR > 5-fold at both 30 days and 1 year). In low-risk patients with severe AS, TAVI offers clear early procedural safety advantages, particularly regarding stroke, bleeding, and atrial fibrillation. While the overall analysis suggested a 30-day mortality benefit for TAVI and a 1-year mortality benefit for SAVR, these findings were driven principally by observational data and were not statistically significant in the subgroup of randomized controlled trials. These procedural benefits are counterbalanced by a persistently higher risk of permanent pacemaker implantation and paravalvular leakage with TAVI. The choice of intervention requires a nuanced, individualized approach through shared decision-making, weighing early recovery benefits against device-related risks and the divergence between trial and registry outcomes."

OpenAlex,aortic stenosis,Refining insights on type 2 diabetes and aortic valve replacement,P. F. Liu; Xiaoyu He; Zejun Song,10.1111/dme.70239,2026-02-18,Diabetic Medicine,"Davis and colleagues' longitudinal Fremantle Diabetes Study Phase II study makes a pivotal contribution by demonstrating that type 2 diabetes doubles the risk of incident aortic valve replacement (AVR) with distal symmetrical polyneuropathy (DSPN) and intensive glucose-lowering therapy as key associates.1 Its strengths include rigorous age, sex and postcode matching, long-term follow-up from 2008 to 2021, and integration of competing risk models that address critical limitations of prior research and reinforce the clinical relevance of its findings. Several underdeveloped dimensions could further enhance the study's translational value and we aim to elaborate on targeted recommendations to address these aspects. Our core suggestions focus on three interconnected areas to deepen understanding and clinical applicability. First, subgroup stratification is essential as the study aggregates type 2 diabetes participants. Stratifying by diabetes duration, such as less than 5 years, 5–10 years and more than 10 years, would clarify whether AVR risk accumulates linearly or if thresholds exist. Distinguishing between glucose-lowering medication classes, such as sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors versus insulin, could reveal if specific therapies modify valvular risk.2 Second, a mechanistic exploration of the DSPN-AVR association is needed beyond the common soil hypothesis.3 Investigating sarcopenia as a mediator, given its links to both DSPN and aortic stenosis progression,4 could identify modifiable targets like resistance training. Third, outcome granularity matters in distinguishing urgent versus elective AVR as the former carries a higher perioperative risk.5 Assessing post-AVR non-mortality outcomes, such as infections and renal dysfunction, would provide a more comprehensive view of the diabetes-related burden and guide perioperative management. These recommendations build on the study's robust foundation without undermining its core findings. By addressing subgroup-specific risk, mechanistic mediators and outcome detail, future research can refine risk stratification, identify targeted interventions and optimize personalized care for adults with type 2 diabetes at risk of severe valvular heart disease. Davis and colleagues' work rightly highlights the need for heightened clinical suspicion of aortic stenosis in older adults with type 2 diabetes, and these extensions will further strengthen its translational impact.

Jonathan Zhang; Xiaojing Liu; Haibo Yang; Hua Zhang; Youjin Li; Jian Yang,10.3389/fcvm.2026.1662827,2026-02-18,Frontiers in Cardiovascular Medicine,"Background The prevalence of rheumatic aortic regurgitation (AR) is higher than that of aortic stenosis in developing countries, but the efficacy of transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) in high surgical risk patients with severe AR remains unknown. Our goal was to explore the differences in clinical outcomes of TAVR in patients with rheumatic and non-rheumatic AR. Methods 144 Rheumatic and 417 nonrheumatic patients with severe AR were prospectively enrolled from January 2018 to December 2021. All patients underwent transapical TAVR with J-Valve after evaluation by computed tomography angiography and transthoracic echocardiography before the procedure. The primary end point was 3-year all-cause mortality. Results The average age was 71.2 [interquartile range (IQR): 66.0–76.0] years, and the Society of Thoracic Surgeons score was 4.8 (IQR: 3.4–6.1) %. The proportion of patients with rheumatic AR who developed ≥ mild PVL was lower than the proportion of patients with non-rheumatic AR (5.6% vs. 11.3%, P &amp;lt; 0.001). At a median follow-up of 39.7 (IQR: 36.4–41.8) months, no difference was observed in the 3-year all-cause mortality ( P = 0.740) between the two groups. After multivariate adjustment, the Society of Thoracic Surgeons score, higher frailty and larger aortic angulation were associated with 3-year all-cause mortality. Conclusion For patients with rheumatic AR, the clinical outcomes were similar to those of patients with non-rheumatic AR. TAVR can be one of the feasible treatment options for such patients."
OpenAlex,aortic stenosis,Vector mapping of blood flow in the left ventricle in healthy and patients with aortic stenosis,V A Sandrikov; T. Y Kulagina; V.O. Russkin; O. A. Zhigulina,10.17116/kardio20261901157,2026-02-18,Russian Journal of Cardiology and Cardiovascular Surgery,"Objective. The aim of the study was to apply a new echocardiographic technology in the visualization of turbulent blood flow and energy expenditure in healthy and patients with aortic stenosis. Materials and methods. Intraventricular blood flow studies were performed in 10 healthy subjects (average age 37±8 years) and 10 patients with aortic stenosis (average age 67±9 years) using the LISENDO 880LE premium ultrasound system (Fujifilm Corporation, Japan). Intracardiac blood flows were studied using a specialized software module Vector Flow Mapping (VFM). The structure of blood flow inside the left ventricle was assessed by the location of turbulence zones with the determination of the area, direction and acceleration of the vortex in certain phases of the cardiac cycle: isovolumic contraction, systole, diastole and atrial contraction. The results were calculated based on the average acceleration of blood flow and the area of turbulent flow in the outflow tract of the left ventricle. Results. Pressure gradients on the aortic valve and its opening area were evaluated to characterize aortic stenosis. The vortices formed during the filling of the left ventricle have a certain geometry and anatomical location that determine the directional blood flow during the shock discharge. The mechanics of myocardial contraction were assessed by three components: blood flows in the heart cavities, energy distribution and expenditure during the cardiac cycle, and their relationship between the area of turbulent flow and acceleration. Conclusion. Turbulence plays an important role in the normal functioning of the heart, supporting the movement and direction of blood flow. The energy dissipation during the cardiac cycle in aortic stenosis is determined by the area of the aortic valve opening, the zones of additional turbulence in the left ventricle, and the acceleration of turbulent vortices."

Of these, 33 patients had coral reef aorta (CRA). Patients were stratified by lesion location and CRA presence. Primary endpoints were 30-day adverse events and technical success (residual stenosis <30%). Secondary endpoints were major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE), major adverse limb events (MALE), and all-cause mortality. Cox regression identified predictors of outcome. <i>Results:</i> Technical success was achieved in 81.9%. Thirty-day mortality was 0.5%. At 10 years, freedom from MACE was significantly lower in patients with non-bifurcation abdominal aortic stenosis (56% vs. 76%; aHR 2.13, p < .05) and lowest in CRA (30% vs. 71%; aHR 3.17, p < .05). Independent predictors of MACE were CRA, chronic total occlusion (aHR 3.38, 95% CI 1.57-7.29), critical limb-threatening ischemia (aHR 3.67, 95% CI 1.74-7.75), and age (aHR 1.06 per year, 95% CI 1.01-1.11). MALE was more frequent in patients with peripheral arterial disease (aHR 2.07, 95% CI 1.12-3.81), CRA (aHR 2.51, 95% CI 1.17-5.40), and current smokers (aHR 5.10, 95% CI 1.23-21.0). <i>Conclusions</i>: CRA and non-bifurcation abdominal aortic stenosis are associated with reduced long-term freedom from MACE after EVT. These findings define high-risk subgroups within calcified AIOD and highlight the prognostic value of anatomical lesion characteristics for treatment planning and follow-up."

Critical appraisal was conducted using the PROBAST and TRIPOD+AI guidelines. Overall, 288 studies were included with an exponential rise from 2017 onwards. The majority of studies addressed aortic pathologies (33%), carotid stenosis (30%), and foot ulcers (25%), while few focused on peripheral artery disease (6%). Most were observational using retrospective (81%) or prospective data (15%), and one clinical trial was included. Dice coefficient (51%) and accuracy (36%) were the most commonly reported performance metrics with infrequent use of AUROC (17%). Only 15% of studies had a low risk of bias and overall adherence to the TRIPOD+AI checklist was relatively poor at 57%. Overall, we suggest greater attention to peripheral artery disease; for dice coefficient and AUROC to be used in segmentation and discrimination tasks, respectively; and for the TRIPOD+AI statement to be consulted early on during model development."

Evidence on the efficacy and safety of TAVR is scarce despite several cases of RAS recorded in China. This study aimed to evaluate the efficacy of TAVR in patients with RAS. A total of 359 patients were enrolled and divided into the RAS ( n = 71) and non-RAS ( n = 288) groups according to the World Heart Federation guidelines for rheumatic heart disease combined with computed tomography imaging. Propensity score matching was performed to ensure comparability between groups. A self-expanding valve was used in all the patients. Primary endpoints included technical success, device success, and 1-year composite outcomes. Short-term complications and anatomical differences were analysed. Patients with RAS had higher N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide levels and Society of Thoracic Surgeons scores, higher atrial fibrillation rates, and worse cardiac metrics (enlargement, valve regurgitation, and lower estimated glomerular filtration rates). The patients in the RAS group had fewer bicuspid valves, less calcification, more elliptical annuli, and larger left ventricular outflow tract/annulus area ratios. The RAS group had a higher prosthesis positioning and oversizing rate. Technical success, device success, and early safety rates were similar between groups. However, the RAS group had a higher pacemaker implantation and transcatheter heart valve displacement (THVD) risk, yet demonstrated superior 1-year outcomes. TAVR may be safe and effective for the treatment of RAS. The anatomical characteristics of patients with RAS increased the risk of THVD and pacemaker implantation. A high-release strategy and appropriate oversizing could partially alleviate the risk of THVD. TAVR, transcatheter aortic valve replacement; RAS, rheumatic aortic valve stenosis."
OpenAlex,deep learning,Combating Data and Target Shifts in Visual Tasks,Zhaorui Tan,10.17638/03194353,2031-01-01,University of Liverpool,"The rapid advancement of deep learning models for visual tasks has led to significant progress in many domains. However, a key challenge remains: ensuring that models can generalize effectively to unseen samples or novel classes, especially in real-world scenarios where training data-target pairs are often limited or unavailable, and test data may exhibit shifts in both data and targets. This thesis addresses the problem of shifts across data and targets, proposing novel methods to improve model generalization and transferability in complex settings. The thesis identifies the different shift scenarios for visual tasks and presents their problem forms. The research first relaxes the static target distribution assumption in Multi-Domain Generalization (mDG) tasks, introducing the General Multi-Domain Generalization (GMDG) objective to improve generalization under varying data shifts. Specifically, Extensive experiments validate that GMDG is feasible for classification, segmentation, and regression tasks. Further considering extreme target distribution shifts where even unknown novel classes emerge, the study also explores logical regularization techniques for tasks such as Generalized Category Discovery (GCD), mDG+GCD, and Class Incremental Learning (CIL), proposing a sample-based logical regularization term (L-Reg) to enhance data-, target-, and all-shift generalization. Additionally, a partial logic framework is introduced to address challenges in CIL, enabling models to retain room for unknown classes during training. This is further extended by the Partial-Logic Regularization (PL-Reg), which improves generalization across GCD, mDG+GCD, and transferability for CIL tasks. Furthermore, the thesis proposes a novel Semantic-aware Data Augmentation (SADA) framework for cross-modality generalization in text-to-image synthesis (T2Isyn), text-image retrieval (TIR), and image-text retrieval (ITR) tasks. This framework ensures semantic preservation across text and image modalities, improving both semantic consistency and image quality in cross-modality tasks. The methods proposed in this thesis offer significant advancements in visual generalization and transfer scenarios, providing theoretical insights and practical solutions for handling data shifts, target shifts, and multi-modalities in complex scenarios. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of the proposed methods, demonstrating their superior performance across a range of tasks."
OpenAlex,deep learning,Antecedents and consequences of Green-tech FDI in emerging markets,Zhuoran Liu,10.17638/03195308,2031-01-01,University of Liverpool,"As environmental pressures intensify, attracting sustainable foreign direct investment (FDI), particularly green-tech FDI, has become a critical pathway for emerging markets to achieve environmental sustainability. However, existing research remains fragmented, offering limited insights into why green-tech FDI enters emerging markets and how it affects regional green innovation. This thesis addresses these gaps by systematically examining both the antecedents and consequences of green-tech FDI through three empirical studies using regional data from China. Study 1 and Study 2 focus on the antecedents of green-tech FDI. Study 1 examines how host-country conditions can attract green-tech FDI, highlighting the role of environmental management information disclosure (EMID) by domestic firms in reducing information gaps and strengthening green market–seeking motives. Study 2 shifts attention to the active decision-making of green-tech FDI, showing that under uncertainty, green-tech foreign investors engage in identity-based bandwagon learning by imitating peers with similar green identities, thereby mitigating investment risks. Study 3 turns to the consequences of green-tech FDI. It demonstrates that, due to the technological complexity of green innovation and limited absorptive capacity in emerging markets, green-tech FDI may generate crowding-out effects rather than purely positive spillovers. Adopting a network perspective, the study further finds that universities play a key moderating role: through broad linkages and deep collaborations, they help mitigate negative spillovers and facilitate the diffusion of green technologies. Together, the three studies advance the literature on sustainable FDI by differentiating green-tech FDI from general FDI and identifying the specific mechanisms that shape its entry decisions and local innovation outcomes. Practically, the findings provide guidance for emerging-market governments and firms on how to attract and manage sustainable investment, balance growth with environmental objectives, and strengthen local innovation ecosystems."
OpenAlex,deep learning,A UAV-Based Framework for Community-Scale Residential Building Energy Modelling in China,Mengfan Jin,10.17638/03195460,2029-01-01,University of Liverpool,"With increasing emphasis on energy efficiency and carbon emission reduction in the building sector, rapid and scalable energy modelling of existing buildings is critical for retrofit projects and policy development. Conventional surveys, data collection and energy modelling processes remain labour-intensive and impractical for large-scale applications, and energy modelling often dominates project time and cost. Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) equipped with high-resolution and infrared cameras now offer fast and safe exterior surveys, showing great potential in building energy assessments. Yet, a systematic framework for UAV integration, from image capture through processing to inputs for building energy simulation, has not been established. This research addresses these challenges by developing a structured framework for community-scale building energy modelling, which integrates UAV photogrammetry to accelerate data acquisition, reduce labour, and shorten energy modelling time for retrofit projects. The framework is designed to minimise prior data requirements while maximising automation and retaining sufficient accuracy and reliability. It also addressed systemic issues, such as the lack of data necessary to fully exploit the potential of available technologies in the context of this study. To achieve this research objective, a mixed-methodology approach, combining desk studies and fieldwork, was adopted. First, a comprehensive review of UAV-based building energy studies mapped the current applications and available tools, proposing a preliminary framework. Fieldwork then encompassed a pilot study and a detailed case study. In the pilot test, a single building was surveyed to identify an optimal toolchain for flight planning, image capture, photogrammetric reconstruction, model generation, and selection of a simulation platform. The resulting refined framework was applied to a case study of a 39-building community, and it was demonstrated that further automation was necessary. The potential for automation was then further explored. Geomatic algorithms, machine learning, and deep learning techniques were compared, and the combination that best balanced accuracy and processing time was selected for 3D model generation and window-to-wall ratio (WWR) extraction. In parallel, an archetype library of residential buildings in the Hot Summer Cold Winter (HSCW) zone in China was compiled to facilitate the assignment of thermal parameters. Finally, a reusable community-scale building energy modelling (CBEM) workflow was assembled in Grasshopper using Ladybug Tools components to process the aforementioned inputs. In conclusion, this study integrates UAV photogrammetry, GIS-based geomatic algorithms, machine learning, and graphical programming to develop an UAV-CBEM framework. The outcomes establish a foundation for scalable UAV-based building energy assessments, enhancing applicability in data-limited and large-scale settings worldwide."

OpenAlex,deep learning,Unsupervised Deep-learning Methods for Low-dose Computed Tomography Reconstruction,Ran An,10.17638/03194237,2027-01-01,University of Liverpool,"Computed tomography (CT) has become an indispensable imaging technique in medical diagnostics and industrial applications, owing to its non-invasive nature and high resolution in visualizing object internal structures. While X-ray CT (X-ray computed tomography) significantly enhances lesion detection capabilities, excessive exposure to X-ray radiation raises substantial health concerns, including elevated cancer risks and potential genetic damage. Although low-dose CT (LDCT) protocols reduce radiation safety concerns, they inevitably introduce severe noise and artifacts, which might compromise diagnostic accuracy. Recent advances in supervised deep learning approaches have demonstrated remarkable success in LDCT reconstruction. However, the reliance on paired training data severely limits their deployment in practical CT applications. This fundamental constraint highlights the critical importance of developing unsupervised reconstruction methods. Although existing unsupervised LDCT methods have made notable progress, they still face challenges requiring systematic solutions. This thesis makes three contributions to advance the field of unsupervised LDCT reconstruction: 1. Current dual-domain self-supervised LDCT denoising methods typically neglect the heterogeneity of the non-stationary Gaussian noise levels in low-dose sinograms and usually treat them as common images without appropriately controlling the denoising strength. The denoisers employed by them, which are based on classic convolutional neural networks (CNN), will lead to blurring artifacts in the reconstructed images if directly used for sinogram denoising. In addition, the denoising strength in the sinogram and image domains must be well-balanced to avoid introducing over-blurring or secondary artifacts in the reconstructed images, but existing approaches do not focus on this crucial point. To address these limitations, this thesis proposes a novel end-to-end dual-domain self-supervised framework for LDCT denoising. It employs Dropblock layers to adaptively localize the effect of convolution for sinogram denoising and sets a weighted average between the denoised sinograms and their noisy counterparts to better control the denoising strength, thus effectively reducing the blurring artifacts and leading to a well-balanced dual-domain denoising. Numerical experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and superior performance of the proposed method. 2. Existing normalizing flows (NFs)-based unsupervised LDCT reconstruction methods face challenges in both image quality and computational efficiency. On one hand, they typically utilize a two-way transformation strategy between noisy images and latent variables, which could easily lead to detail loss and secondary artifacts in the reconstructed images. On the other hand, training NFs on high-resolution CT images is computationally intensive. Although conditional normalizing flows (CNFs) can mitigate computational costs by learning conditional probabilities, existing approaches rely on labeled data for conditionalization, leaving unsupervised CNFs-based LDCT reconstruction a challenge. To tackle these issues, this thesis proposes a novel unsupervised LDCT iterative reconstruction algorithm based on CNFs. The proposed method employs a strict one-way transformation strategy during the alternating optimization in the dual spaces to prevent detail loss and secondary artifacts, and proposes a novel unsupervised conditionalization strategy for CNFs, thus achieving efficient training and inference on high-resolution images. The proposed method illustrates high-quality and relatively fast unsupervised reconstruction. Experiments across two datasets demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed method by rivaling several state-of-the-art methods. 3. Current diffusion model-based LDCT reconstruction methods solely employ the prior distributions learned from normal-dose CT data but neglect the valuable priors in low-dose data, which contain information about the characteristics of low-dose noise and artifacts. In addition, their reconstruction speed suffers from multiple sampling steps, presenting low efficiency. Breaking new ground in prior utilization, this thesis proposes a novel unsupervised LDCT iterative reconstruction algorithm based on dual denoising diffusion probabilistic models (DDPM), which leverages both normal-dose and low-dose priors. Specifically, the proposed method employs two DDPMs to learn the prior distributions from normal-dose and low-dose images, respectively, and incorporates them into a joint iterative reconstruction framework. To accelerate the reconstruction, partial diffusion sampling and single-pass deterministic reconstruction strategy are utilized in the proposed method, as well as the spaced OS-SART approaches. Experiments at different dose levels demonstrate the outstanding performance and fast speed of the proposed reconstruction algorithm. Through these innovations and contributions, this thesis addresses some significant challenges in current deep-learning-based unsupervised LDCT reconstruction methods, and proposes three novel unsupervised reconstruction algorithms. The proposed methods effectively improve the performance and efficiency of LDCT reconstruction under different unsupervised learning conditions, and provide some new perspectives and inspirations for future research."
OpenAlex,deep learning,From Sparse to Dense: Label-Efficient Weakly Supervised Segmentation for Images and Videos,Jian Wang,10.17638/03195330,2027-01-01,University of Liverpool,"Obtaining high-quality annotated data has become a primary bottleneck for training deep learning models, particularly for dense prediction tasks like semantic segmentation and video salient object segmentation. The demand for meticulous, pixel-level labeling makes fully-supervised approaches prohibitively expensive and limits their scalability. This thesis directly confronts this issue by proposing and systematically investigating a label-efficient ""sparse-to-dense'' paradigm. The core objective is to develop innovative frameworks that can learn from sparse, inexpensive weak supervision—such as image-level tags or scribbles—and intelligently propagate this minimal information to generate complete, pixel-accurate dense predictions. The major part of this thesis focuses on the ""sparse-to-dense'' challenge within Weakly Supervised Semantic Segmentation (WSSS) for images, where models learn from only image-level tags. Dominant approaches rely on Class Activation Maps (CAMs) as initial object seeds. However, CAMs inherently activate only the most discriminative object regions, leading to incomplete pseudo-labels. This gives rise to the central problem of activation densification: the critical process of expanding these sparse activations to cover the full extent of an object. Our research addresses this challenge through a progressive, multi-faceted strategy. Our exploration begins with a foundational framework (C3) designed to rectify the intrinsic flaws of initial CAMs. We propose a synergistic mutual calibration method. This method leverages the discrepancies between the two maps to generate local prototypes, which are simultaneously utilized to complete missing object parts and suppress background noise, yielding a significantly more accurate and complete initial seed. This foundational work immediately reveals the limitation of single-prototype instability and its inability to capture diverse features. Building on this foundation, we then develop architecture-specific strategies to address deeper limitations of the prototype-based approach. For Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) (C4), the use of a single prototype proves insufficient to capture significant intra-class variation. In response, we introduce an Optimal Transport (OT)-assisted framework that effectively mines multiple, diverse prototypes, thereby yielding more comprehensive activation maps. However, while C4 solves the intra-class diversity problem, the inherent local context constraint of the CNN architecture becomes the new bottleneck, fundamentally limiting the quality of globally-aware feature extraction needed for optimal multi-prototype assignment. This limitation necessitates a shift in architectural focus from CNNs to Vision Transformers. In the ViT architecture (C5), a new challenge arises where the token gap between the discriminative class token and varied patch tokens leads to incomplete activation. To bridge this gap, we leverage a tailored application of Optimal Transport, where the algorithm is tasked with learning a comprehensive proxy to ensure complete object activation. Despite these architectural advances (C3-C5), the overall WSSS performance hit a ceiling. This is fundamentally limited by the sparse supervision of class labels, which cannot provide precise boundary information. To break this ceiling, our WSSS exploration culminates in a universal enhancement strategy (C6) that transcends architecture-specific designs by leveraging Visual Foundation Models (VFMs). We resolve the conflict between the discriminative nature of initial CAMs and the VFM's need for holistic prompts. By modeling the CAM foreground as a graph and employing spectral analysis, our method intelligently selects a diverse set of prompt points that represent the overall structure of the foreground object. This guides the VFM to generate superior, boundary-aware supervision that can universally enhance any WSSS pipeline. Subsequently, the thesis extends the ""sparse-to-dense'' paradigm to the dynamic domain of video, addressing Weakly Supervised Video Salient Object Segmentation (WSVSOS) (C7) from sparse scribble annotations. In this specific context, the challenge evolves into spatio-temporal densification, which requires both full-object coverage within each frame and temporal consistency across the video sequences. To this end, we introduce the core CFMR framework, which utilizes Spatio-Temporal co-regulation. This framework is subsequently enhanced (CFMR+) by integrating the VFM guidance strategy from C6, which provides high-quality spatial priors essential for ensuring both high spatial detail and inter-frame consistency. By enforcing both intra-frame and cross-frame consistency between these two streams, our method effectively propagates the sparse initial signal to generate dense and temporally coherent saliency masks. In conclusion, this thesis presents a comprehensive and cohesive investigation into label-efficient segmentation tasks, offering a suite of innovative and effective strategies for the ""sparse-to-dense'' challenge. Our work establishes a progressive roadmap that systematically overcomes architectural and semantic limitations, culminating in highly robust and generalized densification pipelines. Our extensive experimental results on standard benchmarks validate the state-of-the-art performance of these methods, providing robust solutions to a long-standing problem in the computer vision field."

Abstract This Project develops an urban traffic intensity prediction system using deep learning techniques, with the aim of improving mobility decision-making. Unlike other platforms focused on visualizing the current state, the proposed solution seeks to anticipate future behaviors, and is positioned as an open, replicable alternative specifically oriented towards prediction. To achieve this, a modular architecture based on the Python language has been designed, capable of integrating multiple open data sources: historical traffic records, historical weather situation data, and spatial coordinates of measurement sensors. The system applies a process of cleaning, temporal interpolation, and variable transformation, including cyclic encoding of time and spatial conversion to UTM coordinates, allowing for precise fusion between geographical and meteorological data through techniques such as inverse distance weighting (IDW). The predictive model is based on an LSTM neural network, especially adapted for multivariate time sequences. It is trained using a sliding window strategy of 32 samples (7 hours and 45 minutes) to predict traffic intensity in the next interval. The system additionally incorporates an IterableDataset mechanism to handle large volumes of training data without compromising the stability of the environment. The obtained results show robust accuracy in validation scenarios, with acceptable prediction errors (MAE and RMSE). Furthermore, an interactive web interface has been developed, allowing for the local deployment of the system, with the capacity for real-time data ingestion and direct visualization of predictions. This work demonstrates the technical and operational feasibility of applying deep learning to urban traffic analysis and lays the groundwork for its future evolution towards more generalizable, robust, and useful systems in real smart city contexts."
OpenAlex,deep learning,Deep Learning-Based Data Hiding Technique for Medical Images,Hadjer SAIDI,,2026-06-26,University of Biskra Theses Repository (University of Biskra),"This thesis introduces novel deep learning-based frameworks for secure medical image steganography, addressing the critical challenge of protecting sensitive patient information while preserving diagnostic quality. Medical images present unique security requirements due to their dual nature: containing both critical visual data for diagnosis and sensitive patient metadata, which conventional steganographic techniques do not adequately address. Our work presents two complementary approaches to this challenge. First, we develop a Mask-RCNN based framework that intelligently identifies diagnostically insignificant regions within medical images for strategic data embedding. By combining this regionaware detection with Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) embedding in the frequency domain, our method achieves remarkable imperceptibility with Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR) values exceeding 115 dB while maintaining high payload capacity. Second, we propose a clinical quality-aware convolutional neural network architecture that leverages an encoder-decoder framework for end-to-end steganography. This approach employs parallel processing paths with scaled residual learning to embed secret medical images within cover images while preserving diagnostic features. Extensive experimentation across multiple medical imaging modalities (CT, MRI) from datasets including MIDRC-RICORD-1B, and IQ-OTH/NCCD, demonstrates that our method achieves a good trade-off between payload and imperceptibility. The frameworks developed in this thesis achieve an optimal balance between embedding capacity, imperceptibility, and robust secret recovery, providing healthcare institutions with effective tools for safeguarding patient privacy while maintaining the integrity of medical diagnostics. This work significantly advances the field of medical image security and establishes a foundation for future innovations in secure healthcare information systems."
OpenAlex,deep learning,A Novel Deep-Learning-Based Approach for Estimating High-Resolution InSAR Parameters,"Dell Amore, Luca; Carcereri, Daniel; Demir, Begüm; Rizzoli, Paola",,2026-06-01,elib (German Aerospace Center),"Nowadays, SAR Interferometry (InSAR) represents one of the most powerful tools to perform complex tasks, such as retrieving Earth’s surface topography and monitoring its deformations. However, denoising strategies are crucial for the generation of reliable and high-quality InSAR products. In this framework, we propose a complete and generalized theoretical and statistical model to physically describe and simulate a noise-free interferogram, together with its corresponding noisy version, starting from the knowledge of the InSAR acquisition geometry and of the underlying topography. A deep-learning-based model is then trained in a fully-supervised manner to estimate high-resolution InSAR parameters, i.e. coherence and interferometric phase, leveraging the proposed statistical model. In particular, an accurate assessment of the network’s estimation performance is conducted by comparing it to state-of-the-art denoising filters, such as Boxcar and Phi-Net and showing the added value of the proposed theoretical modifications to the state-of-the-art literature."
