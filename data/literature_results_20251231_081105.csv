PubMed,aortic stenosis,Changes in myocardial blood flow and microvascular resistance in patients with coronary artery disease undergoing transcatheter aortic valve implantation.,Eron Yones; Rebecca Gosling; Daniel Taylor; Tom Alexander Howard Newman; Mark Sammut; Saadia Aslam; Javaid Iqbal; Muhammad Aetesam-Ur-Rahman; Kenneth Morgan; Amir Aziz; Melanie Neville; Ever Grech; Paul D Morris; Julian Gunn,10.1136/openhrt-2025-003621,2025-12-30,Open heart,"Severe aortic stenosis (AS) causes a pathophysiological cascade, which impairs myocardial blood flow. This effect is exacerbated in the presence of coronary disease (CAD). Treatment with transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) may promote reversal of these pathophysiological conditions.
We performed multimodality assessment of cardiac physiology in patients with AS and concurrent CAD requiring percutaneous coronary intervention, prior to and 6 months after undergoing TAVI. Techniques include: coronary angiography and bolus thermodilution-derived indices of microvascular function (coronary flow reserve (CFR); index of microcirculatory resistance (IMR)); stress perfusion cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) imaging, which was used to measure changes in global myocardial blood flow (MBF) and left ventricular mass (LVM), and computed resting and hyperaemic vessel specific absolute coronary flow (aCBF) and microvascular resistance (MVR) using a computational model of coronary physiology.
Data were obtained for seven patients (10 vessels). CFR increased from 1.53 (1.2-1.7) to 2.35 (2.0-2.7) (p=0.037) 6 months post-TAVI. There was a 33% reduction in resting aCBF from 218 mL/min to 146 mL/min (p=0.004). On CMR, resting MBF fell 37% from 3.0±0.98 mL/min/g to 1.9±0.7 mL/min/g (p=0.033) and stress MBF fell 25% from 3.6±0.57 mL/min/g to 2.7±0.7 mL/min/g (p=0.004). Indexed LVM regressed from 79±14 g/m2 to 71±16 g/m2 (p=0.006). MVR remained unchanged.
CFR increased following TAVI. The mechanism for this was a significant reduction in resting coronary blood flow measured with CMR and modelled computationally. The unchanged MVR and IMR suggest that resting blood flow reduces due to reduced myocardial demand and myocardial remodelling, rather than changes in resistance."

Surgical aortic valve replacement remains the standard treatment but is often deferred due to perceived high surgical risk and frailty, leaving nearly one‑third of patients with severe AR untreated. Transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) offers a less invasive alternative, but off-label use of transcatheter valves designed for aortic stenosis has been limited by anchoring difficulties, valve embolization, and residual regurgitation. Dedicated devices have addressed these challenges with tailored anchoring mechanisms and demonstrated improved procedural success. This case-based review explores the evolving role of TAVR for AR through three patient vignettes that highlight practical considerations for device selection, anchoring strategies, and complication management. While outcomes with dedicated systems are encouraging, further research should establish TAVR in AR treatment. In parallel, device iterations are required to curtail procedure-induced conduction disturbances and broaden anatomical eligibility."
PubMed,aortic stenosis,Correcting CT-derived aortic valve area for LVOT ellipticity: A novel approach.,Yoav Niv Granot; Solomon W Bienstock; Daniel Karlsberg; Gilbert H L Tang; Stamatios Lerakis,10.1016/j.ijcard.2025.134122,2025-12-28,International journal of cardiology,"A limitation of echocardiography is its tendency to underestimate the left ventricular outflow tract (LVOT) area due to reliance on single diameter. While substituting CT-derived LVOT area in aortic valve area calculations (AVA_CT) increases the calculated valve area, this does not improve its clinical utility. In fact, AVA_CT overestimates the AVA, requiring a higher threshold for defining severe aortic stenosis [AS] (<1.2 cm2). This phenomenon may be attributed to differences in fluid flow dynamics between circular (assumed by echocardiography) and elliptical conduits.
Demonstrate the differences between the calculated AVA before and after implementing a mathematical correction factor for flow in a non-circular conduit.
662 patients with severe AS who underwent aortic valve replacement between 06/2021 and 07/2023. AVA calculated using the continuity equation with both echocardiography and CT data. A correction factor (CF) for elliptical flow was applied per patient.
AVA_CT was significantly higher than AVA_Echo, showing a 23 % increase. After correcting for the elliptical shape of the LVOT, AVA_CT-corrected was lower and closer to AVA_Echo (mean absolute difference of 0.06 cm2) and had superior correlation with invasive measurement. Several patients were reclassified from severe to moderate AS when using AVA_CT; however, applying the correction factor significantly reduced the reclassification.
Incorporating a correction factor for the elliptical geometry of the LVOT improves the accuracy of AVA estimation. The corrected AVA demonstrates better agreement with echocardiographic measurements and reduces the overestimation inherent in CT-based calculations. This approach minimizes discrepancies in patientclassification across AS severity categories."

However, long-term data are limited. This study aimed to evaluate 5-year echocardiographic and clinical outcomes of SEVs versus BEVs in patients with small aortic annulus underwent transcatheter aortic valve replacement.
We analyzed RESOLVE registry patients who underwent transcatheter aortic valve replacement at Cedars-Sinai between 2015 and 2020. Patients with a small aortic annulus (<430 mm2 by computed tomography) were included and followed for up to 5 years. The primary outcome was a composite of all-cause mortality, stroke, or heart failure hospitalization. Secondary outcomes included myocardial infarction, pacemaker implantation, aortic valve reintervention, and structural bioprosthetic valve dysfunction.
Among 1392 transcatheter aortic valve replacement recipients, 423 (78 SEVs, 345 BEVs) met the small annulus criteria. SEVs were associated with lower transvalvular gradients and larger indexed effective orifice area at discharge and 1 year (P<0.001). Moderate-to-severe paravalvular leak was more frequent with SEVs at 30 days (7.7% versus 1.5%, P<0.001), as was permanent pacemaker implantation (17.9% versus 6.1%, P<0.001). At 5 years, the primary outcome did not differ significantly (hazard ratio, 1.21; 95% CI, 0.81-1.82; P<0.33). All-cause mortality, stroke, heart failure hospitalization, structural bioprosthetic valve dysfunction, and reintervention rates were similar between groups.
Although SEVs provide better hemodynamic performance in patients with severe aortic stenosis and small annuli, this advantage did not translate into improved survival or reduced cardiovascular events at 5 years."

The objective of this substudy was to compare echocardiographic findings in women with severe aortic stenosis following surgical aortic valve replacement or TAVI.
At 48 European centers, 443 women underwent randomization 1:1, and 420 were treated as randomized. Echocardiograms were available in 356 patients and were analyzed by a core laboratory.
Rates of or greater moderate paravalvular regurgitation was low (<1%) and similar between groups. At 30 days, TAVI was associated with higher mean transprosthetic gradient and smaller aortic valve area, but the rate of severe patient-prosthesis mismatch (3.0 versus 2.6%; P=1) was low and not different between groups. Valve hemodynamics were stable at 1 year. The rate of residual left ventricular hypertrophy (45.3 versus 28.6%; P=0.004) at 1 year was significantly higher with TAVI, whereas the rate of right ventricular systolic dysfunction (14.5 versus 40.7%; P<0.001) and evolution of cardiac damage stage (improved in 21.8 versus 18.1%; worsened in 16.8 versus 47.0%; P=0.001) were better with TAVI.
Among women with severe aortic stenosis, both TAVI and surgical aortic valve replacement achieve excellent valve hemodynamic results with low and similar rates of moderate or greater paravalvular regurgitation or severe patient-prosthesis mismatch. Surgical aortic valve replacement was associated with lower gradients and more pronounced regression of left ventricular hypertrophy, whereas TAVI was associated with better right ventricular systolic function and evolution of cardiac damage stage.

Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement (TAVR) offers a minimally invasive alternative to Surgical Aortic Valve Replacement (SAVR), particularly for high-risk patients. However, TAVR adoption and outcomes in Japan remain understudied due to limited national database analyses and differences in patient demographics compared to major international trials. We conducted a retrospective cohort study of aortic valve replacement (AVR) procedures from 2014 to 2021 using the National Healthcare Reimbursement database. In total, 103,076 cases were analyzed, with 33,881 undergoing TAVR and 31,337 undergoing SAVR for aortic stenosis. TAVR patients were older (median age 85 vs. 76 years, p < 0.0001) and more often female (66.7% vs. 51.4%, p < 0.0001). TAVR was associated with lower in-hospital mortality (0.88% vs. 2.4%, p < 0.0001), shorter hospital stays (14 vs. 24 days, p < 0.0001), but significantly higher medical costs (¥5,303,722 vs. ¥3,945,622, p < 0.0001). Among patients younger than 75 years, no significant difference in mortality was observed. In this nationwide administrative database, TAVR was associated with lower in-hospital mortality and shorter hospital stays compared to SAVR, though at a higher cost. While patient backgrounds and clinical risks could not be fully adjusted due to data limitations, the observed differences in in-hospital outcomes between TAVR and SAVR reflect real-world practice patterns. These findings should be interpreted as descriptive, not causal. The absence of a mortality difference in patients under 75 years highlights the need for further evaluation of TAVR's long-term effectiveness and cost-efficiency in younger populations."

The advent of transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) has revolutionized the treatment of patients previously considered ineligible for surgical aortic valve replacement (SAVR). TAVR provides a relatively safe intervention that leads to improvements in survival, symptoms, and functional status within months of implantation. A major complication following TAVR is the occurrence of paravalvular leaks (PVLs), which have been associated with increased mortality and higher rates of heart failure-related hospitalizations. PVLs refer to abnormal blood flow between the implanted valve and the aortic wall, which can compromise the functionality of the device. Careful pre-procedural planning enables the identification of patients at higher risk for PVL development. Although the incidence of PVLs has decreased with the introduction of newer-generation transcatheter valves, the condition remains clinically relevant. Due to the complex anatomy of the aortic valve apparatus and interference from the prosthetic frame, accurate evaluation of PVLs requires a multimodal diagnostic approach. Current evidence on PVL management is limited. In most cases, a conservative approach is adopted, while interventional strategies (such as pre- and post-dilatation, percutaneous PVL closure, and TAVR-in-TAVR) are reserved for selected patients. We performed a systematic literature review to summarize the incidence, predictors, diagnostic techniques, and management strategies of PVLs following TAVR."

Beyond simply elevating transvalvular gradient, PPM profoundly affects cardiac remodeling, coronary physiology, and ultimately patient survival. This comprehensive review synthesizes current evidence regarding PPM pathophysiology, clinical consequences, and therapeutic strategies. Methods: We conducted a narrative review of PPM in surgical (SAVR) and transcatheter (TAVR) aortic valve replacement. PubMed and Embase were systematically searched using terms related to AVR and PPM and reference lists of key studies and reviews were screened. Studies addressing PPM prevalence, hemodynamic impact, clinical outcomes, and mitigation strategies were included. Results: PPM, defined as an iEOA ≤ 0.85 cm2/m2 (moderate) or ≤0.65 cm2/m2 (severe), demonstrates variable prevalence across studies, typically ranging from 5 to 30% after SAVR and 2-35% after TAVR. It is associated with increased transvalvular gradients, reduced left ventricular mass regression, persistent coronary flow abnormalities, higher rates of heart failure, and both early and late mortality. Supra-annular self-expanding transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) devices and newer generation stentless or bovine pericardial surgical valves exhibit lower PPM rates than older stented or porcine valves. Valve-in-valve (ViV) TAVR and bioprosthetic valve fracture (BVF) can improve outcomes in failed surgical valves but are less effective in small annuli. TAVR-in-TAVR procedures are limited by anatomic and technical constraints, especially in maintaining coronary access and minimizing residual gradients. Conclusions: PPM remains a common and clinically consequential complication of AVR that compromises long-term outcomes. It is largely preventable through accurate preoperative imaging, valve sizing, and consideration of annular enlargement. Optimal outcomes require matching valve characteristics to individual patient anatomy and physiology. In an era of expanding TAVR use, preventing PPM during the index procedure is critical to optimizing survival and preserving future reintervention options."

Multidetector computed tomography (MDCT)-derived methods for calculating aortic valve area (AVA) may improve diagnostic concordance, but their diagnostic performance, validation against invasive hemodynamics, and the influence of left ventricular outflow tract (LVOT) morphology on severity grading remain insufficiently investigated. Methods: We retrospectively analyzed 307 patients with normal-flow, high-gradient calcific AS who underwent echocardiography, MDCT, and cardiac catheterization. AVA was calculated using (1) echocardiographic LVOT diameter, (2) hybrid Doppler-MDCT planimetric LVOT area, and (3) corrected echocardiographic LVOT diameter (×1.13). Agreement, correlation, and diagnostic performance were assessed using Bland-Altman analysis, Pearson correlation, ROC analysis, and McNemar's test. Subgroups defined by diagnostic concordance and MDCT-derived LVOT size were compared using ANOVA. Results: Hybrid AVA showed a strong correlation with echocardiographic AVA (r = 0.749, p < 0.001), with a mean difference of +0.11 ± 0.15 cm2. Both methods demonstrated similar relationships with invasive and non-invasive hemodynamic markers of AS severity. When combined with echocardiography, the hybrid method increased concordant classification of severe AS by 8%. In contrast, corrected AVA performed significantly worse, leading to more discordant classifications. LVOT size was significantly associated with variability in AVA and Doppler velocity index, independent of flow status. Conclusions: Hybrid MDCT-derived AVA provides diagnostic performance equivalent to echocardiography and improves concordance in selected patients. LVOT size influences key echocardiographic parameters and may warrant tailored diagnostic thresholds."

However, the causality and cross-ancestry generalizability of these associations remain uncertain.
Collecting summary-level data from genome-wide association studies for systolic (SBP) and diastolic (DBP) blood pressure, hypertension, type 2 diabetes, fasting glucose, glycated hemoglobin, body mass index (BMI), waist circumference (WC), alcohol consumption, smoking initiation, HCM, and DCM (sample size ranging from 38,288 to 1,812,017), we performed comprehensive two-sample univariable Mendelian randomization (MR) to evaluate the causal effect of each trait on HCM and DCM in both European and East Asian populations. We performed multivariable MR to investigate the independent effects of interrelated traits (SBP vs. DBP; BMI vs. WC).
MR analyses identified reliable evidence of a causal effect of SBP on HCM (Europeans: odds ratio (OR) = 1.03, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.02-1.04; East Asians: OR = 1.06, 95% CI = 1.03-1.08). For DCM, reliable evidence of causal effects was identified for DBP (Europeans: OR = 1.04, 95% CI = 1.03-1.04; East Asians: OR = 1.07, 95% CI = 1.04-1.11), WC (Europeans: OR = 1.73, 95% CI = 1.58-1.89; East Asians: OR = 3.32, 95% CI = 1.22-9.03), and alcohol consumption (Europeans: OR = 1.50, 95% CI = 1.20-1.86; East Asians: OR = 1.32, 95% CI = 1.11-1.56). In Europeans, genetically predicted higher WC (OR = 1.75, 95% CI = 1.53-2.01) and smoking initiation (OR = 1.34, 95% CI = 1.16-1.56) specifically increased the risk of HCM and DCM, respectively, while genetically predicted higher alcohol consumption (OR = 1.68, 95% CI = 1.36-2.07) specifically increased the risk of HCM in East Asians.
This study provided reliable cross-ancestry genetic evidence supporting higher SBP as a causal risk factor for HCM and higher DBP, WC, and alcohol consumption as causal risk factors for DCM. These findings underscore the potential of precision prevention strategies targeting modifiable cardiovascular risk factors to reduce cardiomyopathy burden across populations."

We aimed to map the multisystem comorbidity network of CAS and clarify underlying genetic mechanisms.
In 467 484 participants from the UK Biobank, observational and polygenic phenome-wide association studies evaluated associations between CAS and 1571 phenotypes, integrating disease-trajectory analyses to visualise temporal patterns. Associations replicated across observational and polygenic analyses were tested using two-sample Mendelian randomisation (MR) based on 22 CAS-related variants from FinnGen. Polygenic risk score (PRS) analyses excluding specific genes assessed their contributions, particularly LPA and plasma lipoprotein(a) (Lp(a)) levels.
CAS was associated with higher risks of 42 cardiovascular and non-cardiovascular conditions, most prominently metabolic, endocrine, haematological and respiratory disorders. Temporal analyses showed that circulatory and metabolic diseases typically precede other comorbidities in CAS trajectories. MR findings were consistent with causal effects of CAS on multiple cardiovascular diseases, iron-deficiency anaemia, mental disorders and pleural effusion. When LPA variants were removed from the CAS PRS or plasma Lp(a) concentration was adjusted for, most associations lost significance, indicating a shared LPA/Lp(a)-mediated genetic pathway.
CAS is embedded within a broad multisystem comorbidity network, driven largely by genetic variation at LPA and elevated Lp(a). These findings highlight pleiotropic mechanisms linking valvular calcification with systemic disease and support LPA-targeted therapies as a promising avenue for reducing the multisystem burden of CAS."

Assessment of severity assumes the greatest importance when aortic valve replacement is under consideration. In addition to a number of well-known technical frustrations in the Doppler diagnosis, a puzzling and persistent discrepancy between aortic valve gradients obtained by Doppler and those measured at catheterization emerged, further clouding the issue. This discordance led several investigators to the discovery of pressure recovery (PR) of varying degrees in the ascending aorta in AS patients distal to the stenotic valve. PR is often a significant factor in assessing the physiologic burden of AS. The impact of PR must be considered in the comprehensive assessment of AS severity."

ECV can be measured using myocardial T1 maps acquired before and after contrast administration. Standard ECV measurements do not consider the limited rate of water exchange (WX) between cardiomyocytes and the extracellular matrix which can result in underestimated ECV at higher contrast agent concentrations.
The objective was to estimate ECV in patients with severe AS before and after surgical aortic valve replacement (AVR) using a 2-site exchange model (2SXM) that also enables estimates of the intracellular lifetime of water (τic; an indicator of the minor diameter of the cardiomyocytes).
20 patients (67 ± 6 years) with severe AS, referred for AVR, underwent MRI on a 3T MR system before and 6 months after AVR. T1 measurements were made using a multiparametric saturation-recovery single-shot acquisition before and at multiple time points post-injection of contrast agent. A 2SXM and standard linear model (LM) were used to estimate ECV and, when combined with indexed left ventricular mass (LVMI), to calculate cell and matrix volumes, (LVMI x (1-ECV)/1.05) and (LVMI x ECV/1.05), respectively. The 2SXM model was also used to estimate τic.
Data were acquired before and 174 (157 to 267) days after AVR. LVMI reduced following AVR, from 78 ± 15g/m2 to 63 ± 11g/m2 (p<0.001). ECV estimates increased from 22 ± 3% to 28 ± 5% (p<0.001) using the LM compared to 28 ± 5% to 32 ± 4% (p=0.005) using the 2SXM. Indexed cell volume decreased from 58 ± 12 cm3/m2 to 43 ± 9 cm3/m2 (p < 0.001; LM) and from 54 ± 12 cm3/m2 to 41 ± 8 cm3/m2 (p<0.001; 2SXM). Indexed matrix volume did not change significantly by either method (LM, 16 ± 4 cm3/m2 to 17 ± 3 cm3/m2; 2SXM, 20 ± 5 cm3/m2 to 19 ± 3 cm3/m2). τic decreased from 0.21 ± 0.12s to 0.12 ± 0.09s (p=0.007).
Cellular hypertrophy regressed 6 months following AVR; the extracellular matrix volume did not change significantly. τic decreased post-AVR indicating that the reduction in cell volume can be largely attributed to a reduction in cardiomyocyte diameter."
PubMed,aortic stenosis,Sutureless versus transcatheter aortic valve replacement in patients with aortic stenosis: An updated meta-analysis of short- and mid-term outcomes with trial sequential analysis.,Ogechukwu Obi; Ayesha Ayesha; Paweł Łajczak; Ahmed W Hageen; Muhammad Hamza; Gabriel Erzinger; Muhammad Khan; Uchenna Nweze; Sherif Eltawansy,10.1016/j.ijcard.2025.134116,2025-12-24,International journal of cardiology,"The efficacy and safety of a novel aortic valve replacement treatment (SAVR) technique, sutureless aortic valve replacement (SU-AVR), compared to transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) in the treatment of aortic stenosis, is unclear in short and mid-term outcomes due to limited data.
PubMed, Scopus, Embase, Web of Science, and the Cochrane Library were systematically searched for studies comparing SU-AVR with TAVR. Risk ratios (RR) with 95 % confidence intervals (CIs) were computed for binary outcomes. Trial sequential analysis (TSA) was performed to assess whether the results in our meta-analysis were conclusive.
This systematic review and meta-analysis included 22 observational studies of symptomatic patients. When comparing SU-AVR to TAVR, similar risk of in-hospital mortality (RR 0.67, 95 % CI 0.37-1.24, p = 0.20, I2 = 15.1 %) and two-year mortality (RR 0.73, 95 % CI 0.39-1.37, p = 0.32, I2 = 61.5 %) were noted. However, SU-AVR was associated with significantly lower 30-day mortality (RR 0.46, 95 % CI 0.28-0.75, p = 0.002, I2 = 0.9 %), total number of valvular leakages (RR 0.13, 95 % CI 0.05-0.32, p < 0.00, I2 = 59.5 %), and one-year mortality (RR 0.51, 95 % CI 0.32-0.80, p = 0.003, I2 = 0.0 %). In the TSA analysis, 30-day mortality, one-year mortality, and total leakage rate showed true-positive results in the method. The two-year mortality rate yielded false-negative results due to the too low required information size.
In patients with aortic stenosis, SU-AVR was associated with similar in-hospital mortality and two-year mortality rates compared with TAVR; however, it was associated with significantly lower 30-day mortality, total number of valvular leakages, and one-year mortality rates."

With a focus on the prevalent psychological complications following the onset of this condition, this study aimed to explore the correlation between antenatal depression and Corona disease anxiety, personality traits, and postpartum depression during the COVID-19 pandemic.                                                           Materials and Methods:                     This cross-sectional descriptive-analytical study investigated women receiving care at health centers affiliated with Kerman University of Medical Sciences during the last month of their pregnancy and the postpartum period in 2022. Following the acquisition of informed consent, participants were assessed using various measures, including demographic and obstetric information, the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale, the Corona Disease Anxiety Scale (CDAS), and the NEO Personality Inventory-Revised during their third trimester of pregnancy. The same group of participants completed the Edinburgh Depression Scale and the Corona Disease Anxiety Scale (CDAS) 4-6 weeks after childbirth.                                                           Results and Discussion:                     There was a significant correlation between family income, unwanted pregnancy as perceived by both the mother and father, and antenatal depression. Additionally, marital satisfaction played a significant role in postpartum depression. Furthermore, antenatal depression was significantly associated with neuroticism, agreeableness, and physical symptoms related to Corona disease anxiety. Personality traits, with the exception of extroversion and conscientiousness, and various domains of Corona disease anxiety, excluding psychological symptoms, were also significantly associated with postpartum depression.                                                           Conclusion:                     During pandemics or epidemics, such as the COVID-19 outbreak, experiencing mental distress during pregnancy can contribute to mental health issues during the postpartum period. This risk is particularly true in individuals with unique personality traits, emphasizing the need for increased focus on mental health within prenatal care during these crises."

We conducted two key analyses: 1. Mixed effect logistic regression was used to check the relationship between the variables and COVID-19 severity. 2. Mixed effect linear regression was used to check the relationship between the variables and the length of stay in the hospital.                                                           Results:                     The findings indicated that the most important risk factors for the severity of COVID-19 were heart diseases (OR=1.67,95%CI:1.20-2.30), increasing age (OR=2.23 for age&gt;54, 95%CI:1.70- 2.90), male gender (OR=1.47,95%CI:1.10-1.96), respiratory diseases other than asthma, and frequency of admission (OR=1.60,95%CI:1.20-2.15). All patients who underwent readmission experienced a shorter duration of hospitalization during their subsequent admission (OR=0.94,95%CI:0.91,0.96) and had a higher mortality rate (30% within 14 days, 26.6% between 14-90 days). Patients readmitted at intervals of 14-90 days and greater than 90 days exhibited lower disease severity compared to those readmitted within the 0-14 day period.                                                           Conclusion:                     Examining readmissions, the severity of COVID-19, and the length of hospital stay in affected patients are important factors for planning and allocating resources for COVID-19 management and treatment. These factors can help policymakers develop effective clinical guidelines for hospitalization or outpatient treatment of COVID-19 patients and contribute to reducing the burden of disease in the community."

Kinovea, as an accessible motion-analysis software, provides both visual and quantitative feedback. However, its application in supporting technique development among beginner athletes remains insufficiently explored. Aim: This study aims to describe the use of Kinovea in biomechanics training and examine its contribution to the awareness of kinematic characteristics and movement techniques among beginner athletes. Methods: A descriptive qualitative design involved 72 beginner athletes aged 18–25 years selected through purposive sampling. Data were collected over 16 weeks through interviews, field observations, and motion video recordings analyzed using Kinovea. Kinematic data focused on joint angles, stride behavior, and movement phases during walking, running, and the flight phase. Qualitative data were analyzed using content analysis with NVivo 12, while kinematic results were interpreted descriptively to identify performance patterns and areas for technical refinement. Result: Kinematic analysis showed coordinated joint-angle patterns across all phases. Walking analysis identified arm swing angles of 50.9°–58.8° and leg separation angles of 64.3°–67.2°, indicating a stable gait rhythm. The running analysis revealed knee angles of 68.8°–69.8° and elbow angles of 87.6°–89.1°, indicating efficient propulsive mechanics. The flight phase demonstrated knee angles of 81.2°–87.8° and elbow angles of 80.4°–88.3°, suggesting effective momentum use and postural stability. These measurements supported stride-efficiency assessment and technique evaluation. Qualitative findings revealed that Kinovea enabled athletes to interpret movement phases and identify technical inefficiencies through slow-motion and frame-by-frame visualization. Conclusion: Kinovea supports basic motion analysis by providing clear kinematic information and helping beginner athletes observe and refine their movement techniques. The findings also offer practical value for coaches by enabling more precise identification of inefficient patterns and guiding targeted corrections during early-stage training."

OpenAlex,aortic stenosis,Outcomes of Surgical versus Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement: A Clinical Review,"Stang, Grace",,2026-01-01,Digital Commons - Gardner-Webb University (Gardner–Webb University),"Introduction: Surgical aortic valve replacement (SAVR) has been the predominant treatment for aortic stenosis (AS) for decades. However, transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) is becoming increasingly popular. Originally, TAVRs were only performed on patients who were deemed high-risk for surgery and would have died without the valve replacement. The purpose of this paper is to determine if TAVR or SAVR has better health outcomes for all patients no matter their surgical risk. Methods: A search via PubMed database was done using the key words “aortic stenosis”, “surgical aortic valve replacement”, “transcatheter aortic valve replacement”, and “mortality.” Additional search filters were applied for randomized control trials, systematic reviews, and meta- analyses. Dates were restricted to the last 5 years, and restrictions were added for English language and free full text only. This yielded 67 results and 5 were selected. Results: Of the five reviewed articles, all were meta-analyses and one systematic review. There was a total of 52122 patients. Primary endpoints across all articles were that there is no significant difference between TAVR and SAVR in the outcomes studied. Discussion: This review of studies provided supportive evidence that both TAVR and SAVR are valid treatment options or AS. TAVR had better short-term outcomes while SAVR had better long-term outcomes."

Zatevakhin; A V Matyushkin; A. T. Mustafin; Aleksey M. Frantsevich; Mubinjon N. Zoidov,10.17816/pavlovj630485,2025-12-28,I P Pavlov Russian Medical Biological Herald,"INTRODUCTION: Currently, X-ray endovascular technologies in the amount of endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR) are widely used not only in the treatment of scheduled patients with abdominal aortic aneurysm, but also in emergency situations, such as acute symptomatic aneurysm or its rupture, as an alternative to an open surgery. Endovascular treatment is characterized by minimal trauma, low mortality and a short hospital stay. However, for some patients, EVAR poses significant challenges and risks. One such group is patients with chronic kidney disease due to atherosclerotic lesions of the renal arteries. The article discusses a clinical case of a 67-year-old patient with an acute symptomatic abdominal aortic aneurysm, 5 cm in diameter, with a prominent concomitant cardiac pathology and stage IV chronic kidney disease (glomerular filtration rate 25 ml/min/1.73 m2) with the underlying critical stenosis of both renal arteries (subocclusion on the left and 85% stenosis on the right). The patient underwent emergency surgery in the amount of infrarenal aortic grafting and stenting of both renal arteries using gadodiamide. A reduction in the volume of contrast agent administered was achieved by stenting the renal arteries before EVAR. As a result, the stents, due to their radiopaque properties, were used as a guide for localizing the renal arteries during endograft placement. The postoperative period was uneventful, except for an early postoperative increase in blood creatinine up to 344 µmol/l and stabilization at this level. The patient was transferred to the vascular surgery department for symptomatic treatment. With infusion therapy, the blood creatinine level decreased to 270 µmol/l. On day 5, the patient was discharged for outpatient follow-up at the place of residence. CONCLUSION: This clinical case demonstrates a possibility of performing endovascular intervention in patients with stage IIIb–IV chronic kidney disease, due to, on the one hand, improvement of endovascular technologies, and, on the other, reduction of the volume of contrast agent used during surgery."

The study aim is to unravel the genetic basis of BAV and its complications through a high-throughput sequencing (HTS) approach and segregation analysis if family members were available. Methods: Fifty-two Italian BAV patients were analyzed by HTS using the Illumina MiSeq platform. Targeted sequencing of 97 genes known to be or plausibly associated with connective tissue disorders or aorthopathy was performed. Thirty-five first-degree relatives of N = 10 probands underwent mutational screening for variants identified in the index cases. Results: HTS identified 194 rare (MAF &lt; 0.01) variants in 63 genes. Regarding previously reported genes, five NOTCH1 variants in four BAV patients, four FBN1 variants in two patients and one GATA5 variant in one patient were identified. Interestingly, among further loci, the possible contribution of PDIA2, LRP1 and CAPN2 was suggested by (a) the increased prevalence of rare genetic variants, independently from their ACMG classification in the whole BAV cohort, and (b) segregation analyses of variants identified in family members. Moreover, the present data also suggest the possible contribution of rare variants to BAV complications, specifically MYLK in aortic dilatation, CAPN2 in BAV calcification and VHL and AGGF1 in valve stenosis. Conclusions: Our results underline clinical and genetic diagnosis complexity in traits considered monogenic, such as BAV, but characterized by variability in disease phenotypic expression (incomplete penetrance), as well as the contribution of different major and modifier genes to the development of complications."

However, a substantial proportion of cardiovascular events occur in individuals with LDL-C levels within the normal range, highlighting the need for additional risk markers. Lipoprotein(a) [Lp(a)] has emerged as an independent and genetically determined cardiovascular risk factor that is not adequately captured by conventional lipid profiling. Elevated Lp(a) levels are associated with an increased risk of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, including coronary artery disease, ischemic stroke, and calcific aortic valve stenosis, and appear to be particularly relevant in the context of premature cardiovascular events. The pathogenicity of Lp(a) is driven by distinct mechanisms that extend beyond cholesterol transport. These include pro-atherogenic, pro-inflammatory, and pro-thrombotic effects mediated largely by oxidized phospholipids carried by the particle and by the structural properties of apolipoprotein(a), which interfere with fibrinolysis. Despite its strong and stable genetic determination, Lp(a) remains underrecognized and inconsistently measured in clinical practice, partly due to historical limitations in assay standardization and reporting. This minireview summarizes current knowledge on the pathophysiological mechanisms underlying elevated Lp(a), discusses its clinical implications for cardiovascular risk assessment, and highlights the importance of standardized Lp(a) measurement in routine practice, particularly in light of emerging Lp(a)-targeted therapies."

Its popularity has led to its use in lower volume institutions, where outcomes are comparable to higher volume centers. This study analyzes procedural volume and outcomes at our institution, compares them with the PARTNER III trial and evaluates complications and patient selection criteria. Design: This was a retrospective descriptive study. Setting: This study was performed at a public, multi-institutional healthcare system featuring an acute care hospital with a level I adult trauma and burn center. Participants: We obtained retrospective data on 37 patients who underwent TAVR in our hospital system in 2022. Data was collected on their outcomes, including mortality, readmission rates and cardiovascular and cerebrovascular complications at 30 days and 1 year. Interventions: No interventions were performed on patients as this was a retrospective study. Measurements and main results: Patient outcomes were compared with PARTNER III trial results. There was no 30-day mortality (versus 1% in the PARTNER III trial) and a 1-year mortality rate of 2.7% (versus 8.5% in the PARTNER III trial). During the procedures, no patients were converted to general anesthesia nor actively bleeding. At 30 days, no patients were readmitted for valve-related issues. Conclusion: This study demonstrates that lower volume healthcare institutions can achieve outcomes comparable/similar to higher volume institutions in specialized procedures like TAVR, challenging the assumption that superior outcomes are tied to institutional size. Our findings highlight the importance of quality, teamwork and individualized care in achieving excellent clinical outcomes, regardless of size."

International normalized ratio (INR) goals for mechanical AVRs can change throughout treatment as risk factors change. Appropriate INR goal selection is crucial as goals that stray from evidence-based recommendations can lead to increased risk of bleeding, thrombosis or unnecessary monitoring. Objective: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the appropriateness of INR goals in patients with mechanical AVRs and identify opportunities for pharmacist-led intervention. Methods: A cross-sectional quality improvement study was conducted at a safety net academic medical center’s outpatient anticoagulation clinic. This quality improvement project was not formally supervised by the Institutional Review Board per their policies. Adult patients with isolated mechanical AVR actively managed on warfarin were included. Pharmacists determined whether INR goals were justified by clinical context and American and European valvular heart disease guidelines. When goals lacked clear justification, pharmacists contacted referring providers to recommend INR goal adjustment. Results: Of 100 identified patients, 81 met eligibility criteria including 24 (29.6%) with On-X valves and 57 (70.4%) with alternative mechanical AVRs. Nearly one-third of patients (23, 29.3%) had INR goals inconsistent with current guidelines. Pharmacist-led outreach resulted in 20 accepted recommendations (87.0%), representing 24.7% of the study population. On-X valve recommendations primarily involved reducing INR targets to 1.5 to 2.0 for patients at least 3 months postsurgery without other risk factors that would constitute a higher INR goal. The most common alternative mechanical valve interventions included increasing INR goals to 2.5 to 3.5 in those with thromboembolic risk factors and decreasing INR goals to 2.0 to 3.0 due to absence of thromboembolic risk factors. Conclusion and Relevance: This stewardship initiative highlights the need for periodic INR goal review, as risk factors in patients with mechanical AVRs can change over time."

The reported incidence is 6–10 per 1 000 live births. Comorbid connective tissue dysplasia (CTD) significantly influences the clinical course of CHD, contributing to structural weakness of cardiac and vascular tissues, elevated risk of postoperative complications, and poorer long-term outcomes. Objective. To synthesise current evidence regarding the clinical features, complications, and management of congenital heart disease in children with concomitant connective tissue dysplasia; to identify key pathophysiological mechanisms and highlight promising diagnostic and therapeutic strategies. Materials and methods. This review analyses global trends in the association between CHD and CTD in the paediatric population. Scientific literature indexed in PubMed, ScienceDirect, and Google Scholar from 2017 to 2024 was systematically evaluated. Results. Current research indicates that molecular alterations in connective tissue components—particularly fibrillin, collagen, and transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) receptors—impair myocardial and vascular remodelling, thereby increasing susceptibility of valves and arterial walls to haemodynamic stress. Children with CTD frequently exhibit valve prolapse with regurgitation, aortic dilatation, aneurysm formation, vascular dissection, and heightened risk of perioperative haemorrhage and infection. These patients are more likely to require repeat surgical procedures and demonstrate delayed wound healing. Well-characterised syndromes—including Marfan, Loeys–Dietz, and Ehlers–Danlos—demonstrate unequivocal cardiovascular involvement. Optimal management mandates a multidisciplinary strategy encompassing early recognition of phenotypic features, comprehensive imaging (echocardiography, cardiac magnetic resonance imaging, angiography), and targeted genetic testing. Regular surveillance of aortic dimensions and valvular function, judicious timing of interventions, and appropriate pharmacological prophylaxis are critical to mitigating severe complications. Conclusions. Connective tissue dysplasia constitutes a significant comorbidity that exacerbates the natural history of congenital heart disease, increases surgical risk, and necessitates individualised therapeutic planning. Phenotypic signs of CTD must be actively sought and integrated into preoperative assessment and surgical decision-making. A coordinated, multidisciplinary approach—supported by advanced imaging, genetic counselling, and longitudinal follow-up—is essential for risk reduction and improved long-term prognosis. Further research into the molecular genetics and pathogenesis of CTD holds promise for early risk stratification and personalised management in children with CHD."

Favorable anatomy includes adequate leaflet length, central jet location, and mitral valve area &gt;4 cm². Technological advances (MitraClip G4, PASCAL Precision) enable treatment of complex anatomies such as flail segments and commissural jets. TEER demonstrates significant symptomatic improvement and reduced hospitalization in high-risk cohorts, with low rates of major complications (SLDA 1.5–5%, leaflet injury ≤2%, device embolization ≤0.7%). Nursing roles encompass preprocedural preparation, intraoperative monitoring, anticoagulation management, and postprocedural surveillance for complications such as tamponade, vascular injury, and residual MR. Conclusion: TEER represents a transformative option for patients unsuitable for surgery, offering durable MR reduction and improved quality of life when applied with rigorous anatomical assessment and multidisciplinary collaboration."

Бузовський,,2025-12-27,Scientific periodicals of Ukraine,"Congenital heart disease (CHD) remains a leading cause of paediatric morbidity and mortality, necessitating early diagnosis and timely surgical intervention. The reported incidence is 6–10 per 1 000 live births. Comorbid connective tissue dysplasia (CTD) significantly influences the clinical course of CHD, contributing to structural weakness of cardiac and vascular tissues, elevated risk of postoperative complications, and poorer long-term outcomes. Objective. To synthesise current evidence regarding the clinical features, complications, and management of congenital heart disease in children with concomitant connective tissue dysplasia; to identify key pathophysiological mechanisms and highlight promising diagnostic and therapeutic strategies. Materials and methods. This review analyses global trends in the association between CHD and CTD in the paediatric population. Scientific literature indexed in PubMed, ScienceDirect, and Google Scholar from 2017 to 2024 was systematically evaluated. Results. Current research indicates that molecular alterations in connective tissue components—particularly fibrillin, collagen, and transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) receptors—impair myocardial and vascular remodelling, thereby increasing susceptibility of valves and arterial walls to haemodynamic stress. Children with CTD frequently exhibit valve prolapse with regurgitation, aortic dilatation, aneurysm formation, vascular dissection, and heightened risk of perioperative haemorrhage and infection. These patients are more likely to require repeat surgical procedures and demonstrate delayed wound healing. Well-characterised syndromes—including Marfan, Loeys–Dietz, and Ehlers–Danlos—demonstrate unequivocal cardiovascular involvement. Optimal management mandates a multidisciplinary strategy encompassing early recognition of phenotypic features, comprehensive imaging (echocardiography, cardiac magnetic resonance imaging, angiography), and targeted genetic testing. Regular surveillance of aortic dimensions and valvular function, judicious timing of interventions, and appropriate pharmacological prophylaxis are critical to mitigating severe complications. Conclusions. Connective tissue dysplasia constitutes a significant comorbidity that exacerbates the natural history of congenital heart disease, increases surgical risk, and necessitates individualised therapeutic planning. Phenotypic signs of CTD must be actively sought and integrated into preoperative assessment and surgical decision-making. A coordinated, multidisciplinary approach—supported by advanced imaging, genetic counselling, and longitudinal follow-up—is essential for risk reduction and improved long-term prognosis. Further research into the molecular genetics and pathogenesis of CTD holds promise for early risk stratification and personalised management in children with CHD."
OpenAlex,valvular heart disease,Bilateral Carcinoid Heart Disease in Advanced Functional Small Bowel Neuroendocrine Tumor Without Intracardiac Shunt: A Clinical Conundrum Case Report,Stefano H Byer; Mashkurul Haque; Ola Abdelkarim; Christian Anderson; Udhayvir Singh Grewal,10.1093/ehjcr/ytaf679,2025-12-26,European Heart Journal - Case Reports,"Abstract Background Carcinoid heart disease (CHD) is a known complication of advanced functional neuroendocrine tumors (NETs), almost exclusively affecting right-sided cardiac valves. Left-sided involvement is rare and usually attributed to intracardiac shunting or pulmonary sources of serotonin. This case report highlights a rare presentation of CHD involving left- and right-sided valves in the absence of an anatomic shunt or bronchopulmonary NET. Case Presentation A 67-year-old woman with a longstanding, functional, small bowel Grade 1 NET and metastatic liver and peritoneal disease presented with worsening dyspnea and peripheral edema. She had a 10-year disease history, previously managed with debulking surgery, somatostatin analogs, peptide receptor radionuclide therapy (PRRT), and everolimus. Echocardiography and cardiac MRI demonstrated extensive left- and right-sided valvular involvement with severe mitral regurgitation, moderate aortic and pulmonic regurgitation, and mild tricuspid regurgitation, yet without intracardiac shunt. An elevated Qp/Qs ratio of 2.6 was attributed to severe left-sided valvular regurgitation. The patient improved on diuretic therapy and was referred for surgical evaluation of valve replacement prior to additional systemic treatment. Discussion This case illustrates an atypical presentation of bilateral carcinoid valvulopathy in the absence of intracardiac shunting, likely due to overwhelming systemic serotonin from tumor burden. Although serotonin is typically inactivated in the lungs, extensive exposure may surpass this protective mechanism. The potential role of SSRIs remains inconclusive. Multidisciplinary coordination is essential for optimizing cardiac and oncologic outcomes, especially when systemic therapy such as PRRT is considered. Conclusion Left- and right-sided CHD may develop in patients with small bowel NETs even without anatomic shunting. High tumor burden and systemic serotonin exposure may override pulmonary inactivation, leading to left-sided involvement. Early recognition and multidisciplinary care are critical for effective management."

Early detection of abnormal cardiac structure may facilitate timely intervention and improve clinical outcomes. Methods: This cross-sectional descriptive study analyzed echocardiographic data from 66 ESRD patients in a hemodialysis unit between March 15th, 2020, and December 31th, 2021. A total of 66 patients were included. Two-dimensional echocardiographic parameters were assessed to evaluate cardiac structure and function. Results: The mean age of the patients was 63.5 years (57.3–72). Among the 66 patients, 36 (54.5%) were male, and 30 (45.5%) were female. Hypertension was present in 83.3% of patients, while 43.9% had diabetes. Left ventricular (LV) dilation was diagnosed in 7.6% of patients, LV systolic dysfunction in 16.7%, and LV hypertrophy (LVH) in 54.5%. Diastolic dysfunction was detected in 44 patients (66.7%) and valvular heart disease was observed in 20 patients (30.3%). Conclusions: Echocardiography plays a crucial role in identifying cardiac abnormalities in patients with ESRD. The high prevalence of LVH and diastolic dysfunction underscores the need for routine cardiac evaluation in this population. Future research should focus on long-term follow-up to better understand the progression of cardiac dysfunction and its impact on patient outcomes."

However, long-term durability remains limited by structural valve degeneration (SVD). Case report A 70-year-old male presented with severe heart failure 4 years after bioprosthetic mitral and aortic valve replacement. Imaging confirmed SVD affecting both valves, necessitating high-risk redo surgery. Postoperatively, the patient developed profound systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) to cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB), refractory to vasopressors and steroids, and died within 24 hours. Discussion Further investigations revealed elevated isolated anti-cardiolipin IgM antibodies, raising suspicion of autoimmune-mediated valve thrombosis as a contributor to this case of early SVD. Conclusion This case highlights the importance of thorough diagnostic evaluation in cases of early SVD, the need to individualise anticoagulation strategies in at-risk patients, and serves as a critical reminder of the serious inflammatory complications that can occur post-surgery."

Wright; Fátima Coronado,10.1177/15409996251403974,2025-12-23,Journal of Women s Health,"Background: Cardiovascular diseases are among the leading causes of maternal morbidity and mortality in the United States. During 2010–2020, 1 in 10 severe maternal morbidities (SMMs) during delivery hospitalization was heart disease (HD)-related. This report synthesizes science, including methodologies, challenges, and opportunities, and summarizes national estimates on HD during pregnancy, focusing on congenital heart disease (CHD), cardiomyopathies (CM), valvular heart disease (VHD), arrhythmias (ARR), and heart failure (HF). Methods and Results: We analyzed large nationwide databases, including the National Inpatient Sample and the Nationwide Readmissions Database. The prevalence of HD complicating deliveries ranges from approximately 20–40 cases per 10,000 deliveries. Increasing trends were observed in CHD, ARR, and HF. HF, particularly peripartum CM, is a leading cause of adverse maternal outcomes, including in-hospital mortality and SMM. VHD prevalence has declined, whereas ARR has become the most prevalent HD during pregnancy hospitalizations. Significant gaps exist due to inconsistent definitions and methodologies, limiting comparability and clinical utility. Proposed solutions include adopting standardized definitions, developing a core outcome set, improving data quality through structured documentation and standardized data models, and using validated algorithms and indices. Collaboration among multidisciplinary teams is essential to enhance research quality. Conclusion: The efforts aligning definitions of HD, outcomes, and indices with public health measures and initiatives present an opportunity to create a unifying framework that connects patient-level data to system-wide improvements. This integration helps ensure that advances in methodology translate into better care delivery, billing accuracy, research quality, and public health surveillance, and ultimately enhance outcomes for pregnant women with HD."

OpenAlex,valvular heart disease,Right ventricular function as a predictor of morbidity and mortality in post-heart valve surgery,Mohammad Risandi Priatama; Sony Hilal Wicaksono; Arinto Bono Adji Hardjosworo; Ario Soeryo Kuncoro; Dian Yaniarti Hasanah; Damba Dwisepto Aulia Sakti; Amiliana M Soesanto,10.4081/monaldi.2025.3447,2025-12-22,Monaldi Archives for Chest Disease,"Valvular heart disease (VHD) remains a significant global health concern, with mortality rates ranging from 1% to 15%. In Indonesia, the most prevalent form of VHD is rheumatic heart disease, which is associated with a hospital mortality rate of 6.5% following valve surgery. Previous studies have shown that, post-surgery, morbidity rates remain high: 30.8% of patients experience prolonged intensive care unit stays (&gt;96 hours), 30.67% require extended mechanical ventilation (&gt;24 hours), and 52% need prolonged use of inotropic agents (≥14 days). Right ventricular (RV) dysfunction is closely associated with these three morbidity parameters, as well as with 30-day postoperative mortality. However, limited research in Indonesia has explored the most effective parameters for evaluating RV function as a predictor of postoperative morbidity and mortality following heart valve surgery. This prospective cohort study was conducted at the Department of Cardiology and Vascular Medicine, Universitas Indonesia, and the National Cardiovascular Center Harapan Kita (NCCHK) from October 2023 to July 2024. During this period, 174 patients with VHD who underwent surgical valve replacement were enrolled. After applying exclusion criteria, 26 patients were excluded, resulting in a final study population of 148 patients. All participants underwent preoperative echocardiographic assessment of RV function, performed by two operators within 1 week prior to surgery. Among the 148 subjects, females comprised the majority (60.1%). Atrial fibrillation (AF) was the most common comorbidity, affecting 62.8% of the cohort. The most frequent morbidity outcome was prolonged mechanical ventilation, observed in 27.7% of cases. Of the total mortality events, 70% were cardiac-related, while the remaining 30% were due to non-cardiac causes. Multivariate analysis revealed that a preoperative S′&lt;10 cm/s was significantly associated with cardiac-related mortality [odds ratio (OR) 3.46; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.01-11.87; p=0.049]. Additionally, a preoperative S′&lt;11 cm/s was significantly associated with overall clinical outcomes, including both morbidity and all-cause mortality (OR 3.08; 95% CI 1.43-6.65; p=0.004). In conclusion, S′, an echocardiographic parameter reflecting RV function, demonstrates potential as a predictive marker for postoperative morbidity and mortality in patients undergoing heart valve surgery."
OpenAlex,valvular heart disease,Progressive and concordant alterations in transcriptional and gut microbiota across aortic valve calcification severity,Jue Wang; Ruihang Qu; Weicheng Huang; Yue Chen; Yun Li; Qi Lin; Ziji Wu; Hangfei Yan; Tingting Yu; Chiyin Wang; Xinlei Ren; Xi Wang; Jinyu Wu,10.1128/spectrum.02137-25,2025-12-22,Microbiology Spectrum,"ABSTRACT Calcific aortic valve disease (CAVD) is a common disorder associated with substantial morbidity and mortality. Although the gut microbiome has complex associations with cardiovascular disease, its variation across the calcification spectrum in CAVD remains poorly defined. We profiled aortic-valve transcriptomes from 31 patients spanning graded calcification and paired these with matched stool microbiome profiles. We identified subtle yet widespread transcriptional changes in mild CAVD (m-CAVD), consistent with a progressive relationship between calcification burden and gene-expression remodeling. At the community level, the gut microbiome in m-CAVD exhibited an intermediate configuration between non- and higher-calcification profiles, suggesting an early shift in the gut ecosystem along the disease continuum. At the genus level, we identified 11 taxa associated with stage; notably, Anaerococcus increased with calcification burden, whereas Rheinheimera declined across stages. These results refine the pathophysiology landscape of CAVD by connecting stage-dependent valvular transcriptional changes with coordinated shifts in the gut microbiome and indicate that early, microbiome-targeted interventions may be promising. IMPORTANCE Calcific aortic valve disease is a common valvular heart disease. Due to the difficulty in sampling arterial calcified tissues, research on the interaction between their gene expression and the gut has been limited. In this study, by analyzing the transcriptional profiles of calcified aortic valve tissues from patients with different levels of calcification and the characteristics of their corresponding gut microbiota, we identified consistent features between lesion gene expression and gut microbiota variation. This provides important evidence for the association between the gut microbiota and disease development stages, offering a new perspective for understanding disease progression and early intervention."

However, information regarding the factors influencing cardiovascular events in neonates and mothers within 6 months postpartum is limited. This study aimed to identify predictors of adverse maternal and neonatal outcomes in pregnancies of women with pre-existing heart disease. Methods: The study conducted a retrospective cross-sectional analysis of all pregnancies with a history of heart disease from January 2017 to January 2024, using secondary data from medical records at Dr M. Djamil Padang Hospital, Indonesia. We analysed the data using the χ2/Fisher’s exact test and logistic regression. Results: A total of 110 pregnant women with heart diseases were hospitalised during the study period, with an average age of 30.52 ± 6.00 years. The most common types of heart disease were valvular heart disease (28%), chronic hypertension (24%) and congenital heart disease (23%). In 27.2% of cases, adverse maternal outcomes included mortality (10%), heart failure (8.2%), arrhythmia (4.5%), rehospitalisation (3.6%) and thromboembolic event (0.9%). Meanwhile, 57.3% of cases had neonatal adverse outcomes, including mortality (5.4%), low Apgar score (16.4%), prematurity (28.2%), low birthweight (6.4%) and congenital heart disease (0.9%). The multivariate analysis discovered that moderate-to-severe left heart obstruction (OR 14.184; 95% CI [2.725–73.836]; p=0.002) and reduced ejection fraction &lt;40% (OR 16.211; 95% CI [1.712–153.507]; p=0.015) were the main factors that led to adverse maternal outcomes.

Conclusion: This study revealed that moderate-severe left heart obstruction and reduced ejection fraction &lt;40% were the most significant factors influencing adverse maternal outcomes. Meanwhile, cyanotic congenital heart disease was the most important determinant of adverse neonatal outcomes."
OpenAlex,valvular heart disease,Features of immune response to xenogeneic tissues of cardiac valves and patches: Review of literature,A. V. Shabaldin; A. V. Blinova; A. V. Evtushenko,10.15789/1563-0625-foi-3159,2025-12-20,Medical Immunology (Russia),"Global studies show that valvular heart disease still takes one of the leading places in the structure of mortality from cardiovascular diseases, being among the major causes of heart failure, including those among the employed population. Xenogeneic tissues are widely used in cardiac surgery, both in biological prosthetic heart valves, and as vascular and intracardiac patches. Modern chemical methods of xenogenic tissue treatment aimed at elimination of its immunogenicity but they do not, however, completely remove xenoantigens from the tissues. The residual carbohydrate antigens are thought to be a trigger of immune response against the animal xenotissues. At the same time, the role of immune response to xenogeneic antigens for induction of inflammation, valve dysfunction, and calcification are under discussion. The aim of this review was to summarize the research data on immune response to xenogeneic tissue implanted into the heart, and to find tools of preventing this immune conflict. Modification of pericardium of large animals by various methods does not entirely remove carbohydrate epitopes from extracellular matrix and cell membranes, which are recognized by pre-existing antibodies of M and G classes. The highly dynamic functioning of xenogeneic biological prostheses increases their antigenicity by reducing the primary cross-linking of extracellular matrix and activating the alternative complement pathway associated with adsorption iC3b complement component on xenogeneic tissue, serving as an opsonin for micro- and macrophages. The inflammatory endotypes of individual patients may be genetically determined by increased synthesis of certain cytokines. In particular, rheumatic heart disease, as a basis for the disorders of mitral heart valves, is characterized by an increase in TNFα, IFNγ and IL-6. Any of these cytokines may be targets for biological therapies aimed at limiting the constitutional inflammatory endotype. The OMICs technologies applied to various studies of biological degradation of xenogeneic heart valve prostheses, their implantation, and wide clinical examination of patients, may help us to find novel variants of immune-inflammatory endotypes leading to dysfunction of bioprostheses, and to identify target molecules for potential inhibition of antixenogeneic immune response."

This study aimed to assess the predictive value of the age–creatinine–ejection fraction (ACEF) score for NOAF in STEMI patients. Methods We retrospectively analyzed 951 STEMI patients who underwent primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) at out tertiary center between 2020 and 2023. Patients with prior atrial fibrillation (AF), AF on admission, cardiogenic shock, heart failure, significant valvular disease, or failed PCI were excluded. Clinical, laboratory, and echocardiographic data were collected, and ACEF scores were calculated. NOAF was defined as any AF episode during hospitalization in patients without prior AF. The optimal ACEF cutoff was determined using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis (Youden’s index), and multivariate logistic regression identified independent predictors of NOAF. Results NOAF occurred in 63 patients (6.6%). These patients were older, more often female, and had lower systolic blood pressure, lower left ventricular ejection fraction, and higher C-reactive protein and creatinine levels (all p &lt; 0.05). In-hospital major adverse cardiac events (MACE) and mortality were significantly higher in the NOAF group than patients in without NOAF group (22.2% vs. 6.2%, and 15.9% vs. 4.3%, respectively; p &lt; 0.001). The ACEF score was significantly higher in patients with NOAF (1.73 ± 0.74 vs. 1.42 ± 0.64, p &lt; 0.001). ROC analysis showed an area under curve (AUC) of 0.643 (95% CI: 0.571–0.715; p &lt; 0.001). An ACEF score ≥1.32 predicted NOAF with 73% sensitivity and 55.6% specificity. In multivariate analysis, ACEF remained an independent predictor of NOAF (OR ~1.5, p = 0.02), but among its components, only age was independently associated with NOAF (OR ~1.03 per year, p = 0.01). Conclusions The ACEF score modestly predicts NOAF in STEMI patients, but its predictive power only incremental to age alone. Further studies are warranted for this field."

Peloso,10.1038/s41588-025-02417-6,2025-12-19,Nature Genetics,"Abstract Aortic stenosis (AS) is a common valvular heart disease and has no pharmacological therapies. We performed a multi-ancestry genome-wide association meta-analysis of 86,864 AS cases among 2,853,408 individuals, discovering 241 autosomal independent risk loci and 3 X chromosome risk loci. We additionally performed sex-stratified and ancestry-stratified genome-wide association studies (GWASs), identifying an additional 5 sex-specific risk loci, 11 risk loci in European ancestry individuals and 1 risk locus in African ancestry individuals. We also performed a transcriptome-wide association study using expression quantitative trait loci from human aortic valves, discovering 54 new genes for which genetically predicted expression influences the risk of AS. We then generated a new polygenic risk score for AS. Finally, we performed gene silencing experiments targeting biologically relevant genes identified by our GWAS. Silencing of CMKLR1 and LTBP4 in human valvular interstitial cells substantially decreased mineralization, implicating a role for polyunsaturated fatty acids and transforming growth factor β signaling in AS."
