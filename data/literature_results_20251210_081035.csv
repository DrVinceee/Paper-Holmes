We aimed to identify frequency and course of VHD stages as well as determinants of VHD progression in the general population.
The STAAB cohort study (Characteristics and Course of Heart Failure STAges A/B and Determinants of Progression) recruited a prestratified, population-based sample of residents (30-79 years) from Würzburg, Germany, without self-reported heart failure. Participants underwent baseline transthoracic echocardiography (2013-2017) with follow-up after 3 years (2017-2021). VHD progression was defined as an increase in stage or valve intervention.
Of 4943 participants (mean age 55 years, 53% women) VHD stages were: 24% no VHD, 54% stage A, 21% stage B and 0.3% stage C/D. Prevalence of VHD increased with advancing age. Among 3833 participants who were followed for a median of 34 months, 10% in stage A and 1.3% in stage B progressed. Progression rates were highest in participants aged 60-69 and 70-79 years, at rates of 15% and 25% for stage A and 1.6% and 2.6% for stage B, respectively. In multivariable age-adjusted models, elevated E/e' predicted progression from stage A, while elevated N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) predicted progression from stage B. Continuous analysis of aortic stenosis progression showed associations with older age, higher body mass index, diabetes and baseline peak velocity.
In a large community cohort, VHD was common, especially at older ages, and about 11% of individuals progressed within 3 years. Echocardiographic indices (E/e') and the biomarker NT-proBNP emerged as stage-specific predictors, supporting their potential role, along with age and metabolic factors, in identifying individuals at higher risk for progression."

We aimed to characterise metabolic profiles in patients with severe AS before and after aortic valve replacement (AVR) and their association with functional status, structural remodelling and mortality. Patients with symptomatic, severe AS before (n=143) and 1-year after (n=113) AVR underwent cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR), serum cardiac biomarkers, and 6-minute walk test. Resting non-fasting plasma samples underwent targeted nuclear magnetic resonance for fatty acids (FA), branched chain amino acids (BCAAs), glycolysis-related metabolites, and ketones. Lower FA and BCAA concentrations, but not glycolysis metabolites or ketones, correlated with greater myocardial mass and focal fibrosis, NT-proBNP, TnT and 6-minute walk distance. After 10.5 years of follow-up (66/143 deaths), lower FAs and BCAAs, but not ketones were independently associated with higher mortality risk (P<0.05). At 1-year after AVR, FAs had decreased compared to baseline. In conclusion, reduced serum FA and BCAA concentrations are cardiac, maladaptive, prognostic metabolic changes to AS, which are not reversible after AVR. Whether these markers may be used to guide the timing of AVR or provide metabolic risk stratification remains to be evaluated by future research. Condensed Abstract: In patients with aortic stenosis (AS) systemic metabolomics and their association with myocardial remodeling and outcome after aortic valve replacement (AVR) are largely unknown. We show that in severe AS low levels of unsaturated fatty acids and branched-chained amino acids correlate with higher mortality risk, and biomarkers measured by cardiac magnetic resonance, serum, and functional incapacity, and do not increase after AVR. This may provide an alternate approach to risk stratification using blood biomarkers or guide targeted therapies to myocardial energetics before or after AVR."

To investigate the association of obstructive CAD with clinical outcomes and health status among patients with symptomatic severe AS undergoing TAVR.
This post hoc analysis of the investigator-initiated, multicenter SCOPE I (Safety and Efficacy of the Symetis ACURATE Neo/TF Compared to the Edwards SAPIEN 3 Bioprosthesis for Transcatheter Aortic Valve Implantation by Transfemoral Approach) randomized clinical trial was conducted at 20 tertiary heart centers in Europe from February 8, 2017, to February 2, 2019, with follow-up through 3 years. Data were analyzed from February 17 through August 13, 2025.
Presence vs absence of obstructive CAD, defined as greater than 50% stenosis in at least 1 major epicardial coronary vessel.
Parameters of interest included vital and patient-reported disease-specific health status (Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire [KCCQ] scores, ranging from 0 to 100, with higher numbers indicating better health status), and clinical efficacy according to Valve Academic Research Consortium (VARC)-3 definitions. Analyses were conducted using the as treated population.
Of 732 patients with symptomatic severe AS undergoing TAVR (mean [SD] age, 82 [4] years; 416 [56.8%] female), obstructive CAD was identified in 373 (51.0%), 144 (38.6%) of whom underwent elective percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) during the periprocedural period. At 3 years after TAVR, there were no statistically significant differences in patient-reported health status (eg, median [IQR] baseline overall KCCQ scores with CAD, 54.2 [40.3-69.8] vs without CAD, 55.2 [38.5-72.9] and at 3-year follow-up with CAD, 79.7 [64.4-90.6] vs without CAD, 82.3 [68.2-91.7]), mortality (all-cause death: 88 of 373 [24.7%] vs 76 of 359 [22.3%], adjusted hazard ratio, [HR], 0.97 [95% CI, 0.66-1.43]; cardiovascular death: 59 of 373 [17.6%] vs 51 of 359 [15.5%], adjusted HR, 0.87 [95% CI, 0.54-1.42]), and clinical efficacy of TAVR (163 of 313 [52.1%] vs 159 of 298 [53.4%]; adjusted risk ratio, 1.10 [95% CI, 0.92-1.32]) between patients with vs without obstructive CAD. Having (vs not having) obstructive CAD was associated with a numerically albeit not statistically significantly higher risk of myocardial infarction (18 of 372 [5.5%] vs 3 of 359 [1.1%]; adjusted HR, 3.83 [95% CI, 0.96-15.31]). Periprocedural PCI among patients with obstructive CAD did not improve clinical outcomes, patient-reported health status, nor the integrated end points of clinical outcomes and quality of life measures.
In this post hoc analysis of SCOPE I, patients with obstructive CAD who underwent TAVR had no statistically significant differences in survival, patient-reported health status, or VARC-3 clinical efficacy compared with patients without CAD through 3 years of follow-up. Findings suggest that a tailored approach may be essential in the treatment of TAVR candidates with severe AS and CAD.

We report the use of distal coronary pressure (Pd) above proximal aortic pressure (Pa) during the early expansion period as a visual dichotomous marker (negative expansion resistance, NER) for rapid clinical decision-making. Simultaneous pressure and velocity signals were used to calculate instantaneous wave-free ratio (iFR), fractional flow reserve (FFR), hyperemic stenosis resistance (hSR), and to identify the NER. NER was defined as the Pd > Pa during the early-expansion period, which refers to early-decompression of coronary circulation marked by pressure decay (dP/dt < 0) coinciding the time-window of reduced ejection phase of systole to early diastole. Classification performance of NER was evaluated against iFR, FFR and hSR. Out of 475 lesions with mean diameter stenosis of 61% ± 16% from 388 patients with chronic coronary syndrome (CCS), 46%(217/475) exhibited the NER-phenomenon. Of these, 96% (209/217) had an iFR above 0.89(NPV = 0.96[95%CI 93-98] PPV = 0.47[95%CI 41-54]) indicating hemodynamically non-significant lesions. 94%(204/217) of the NER( +) lesions had an hSR below 0.80(NPV = 0.94 [95%CI 90-97] PPV = 0.36[95%CI 30-42]), and 88%(191/217) had an FFR above 0.80 (NPV = 0.88[95%CI 83-92] PPV = 0.53[95%CI 46-59]), indicating non-flow limiting lesions. Of 8 lesions with NER despite an abnormal iFR, only 1 had abnormal hSR, whereas 7 had normal hSR. Of 162 lesions with abnormal FFR, iFR identified 53 (33%) as 'normal' whereas NER was present in 26 (16%) of these cases.NER was associated with instantaneously stronger coronary decompression wave(8.0 ± 11.2 vs 5.5 ± 10.1 10.kW.m-2.s-2 p:0.016) and higher flow acceleration(195 ± 204 vs 106 ± 182 cm.s-2 p < 0.001). In conclusion, the NER, visually recognized by resting pressure tracings, rules out flow-limiting lesions in CCS with high certainty, offering a simple first-line evaluation for clinical decision-making, and warrants prospective clinical studies."

Patients with WS are at increased risk of perioperative sudden cardiac death, necessitating thorough cardiovascular assessment. Additionally, craniofacial anomalies such as micrognathia and retrognathia may lead to difficult airway management and often require awake intubation. However, awake intubation and hospitalization can be distressing for patients with WS due to their developmental challenges. These facts indicate the importance of identifying during the preoperative assessment for ambulatory general anesthesia those at low risk for cardiovascular complications and airway difficulties. This case report details the successful anesthetic management of a 9-year-old boy with WS undergoing ambulatory general anesthesia for dental treatment by maintaining a balance between myocardial oxygen supply and demand to minimize cardiovascular fluctuations and by paying careful attention to managing his airway. Our case highlights the feasibility and safety of ambulatory general anesthesia for patients with WS, minimizing hospitalization stress and ensuring patient safety."

HCM phenotype cases were defined as cats with echocardiographic findings of a maximum left ventricular wall thickness (LVWT) ≥6 mm on at least one presentation. TMT was defined as an increased LVWT ≥6 mm on at least two presentations, a subsequent decrease in LVWT of more than 25% within 6 months, no subsequent increase in left atrial-to-aortic root ratio (LA/Ao) ≥20% from baseline, and a fractional shortening ≤30%. A total of 145 cats had HCM phenotypes. Among cats that underwent serial echocardiography (n = 53), 16 were diagnosed with TMT and 34 with HCM. At presentation, the maximum LVWT was 8.3 ± 1.7 mm in cats with TMT, and decreased to 5.4 ± 0.9 mm after a median of 3.5 months [1-6 months]. Two cats initially classified as TMT were later identified as TMT on HCM based on persistent LV thickening, and all cats with TMT survived until the time of publication. The prevalence of TMT may be higher than expected when including asymptomatic TMT and TMT on HCM. Clinicians should be aware of the possibility of dynamic changes in myocardial thickness in cats."

However, the interpretation of variants, especially those of uncertain significance (VUSs), remains challenging for laboratories and clinicians. In April 2024, the ClinGen Cardiomyopathy Variant Curation Expert Panel (VCEP) adapted the ACMG/AMP criteria for eight of the sarcomeric genes (MYH7, MYBPC3, TNNI3, TNNT2, TPM1, ACTC1, MYL2, and MYL3), providing a refined framework for variant interpretation in these genes. This retrospective study re-evaluated 69 VUSs identified in 84 HCM patients between 2017 and 2024, aiming to resolve uncertainty and reduce the VUS rate.
Here, two groups of curators reinterpreted variants with the most recent data using the Cardiomyopathy VCEP specifications until a consensus was reached. To streamline the process, we created a semiautomated decision support tool based on these gene-specific rules.
The application of the Cardiomyopathy VCEP specifications resulted in the reclassification of 17.4% (N = 12/69, 95% CI: 10.2%-28.0%) of VUS, whereas the new data alone were not sufficient. Out of the reclassified variants, 91.7% (N = 11/12) were downgraded to benignity (involving 17 patients), and 8.3% were upgraded to pathogenicity (involving one patient), with a mean reclassification time of 68.3 months, corresponding to 5.7 years. The most applied criteria were related to population (PM2 = 55%; BA1/BS1 = 16%), bioinformatic prediction (PP3 = 45%; BP4 = 25%), and critical domains (PM1 = 21%). However, most codes suffer from a lack of evidence (segregation data, functional assays, and case-control studies). When comparing this curation with classifications in public databases, 13.3% (N = 8/60) and 16.2% (N = 11/68) of variants listed as having inconclusive significance in ClinVar and CardioClassifier were, respectively, reclassified in this study.
Using gene-specific ACMG/AMP criteria reduces the rate of VUS, increasing diagnostic yield, and informing clinical management in the context of HCM. Nonetheless, ongoing efforts to generate evidence and promote standardization remain essential to improve variant interpretation."

Patients with cirrhosis frequently experience exacerbated AS symptoms due to the hyperdynamic circulatory state induced by portal hypertension, which masks early AS signs, resulting in delayed diagnosis. The coexistence of AS and liver disease significantly complicates management, particularly for those awaiting liver transplantation (LT), where untreated AS can increase perioperative morbidity and mortality. This review examines the pathophysiology, clinical manifestations, and management of AS in cirrhotic patients, with a focus on implications for LT candidates. Available treatment options, including surgical aortic valve replacement and transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR), are discussed, with TAVR emerging as a preferred approach due to favorable outcomes in high-risk patients. We also explore the potential role of TAVR as a bridge to LT, with case reports showing promising, albeit anecdotal, success in restoring LT candidacy. Limitations in current perioperative risk assessment tools, which inadequately address the unique risks faced by cirrhotic patients undergoing cardiac procedures, highlight the need for multi-disciplinary care and further research to improve outcomes of patients with concomitant end-stage liver disease and AS."

While certain LMNA gene mutations are known to cause cardiomyopathy and conduction system disease, severe early-onset calcific valvular heart disease is not conventionally considered a typical feature of MADA. This report describes two brothers from a consanguineous Han Chinese family who presented with classical MADA phenotypes alongside severe, early-onset cardiac valvular calcification. Genetic investigation revealed that both affected brothers carried a homozygous missense mutation, c.785A > G (p.Glu262Gly), in the LMNA gene. The elder brother, aged 41, successfully underwent transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) due to severe aortic valve stenosis. This finding represents the first association, to our knowledge, between the homozygous LMNA c.785A > G (p.Glu262Gly) mutation and significant severe early-onset cardiac valvular calcification manifesting as a prominent feature within the MADA phenotype, thus expanding the clinical spectrum associated with MADA and this specific LMNA variant. This case highlights a potentially underrecognized cardiovascular manifestation in MADA patients and underscores the importance of comprehensive cardiac assessment in affected individuals, particularly those from consanguineous families."

Among valvular manifestations associated with APS, mitral regurgitation (MR) is the most common, followed by aortic regurgitation. Surgical interventions for APS-related valvular diseases carry high perioperative morbidity and mortality. There are no established guidelines regarding the surgical management of APS-related MR.
A 46-year-old man underwent mitral valve repair for severe MR. Histopathological examination of the vegetation on the mitral valve revealed nonbacterial thrombotic endocarditis, and in combination with laboratory findings, the MR was diagnosed as associated with APS. Leaflet thickening and fusion progressed postoperatively, leading to moderate-to-severe MR and mitral stenosis within 2 years.
In cases where MR is the initial presentation of APS, preoperative diagnosis of APS can be challenging. Detailed, frame-by-frame transesophageal echocardiographic evaluation may aid in the preoperative identification of subtle valvular abnormalities suggestive of APS. When thrombocytopenia and a prolonged activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT) are identified during preoperative evaluation for valvular heart disease, tests for lupus anticoagulant, anticardiolipin antibody, and anti-β2 glycoprotein I antibody should be performed, and consultation with hematologists is recommended. Valve repair for MR associated with APS, which preserves valvular tissue that may become diseased in the future, is likely to result in poor outcomes."

Moreover, limited evidence exists regarding the outcomes of patients with very LG severe AS following transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI).
We aimed to elucidate the prognosis of patients with very LG severe AS after TAVI and the influence of flow status.
Data were retrospectively collected from the OCEAN-TAVI multicenter registry in Japan, including patients with severe AS who underwent TAVI.
In total, 7103 patients were classified into three groups based on their baseline mean pressure gradient (MPG): very LG (MPG ≤ 20 mmHg), LG (20 < MPG < 40 mmHg), and high-gradient (HG) (MPG ≥ 40 mmHg). The primary endpoint was a composite of all-cause mortality and hospitalization for heart failure. During a median follow-up period of 741 days, the composite endpoint was reached in 2081 patients. Patients with very LG severe AS had a higher prevalence of comorbidities. Kaplan-Meier analysis showed that very LG severe AS was associated with significantly lower event-free survival compared to that with LG and HG severe AS. Multivariable Cox regression analysis identified very LG severe AS as an independent poor prognostic indicator, regardless of the flow state. Moreover, within the very LG severe AS group, a low body mass index and myocardial infarction history were associated with worse outcomes.
This study indicates that patients with very LG severe AS have worse prognoses compared to those with LG or HG severe AS following TAVI, regardless of the flow state."

Diastolic dysfunction (DD) has been reported in up to 54.4 % of TAVR patients (predominantly grade 1) and severe (grade 3) DD in ∼13.4 % in prior cohorts and predicts poor outcomes. N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-pro-BNP), a marker of ventricular stress, shows promise in enhancing risk assessment. This study evaluates NT-pro-BNP's utility in detecting DD and predicting outcomes in severe AS patients with preserved EF undergoing TAVR.
This retrospective study included 1594 patients with severe AS (aortic valve area < 1 cm2) and EF ≥50 % undergoing TAVR at Cleveland Clinic (2016-2020). Of these, 784 had complete echocardiographic DD data. Pre- and post-TAVR NT-pro-BNP levels, clinical, and echocardiographic parameters were analyzed. DD was classified using Mitral valve (MV) E/e', tricuspid regurgitation (TR) velocity, and left atrial volume index (LAVi). The Youden Index determined the optimal NT-pro-BNP cut-off, with outcomes assessed via Kaplan-Meier and Cox regression analyses.
NT-pro-BNP correlated with DD severity, with a cut-off of 802 pg/ml (sensitivity 62.3 %, specificity 54.1 %) identified. Higher NT-pro-BNP tertiles were linked to worse baseline characteristics (e.g., NYHA III/IV 65.7 %-82.5 %, p = 0.02) and echocardiographic DD markers (e.g., LAVi 37.61-50.14 ml/m2, p < 0.001). Post-TAVR, NT-pro-BNP >802 pg/ml predicted increased mortality, heart failure hospitalizations, and prolonged length of stay (p < 0.001), with Cox regression confirming NT-pro-BNP as an independent predictor (OR 1.645, 95 % CI: 1.244-2.174).
NT-proBNP should be considered a complementary biomarker of DD and predicts adverse outcomes in severe AS patients with preserved EF undergoing TAVR, supporting its integration into pre-procedural risk stratification to optimize management."

Currently available lipid-lowering pharmacotherapies have limited effects on elevated levels of Lp(a), and several new therapies are in development to lower Lp(a).
This article reviews the novel therapies in development to reduce Lp(a) in patients with elevated levels. These were identified by a PubMed search and mainly focus on the drugs that are at an advanced stage of development.
The N-acetylgalactosamine (GalNAc)-conjugated antisense oligonucleotide (ASO) pelacarsen and the small-interfering RNA (siRNA) agents olpasiran, lepodisiran, and zerlasiran have all been shown to be safe and effective in lowering Lp(a) levels between 80% and almost 100%. Pelacarsen, olpasiran, and lepodisiran are being tested in phase 3 cardiovascular outcome studies, and the first results may be available in 2026. Muvalaplin is a small molecule given orally once daily and reduces Lp(a) by up to 65%. It is also being assessed in a cardiovascular outcome study. It will be essential to identify what baseline level of Lp(a) is needed, and what degree of Lp(a) lowering is required to produce a cardiovascular benefit and whether aggressive lowering of Lp(a) has any adverse effects."

The appraisal domains included objectives and study endpoints; selected non-inferiority (NI) margins; adequacy of follow-up for late events; statistical analysis plans and handling of crossovers/missing data; consistency of surgical comparators; and prespecified sub-groups.
Several major concerns were identified: (1) co-primary safety/efficacy composites mix hard adverse events (death, stroke) with softer outcomes, with rehospitalization likely to dominate; (2) limited duration primary follow-up (30 days/1 year), with only optional survaillance beyond 5 years, inadequate for durability and late hazards; (3) wide NI margins (7%-8%) that could accept clinically meaningful inferiority; (4) an unclear statistical analysis plan; (5) a device-specific TAVI arm versus heterogeneous SAVR comparator; and (6) up to 25% bicuspid anatomy without stratified randomization or powered analyses. Collectively, these choices markedly increase the risks of type I error, and misinterpretation in a population with likely crossing hazard curves and a long median LE comparable to that of the age-matched general population after SAVR.
In order to generate guideline-informing evidence for extending TAVI to younger patients with severe AS, the trial should prioritise hard adverse endpoints, tighten NI margins, mandate extended follow-up, standardise the surgical comparator, and adequately power the bicuspid subgroup. Without these revisions, continuing the study under the current protocol risks yielding biased, non-guideline informative results."

Between November 2020 and November 2022, 142 patients with a small aortic valve annulus underwent AVR at Wuhan Asia Heart Hospital, with 73 patients in mechanical group and 69 in biological group. All patients met the surgical criteria for AVR. Baseline data, historical diseases, preoperative and follow-up echocardiographic results, and surgical-related data were shown in this study.
All patients successfully underwent surgery. In the mechanical valve group, four perioperative deaths occurred due to multiple organ failure, respiratory and cardiac arrest and circulatory failure. After one-year follow-up, hemodynamic parameters improved in both groups compared with preoperative values. Although the mechanical valve group demonstrated lower peak pressure gradients and maximum velocity compared with the bioprosthetic valve group in the follow-up period (P < 0.05), the bioprosthetic valve group exhibited shorter Intensive Care Unit (ICU) stay(3.6 ± 2.5d vs. 5.3 ± 7.9d, P < 0.001 ) and cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) times (178.1 ± 89.0 min vs. 192.4 ± 124.3 min, P = 0.032), and fewer postoperative complications at the one-year follow-up (4.3% vs. 14.9%, P = 0.026). No cerebrovascular events, valve dysfunction, or structural valve degeneration were observed in either group during the follow-up period.
Both mechanical and bioprosthetic valves showed excellent short-term outcomes in small aortic annulus patients. Bioprosthetic valves were comparable to mechanical valves, with potential benefits in reducing ICU stay, CPB time, and complications. For elderly patients, bioprosthetic valves are a safe and effective alternative in small aortic annulus AVR."

Epilepsy incurs a higher risk for developing CVD with an odds ratio of 2.25. CVDs can influence the function of the brain, and many brain diseases are linked with CV dysfunction, in a resiprocal relationship (neurocardiac axis). In patients with epilepsy, interactions along this neuro-cardiac axis appear to be involved in CVDs, such as hypertension and cardiac arrhythmias including atrial fibrillation, long QT syndrome, catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia, and sudden cardiac death (SCD) in epilepsy. Heart-brain interactions may comprise 2 wide categories: CV effects of neurological disease and neurological effects of CVD. The pathogenesis of neurogenic CV effects may involve a neurogenic cascade where sudden shifts in autonomic balance lead to an exaggerated catecholamine release. This can occur in acute neurological conditions such as ischemic stroke, intracranial hemorrhage, and epilepsy. Cardiovascular complications comprise the stroke-heart syndrome, neurogenic pulmonary edema and cardiomyopathy, Takotsubo syndrome, cardiac arrhythmias, and SCD. Specific areas of the brain, such as the insular cortex, play key roles in cardiac autonomic regulation, and disorders involving these areas have greater effects on the CV system. On the other hand, CV conditions can adversely influence the neurological system. Atrial fibrillation and intracardiac thrombus can cause cardioembolic strokes, whereas heart failure and severe aortic stenosis might account for cognitive impairment. This neuro-cardiac axis is herein detailed and the heart-lung-brain interactions in patients with epilepsy are pictorially illustrated. The epileptogenic and anti-epileptogenic medications and the results of reports of meta-analyses on the CV outcomes of patients with epilepsy are tabulated."

This meta-analysis aims to compare the clinical outcomes of TAVR in IC versus non-IC patients. A comprehensive search was conducted across PubMed, EMBASE, and Cochrane Central for randomized controlled trials and observational studies that compared outcomes between IC and non-IC patients undergoing TAVR. Primary outcomes included 1-year all-cause, cardiovascular (CV) and non-CV mortality. Secondary outcomes included new permanent pacemaker implantation (PPI) and major periprocedural complications. 4,478 patients in seven studies (mean age 80.5 years, 7.64% IC) were included in the analysis. As compared with non-IC patients, IC patients exhibited a similar 30-day death rate (Odds Ratio (OR) 1.62; 95% Confidence Interval (CI) 0.68 - 3.98; p=0.297), but significantly higher 1-year all-cause mortality (OR 2.39; 95% CI 1.55 - 3.70; p < 0.001). Notably, IC patients demonstrated a lower risk of CV death (OR 0.24; 95% CI 0.10 - 0.59; p = 0.002) but a higher risk of non-CV death (OR 4.16; 95% CI 1.70 - 10.18; p = 0.002). There was no difference in the rate of new PPI or major periprocedural complications. In conclusion, TAVR is a safe and effective treatment strategy in IC patients, with similar short-term mortality and increased medium-term mortality risk as compared with non-IC patients.

Promising outcomes using various approaches have been reported; however, limited literature is available for urgent scenarios.
We report our surgical approach in a young female patient with Marfan syndrome and PEx status after multiple sternal reconstruction procedures who presented with acute congestive heart failure due to mitral valve insufficiency caused by chordae rupture. A thoracic surgeon first removed the previously implanted Nuss bars. Subsequently, the cardiac procedure was performed, including a standard midline incision with median sternotomy preceded by peripheral cannulation for cardiopulmonary bypass via the right common femoral artery and vein. Dense adhesions were expected, and adequate mitral valve exposure was achieved after meticulous dissection and usual left atriotomy. Valve analysis revealed a classic Barlow-type mitral valve prolapse with A1-A2 chordae rupture. Two sets of CV-4 sutures attached to both papillary muscles were used to restore chordal attachments, followed by secondary chordae transfer and 36 mm Physio-2 annuloplasty ring implantation. A piece of bovine pericardium was used to cover the heart. Postprocedural transesophageal echocardiography revealed trace mitral regurgitation without systolic anterior motion. The patient was weaned off the cardiopulmonary bypass, and hemostasis was achieved in preparation for sternal reconstruction and closure. The thoracic surgery team rejoined for Nuss bar re-implantation to complete the procedure. The patient's recovery was uneventful, and she was discharged on postoperative day 19.
Our case report on complex mitral valve repair with concomitant Nuss bar reimplantation demonstrates the feasibility and safety of this procedure in challenging scenarios. The median sternotomy approach is safe for urgent open-heart surgery, even in patients with a previously corrected sternum due to PEx."

Their utility in patients with degenerative mitral regurgitation (DMR) undergoing transcatheter mitral edge-to-edge repair (M-TEER) remains unclear.
To evaluate the prognostic value of RV-PA coupling and PAPi in DMR patients treated with M-TEER.
This retrospective single-center study included 293 patients with DMR undergoing M-TEER between 2012 and 2022. RV-PA coupling was assessed by echocardiographic tricuspid annular plane systolic excursion (TAPSE) to systolic pulmonary artery pressure (sPAPecho) and, in a subset, invasively (TAPSE/sPAPinvasive). PAPi was calculated as (sPAP-diastolic PAP) / right atrial pressure. The primary endpoint was all-cause mortality at 2 years; the secondary endpoint was a composite of mortality or heart failure hospitalization.
RV-PA uncoupling (TAPSE/sPAPecho < 0.307 mm/mmHg) was associated with higher 2-year mortality (52.2% vs. 22.2%; HR = 2.64; p < 0.001) and composite events (56.4% vs. 30.1%; HR = 2.22; p = 0.0023). Similar results were observed with invasively derived TAPSE/sPAP (cut-off < 0.315 mm/mmHg). In contrast, PAPi < 3.65 was not associated with outcomes. TAPSE alone showed no prognostic significance.
RV-PA coupling, but not PAPi, predicts mortality and heart failure rehospitalization following M-TEER in DMR patients. These findings highlight the value of RV-PA coupling indices for risk stratification and support their routine use in preprocedural assessment."

These may be associated with kyphoscoliosis, pulmonary, and cardiac diseases. However, the incidence of concomitant cardiac disease in patients with pectus deformities is not well-documented. There is no consensus on the optimal age for repair, the most effective technique, or whether a simultaneous or staged approach is preferable. This study presents our experience with combined pectus and cardiac surgery.MethodsThirteen patients (aged 6-32 years) with pectus deformities and concurrent cardiac disease underwent surgery between 2016 and 2024. Eleven had pectus excavatum, one had a mixed deformity, and one had Pouter chest wall deformity. Seven had Marfan syndrome, one had Noonan syndrome, and three had mitral valve regurgitation requiring Bentall and/or valve replacement. The patient with Pouter chest wall deformity had right ventricular outflow tract (RVOT) stenosis, pulmonary valve stenosis, and a patent foramen ovale. Another had a failed Ravitch repair with a right coronary artery to RVOT fistula.ResultsThere was no mortality. All patients were extubated within 72 h, except one requiring reintubation for seven days due to COVID-19 pneumonia. Patients' characteristics are summarized in Table 1. One patient with a previous failed Ravitch repair required bilateral costochondral fixation. Pectus repair outcomes were excellent in 11 patients, while two children developed postoperative pectus carinatum.ConclusionThe choice between simultaneous or staged repair remains debated. Our experience suggests the modified open Nuss procedure is preferable for concomitant pectus and cardiac surgery, except when infeasible."

We aimed to assess short- and long-term outcomes of mitral valve surgery in men and women using confounder-adjusted data.
We searched PubMed, Embase, and the Cochrane Library for eligible propensity-score-matched studies. Analysis was performed for short-term (<30 days mortality and procedural complications) and long-term (>1 year mortality, reoperation, and mitral regurgitation) endpoints. A pairwise random-effects meta-analysis was done for short-term outcomes, pooling risk ratios (RR) with 95 % confidence intervals (CIs). A meta-analysis of Kaplan-Meier derived individual patient data was conducted for long-term endpoints. Cox frailty regression analysis was used to obtain hazard ratios (HR).

early mortality (at 30 days), late mortality, and need for re-intervention.
A total of 56 patients were identified, with a median age of 147 days and median weight of 5.1 kg. Of these, 39 underwent mitral valve repair and 17 underwent replacement. The median follow-up duration was 2.9 years (interquartile range 0.3-8.1). Patients who underwent replacement had longer ICU stays, hospital stays, and assisted ventilation times (p = 0.005, p = 0.01, p = 0.019), with higher early mortality (12% vs. 0%). Survival was significantly higher in the repair group (p = 0.039). Re-intervention was required in 23 patients (41.1%): 16 had replacement, 6 had re-repair, and 2 needed pacemaker implantation. Seven patients (12.5%) needed more than one re-intervention. Re-intervention-free survival rates after repair were 81%, 65%, and 46% at 1, 5, and 10 years, respectively. After replacement, rates were 74% at 1 year and 55% at 5 and 10 years. Conclusion Mitral valve surgery in infants is particularly high risk and is associated with high rate of re-intervention. While mitral repair demonstrates superior outcomes in mortality, it often delays but does not always prevent the need for valve replacement."

Such kinking can lead to serious issues, including heart failure, hemolysis, graft thrombosis, and significant upper and lower limb blood pressure difference. Although several cases involving various frozen elephant trunk (FET) devices have been documented, this report presents a potentially novel instance of stent graft kinking following implantation of an E-Vita Open Neo prosthesis.
A 48-year-old female with a complex cardiac history including previous coarctation repair, aortic valve replacement (AVR), and aortic root enlargement presented with mild hemoptysis, chest, and back pain. Imaging test revealed a growing aortic aneurysm (5.5 cm) at the anastomosis site, severe aortic arch angulation (55°), and prosthesis-patient mismatch with mitral regurgitation. She underwent total arch replacement with the frozen elephant trunk technique and double valve replacement. Postoperatively, she developed stent graft kinking and a significant systolic pressure gradient between upper and lower extremities, along with microangiopathic hemolytic anemia (MAHA) and elevated lactate dehydrogenase (LDH). Balloon dilatation and stent graft relining reduced the pressure gradient from 80 mmHg to 20 mmHg and resolved her symptoms. Follow-up computed tomography angiography (CTA) showed slight improvement in arch lumen size, while microangiopathic hemolytic anemia and lactate dehydrogenase levels normalized.
Stent graft kinking after total arch replacement with the frozen elephant trunk technique is a rare but potentially severe complication requiring prompt intervention when symptomatic. In the present case, the kinking was likely due to severe aortic arch angulation and fibrotic changes from prior surgeries. To reduce the risk of kinking in patients with significant aortic arch angulation, conventional total arch replacement or performing the distal anastomosis beyond the angulation should be considered during total arch replacement with the frozen elephant trunk procedure."

This article highlights the unique pitfalls associated with these devices, including imaging challenges and flow dynamics, which often push echocardiography to its limits. The use of a multimodality imaging approach including cardiac computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance, and positron emission tomography-CT is recommended to confirm the diagnosis of prosthetic valve dysfunction (PVD), quantify its severity and determine its mechanism and etiology. Thus, the distinction between non-structural and structural PVD is important to make by assessing: i) the morphology and mobility of the valve leaflets; ii) the changes in valve hemodynamic parameters during echocardiographic follow-up. Algorithms are also proposed to assess the presence and severity of residual valve regurgitation and iatrogenic stenosis following mitral or tricuspid transcatheter edge-to-edge repair.

These mechanisms demand divergent strategies because inotropes and afterload reduction that may help pump failure can aggravate obstruction, whereas preload reduction that aids congestion can worsen gradients if LVOTO is present. This review synthesizes epidemiology, mechanisms, imaging pathways, hemodynamic phenotypes, management, special contexts, outcomes, and research priorities of MR in TTS using only the provided peer-reviewed sources. Transthoracic echocardiography anchors diagnosis by identifying SAM, quantifying MR, and measuring left ventricular outflow tract (LVOT) or intracavitary gradients, while transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE), cardiovascular magnetic resonance imaging (CMR), left ventriculography, and myocardial contrast echocardiography (MCE) provide complementary insights when acoustic windows are limited or when postoperative differentials must be adjudicated. Right ventricular involvement denotes a higher‑risk phenotype with more functional regurgitation and worse short-term outcomes, reinforcing the need for meticulous preload and afterload management. In patients with obstruction, therapy focuses on beta-blockers, careful volume expansion, and vasoconstrictors to restore stability. For patients with tethering-dominant MR, the priority is decongestion and customized afterload reduction. If shock persists despite these measures, temporary mechanical circulatory support can be used to bridge patients to recovery."

Despite the prevalence of TR, this condition remains undertreated due to the absence of effective medical therapy and high surgical risk. However, tricuspid transcatheter edge-to-edge repair (T-TEER) using the TriClip system has emerged as a new approach, offering a minimally invasive alternative for patients with symptomatic severe TR and prohibitive surgical risk. Thus, this comprehensive review outlines a step-by-step approach to TriClip implantation, encompassing anatomical and pathophysiological foundations, patient selection criteria, imaging protocols, and procedural techniques. Emphasis is placed on the critical role of transesophageal echocardiography for device guidance, leaflet grasping, and confirmation of procedural success. Moreover, key intra-procedural challenges and troubleshooting strategies are discussed in detail, along with post-procedural management, including antithrombotic therapy, imaging surveillance, and functional assessment. Comparative insights between TriClip and the PASCAL system are provided, highlighting technical and clinical differences, as well as implications for device selection. The emerging role of combined mitral and tricuspid TEER using a single steerable guide catheter is also explored, supported by early data suggesting the safety and efficacy of this combination. Evidence from randomized trials and real-world registries supports the safety, feasibility, and durability of TriClip-based T-TEER. Notably, as experience and technology continue to evolve, T-TEER is positioned to become a cornerstone in the management of functional TR in high-risk populations."

Dextrocardia (1-2/20,000 incidence) and interruption of the inferior vena cava are rare structural abnormalities that complicate vascular access and catheter navigation during catheter ablation.
We report the case of a 39-year-old Chinese woman with persistent atrial fibrillation, dextrocardia, interruption of the inferior vena cava (with azygos continuation to the superior vena cava), severe mitral regurgitation, and pulmonary hypertension who underwent catheter ablation in the fluoroless catheterization laboratory. After thorough preoperative imaging assessment, we decided to perform the procedure through the right femoral vein and the left internal jugular vein approaches. Intracardiac echocardiography combined with the three-dimensional electroanatomic mapping method facilitated real-time visualization of the fossa ovalis and transseptal needle positioning without fluoroscopy. We safely completed the transseptal puncture by using this method. Pulmonary vein isolation and posterior wall box isolation were performed using a SmartTouch Surround Flow catheter, despite limited catheter maneuverability due to anatomical constraints. Successful sinus rhythm restoration was achieved without complications. At 3-month follow-up, the patient remained asymptomatic with a reduced left atrial diameter (57.7 mm to 51.2 mm) and stable sinus rhythm on electrocardiography. Integration of intracardiac echocardiography, three-dimensional electroanatomic mapping, and multidisciplinary planning enabled precise catheter ablation in the patient with complex anatomy.
The results support fluoroless techniques as a viable option for atrial fibrillation ablation in challenging congenital anomalies, minimizing radiation exposure while maintaining procedural success."

While several models have been developed to predict myocardial growth in MR, they often neglect key concurrent adaptive mechanisms that influence both the pattern and severity of LV dilation. This study presents a unified finite element framework to systematically evaluate the individual and combined contributions of fiber reorientation (FR) and baroreflex regulation to LV growth and remodeling, along with the effects of myocardial material property changes associated with the acute and chronic phases of MR. A healthy baseline model and multiple MR models were simulated, each incorporating different combinations of these mechanisms. The growth model that included both FR and baroreflex most accurately reproduced clinical measurements of LV geometry, myocardial mass, and pressure-volume loops. Excluding either FR or baroreflex consistently led to underestimation of myocardial growth and less realistic LV shapes. Importantly, FR was essential for capturing the increased chamber sphericity observed in MR, while baroreflex significantly influenced the extent of dilation and pressure compensation. Phase-dependent changes in myocardial material properties further modulated remodeling patterns, capturing distinct features of acute and chronic disease stages. These findings highlight the critical role of integrating concurrent physiological mechanisms to reliably predict cardiac adaptation in MR and provide new insights into the drivers of remodeling patterns observed in patients. This comprehensive approach offers a valuable framework for evaluating therapies that target distinct aspects of cardiac adaptation.

PubMed,mitral regurgitation,Intraoperative recognition of persistent left superior vena cava during right internal jugular central line placement in mitral valve replacement: a case report.,John Choi; Michelle Chen,10.1186/s13256-025-05698-x,2025-12-06,Journal of medical case reports,"Persistent left superior vena cava is a rare congenital venous anomaly, present in approximately 0.3-0.5% of the general population and in up to 10% of patients with congenital heart disease. Although typically asymptomatic and often discovered incidentally, persistent left superior vena cava may complicate central venous catheter placement and transesophageal echocardiography confirmation during cardiac surgery. Unrecognized persistent left superior vena cava can lead to misinterpretation of guidewire position, unnecessary catheter manipulation, and procedural delays.
A 65-year-old white woman (body mass index 26 kg/m2; American Society of Anesthesiologists physical status III) with severe degenerative mitral regurgitation, hypertension, and well-controlled type 2 diabetes mellitus presented for elective mitral valve repair. After uneventful induction of general anesthesia, a right internal jugular central venous catheter was placed under ultrasound guidance without resistance, arrhythmia, or abnormal waveform. Intraoperative transesophageal echocardiography-using standard bicaval, midesophageal four-chamber, and midesophageal long-axis views-failed to visualize the guidewire or catheter tip within the superior vena cava or right atrium despite correct placement technique and a normal central venous pressure waveform. Given stable hemodynamics and appropriate venous return, the catheter was secured in place, and mitral valve repair proceeded without incident. Postoperative contrast-enhanced computed tomography identified a persistent left superior vena cava draining into an enlarged coronary sinus, accounting for the atypical guidewire trajectory. The central line remained functional throughout, and the patient was extubated on postoperative day 1. She experienced an uncomplicated recovery and was discharged home on postoperative day 4.
When transesophageal echocardiography fails to confirm central venous catheter position despite proper technique, rare anatomical variants such as persistent left superior vena cava should be considered. Employing targeted transesophageal echocardiography interrogation of the coronary sinus and adjunctive imaging modalities can facilitate prompt recognition. Awareness of persistent left superior vena cava prevents unnecessary catheter manipulation, reduces procedural delays, and enhances patient safety during cardiac surgery."

A retrospective observational cohort study.
Academic tertiary care medical center.
Nine children underwent robot-assisted cardiac surgery from 2022 to 2024. Indications for operation included atrial septal defect (n = 8) and mitral valve regurgitation with concomitant Marfan syndrome (n = 1).
Eight patients underwent atrial septal defect closure; 1 patient underwent mitral valve repair.
Mean (SD) age was 13.1 (2.5) years, mean (SD) weight was 48.5 (20.3) kg, and mean (SD) body mass index was 21.7 (5.4) kg/m2. Mean (SD) operative time was 388.2 (40.7) minutes, fibrillation time was 92.4 (25.8) minutes, and cardiopulmonary bypass time was 192.1 (31.3) minutes. None of the patients required 1-lung ventilation based on surgeon preference, and most patients (77.8%) were extubated in the operating room. The median (IQR) intensive care unit length of stay was 45 (26) hours, and the median (IQR) hospital stay was 3 (2.5) days. One patient required conversion to median sternotomy due to aortic insufficiency in the setting of Marfan syndrome and aortic root dilation. One patient required a reoperation due to bleeding following an emesis episode in the intensive care unit. There were no mortality events.
Robot-assisted cardiac surgery is well tolerated in appropriately selected pediatric patients, including children as small as 24 kg. Our experience suggests that the success of this approach is predicated upon a center with institutional experience and multidisciplinary collaboration. Furthermore, it is critical that the anesthesiologist understands the unique anatomic, airway, monitoring, positioning, and surgical considerations that are unique for this patient population."

The QUEST trial demonstrated that Qiliqiangxin (QLQX) capsules could improve outcomes for Chinese HFrEF patients, but the cost-effectiveness of QLQX has not been previously evaluated.
We developed a lifetime Markov model to assess the cost-effectiveness of adding QLQX to standard therapy compared to standard therapy alone in a simulated cohort of 63-year-old HFrEF patients. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER), defined as incremental cost per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY), was the primary outcome. A willingness-to-pay (WTP) threshold was set at three times China's per capita GDP. One-way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were performed to test the robustness of the results.
Adding QLQX to standard treatment resulted in an additional 0.53 QALYs (4.74 vs. 4.22 QALYs) at an incremental cost of 28,760 Chinese Yuan (CNY) (USD 4,081), yielding an ICER of 54,522 CNY (USD 7,737) per QALY. This ICER was significantly below the WTP threshold. Sensitivity analyses confirmed the robustness of these findings.
QLQX capsules, as adjunctive therapy to standard treatment, represent a cost-effective strategy for managing HFrEF in China, supporting their inclusion in clinical guidelines and reimbursement policies. Real-world studies are needed to validate these results further."

We searched PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, and the Cochrane Library for eligible studies of iopromide contrast-enhanced CCTA in patients with AF from inception to February 2025. Using a random-effect model, we pooled the following diagnostic metrics of CCTAs from included studies: diagnostic segments, effective radiation dose, sensitivity, specificity, and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve for CAD diagnosis versus conventional angiography.
We included 14 studies involving 601 patients with AF who underwent iopromide 370 mgI/ml contrast-enhanced CCTA. Most studies applied individualised contrast and voltage protocols. Pooled analysis in 11 of those 14 studies indicated 98% segments were diagnostic (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.96-0.99) with consistent results in subgroups of patients with heart rate variation >50 beats per minute, patients with overweight status, and patients with heart valve diseases. Scanners with ≥128 slices or individualised protocols could further improve image quality. The per-patient ROC was 0.97 (95% CI: 0.95-0.98), while the per-segment ROC was 0.99 (95% CI: 0.98-0.99). In addition, prospective-triggered or individualised voltage protocols reduced radiation dose by approximately 50%.
Our meta-analysis showed that 370-mgI/ml iopromide contrast-enhanced CCTA delivers consistent image quality and accurate diagnosis of CAD in patients with AF. The use of high-performance scanners combined with individualised protocols and prospective acquisition could further enhance image quality while reducing radiation exposure."

The Japanese journal of thoracic surgery,"A 50-year-old male was diagnosed with aortic annulus ectasia (AAE) and aortic valve regurgitation (AR), and was thus referred to our department for surgery. Computed tomography (CT) revealed a Valsalva aneurysm with a maximal diameter of 52 mm. Echocardiography revealed severe AR with left ventricular enlargement [left ventricular internal dimension in diastole (LVDd) 85 mm]. The creatinine (CRE) level was 0.97 mg/dl, and the C-reactive protein (CRP) level was 1.92 mg/dl. David's procedure was initiated as a therapeutic intervention; however, severe adhesion and enlargement of the ascending aorta were observed after it was exposed during cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB). Based on this finding, the patient was suspected of having Takayasu's arteritis, and thus a Bentall procedure, with ascending aorta replacement by selective cerebral perfusion (SCP) and systemic cooling, was performed. Pathological examination revealed an inflammatory reaction from the adventitia to the intima with mononuclear cell infiltration, leading to a histological diagnosis of Takayasu's arteritis. The postoperative course was uneventful, and the patient was discharged on postoperative day 21. Steroids were used to treat Takayasu's arteritis and to prevent its recurrence after discharge."

The Japanese journal of thoracic surgery,"In a 77-year-old man, there was difficulty in removing a guidewire that had strayed into the right ventricle during leadless pacemaker insertion. Surgical removal was required. During removal of the wire, the tendon cords of the anterior tricuspid valve were pulled out, resulting in acute severe tricuspid regurgitation. The patient underwent tricuspid valve repair under cardiac arrest. He had a good postoperative course, a permanent pacemaker was implanted on postoperative day 14, and he was discharged on postoperative day 20. Although complications associated with catheter procedures have been increasing in recent years, there have been no reports of cases in which a guidewire became entangled in the tendon cords of the tricuspid valve. We discuss the cause of this case from the viewpoint of preventing recurrence and refer to acute tricuspid regurgitation that occurred during the removal of the catheter."

Accurately capturing and analyzing the multidimensional dynamics of cardiac motion is crucial for early diagnosis and rehabilitation assessment. This study introduces a novel concept for non-contact cardiac linear vibration (SCG) and rotational components (GCGx and GCGy) decoupling and reconstruction by integrating speckle motion signals captured from two cameras with different defocus levels. The intention is to overcome the motion coupling issues inherent in single-camera imaging and improve the accuracy in characterizing the cardiac complex 3D mechanical behavior. Using a sternum-mounted inertial sensor as the reference, experiments were conducted on 42 subjects in laboratory and intensive care unit settings. The results show that the reconstructed cardiac 3D motion signals exhibit greater waveform similarity to the reference signal than the raw speckle motion signal from a single camera, with similarity indices above 87.471%. In addition, with an 8 ms tolerance error, the localization accuracy of 6 key biomarkers (aortic valve opening/closing (AO/AC), mitral valve opening/closing (MO/MC), the biomarkers corresponding to the AO event in GCGy and the MC event in GCGx) are 73.080%, 99.998%, 85.587%, 86.617%, 99.683% and 77.301%, respectively. These results also outperform those obtained from the raw speckle motion signal. These findings validate the rationale and effectiveness of using dual-camera imaging with different defocus levels to reconstruct SCG, GCGx, and GCGy, offering a promising approach for accurately capturing complex cardiac 3D motion and improving cardiac function assessment."

Imaging methods and practice,"Valvular heart disease is a leading cause of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality globally, with women experiencing delayed referrals, difficulties recognizing atypical symptoms, and suboptimal adherence to guideline-based therapies, resulting in worse outcomes. However, the literature identifying these disparities remains limited, underscoring the need for a comprehensive registry to address these gaps. The Valvular Heart Disease in Women Registry (VHD-W) aims to provide real-world insights into gender differences by examining treatment patterns, guideline adherence, and clinical results.
The VHD-W is an international, multicenter, non-commercial, investigator-initiated, multipurpose registry endorsed by the European Association of Cardiovascular Imaging. The VHD-W involves adult patients with moderate-to-severe valvular heart disease admitted, either urgently or electively, to the cardiology inpatient service. The study aims to enrol 800 patients, balanced between genders, across more than 70 centres worldwide, over a 6-month period from the registry inception in March 2024 until the end of December 2025. Data will be collected at inpatient admission, inpatient discharge, and 1-year follow-up, including demographics, medical history, physical examination, biomarkers, echocardiography, other imaging results, and management. Conclusion The VHD-W is the first registry to focus on gender disparities in valvular heart disease in a real-world setting, aiming to fill a significant management gap that will help develop gender-specific, evidence-based guidelines for valvular heart disease."

Kinovea, as an accessible motion-analysis software, provides both visual and quantitative feedback. However, its application in supporting technique development among beginner athletes remains insufficiently explored. Aim: This study aims to describe the use of Kinovea in biomechanics training and examine its contribution to the awareness of kinematic characteristics and movement techniques among beginner athletes. Methods: A descriptive qualitative design involved 72 beginner athletes aged 18–25 years selected through purposive sampling. Data were collected over 16 weeks through interviews, field observations, and motion video recordings analyzed using Kinovea. Kinematic data focused on joint angles, stride behavior, and movement phases during walking, running, and the flight phase. Qualitative data were analyzed using content analysis with NVivo 12, while kinematic results were interpreted descriptively to identify performance patterns and areas for technical refinement. Result: Kinematic analysis showed coordinated joint-angle patterns across all phases. Walking analysis identified arm swing angles of 50.9°–58.8° and leg separation angles of 64.3°–67.2°, indicating a stable gait rhythm. The running analysis revealed knee angles of 68.8°–69.8° and elbow angles of 87.6°–89.1°, indicating efficient propulsive mechanics. The flight phase demonstrated knee angles of 81.2°–87.8° and elbow angles of 80.4°–88.3°, suggesting effective momentum use and postural stability. These measurements supported stride-efficiency assessment and technique evaluation. Qualitative findings revealed that Kinovea enabled athletes to interpret movement phases and identify technical inefficiencies through slow-motion and frame-by-frame visualization. Conclusion: Kinovea supports basic motion analysis by providing clear kinematic information and helping beginner athletes observe and refine their movement techniques. The findings also offer practical value for coaches by enabling more precise identification of inefficient patterns and guiding targeted corrections during early-stage training."
