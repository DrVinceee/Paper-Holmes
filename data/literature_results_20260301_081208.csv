PubMed,aortic stenosis,Cancer treatment-related ischemic arterial events: Focus on peripheral arterial disease and cerebrovascular events.,Gilles Pernod; Gabrielle Sarlon-Bartolli; Marie Antoinette Sevestre,10.1016/j.vasdi.2026.02.006,2026-02-27,"Vascular diseases (Paris, France)","Cancer therapies, including VEGF inhibitors, BCR-ABL tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs), immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs), multiple myeloma and hormonal therapies, are associated with an increased risk of arterial thrombotic events (ATEs). While most studies have focused on myocardial and cerebral ischemia, this review highlights the underreported peripheral arterial complications, peripheral arterial disease (PAD) and cerebrovascular events. VEGF inhibitors, such as bevacizumab and VEGFR-TKIs (e.g., sorafenib, sunitinib), significantly elevate the risk of ATEs, with hypertension and proteinuria as common comorbidities. BCR-ABL-TKIs, especially nilotinib and ponatinib, are linked to rapid-onset PAD, even in patients without prior cardiovascular risk factors. ICIs triple the progression of aortic plaque volume, increasing the risk of ischemic stroke and myocardial infarction. Hormonal therapies, including tamoxifen and androgen deprivation therapy, also contribute to ATEs through metabolic and vascular mechanisms. Radiotherapy further exacerbates arterial disease, particularly carotid stenosis and iliofemoral atherosclerosis, in head, neck, and pelvic cancer survivors. Monitoring and prevention strategies, such as regular cardiovascular risk assessments, lipid management, and arterial ultrasound surveillance, are critical for high risk patients. Multidisciplinary onco-vascular teams are essential to mitigate these risks and optimize patient outcomes."

This observational cohort study evaluated temporal trends in Ross, TAVR, and surgical aortic valve replacement (SAVR) utilization and compared their 6-year outcomes in adults 18-64 years old.
We used California and New York discharge data (2000-2025) to identify patients undergoing Ross, TAVR, mechanical (SAVR-mech), or biological SAVR (SAVR-bio). Multivariable time-to-event models assessed the 6-year risks of death, myocardial infarction, stroke, infective endocarditis (IE), reintervention, and pacemaker implantation.
Ross utilization declined from 2.8% in 2000 to 0.9% in 2005, then rebounded to 2.8% by 2022. TAVR expanded rapidly after 2011, while SAVR-mech declined and SAVR-bio plateaued after 2017. Early mortality was low across all groups, and notably rare following the Ross procedure. Compared with SAVR-bio, the Ross procedure was associated with lower adjusted 6-year mortality (HR:0.42 [95%CI:0.19-0.91]) and stroke risk. The risk of isolated aortic valve reintervention and aortic and/or pulmonary valve reintervention was higher after Ross and SAVR-mech than SAVR-bio but remained lower after TAVR. TAVR was associated with higher mortality (HR:1.48[95% CI:1.07-2.05]), IE, and heart failure hospitalization compared with SAVR-bio. SAVR-mech demonstrated comparable survival to SAVR-bio (HR:0.96[95% CI:0.85-1.08]) but higher risks of IE, myocardial infarction, heart failure, and pacemaker implantation.
Ross use in adults<65 is rising and confers lower 6-year mortality rates than SAVR-bio or TAVR, supporting broader consideration for younger patients."

While rapid deployment (RD) SAVR is not recommended for redo cases, we retrospectively analyzed its potential expanded indication.The primary objective was to examine the potential expanded indication of RD rSAVR and the advantages it might confer, particularly in surgeries with prolonged intraoperative times.
Between January 2014 and March 2022, 37 patients underwent RD rSAVR (Edwards Intuity Elite rapid deployment valve system (Edwards Lifesciences, Irvine, CA) due to structural valve degeneration, compared with 48 patients undergoing conventional rSAVR (crSAVR) for aortic stenosis. Data were collected retrospectively after gaining patient consent.
No significant difference in postoperative or intraoperative complications was obtained, no repeat surgery was performed due to valvular complications in either group, and only one paravalvular leak was noted in the crSAVR group. A very low new pacemaker rate was observed in both groups (3% RD rSAVR vs 6% crSAVR). The cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) and cross-clamping time is significantly lower in the RD rSAVR collective, which is reflected in the pure rSAVR after stratification according to concomitant procedures.On average, a 23 mm valve was selected in both groups with comparable postoperative mean gradient. The RD group had a higher TIA rate (19% vs 0%, p = 0.002), though without residual neurological deficits, but no significant differences in postoperative stroke, respiratory complications, or mortality.
RD rSAVR appears safe in redo settings, providing excellent haemodynamic results and time efficiency in experienced hands."
PubMed,aortic stenosis,Association Between AI-derived Thoracic Calcium Volume and Aortic Valve Calcification Quantified by Agatston Scoring.,Gonçalo G Almeida; Dana Belde; Mike Guldimann; Stephan Engelberger; André Euler; Fabienne Knöpfli; Rahel A Kubik-Huch; Michael Thali; Tilo Niemann,10.21873/invivo.14266,2026,"In vivo (Athens, Greece)","Aortic valve calcification is a key determinant of aortic stenosis severity. Whether AI-derived thoracic aortic calcium volume reflects valvular calcification remains unclear. This study examined the association between aortic valve calcification quantified using Agatston, volume and mass scores, and total aortic calcium volume measured with an automated AI tool.
This retrospective single-center study included 32 patients undergoing computed tomography (CT) for transcatheter aortic valve implantation planning. Aortic valve calcification was quantified on noncontrast CT using Agatston, volume and mass scores. Total aortic calcium volume was derived from contrast-enhanced CT using the AI-Rad Companion Chest CT. Correlation analyses and simple linear regression assessed associations between aortic and valvular calcification metrics.
Mean total aortic calcium volume was 4.38 ml. Mean aortic valve Agatston score was 3307 units and mean valve calcium volume was 2727 mm3. Correlation between total aortic calcium and aortic valve Agatston score was weak and nonsignificant (Pearson r=0.213, p=0.259). Correlation with valve calcium volume was similarly weak (Pearson r=0.219, p=0.244). Regression models showed minimal explained variance (R2≈4-5 percent), and slopes were not statistically significant. No clinically relevant association between thoracic aortic calcium burden and aortic valve calcification was identified.
AI-derived thoracic aortic calcium volume did not correlate with aortic valve calcification. Valvular calcification appears to progress independently of thoracic aortic wall calcification. Automated aortic calcium measurements cannot substitute for direct quantification of aortic valve calcification in preprocedural assessment."
PubMed,aortic stenosis,Early TAVR cost-effectiveness compared to clinical surveillance in patients with asymptomatic severe aortic stenosis in the US.,Phillippe Généreux; Matthew R Reynolds; Marcella A Kelley; Christin Thompson; Suzanne J Baron,10.1016/j.jval.2026.02.005,2026-02-25,Value in health : the journal of the International Society for Pharmacoeconomics and Outcomes Research,"The EARLY TAVR trial demonstrated improved clinical outcomes for patients with asymptomatic severe aortic stenosis (aSAS) treated with transcatheter aortic valve replacement (eTAVR) compared with clinical surveillance (CS). The cost effectiveness of an eTAVR strategy for patients with aSAS in the United States (US) is unknown.
A Markov model with 30-day cycles was developed from the US healthcare payor perspective to estimate the cost-effectiveness of eTAVR vs. CS over a lifetime horizon. Inputs for population characteristics and health outcomes were derived from the EARLY TAVR trial. Costs were derived from US Medicare reimbursement rates. Probabilistic and deterministic sensitivity analyses were performed to evaluate the effect of parameter uncertainty on model output.
When compared to CS, eTAVR was associated with 0.21 additional life years (LY) and 0.24 additional quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) over a lifetime due to more time spent in the alive and well health state with eTAVR. Lifetime costs were estimated to be $8,812 lower, due primarily to reductions in costs associated with the AVR procedure, stroke, and heart failure hospitalizations. Accordingly, eTAVR was projected to be economically dominant over CS. In probabilistic sensitivity analysis, a large majority of iterations (95.9%) produced cost-effective results ($100,000 threshold) for eTAVR versus CS, with most simulations (90.3%) showing dominance, confirming the robustness of the base case results. These findings were consistent over a variety of scenario analyses.
An eTAVR strategy for the treatment of aSAS may be a cost-saving approach for US healthcare payors, when compared to CS."

Heart and circulatory physiology,"Background: Aortic stenosis (AS) quantification relies on transvalvular gradients or aortic valve opening area (AVA), two measures that inherently depend on the instantaneous transvalvular flow rate (Q). We present a new quantification method for AS based on new modelling where AVA saturates with increasing Q, contradicting the assumption of linear Q-AVA-relation currently predominant in the literature. Objective: Development of a new method for the quantification of AS. Methods: In 141 patient undergoing transesophageal echocardiography, AVA was obtained frame-by-frame over an entire systole from 3D echocardiograms using multiplanar reconstruction. Q was retrieved by Doppler- and 3D echocardiography of the left ventricular outflow tract. A sigmoid Q-AVA relation was fitted with a machine learning algorithm. The measured and the predicted AVA were compared between a parametrized linear and sigmoid Q-AVA-relation model. A relative aortic valve stiffness (rAVS) was calculated, and an isostiffness nomogram was constructed. Cox proportional hazard modelling was used to look for predictors of rehospitalization-free survival Results: Compared to the linear model, the sigmoid model consistently better predicted measured AVA in all AS severity groups. Within severity groups, rAVS remained robust and constant, a property not shared by the linear model. A ROC-Analysis revealed a rAVS-value of 1.51 as the best cut-off for distinguishing severe from non-severe AS. Cox proportional hazard modelling showed its value as an independent predictor of rehospitalization-free survival. Conclusions: We present a new method for the quantification of AS that could help simplify the diagnosis of patients with low-flow, low-gradient AS."

Case reports,"Coronary artery anomalies are encountered in less than 1% of the population and are usually found incidentally. Some vessel courses are linked to myocardial ischaemia and sudden cardiac death while successful PCI in ACS scenarios poses a clinical challenge.
An 83-year-old woman with hypertension and dyslipidaemia presented with an ACS. The ECG showed atrial fibrillation while echocardiography revealed ischaemic cardiomyopathy with mildly reduced ejection fraction. Diagnostic coronary angiography showed a four separate ostia arising from the right sinus of Valsalva: RCA, LAD, LCX, and an independent conus branch. Transient occlusion of the conal branch by the diagnostic catheter triggered VF promptly terminated with DC cardioversion. On Day 4, PCI via right transulnar access was performed as we treated a first diagonal branch with DCB and mid-RCA stenosis with two DES. CTCA at follow-up confirmed an anterior (pre-pulmonic) course of the LAD, a retroaortic course of the LCX, and a dominant RCA. LAAT was detected and oral anticoagulation was initiated. The patient was discharged in stable condition on GDMT.
This constellation, a separate ostia of four coronary arteries arising from the right coronary sinus, is exceedingly rare. The case underscores several practical points. Anomalous coronaries are susceptible to atherosclerosis and should be revascularized according to clinical context and not anomaly per se. Furthermore, meticulous catheter manipulation should be performed in order to avoid transient ostial compromise of small branches, such as in our case. Finally, CTCA complements invasive angiography by clarifying spatial relationships essential for risk stratification."

Between January 2014 and May 2024, 99 patients (age ≥ 18 years) who underwent repair of pAVSD and its associated TVD using the aforementioned strategy were retrospectively analyzed.
The mean aortic cross-clamp time was 48.5 ± 12.6 min, and the mean cardiopulmonary bypass time was 75.8 ± 13.0 min. Follow-up was 100% at a mean of 5.2 years (3-8 years). No operative or late deaths occurred. No evidence of mitral stenosis was detected, and only one patient developed a severe MR 2 years after the surgery and underwent reoperation. There was no moderate or severe tricuspid regurgitation during follow-up. There was neither secondary tricuspid valve repair nor permanent pacemaker implantation among all patients.
The combined double-orifice and single-patch technique is a safe, effective, and durable strategy for repair of pAVSD and its associated TVD, demonstrating an excellent technical reproducibility."

Adult presentation is uncommon and may result in atypical clinical manifestations, particularly when complicated by infective endocarditis. Coarctation of the aorta-associated infective endocarditis is especially rare and carries significant clinical risk.
We report a 25-year-old male with partial Shone complex consisting of a parachute mitral valve, mitral stenosis, and coarctation of the aorta. The patient presented with persistent high-grade fever and was diagnosed with methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus infective endocarditis based on positive blood cultures. Transthoracic and transesophageal echocardiography revealed obstructive left-sided lesions, mitral valve pathology, and moderate aortic regurgitation. Positron emission tomography demonstrated intense hypermetabolic activity at the coarctation site, consistent with active infection and confirming a saccular aneurysm. The patient underwent prolonged intravenous cefazolin therapy followed by surgical repair. The early postoperative course was stable; however, seven months later he re-presented with recurrent fever. Repeat imaging demonstrated graft infection, vegetation on the prosthetic material, and a perforated mitral leaflet. A second course of intravenous antibiotics (cefazolin and rifampicin) was administered, followed by long-term suppressive oral therapy. Subsequent follow-up showed persistent moderate-to-severe mitral regurgitation with stable postoperative anatomy.
This case highlights a rare adult manifestation of partial Shone complex complicated by coarctation of the aorta-site methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus infection, saccular aneurysm formation, and recurrent graft-associated infective endocarditis. The clinical course underscores the importance of vigilant multimodality imaging, early multidisciplinary evaluation, and long-term follow-up in adults with complex CHD, particularly when infectious complications are present."

In the present study, we evaluated the predictive value and optimal cut-off values of LVMW parameters measured prior to TAVI that may be associated with increased mortality in AS patients. Methods: A total of 116 consecutive patients who were qualified for TAVI between March 2021 and November 2022 were evaluated. Pre-procedural LVMW indices (GWI, GCW, GWW, and GWE) were assessed and long-term survival was analysed. Survival and influencing factors were evaluated using univariate and multivariate Cox proportional hazard models, with significant factors subsequently included in cut-off analysis. Results: The median survival time following the TAVI procedure was 1404 (1143-1549) days, with a maximum observation period of 1721 days. All-cause mortality during the follow-up period reached 29%. Multivariate analysis revealed that EF, GLS, GWI, GWE and GCW before TAVI were independent predictors of all-cause mortality. We identified 1975 mmHg, 1497 mmHg and 85% as optimal cut-off values for GCW, GWI and GWE, which allow for significant stratification of patients according to risk. Conclusions: In this analysis, baseline-assessed parameters such as GLS, GWI, GWE, and GCW emerged as independent predictors of all-cause mortality. The proposed cut-off values clearly separated patient groups with different survival outcomes."

Cardiac damage staging systems may better characterize myocardial and extracardiac involvement. We aim to evaluate the presence and progression of cardiac damage across the clinical course of AS. Methods: A single-center retrospective cohort study was conducted, which included consecutive patients who ultimately underwent TAVR and had retrievable serial echocardiograms at moderate AS, first severe AS, and pre-TAVR symptomatic severe AS (2017-2021). A total of 179 patients were evaluated (mean age 82.7 [5.9] years at moderate AS; 46% male, p = 0.27). Cardiac damage was classified according to two established staging systems. Results: The median time from moderate to severe AS was 32 months (IQR 18-48). Most echocardiographic parameters deteriorated primarily at symptom onset, whereas moderate AS and first severe (asymptomatic) AS showed broadly similar profiles. However, left ventricular global longitudinal strain (LV GLS) was already impaired at the first severe stage, and right ventricular-arterial coupling (RVAc, TAPSE/sPAP) progressively worsened as AS advanced to the severe stage, independently of symptom status (LV GLS -18.1%, n = 163; -17.1%, n = 143; and -14.9%, n = 143; RVAc 1.0, n = 131; 0.8, n = 130; and 0.7, n = 130), respectively; overall p < 0.05. Both staging systems demonstrated increasing cardiac damage with AS progression. Conclusions: Cardiac damage may occur early in AS. The marked deterioration at symptom onset underscores the importance of systematic myocardial assessment and supports prospective studies to evaluate whether integrating LV GLS and RVAc as sensitive early markers of disease progression improves risk stratification."

While management strategies have evolved from mandatory surgical repair to various percutaneous approaches, limited data exist regarding collagen-based vascular closure devices for large-bore carotid arteriotomies. Case Presentation: We report the case of a 59-year-old male patient with acute Stanford Type A aortic dissection who underwent emergency surgical repair of the ascending aorta. During central venous cannulation, a five-lumen Certofix Quinto catheter (12-French outer diameter) was inadvertently inserted into the left common carotid artery. Given the complexity of concurrent cardiac surgery and the large-bore nature of the arteriotomy, percutaneous closure with an 18-French MANTA vascular closure device was successfully performed following completion of the aortic repair. The procedure achieved immediate hemostasis without complications. Outcomes: The patient remained neurologically intact throughout a 12-month follow-up period. Serial duplex ultrasonography and computed tomography angiography confirmed carotid artery patency without evidence of stenosis, dissection, pseudoaneurysm formation, or thromboembolic complications. Conclusions: This case demonstrates the technical feasibility of using a collagen-based vascular closure device for percutaneous management of a large-bore carotid arteriotomy in the acute surgical setting. While the outcome was favorable in this patient, this approach represents an off-label application that requires further validation and should be reserved for carefully selected cases in experienced centers where the benefits of percutaneous closure are judged to outweigh the uncertainties of supra-aortic device deployment."

Surgical and transcatheter aortic valve replacement remain the primary treatments for advanced CAVD; however, effective pharmacological therapies to prevent or slow disease progression are lacking. Therefore, there is an urgent need to explore potential novel candidate biomarkers and therapeutic targets.
In this study, transcriptomic data from multiple independent datasets were integrated to comprehensively characterize the transcriptional profile of CAVD. Feature genes were identified using complementary machine learning approaches, followed by functional pathway enrichment and protein-protein interaction (PPI) network analyses to uncover novel candidate genes associated with CAVD. Single-cell RNA sequencing (sc-RNA-Seq) data were further analyzed using pseudotime trajectory analysis to explore transcriptional dynamics during valve interstitial cells' (VICs) osteogenic progression. Quantitative PCR and Western blot analyses of human calcified aortic valve tissues were used for validation.
A total of 119 CAVD-associated genes were identified, primarily involved in ossification, extracellular matrix organization, and cell-substrate adhesion. Among these, the ossification-associated genes BAMBI, HAND2, and MYOC exhibited potential discriminatory power between CAVD and control samples, with notable downregulation in calcified valves. Pseudotime analysis showed that the expression of these genes gradually decreased along the transcriptional trajectory associated with osteogenic differentiation. In addition, the analysis of relative immune signatures revealed negative correlations between these genes and multiple immune signatures.
This study identifies novel candidate genes underlying CAVD pathogenesis and highlights BAMBI, HAND2, and MYOC as potential biomarkers and therapeutic targets, providing new insights into disease mechanisms and opportunities for novel interventions."

However, growing evidence supports a paradigm shift toward recognizing AS as an active metabolic and inflammatory disorder. This narrative review synthesizes experimental, translational, and clinical evidence published between 2015 and 2025 examining metabolic mechanisms linking valvular calcification and atrial remodeling in AS and discusses their clinical relevance in the context of transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR). We discussed classical pathways involving mineral metabolism and vitamin signaling, alongside emerging roles of lipid oxidation, mitochondrial dysfunction, epigenetic regulation, and gut microbiome-derived metabolites. Further, metabolomic signatures associated with disease severity and post-TAVR outcomes were reviewed, highlighting the predominantly associative nature and current limitations of these data. Although valve replacement remains the only effective therapy for advanced AS, metabolic and multi-omics insights may improve future risk stratification and mechanistic understanding. Metabolomic profiling could be integrated at multiple points in the clinical pathway for aortic stenosis and TAVR-most promisingly for pre-procedural risk stratification. The present paper focuses on an integrative framework in which valvular calcification and atrial remodeling are viewed within a broader context of metabolic dysregulation. Future research should aim to translate molecular biomarkers into real-world diagnostics and targeted interventions."

FlowVN was trained on fully sampled 4D Flow MRI datasets of healthy volunteers from one site. The model was tested on retrospective undersampled data (R = 6-22) of six normal volunteers from the same site and six from another site, prospectively undersampled data (R = 12.4-13.8) of six healthy volunteers from the second site and six patients with aortic stenosis from first Site. Performance was evaluated using nRMSE, relative and angular error, average and maximum velocity, flow rate, volumetric flow, and turbulent kinetic energy (TKE), with a Wilcoxon signed-rank test to assess the difference from ground truth.
FlowVN showed minimal sensitivity to the number of training datasets and performed well even when trained on a single dataset. FlowVN also demonstrated good generalizability across sites. No significant difference in average and maximum velocity was observed up to R = 16. Total TKE was preserved up to R = 10 in the normal volunteers, but was well preserved even at higher acceleration factors in the aortic stenosis patients. Flow volumes through the ascending and descending aorta were well preserved for all acceleration factors, although ascending aorta flow volumes for data from one site were significantly different from ground truth for AF > 16.
FlowVN accurately reconstructs highly undersampled 4D Flow MRI from multiple sites using a model trained on a single dataset, maintaining excellent quantitative image quality even at very high acceleration factors."

While hypertension often coexists with aortic stenosis, the long-term effects of transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) on blood pressure (BP), the predictors of BP changes, and their prognostic significance remain incompletely understood.
We conducted a retrospective cohort study of 1333 patients who underwent TAVI at Sheba Medical Centre between 2008 and 2023. Changes in SBP and DBP were divided into quintiles (lowest, intermediate, and highest) and assessed for associations with all-cause mortality using Kaplan-Meier survival curves and Cox proportional hazards models, adjusted for clinical and echocardiographic variables. Multinomial logistic regression identified predictors of BP changes.
The mean age was 81 years; 50% were men, and 73% had preexisting hypertension. Mean baseline SBP and DBP were 135 and 69 mmHg, respectively. Post-TAVI, SBP increased in 53% of patients, and DBP in 47%. Over a median follow-up of 4.6 years, higher post-TAVI SBP and DBP were independently associated with improved survival, after adjustment for clinical and echocardiographic confounders. Lower baseline left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) predicted increased SBP (P < 0.001), and female sex predicted increased DBP (P < 0.001). Preexisting hypertension did not predict BP changes.
Post-TAVI BP elevation is linked to better long-term survival, especially among patients with reduced baseline LVEF, and may reflect a beneficial hemodynamic response rather than comorbidity. Lower baseline LVEF and female sex are independent predictors of this response. These findings support permissive management of BP changes post-TAVI to improve patient outcomes."

Their effect in patients undergoing transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) for severe aortic stenosis (AS), however, remains unclear. This study evaluated whether SGLT2 inhibitors reduce all-cause mortality and HF hospitalisations after TAVR.
A systematic search of PubMed, ScienceDirect, Cochrane (CENTRAL), Scopus and Embase was performed through April 2025 for studies comparing post-TAVR outcomes between SGLT2 inhibitor users and non-users. Outcomes of interest included a composite of all-cause mortality or heart failure (HF) hospitalisation, along with the individual components of all-cause mortality and HF hospitalisation. All outcomes were extracted at 1 year. Pooled hazard ratios (HRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated using a random-effects model. Heterogeneity was quantified using I2 statistics. Analyses were conducted in R (version 4.4.2).
Three studies (1 RCT, 2 Observational) comprising 3187 patients met inclusion criteria. SGLT2 inhibitor use was associated with a reduced risk of the composite outcome (HR: 0.75; 95% CI: 0.65, 0.86; p < 0.01). Individually, therapy lowered all-cause mortality (HR: 0.72; 95% CI: 0.53, 0.96; p = 0.03) and HF hospitalisations (HR: 0.74; 95% CI: 0.61, 0.90; p < 0.01).
In patients with severe AS undergoing TAVR, SGLT2 inhibitors were associated with significant reductions in all-cause mortality and HF hospitalisations. These findings suggest a promising role for SGLT2 inhibitors in improving post-TAVR outcomes. However, given the limited data, larger randomised clinical trials are necessary to consolidate these findings.

Although mechanical circulatory support (MCS) can mitigate hemodynamic instability, evidence guiding the use of cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) during concomitant transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) and percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) is lacking.
The authors retrospectively reviewed 6 high-risk patients who underwent concomitant TAVR and PCI with planned MCS using CPB or venoarterial (VA)-ECMO between 2015 and 2023. Outcomes were classified according to VARC-3 criteria.
Six male patients (mean age 77.3 ± 8.3 years) underwent concomitant TAVR and PCI with planned MCS using CPB (n = 4, 2015-2020) or VA-ECMO (n = 2, 2022-2023). Complete coronary revascularization was achieved in 4 cases (66.7%). Implanted valves included 2 self-expanding and 4 balloon-expandable prostheses. The mean catheter-measured transaortic gradient decreased from 37.2 ± 17.6 mm Hg to 3.9 ± 2.1 mm Hg (P = .006). Trace (1+) paravalvular leak occurred in 4 patients (66.7%), with none 2+ or higher. There were no intraprocedural complications, neurologic events, major bleeding, vascular complications, or 30-day deaths. Three patients (50%) developed new conduction abnormalities, all without pacemaker requirement. Acute kidney injury occurred in 3 (Stage I, 50%). The mean intensive care and total hospital stays were 5.5 ± 3.5 and 8.3 ± 6.0 days, respectively.
Planned CPB or VA-ECMO support enabled safe performance of concomitant TAVR and PCI in non-surgical, high-risk patients, representing a feasible approach for selected complex cases."
PubMed,aortic stenosis,Structural and Non-Structural Deterioration After Biological Aortic Valve Replacement: Long-Term Outcomes of 918 High-Risk Patients.,Jan Hlavička; Julian Landgraf; Andreas Winter; Mascha von Zeppelin; Yasemin Ilgin; Razan Salem; Florian Hecker; Thomas Walther; Tomas Holubec,10.3390/jcdd13020087,2026-02-11,Journal of cardiovascular development and disease,"The global disease burden of aortic valve disease is already substantial and is projected to rise significantly in the coming decades. Aortic valve replacement (AVR) with a biological prosthesis has become highly popular and commonly used. This study aims to assess long-term outcomes after biological AVR with regard to structural and non-structural deterioration.
In this single-centre retrospective study, 918 patients undergoing surgical AVR with a biological prosthesis at the University Hospital Frankfurt from January 2006 to July 2009 were included. The primary endpoints were freedom from reoperation and from structural and non-structural deterioration, and the secondary was long-term survival. Follow-up was completed in 95.6% with a median of 7.6 years, accounting 6610 patient-years. The mean age was 74.9 years and a median EuroSCORE II (range) was 3.34 (0.77-62.4). Twenty-two percent of surgeries were either emergent or urgent. Many patients had concomitant surgery, while coronary artery bypass grafting in 45.3% of patients was the most common. Three prosthetic valve models were used in our patient population: Carpentier Edwards Perimount (CEP) Model 2900, Model 3000 and Medtronic Mosaic (MM).
Reoperation occurred in 36 patients (3.9%) due to endocarditis (2.0%), aortic root aneurysm (0.1%), isolated or combined aortic stenosis or aortic regurgitation (1.9%). Freedom from reoperation at 5, 10 and 15 years was 97 ± 0.6%, 95.6 ± 0.8% and 90.3 ± 2.3%, respectively. Freedom from major stroke at 5, 10 and 15 years was 97.9 ± 0.0%, 96.4 ± 0.8%, and 96.1 ± 0.08%, and freedom from major bleeding event at 5, 10 and 15 years was 98.5 ± 0.4%, 95.7 ± 0.9% and 92.7 ± 2.2%, respectively. A subgroup analysis of the Carpentier Edwards (CEP) valves and the Medtronic Mosaic (MM) valves showed no significant differences regarding the primary endpoints. The overall survival at 5, 10 and 15 years was 67 ± 1.7%, 39.8 ± 1.8%, and 15.1 ± 2.2% respectively. The Kaplan-Meier survival estimator was 96 ± 2.2 months.
This study showed a good long-term survival of surgical AVR with biological prostheses in relatively high-risk and elderly patient population. All biological prosthetic valves showed good long-term durability with low levels of complications and reoperations. The different models did not show any significant differences. Surgical AVR remains a valuable therapeutic option even though transcatheter aortic valve implantation has been greatly expanded since its introduction."

Endovascular stents typically consist of a metal framework and a flexible membrane graft designed to reopen obstructed aortic segments and maintain blood flow through the true lumen. Consequently, stents are widely used to treat aortic expansion diseases and aortic occlusive stenosis. However, traditional stents have limitations in terms of adaptability to complex anatomical structures, long-term durability, biomechanical stability, and reliance on radial support force for fixation, lacking active fixation mechanisms. These shortcomings remain the primary causes of postoperative complications, significantly impacting the quality of life for patients with aortic dissection.                                                           Methods:                     The research status of the endovascular stent was discussed in depth, and the main factors for the optimal design of the stent (geometry, pattern configuration, additional fixtures, and optimization methods) were analyzed and summarized according to the complications targeted by the repair device.                                                           Results:                     The composition structure, working principle, and development status of the stent grafts under review are elaborated in detail. Stent grafts attempt to alleviate postoperative complications through three approaches: enhancing the flexibility of the stent framework, improving the fit between the vessel wall and the stent, and reducing vascular injury. Blood flow guiding channels are established to alleviate the obstruction of branch blood flow. Additional self-anchoring devices are added to adapt to the dynamic remodeling of blood vessels.                                                           Discussion:                     The effects of various factors, including geometric parameters, structural design, and parameter optimization techniques, on the optimization of stent primary mechanical performance are discussed. The current research status of functional improvement methods for stents is also summarized.                                                           Conclusion:                     Refining the quantitative relationship between stent structural parameters and mechanical performance, as well as exploring the balance criteria between flexibility and radial support force, represent promising directions for future development. These objectives necessitate further in-depth analysis and research."

With a focus on the prevalent psychological complications following the onset of this condition, this study aimed to explore the correlation between antenatal depression and Corona disease anxiety, personality traits, and postpartum depression during the COVID-19 pandemic.                                                           Materials and Methods:                     This cross-sectional descriptive-analytical study investigated women receiving care at health centers affiliated with Kerman University of Medical Sciences during the last month of their pregnancy and the postpartum period in 2022. Following the acquisition of informed consent, participants were assessed using various measures, including demographic and obstetric information, the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale, the Corona Disease Anxiety Scale (CDAS), and the NEO Personality Inventory-Revised during their third trimester of pregnancy. The same group of participants completed the Edinburgh Depression Scale and the Corona Disease Anxiety Scale (CDAS) 4-6 weeks after childbirth.                                                           Results and Discussion:                     There was a significant correlation between family income, unwanted pregnancy as perceived by both the mother and father, and antenatal depression. Additionally, marital satisfaction played a significant role in postpartum depression. Furthermore, antenatal depression was significantly associated with neuroticism, agreeableness, and physical symptoms related to Corona disease anxiety. Personality traits, with the exception of extroversion and conscientiousness, and various domains of Corona disease anxiety, excluding psychological symptoms, were also significantly associated with postpartum depression.                                                           Conclusion:                     During pandemics or epidemics, such as the COVID-19 outbreak, experiencing mental distress during pregnancy can contribute to mental health issues during the postpartum period. This risk is particularly true in individuals with unique personality traits, emphasizing the need for increased focus on mental health within prenatal care during these crises."

Kinovea, as an accessible motion-analysis software, provides both visual and quantitative feedback. However, its application in supporting technique development among beginner athletes remains insufficiently explored. Aim: This study aims to describe the use of Kinovea in biomechanics training and examine its contribution to the awareness of kinematic characteristics and movement techniques among beginner athletes. Methods: A descriptive qualitative design involved 72 beginner athletes aged 18–25 years selected through purposive sampling. Data were collected over 16 weeks through interviews, field observations, and motion video recordings analyzed using Kinovea. Kinematic data focused on joint angles, stride behavior, and movement phases during walking, running, and the flight phase. Qualitative data were analyzed using content analysis with NVivo 12, while kinematic results were interpreted descriptively to identify performance patterns and areas for technical refinement. Result: Kinematic analysis showed coordinated joint-angle patterns across all phases. Walking analysis identified arm swing angles of 50.9°–58.8° and leg separation angles of 64.3°–67.2°, indicating a stable gait rhythm. The running analysis revealed knee angles of 68.8°–69.8° and elbow angles of 87.6°–89.1°, indicating efficient propulsive mechanics. The flight phase demonstrated knee angles of 81.2°–87.8° and elbow angles of 80.4°–88.3°, suggesting effective momentum use and postural stability. These measurements supported stride-efficiency assessment and technique evaluation. Qualitative findings revealed that Kinovea enabled athletes to interpret movement phases and identify technical inefficiencies through slow-motion and frame-by-frame visualization. Conclusion: Kinovea supports basic motion analysis by providing clear kinematic information and helping beginner athletes observe and refine their movement techniques. The findings also offer practical value for coaches by enabling more precise identification of inefficient patterns and guiding targeted corrections during early-stage training."

OpenAlex,deep learning,Combating Data and Target Shifts in Visual Tasks,Zhaorui Tan,10.17638/03194353,2031-01-01,University of Liverpool,"The rapid advancement of deep learning models for visual tasks has led to significant progress in many domains. However, a key challenge remains: ensuring that models can generalize effectively to unseen samples or novel classes, especially in real-world scenarios where training data-target pairs are often limited or unavailable, and test data may exhibit shifts in both data and targets. This thesis addresses the problem of shifts across data and targets, proposing novel methods to improve model generalization and transferability in complex settings. The thesis identifies the different shift scenarios for visual tasks and presents their problem forms. The research first relaxes the static target distribution assumption in Multi-Domain Generalization (mDG) tasks, introducing the General Multi-Domain Generalization (GMDG) objective to improve generalization under varying data shifts. Specifically, Extensive experiments validate that GMDG is feasible for classification, segmentation, and regression tasks. Further considering extreme target distribution shifts where even unknown novel classes emerge, the study also explores logical regularization techniques for tasks such as Generalized Category Discovery (GCD), mDG+GCD, and Class Incremental Learning (CIL), proposing a sample-based logical regularization term (L-Reg) to enhance data-, target-, and all-shift generalization. Additionally, a partial logic framework is introduced to address challenges in CIL, enabling models to retain room for unknown classes during training. This is further extended by the Partial-Logic Regularization (PL-Reg), which improves generalization across GCD, mDG+GCD, and transferability for CIL tasks. Furthermore, the thesis proposes a novel Semantic-aware Data Augmentation (SADA) framework for cross-modality generalization in text-to-image synthesis (T2Isyn), text-image retrieval (TIR), and image-text retrieval (ITR) tasks. This framework ensures semantic preservation across text and image modalities, improving both semantic consistency and image quality in cross-modality tasks. The methods proposed in this thesis offer significant advancements in visual generalization and transfer scenarios, providing theoretical insights and practical solutions for handling data shifts, target shifts, and multi-modalities in complex scenarios. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of the proposed methods, demonstrating their superior performance across a range of tasks."
OpenAlex,deep learning,Antecedents and consequences of Green-tech FDI in emerging markets,Zhuoran Liu,10.17638/03195308,2031-01-01,University of Liverpool,"As environmental pressures intensify, attracting sustainable foreign direct investment (FDI), particularly green-tech FDI, has become a critical pathway for emerging markets to achieve environmental sustainability. However, existing research remains fragmented, offering limited insights into why green-tech FDI enters emerging markets and how it affects regional green innovation. This thesis addresses these gaps by systematically examining both the antecedents and consequences of green-tech FDI through three empirical studies using regional data from China. Study 1 and Study 2 focus on the antecedents of green-tech FDI. Study 1 examines how host-country conditions can attract green-tech FDI, highlighting the role of environmental management information disclosure (EMID) by domestic firms in reducing information gaps and strengthening green market–seeking motives. Study 2 shifts attention to the active decision-making of green-tech FDI, showing that under uncertainty, green-tech foreign investors engage in identity-based bandwagon learning by imitating peers with similar green identities, thereby mitigating investment risks. Study 3 turns to the consequences of green-tech FDI. It demonstrates that, due to the technological complexity of green innovation and limited absorptive capacity in emerging markets, green-tech FDI may generate crowding-out effects rather than purely positive spillovers. Adopting a network perspective, the study further finds that universities play a key moderating role: through broad linkages and deep collaborations, they help mitigate negative spillovers and facilitate the diffusion of green technologies. Together, the three studies advance the literature on sustainable FDI by differentiating green-tech FDI from general FDI and identifying the specific mechanisms that shape its entry decisions and local innovation outcomes. Practically, the findings provide guidance for emerging-market governments and firms on how to attract and manage sustainable investment, balance growth with environmental objectives, and strengthen local innovation ecosystems."
OpenAlex,deep learning,A UAV-Based Framework for Community-Scale Residential Building Energy Modelling in China,Mengfan Jin,10.17638/03195460,2029-01-01,University of Liverpool,"With increasing emphasis on energy efficiency and carbon emission reduction in the building sector, rapid and scalable energy modelling of existing buildings is critical for retrofit projects and policy development. Conventional surveys, data collection and energy modelling processes remain labour-intensive and impractical for large-scale applications, and energy modelling often dominates project time and cost. Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) equipped with high-resolution and infrared cameras now offer fast and safe exterior surveys, showing great potential in building energy assessments. Yet, a systematic framework for UAV integration, from image capture through processing to inputs for building energy simulation, has not been established. This research addresses these challenges by developing a structured framework for community-scale building energy modelling, which integrates UAV photogrammetry to accelerate data acquisition, reduce labour, and shorten energy modelling time for retrofit projects. The framework is designed to minimise prior data requirements while maximising automation and retaining sufficient accuracy and reliability. It also addressed systemic issues, such as the lack of data necessary to fully exploit the potential of available technologies in the context of this study. To achieve this research objective, a mixed-methodology approach, combining desk studies and fieldwork, was adopted. First, a comprehensive review of UAV-based building energy studies mapped the current applications and available tools, proposing a preliminary framework. Fieldwork then encompassed a pilot study and a detailed case study. In the pilot test, a single building was surveyed to identify an optimal toolchain for flight planning, image capture, photogrammetric reconstruction, model generation, and selection of a simulation platform. The resulting refined framework was applied to a case study of a 39-building community, and it was demonstrated that further automation was necessary. The potential for automation was then further explored. Geomatic algorithms, machine learning, and deep learning techniques were compared, and the combination that best balanced accuracy and processing time was selected for 3D model generation and window-to-wall ratio (WWR) extraction. In parallel, an archetype library of residential buildings in the Hot Summer Cold Winter (HSCW) zone in China was compiled to facilitate the assignment of thermal parameters. Finally, a reusable community-scale building energy modelling (CBEM) workflow was assembled in Grasshopper using Ladybug Tools components to process the aforementioned inputs. In conclusion, this study integrates UAV photogrammetry, GIS-based geomatic algorithms, machine learning, and graphical programming to develop an UAV-CBEM framework. The outcomes establish a foundation for scalable UAV-based building energy assessments, enhancing applicability in data-limited and large-scale settings worldwide."

OpenAlex,deep learning,Unsupervised Deep-learning Methods for Low-dose Computed Tomography Reconstruction,Ran An,10.17638/03194237,2027-01-01,University of Liverpool,"Computed tomography (CT) has become an indispensable imaging technique in medical diagnostics and industrial applications, owing to its non-invasive nature and high resolution in visualizing object internal structures. While X-ray CT (X-ray computed tomography) significantly enhances lesion detection capabilities, excessive exposure to X-ray radiation raises substantial health concerns, including elevated cancer risks and potential genetic damage. Although low-dose CT (LDCT) protocols reduce radiation safety concerns, they inevitably introduce severe noise and artifacts, which might compromise diagnostic accuracy. Recent advances in supervised deep learning approaches have demonstrated remarkable success in LDCT reconstruction. However, the reliance on paired training data severely limits their deployment in practical CT applications. This fundamental constraint highlights the critical importance of developing unsupervised reconstruction methods. Although existing unsupervised LDCT methods have made notable progress, they still face challenges requiring systematic solutions. This thesis makes three contributions to advance the field of unsupervised LDCT reconstruction: 1. Current dual-domain self-supervised LDCT denoising methods typically neglect the heterogeneity of the non-stationary Gaussian noise levels in low-dose sinograms and usually treat them as common images without appropriately controlling the denoising strength. The denoisers employed by them, which are based on classic convolutional neural networks (CNN), will lead to blurring artifacts in the reconstructed images if directly used for sinogram denoising. In addition, the denoising strength in the sinogram and image domains must be well-balanced to avoid introducing over-blurring or secondary artifacts in the reconstructed images, but existing approaches do not focus on this crucial point. To address these limitations, this thesis proposes a novel end-to-end dual-domain self-supervised framework for LDCT denoising. It employs Dropblock layers to adaptively localize the effect of convolution for sinogram denoising and sets a weighted average between the denoised sinograms and their noisy counterparts to better control the denoising strength, thus effectively reducing the blurring artifacts and leading to a well-balanced dual-domain denoising. Numerical experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and superior performance of the proposed method. 2. Existing normalizing flows (NFs)-based unsupervised LDCT reconstruction methods face challenges in both image quality and computational efficiency. On one hand, they typically utilize a two-way transformation strategy between noisy images and latent variables, which could easily lead to detail loss and secondary artifacts in the reconstructed images. On the other hand, training NFs on high-resolution CT images is computationally intensive. Although conditional normalizing flows (CNFs) can mitigate computational costs by learning conditional probabilities, existing approaches rely on labeled data for conditionalization, leaving unsupervised CNFs-based LDCT reconstruction a challenge. To tackle these issues, this thesis proposes a novel unsupervised LDCT iterative reconstruction algorithm based on CNFs. The proposed method employs a strict one-way transformation strategy during the alternating optimization in the dual spaces to prevent detail loss and secondary artifacts, and proposes a novel unsupervised conditionalization strategy for CNFs, thus achieving efficient training and inference on high-resolution images. The proposed method illustrates high-quality and relatively fast unsupervised reconstruction. Experiments across two datasets demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed method by rivaling several state-of-the-art methods. 3. Current diffusion model-based LDCT reconstruction methods solely employ the prior distributions learned from normal-dose CT data but neglect the valuable priors in low-dose data, which contain information about the characteristics of low-dose noise and artifacts. In addition, their reconstruction speed suffers from multiple sampling steps, presenting low efficiency. Breaking new ground in prior utilization, this thesis proposes a novel unsupervised LDCT iterative reconstruction algorithm based on dual denoising diffusion probabilistic models (DDPM), which leverages both normal-dose and low-dose priors. Specifically, the proposed method employs two DDPMs to learn the prior distributions from normal-dose and low-dose images, respectively, and incorporates them into a joint iterative reconstruction framework. To accelerate the reconstruction, partial diffusion sampling and single-pass deterministic reconstruction strategy are utilized in the proposed method, as well as the spaced OS-SART approaches. Experiments at different dose levels demonstrate the outstanding performance and fast speed of the proposed reconstruction algorithm. Through these innovations and contributions, this thesis addresses some significant challenges in current deep-learning-based unsupervised LDCT reconstruction methods, and proposes three novel unsupervised reconstruction algorithms. The proposed methods effectively improve the performance and efficiency of LDCT reconstruction under different unsupervised learning conditions, and provide some new perspectives and inspirations for future research."
OpenAlex,deep learning,From Sparse to Dense: Label-Efficient Weakly Supervised Segmentation for Images and Videos,Jian Wang,10.17638/03195330,2027-01-01,University of Liverpool,"Obtaining high-quality annotated data has become a primary bottleneck for training deep learning models, particularly for dense prediction tasks like semantic segmentation and video salient object segmentation. The demand for meticulous, pixel-level labeling makes fully-supervised approaches prohibitively expensive and limits their scalability. This thesis directly confronts this issue by proposing and systematically investigating a label-efficient ""sparse-to-dense'' paradigm. The core objective is to develop innovative frameworks that can learn from sparse, inexpensive weak supervision—such as image-level tags or scribbles—and intelligently propagate this minimal information to generate complete, pixel-accurate dense predictions. The major part of this thesis focuses on the ""sparse-to-dense'' challenge within Weakly Supervised Semantic Segmentation (WSSS) for images, where models learn from only image-level tags. Dominant approaches rely on Class Activation Maps (CAMs) as initial object seeds. However, CAMs inherently activate only the most discriminative object regions, leading to incomplete pseudo-labels. This gives rise to the central problem of activation densification: the critical process of expanding these sparse activations to cover the full extent of an object. Our research addresses this challenge through a progressive, multi-faceted strategy. Our exploration begins with a foundational framework (C3) designed to rectify the intrinsic flaws of initial CAMs. We propose a synergistic mutual calibration method. This method leverages the discrepancies between the two maps to generate local prototypes, which are simultaneously utilized to complete missing object parts and suppress background noise, yielding a significantly more accurate and complete initial seed. This foundational work immediately reveals the limitation of single-prototype instability and its inability to capture diverse features. Building on this foundation, we then develop architecture-specific strategies to address deeper limitations of the prototype-based approach. For Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) (C4), the use of a single prototype proves insufficient to capture significant intra-class variation. In response, we introduce an Optimal Transport (OT)-assisted framework that effectively mines multiple, diverse prototypes, thereby yielding more comprehensive activation maps. However, while C4 solves the intra-class diversity problem, the inherent local context constraint of the CNN architecture becomes the new bottleneck, fundamentally limiting the quality of globally-aware feature extraction needed for optimal multi-prototype assignment. This limitation necessitates a shift in architectural focus from CNNs to Vision Transformers. In the ViT architecture (C5), a new challenge arises where the token gap between the discriminative class token and varied patch tokens leads to incomplete activation. To bridge this gap, we leverage a tailored application of Optimal Transport, where the algorithm is tasked with learning a comprehensive proxy to ensure complete object activation. Despite these architectural advances (C3-C5), the overall WSSS performance hit a ceiling. This is fundamentally limited by the sparse supervision of class labels, which cannot provide precise boundary information. To break this ceiling, our WSSS exploration culminates in a universal enhancement strategy (C6) that transcends architecture-specific designs by leveraging Visual Foundation Models (VFMs). We resolve the conflict between the discriminative nature of initial CAMs and the VFM's need for holistic prompts. By modeling the CAM foreground as a graph and employing spectral analysis, our method intelligently selects a diverse set of prompt points that represent the overall structure of the foreground object. This guides the VFM to generate superior, boundary-aware supervision that can universally enhance any WSSS pipeline. Subsequently, the thesis extends the ""sparse-to-dense'' paradigm to the dynamic domain of video, addressing Weakly Supervised Video Salient Object Segmentation (WSVSOS) (C7) from sparse scribble annotations. In this specific context, the challenge evolves into spatio-temporal densification, which requires both full-object coverage within each frame and temporal consistency across the video sequences. To this end, we introduce the core CFMR framework, which utilizes Spatio-Temporal co-regulation. This framework is subsequently enhanced (CFMR+) by integrating the VFM guidance strategy from C6, which provides high-quality spatial priors essential for ensuring both high spatial detail and inter-frame consistency. By enforcing both intra-frame and cross-frame consistency between these two streams, our method effectively propagates the sparse initial signal to generate dense and temporally coherent saliency masks. In conclusion, this thesis presents a comprehensive and cohesive investigation into label-efficient segmentation tasks, offering a suite of innovative and effective strategies for the ""sparse-to-dense'' challenge. Our work establishes a progressive roadmap that systematically overcomes architectural and semantic limitations, culminating in highly robust and generalized densification pipelines. Our extensive experimental results on standard benchmarks validate the state-of-the-art performance of these methods, providing robust solutions to a long-standing problem in the computer vision field."

In this study,experimental comparisons of large language models (LLMs), known deep learning and machinelearning algorithms are made using a dataset containing content from Twitter (X) users. Inaddition to this comparison, the LoRA (Low-Rank Adaption) strategy was applied to theDistilBERT model, one of the transformer-based large language models that forms the basis ofthe study, and the success of this fine-tuning method, which is lower cost and parameterefficient, was demonstrated. 8 different algorithms were included in the study: MachineLearning algorithms (Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machines (SVM), Random Forest,XGBoost), Deep Learning Algorithms (Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)) and Transformer-Based Algorithms (DistilBERT and DistilBERTfine-tuned with LoRA). According to the results obtained, the LoRA-supported DistilBERTalgorithm was the highest-performing algorithm with 82.38% accuracy. The results show thattransformer-based architectures are much more efficient than classical deep learning andmachine learning algorithms, especially in textual classification processes, when supported bynew methods and strategies that increase efficiency in terms of fine-tuning, such as LoRA.

OpenAlex,deep learning,Seismic source location using deep learning and a metaheuristic-optimized grid search algorithm under a sparse network in underground coal mines,Yaoqi Liu; Anye Cao; Xu Yang; Yuanzhe Zhang; Yapeng Liu; Liyuan Yu; Minghe Ju,,2026-12-01,SHILAP Revista de lepidopterología,"Accurate seismic source location is crucial for assessing rock stability and mitigating dynamic hazards in underground mining. However, high-accuracy source location remains challenging in environments with sparse geophone networks, which are typical in mining operations. The framework strategically integrates three core components in a ‘region-first, precision-later’ workflow: (1) deep learning based on multi-scale attention mechanisms for coarse region location, (2) the regulated signature distance (RSD) method for physics-guided regional refinement, and (3) the sparrow search algorithm (SSA) for metaheuristic-optimized velocity model inversion and grid search. A boundary discrete network is utilized to optimize the initial velocity model structure. The method also integrates a double-difference location technique to reduce velocity model errors. Through comparative and ablation experiments involving both simulations and field tests in coal mines, the method demonstrates superior performance, achieving significantly lower epicenter and source errors compared to traditional approaches. The proposed method distinguishes itself by offering a comprehensive, integrated solution that addresses data scarcity, model inaccuracy, and computational efficiency simultaneously in sparse network scenarios, a challenge not fully tackled by existing hybrid approaches."
OpenAlex,deep learning,DeiT-GAN: a segmentation-driven transformer framework for multi-class chest X-ray disease classification,Kavitha Subramaniam; Natesan Palanisamy,,2026-12-01,SHILAP Revista de lepidopterología,"Chest diseases pose a significant health challenges and requires earlier diagnosis. Chest X-ray (CXRs) images are globally utilized due to their accessibility and cost-effectiveness, but physical intervention is time-consuming and error-prone. Recent improvements in Artificial Intelligence (AI) have enabled faster and more accurate automated disease classification. To address the challenges of limited data and longer training time, this research employs three stage deep learning pipeline for chest disease classification:(1)Bounding box guided U-Net based segmentation to isolate disease affected region, reducing irrelevant background noise and focusing on the clinically significant area (2) Conditional Generative Adversarial Networks (cGAN) and conventional geometric transformation based augmentation technique to address the issue of limited training data and improve the model generalization, (3) attention-based classification mechanism by incorporating transformer-based models which effectively captures long range dependencies within the affected region. This method has been evaluated on two Datasets comprising 4800 images, which were generated from 880 images selected from the NIH Chest X-ray 14 data source across 8 classes through traditional and cGAN-based augmentation techniques. The U-Net + cGAN + DeiT achieves 93.23% accuracy, 93.53% precision, 93.23% recall, 93.28% F1-Score, and requires 98.08sec training time, illustrating its effectiveness in chest diseases."
OpenAlex,deep learning,CCST-KFN: a novel unsupervised urban vegetation change detection approach for high-resolution RGB remote sensing imagery,Hong Fang; Jierui Yang; Jingxi Luo; Shanchuan Guo; Pengfei Tang; Peng Zhang; Yang Tao; Lin Cao,,2026-12-01,SHILAP Revista de lepidopterología,"Accurate detection of urban vegetation changes is essential for maintaining ecological balance and promoting sustainable urban development. Deep learning has become a leading technology for urban vegetation change detection, owing to its superior performance in feature representation and detection accuracy. High-resolution RGB remote sensing imagery has emerged as the key data source for deep learning-based urban vegetation change detection, due to its fine spatial detail and lower acquisition cost compared to high-resolution multispectral imagery. However, most of the existing urban vegetation change detection methods based on deep learning are supervised and require manually annotated training samples, limiting their automation and efficiency. In this study, we proposed a novel unsupervised urban vegetation change detection approach (CCST-KFN) for high-resolution RGB remote sensing imagery. Specifically, an advanced cross-scale change sample transfer (CCST) method was developed to automatically generate reliable high-resolution training samples. It first produces medium-resolution urban vegetation changed and unchanged samples by pre-detection, leveraging the more discriminative spectral features available in medium-resolution multispectral imagery. These samples are then mapped to the high-resolution domain guided by change information. In addition, a dedicated urban vegetation change detection network by fusing domain knowledge and change features (KFN) was designed for urban vegetation change mapping. It takes as input two high-resolution RGB images and two resampled enhanced normalized difference vegetation index images, which emphasize urban vegetation by combining near-infrared, red, and blue bands. This enables the network to effectively exploit the comprehensive features and domain knowledge of urban vegetation changes. Experiments on three typical urban datasets demonstrate that the proposed CCST-KFN identified urban vegetation changes more completely and with fewer errors compared to seven unsupervised change detection methods. Moreover, its application to a representative urban area in Nanjing City, China, further validates its practical effectiveness. Overall, the proposed CCST-KFN offers a reliable and automated solution for accurate urban vegetation change detection using high-resolution RGB remote sensing imagery, with the potential to further support urban ecological security and sustainable development."
OpenAlex,deep learning,Interpretable image deblurring with ISTA_inspired deep network (ISTA_Deblurnet),Guoqiang Dong; Lijing Bu; Zhengpeng Zhang; Guangchun Liu,,2026-12-01,SHILAP Revista de lepidopterología,"Image deblurring algorithms can be broadly categorized into iterative algorithms that solve mathematical models and deep learning algorithms. Iterative algorithms regularize sparsity, with prior knowledge typically set manually, leading to limited applicability. In contrast, deep learning algorithms design networks based on empirical experience, resulting in poor interpretability. To address these issues, this paper proposes an interpretable deep learning network for image deblurring, named ISTA-DeblurNet. Inspired by the Iterative Shrinkage-Thresholding Algorithm, ISTA-DeblurNet employs nonlinear transformations to replace the L1 norm regularization term in deregularized models. Parameters such as nonlinear transformations, shrinkage thresholds, and regularization coefficients in ISTA-DeblurNet are learned end-to-end rather than set manually. This algorithm combines iterative methods with neural network structures, enhancing the interpretability of deep learning networks while improving the performance of iterative algorithms."
OpenAlex,deep learning,An Assessment on the Formative Feedback Practices among Teacher Education Teachers through the Lens of Student: A Convergent Parallel Study,A. C. (Angel) Galvan; J. B. (Jobelle) Jajalla,,2026-11-01,Neliti,"This study aimed to explore the level and impact of formative feedback practices among teacher education teachers, as perceived by Bachelor of Elementary Education (BEED) students. Using a convergent parallel mixed methods design, the research combined both quantitative and qualitative data to provide a deeper understanding of student experiences. A total of 153 BEED students participated in the quantitative strand through purposive sampling, while seven students took part in in-depth interviews and another seven joined a focus group discussion for the qualitative strand. The quantitative findings showed a very high level of formative feedback practices, suggesting that students regularly receive feedback that supports their learning, self-regulation, and instructional growth. Qualitative insights revealed that students especially valued feedback that was clear, timely, and constructive, as it helped them reflect and grow as future educators. Together, the integrated results emphasized the powerful role of intentional and structured feedback in shaping effective teaching and meaningful learning experiences. The study concludes by recommending enhanced training for teacher educators, fostering feedback-rich classrooms, and involving students in co-creating feedback practices to ensure continuous academic and professional development."
