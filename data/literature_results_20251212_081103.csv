PubMed,aortic stenosis,Comparison of Diagnostic Parameters Using Cardiac CT-derived Aortic Valve Area and Aortic Valve Calcium Scores for Low-Gradient Aortic Stenosis.,Syed Ahmad; HangYu Watson; Maan Awad; Philippe Pibarot; Jonathon Leipsic; Seher Berzingi; Kunal Patel; Sameh Nassar; Basel Abdelazeem; Sudarshan Balla; Irfan Zeb,10.1148/ryct.250071,2025-12,Radiology. Cardiothoracic imaging,"Purpose To compare the performance of cardiac CT-derived hybrid aortic valve area (AVA) and planimetry, in combination with aortic valve calcium (AVC) or AVC density (AVCd), for assessing low-gradient aortic stenosis (LGAS). Materials and Methods This retrospective analysis included patients with LGAS (mean gradient < 40 mm Hg) who underwent echocardiography and cardiac CT from November 2018 to March 2022. The performance of absolute and indexed hybrid AVA and planimetry, combined with either absolute AVC or AVCd, was compared by time-to-event analysis and outcome classification ability. Results A total of 215 patients (mean age, 79.2 years ± 8.4 [SD]; 118 male patients) were included in the study. Of these, 74.4% (160 of 215) experienced a composite outcome of valve intervention or all-cause mortality during follow-up. Specifically, 11% (23 of 215) underwent surgical aortic valve replacement, 59% (126 of 215) underwent transcatheter aortic valve replacement, and 15% (32 of 215) died. The median follow-up duration was 478 days (IQR, 283-716 days). Indexed AVA measures performed better than absolute AVA. All models showed comparable discrimination, as measured by Harrell C statistic. The highest performing model was indexed AVA calculated using left ventricular outflow tract area derived from minimum CT diameter combined with absolute AVC (hazard ratio, 2.29; 95% CI: 1.66, 3.15; P < .001; C statistic, 0.60). The lowest performing model was absolute AVA planimetry with AVCd (hazard ratio, 1.62; 95% CI: 1.19, 2.22; P = .002; C statistic, 0.55). Conclusion Diagnostic strategies involving hybrid AVA and AVC or AVCd demonstrated comparable performance in LGAS assessment. Indexed hybrid AVA measures performed better alone or in combination with AVC compared with the absolute AVA measures.

PubMed,aortic stenosis,Multimodal deep learning model for enhanced early detection of aortic stenosis integrating ECG and chest x-ray with cooperative learning.,Shun Nagai; Makoto Nishimori; Masakazu Shinohara; Hidekazu Tanaka; Hiromasa Otake,10.3389/fradi.2025.1698680,2025,Frontiers in radiology,"Aortic stenosis (AS) is diagnosed by echocardiography, the current gold standard, but examinations are often performed only after symptoms emerge, highlighting the need for earlier detection. Recently, artificial intelligence (AI)-based screening using non-invasive and widely available modalities such as electrocardiography (ECG) and chest x-ray(CXR) has gained increasing attention for valvular heart disease. However, single-modality approaches have inherent limitations, and in clinical practice, multimodality assessment is common. In this study, we developed a multimodal AI model integrating ECG and CXR within a cooperative learning framework to evaluate its utility for earlier detection of AS.
We retrospectively analyzed 23,886 patient records from 7,483 patients who underwent ECG, CXR, and echocardiography. A multimodal model was developed by combining a 1D ResNet50-Transformer architecture for ECG data with an EfficientNet-based architecture for CXR. Cooperative learning was implemented using a loss function that allowed the ECG and CXR models to refine each other's predictions. We split the dataset into training, validation, and test sets, and performed 1,000 bootstrap iterations to assess model stability. AS was defined echocardiographically as peak velocity ≥2.5 m/s, mean pressure gradient ≥20 mmHg, or aortic valve area ≤1.5 cm2.
Among 7,483 patients, 608 (8.1%) were diagnosed with AS. The multimodal model achieved a test AUROC of 0.812 (95% CI: 0.792-0.832), outperforming the ECG model (0.775, 95% CI: 0.753-0.796) and the CXR model (0.755, 95% CI: 0.732-0.777). Visualization techniques (Grad-CAM, Transformer attention) highlighted distinct yet complementary features in AS patients.
The multimodal AI model via cooperative learning outperformed single-modality methods in AS detection and may aid earlier diagnosis and reduce clinical burden."

Although TAVR significantly improves the survival and symptoms of patients with aortic stenosis, this population is generally characterized by advanced age, frailty, and multiple comorbidities, posing challenges to postoperative functional recovery and quality of life improvement. Cardiac rehabilitation (CR) constitutes a cornerstone of secondary prevention for cardiovascular disease (CVD), and plays a pivotal role in optimizing outcomes for patients undergoing TAVR. This review aims to discuss the mechanistic, current practical evidence, existing challenges, and future directions of CR in TAVR patients."

This study developed a standardized ovine aortic stenosis (AS) model through surgical implantation of a circular bioengineered annular stent in the aortic root, creating a reproducible pathomimetic platform for TAVI evaluation. Following hemodynamic stabilization, TAVI procedures were performed to systematically assess mid-to-long-term valve functionality and calcification progression.
AS model was established in 11 sheep using extracorporeal circulation assistance technology. Following hemodynamic stabilization (2-4 weeks), TAVI was performed. The modeled sheep were divided into two groups to monitor valve conditions at 3 months (n = 6) and 6 months (n = 5), respectively. Additionally, a non-modeled control group was established, with valve conditions assessed at 3 months (n = 2) and 6 months (n = 1). Preoperative ultrasound data, collected on the day of TAVI, which served as the baseline. Key hemodynamic parameters including blood flow velocity, transvalvular pressure gradient, and left ventricular ejection fraction were measured at 30, 90, and 180 days postoperatively, in accordance with Valve Academic Research Consortium-3 (VARC-3), to evaluate temporal changes in hemodynamics. The effects of the AS model on valve function were further analyzed by integrating final histopathological findings and calcification degree outcomes.
Successful AS model establishment was achieved in all 11 sheep, with significant increases in mean transvalvular pressure gradient (Δ+17.98 ± 12.71 mmHg) and peak flow velocity observed post-modeling (Δ+ 2.23 ± 0.38 m/s). Post-TAVI evaluation demonstrated progressive hemodynamic normalization, achieving pre-modeling levels (1.72 vs. 6.91 mmHg, P = 0.058/0.80 vs. 1.51 m/s, P = 0.065) at 180-day follow-up. LVEF remained stable throughout the experimental period. Histopathological analysis indicated comparable calcification burden between 90 and 180 days (Calcium Content: P = 0.7459 and Calcification Score: P = 0.5455).
The surgically induced ovine AS model effectively replicates clinically relevant hemodynamic perturbations while maintaining excellent procedural feasibility. TAVI in this model achieves complete hemodynamic normalization without accelerating bioprosthetic valve degeneration or calcification. This standardized preclinical platform enables rigorous evaluation of TAVI device performance and durability, providing robust scientific validation for translational applications."
PubMed,aortic stenosis,Clinical outcomes of monitored anesthesia care vs. general anesthesia in transfemoral transcatheter aortic valve implantation: a single-center retrospective study.,Haoran Zhang; Tao Chen; Bo Yu; Donghui Zhang,10.3389/fcvm.2025.1652045,2025,Frontiers in cardiovascular medicine,"Transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) has become a preferred treatment for severe aortic stenosis in high-risk patients. In China, general anesthesia (GA) remains the standard; however, monitored anesthesia care (MAC) offers a less-invasive alternative. In this study, we compared the outcomes between MAC and GA in transfemoral TAVI.
We retrospectively analyzed the data from 106 consecutive patients (54 MAC, 52 GA) who underwent TAVI at a The Second Affiliated Hospital of Harbin Medical University from January 2021 to November 2023. MAC involved administration of a combination of local anesthesia with dexmedetomidine/remifentanil sedation, whereas GA involved endotracheal intubation. We compared procedural metrics, complications, and lengths of hospital stays.
The baseline characteristics were comparable between the groups (mean age: 70.3 ± 7.3 years, 46% with reduced ejection fraction). The MAC group showed shorter procedure times (102 ± 25 vs. 145 ± 42 min, p < 0.0001) and hospital stays (10.5 ± 3.7 vs. 14.1 ± 5.1 days, p < 0.0001), compared with the GA group. Safety outcomes were similar between the groups: 30-day mortality (5.8% vs. 7.4% in the MAC and GA groups, respectively, p = 0.734), stroke (1.9% in both groups), and major vascular complications (3.8% vs. 5.6%). The GA group had higher valve-in-valve rates (13% vs. 1.9%, p = 0.024) and postoperative hypotension (4 vs. 0 patients), compared with the MAC group. Pacemaker implantation was more frequent in the MAC group vs. the GA group (13% vs. 3.8%, p = 0.229).
The use of MAC for TAVI is comparably safe to using GA, with potential advantages in recovery speed and resource utilization. A heart team approach, including cardiac anesthesiologists, is critical for optimal patient selection."

Case reports,"Pan-valvular heart disease involving both native and prosthetic valves is rare and challenging to manage, especially in frail patients with limited treatment options.
A 74-year-old woman on dialysis with prior tricuspid and pulmonary bioprosthetic valve replacements presented with abdominal pain, diarrhoea, dyspnoea, and progressive jaundice. Echocardiography revealed severe aortic stenosis (AS) with pulmonary and tricuspid bioprosthetic valve dysfunction. Right heart catheterization confirmed significant pressure gradients and low cardiac index. Due to financial constraints and the high surgical risk, transcatheter valve-in-valve procedures and surgical treatment were not pursued. Instead, balloon valvuloplasty was performed on all three valves, resulting in transient haemodynamic improvement and bilirubin reduction. The patient later died from complications.
This case illustrates the balloon valvuloplasty as a palliative option in pan-valvular heart disease when definitive therapies are inaccessible. Such cases highlight a need for individualized, multidisciplinary care."

However, it remains unclear how the biological state of EAT is related to AV hemodynamics.
We studied 50 patients with AV calcification who underwent elective cardiac surgery (cardiac valve surgery and/or coronary artery bypass graft). Echocardiographic data (AV area index [AVAI] and peak transvalvular AV velocity [PAVV]), were acquired before surgery. During cardiac surgery, 2 EAT samples were obtained for immunohistochemistry and the number of CD68- and CD11c-positive macrophages and osteocalcin-positive cells was counted in 6 random high-power fields (×400 magnification). PAVV, but not AVAI, was positively correlated with the number of CD11c-positive macrophages and osteocalcin-positive cells in EAT in patients with clinical AV stenosis (AS), defined as PAVV ≥2.5 m/s. On multivariate analysis adjusted for left ventricular function, the number of osteocalcin-positive cells in EAT was independently correlated with increased PAVV (β=0.42; P=0.013) and the presence of clinical AS (odds ratio per 1-unit increase 1.14; P=0.011), whereas there was no correlation between increased PAVV or the presence of clinical AS and the number of CD68- and CD11c-positive macrophages in EAT.
The biological activities of EAT, which are characterized mainly by osteogenic activity, are associated with AV hemodynamics and may contribute to AS progression."

Low-flow, low-gradient (LFLG) aortic stenosis (AS) and chronic kidney disease (CKD) represent a high-risk subset of patients undergoing TAVR. The objective of this study was to evaluate the prognostic impact of LFLG-AS and AKI in CKD patients undergoing TAVR.
A retrospective analysis was conducted on 324 patients with CKD stage G3a-5 who underwent TAVR for severe AS between August 2015 and December 2022. Patients were stratified into 4 groups according to the presence of LFLG- AS and AKI. The primary endpoint was defined as all-cause mortality or heart failure during the 2-year follow-up period. During a median period of 13 months, 46 (14%) patients reached the primary endpoint. The difference between the baseline values for renal function of the patients with AKI or without AKI was not significant. The patients without either condition who had the most favorable outcomes were those without LFLG-AS or AKI. Patients with LFLG-AS only or AKI only had intermediate outcomes. The patients with LFLG-AS and AKI showed significantly higher mortality and adverse outcomes than the other groups (log-rank P<0.001).
This study highlighted the severe prognostic implications of AKI for patients with LFLG-AS who undergo TAVR."

We describe a case of an 80-year-old female patient with a history of severe aortic stenosis and hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy that underwent aortic valve replacement and myectomy. The patient presented with acute pulmonary edema and low blood pressure due to LVOTO and SAM post cardiac surgery in the intensive care unit. She was paced with an epicardial dual-chamber pacing system due to complete atrioventricular block and treated initially with norepinephrine, furosemide, and esmolol infusion and continuous positive pressure ventilation. The patient remained hypoxemic and kept deteriorating hemodynamically despite titrating up norepinephrine. The addition of vasopressin infusion and tapering of norepinephrine finally stabilized the patient with significant reduction of LVOTO, confirmed by transthoracic echocardiography assessment, improved oxygenation and increased urine output.
Vasopressin seems to be the preferred vasopressor for managing LVOTO and SAM post-cardiac surgery, because of its absence of inotropic effects. Echocardiography is crucial for early diagnosis and therapeutic management."

Epicardial adipose tissue (EAT), a metabolically active visceral fat depot surrounding the myocardium, has emerged as a potential biomarker and therapeutic target in this population. EAT influences myocardial and valvular pathology through mechanical compression, metabolic alterations, and secretion of inflammatory mediators such as IL-6, MCP-1, and TNF-α, contributing to left ventricular remodeling and aortic valve degeneration. Recent metabolomic studies demonstrate significant associations between EAT thickness and both positively and negatively correlated metabolites, underscoring its complex role in disease progression. Despite its promise, challenges remain due to limited understanding of EAT-myocardium interactions, variable patient presentation, and confounding factors such as insulin resistance and obesity. Further research is warranted to clarify EAT's pathophysiological role, prognostic value, and therapeutic potential in managing paradoxical LFLG ASpEF."

No dedicated framework currently exists for AR. We aimed to characterize the extent and prognostic implications of multistructural cardiac damage in patients with moderate or greater AR.
We retrospectively analyzed 432 adult patients with ≥ moderate AR who underwent transthoracic echocardiography at Cleveland Clinic between 2008 and 2021. Cardiac damage was staged hierarchically from no damage (stage 0) to right ventricular dysfunction (stage 3) based on echocardiographic assessment of left ventricular (LV) global longitudinal strain, LV ejection fraction, chamber dimensions, valvular abnormalities, pulmonary pressures, and right ventricular function. The primary endpoint was a composite of all-cause mortality and heart failure hospitalization.
Over a median follow-up of 5.2 years (interquartile range, 1.9-9.3 years), advancing cardiac damage stage was associated with worsening LV function, progressive atrial and ventricular remodeling, and elevated pulmonary pressures (p < 0.001 for all trends). Five-year cumulative incidence of the primary endpoint increased from 3.8% in stage 0 (n = 28), 17.3% in stage 1 (n = 101), 26.2% in stage 2 (n = 210) to 60.7% in stage 3 (n = 93). In multivariable Cox analysis, each stage increment portended a significantly higher risk of adverse outcomes (hazard ratio 2.1 per stage; 95% CI, 1.6-2.6; p < 0.0001).
In patients with moderate or greater AR, the burden of cardiac damage incrementally stratified long-term risk. A dedicated staging model specific to AR may refine prognostic assessment and support earlier aortic valve interventions."

To date, there are no quantitative tools capable of evaluating patient experience adapted to percutaneous procedures of this nature. The goal of this study is to propose and validate the VALVEX questionnaire as the reference tool to assess patient experience throughout the TAVI process and to identify areas for improvement in healthcare. Methods: This was a cross-sectional observational study with a 30-day follow-up that included consecutive patients > 18 years of age undergoing elective TAVI in two Spanish hospitals. A multidisciplinary panel including patients was constituted to design, refine, and pilot the VALVEX questionnaire. During its completion 30 days after the procedure, the dimensions assessed were the care provided before, during, and after TAVI, as well as the facilities and overall patient satisfaction. Reliability, validity, and feasibility were analysed during the validation phase. Results: A total of 335 patients were enrolled and filled out the VALVEX questionnaire (mean age 81.1 ± 5 years, 52% female). Evaluation of feasibility showed a mean completion time of 7.8 ± 2.3 min, with a 2.1% rate of unanswered questions. Cronbach's alpha index was 0.912, with high internal reliability measurements for all the assessed dimensions. An intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) of 0.851 was determined as an indicator of stability. The Delphi panel achieved a consensus of over 85% in clarity, coherence, relevance, and sufficiency. Conclusions: We have successfully validated the VALVEX questionnaire as the first quantitative tool specifically designed to measure and evaluate patient experience throughout the TAVI procedure and recovery. This questionnaire is a valid, reliable, simple, and easy-to-use resource that could be used as a reference tool to assess patient experience for TAVI or other percutaneous cardiac interventions."

Coexisting myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) with severe thrombocytopenia further increases the perioperative bleeding risk, which we considered particularly important in the anesthetic planning for this patient. We report a case of laparoscopic anterior resection in a patient with severe AS and thrombocytopenia, highlighting a transfusion strategy adjusted according to the patient's response and remimazolam-based anesthesia. To the best of our knowledge, there have been no previous reports describing remimazolam-based total intravenous anesthesia achieving stable hemodynamics without vasopressor support in a patient with severe AS and MDS-related thrombocytopenia. Method: A 78-year-old man with previously diagnosed MDS and chronic pancytopenia, whose baseline platelet counts (PLTs) ranged from 20,000 to 40,000/μL, was found to have severe AS (aortic valve area, 0.73 cm2; mean pressure gradient, 42 mmHg) during preoperative evaluation for laparoscopic anterior resection. After platelet transfusions titrated to his response, the patient's PLT increased to 93,000/μL before surgery. Anesthesia was induced and maintained with remimazolam and remifentanil, which were chosen to prevent afterload reduction associated with propofol. Results: Hemodynamics, including arterial pressure, cardiac index, systemic vascular resistance index, and cerebral oxygen saturation, remained stable without vasopressor support. Transient systolic hypertension during surgical stimulation was controlled using remifentanil titration and esmolol. Recovery and the postoperative course were uneventful, and the patient was discharged in a stable condition. Conclusions: Remimazolam-based total intravenous anesthesia can provide hemodynamic stability without vasopressors in high-risk patients with severe AS, and a transfusion strategy adjusted step by step according to the patient's response can be effective for optimizing PLTs while minimizing the transfusion-related risks of MDS-associated thrombocytopenia."

We aimed to determine the benefit of HFNO in preventing the occurrence of desaturations during TAVR. Methods: An investigator-initiated, proof of concept, single-centre, randomised, and controlled trial on 132 adult patients who were scheduled to undergo transfemoral TAVR was conducted. Patients were randomised (1:1) to HFNO (H-group) with a flow rate of 50 L min-1 and FiO2 0.6 or standard of care oxygen therapy (S-group). The primary endpoint was the number of patients with a desaturation episode (SpO2 < 93%) for >10 s during TAVR. Secondary outcomes included arterial partial pressure of oxygen (pO2) 45 min from sedation start and changes in glomerular filtration rate from baseline to 12 h post-procedure. Results: Between 23 November and 24 July, a per-protocol analysis was performed in a total of 125 patients (H-group n = 64; S- group n = 61; 49 females). The number of patients with any desaturation episode was significantly lower in the H-group [13/64 (20%, 95% CI: 12-32%)] than in the S-group [31/61 (51%, 95% CI: 39-63%), RR: 0.39 (95%CI: 0.23-0.68)]. At 45 min, mean (SD) pO2 was higher in the H-group (24(9.8) kPa vs. 16.7(7.5) kPa; p < 0.005). A significant improvement in delta median (IQR) difference on glomerular filtration rate was observed in the H-group [1.6(-1-7.9) mL min-1 1.73 m-2] with respect to the S-group [0.2(-6.1-3.1) mL min-1 1.73 m-2; p-value: 0.013]. Conclusions: This trial demonstrated that HFNO provides a better oxygenation pattern than standard oxygen therapy during TAVR.

We developed an automated workflow using large language models (LLMs) to replicate Heart Team risk assessment. Methods: We retrospectively analyzed 231 consecutive patients with severe aortic stenosis evaluated by multidisciplinary Heart Teams (January 2022-December 2024). An automated system using GPT-4o was developed, comprising the following: (1) structured data extraction from clinical dossiers; (2) EuroSCORE II calculation via two methods (algorithmic vs. LLM-based); (3) clinical vignette generation; and (4) risk stratification comparing EuroSCORE-based thresholds versus guideline-integrated LLM approaches with/without EuroSCORE values. The primary endpoint was the risk stratification accuracy of each method compared to Heart Team decisions. Results: Mean age was 79.5 ± 7.7 years, with 58.4% female. The automated workflow processed patients in 32.6 ± 6.4 s. The LLM-calculated EuroSCORE II showed a lower mean difference from Heart Team values (-1.42%, 95% CI -2.32 to -0.53) versus algorithmic calculation (-1.88%, 95% CI -2.38 to -1.38). For risk stratification, the guideline-integrated LLM without EuroSCORE achieved the highest accuracy (90.0%) and AUC (0.93), outperforming both the EuroSCORE-based (accuracy 50.2% for high-risk, AUC 0.63) and guideline-integrated LLM with EuroSCORE approaches (accuracy 82.4%, AUC 0.76). However, systematic hallucinations occurred for cardiovascular risk factors when data were missing. Conclusions: LLMs accurately calculated EuroSCORE II and achieved 90% concordance with multidisciplinary Heart Team decisions.

Methods: Data on consecutive patients undergoing SAVR or transfemoral TAVI between 2017 and 2022 were collected. Patients were separated into three groups according to the type of prosthesis: a biological surgical prosthesis, BE prosthesis and SE prosthesis. The three groups were compared in terms of baseline characteristics, post-procedural outcomes and long-term survival. Results: A total of 542 patients were enrolled, and 221 received a surgical prothesis, 150 received a BE prosthesis and 171 received an SE prosthesis. TAVI patients were older and had a higher risk profile compared to surgical patients. Propensity score matching resulted in an excellent matching of nearly 80 patients in each group. In the matched cohort, SE prostheses were associated with a significantly higher incidence of stroke (SE group 6.3%, BE group 0, SAVR group 2.3%, p = 0.045), para-valvular leak (SE group 8.1%, BE group 2.4%, SAVR group 0, p = 0.017) and left bundle branch block (SE group 23.8%, BE group 18.2%, SAVR group 0%, p < 0.001). Regarding 5-year mortality, no significant differences were reported between the BE and SE TAVI (13.6% vs. 22.5%, p = 0.066). However, when comparing surgery versus TAVI, the SE prosthesis showed a significantly higher 5-year mortality (22.5% vs. 11.6%, p = 0.042). Instead, the BE prosthesis demonstrated its non-inferiority compared to the surgical prosthesis (13.6% vs. 11.6%, p = 0.249). Conclusions: The BE prosthesis should be considered the prosthesis of choice for patients with a long life expectancy requiring a transcatheter procedure."

The objective of the study was to examine trends in mortality related to AS in the United States (U.S.). Methods: The U.S. CDC WONDER dataset was analyzed, extracting age-adjusted mortality rates (AAMR) per 100,000 and calculating annual percentage change (APC) through Joinpoint regression. The results were stratified to identify temporal, sex-specific, racial/ethnic, and regional differences. Results: From 1999 to 2020, 267,515 deaths among older adults (>65 years old) were attributed to AS, with the AAMR declining from 28.00 to 23.69. Males had a higher AAMR (30.35) compared to females (27.42), though more deaths occurred in females (164,104 vs. 103,411). Non-Hispanic (NH) Whites exhibited the greatest AAMR (31.61), trailed by NH American Indian/Alaska Native individuals (16.62), whereas NH Asians/Pacific Islanders had the least (11.50). Significant state-wise variations were noted, with AAMRs ranging from 60.55 in Oregon to 17.23 in Mississippi, and 19 states depicting a concerning rise over the study duration. Regionally, the Northeast (32.09) had the highest AAMRs, while the South (23.06) had the lowest. Micropolitan (32.28) and noncore (28.43) areas reported higher AAMRs compared to large central metropolitan areas (24.32). Conclusions: While there is a trend towards decreased mortality due to AS in the U.S., significant disparities based on race, sex, and region persist and may be worsening. The underlying causes of these discrepancies require further investigation, and targeted strategies must be developed to address them effectively."

Although inter-ethnic differences exist, Lp(a) level ≥50 mg/dL is commonly reported to indicate elevated cardiovascular risk. Blood Lp(a) levels are largely determined based on genetic background, and the kringle IV type 2 repeat variant is a major factor. Lp(a) is structurally similar to low-density lipoprotein (LDL) but also contains apolipoprotein(a) (apo(a)), which includes kringle domains associated with diverse effects depending on particles and individuals. The LDL-like property of Lp(a) and effect of apo(a) on vascular cells can promote atherosclerosis. Apo(a) competes with plasminogen and can inhibit the role of plasmin during fibrinolysis. Furthermore, oxidized phospholipids on apo(a) may induce oxidative stress to enhance atherosclerosis and can affect valve calcification. Trials on new therapeutics targeting Lp(a) RNA, including antisense oligonucleotide (e.g., pelacarsen), siRNAs (e.g., olpasiran, lepodisiran, and zerlasiran), and small molecules (e.g., muvalaplin), are under way. Depending on the study or dose, these agents lowered Lp(a) levels by 80-100% compared with the control; however, results of clinical outcomes have yet to be reported."

Case reports,"Transcatheter aortic valve implantation is technically challenging in patients with predominant aortic regurgitation and preexisting mitral prosthetic heart valve.
To the best of our knowledge, this is the first reported case in which transcatheter aortic valve implantation was successfully performed for predominant severe aortic regurgitation with a history of 3 prior sternotomies: successively for mitral valve replacement with a Starr-Edwards valve, tricuspid valve repair, and subsequently tricuspid valve replacement.
This patient had large aortic annulus dimensions. Noticing predominant aortic regurgitation and mild valvular calcium, we were aiming at 15% to 20% oversizing of the transcatheter valve, which was achievable by overfilling the largest balloon-expandable valve. Having an incomplete understanding of potential aortomitral interaction based on computed tomography and echocardiography, we inflated a balloon at the aortic valve, which revealed significant interaction, leading us to use a self-expanding valve that had limited oversizing.
Identifying the aortomitral interaction in such cases can potentially avoid transcatheter aortic valve embolization."

Clinical, electrocardiographic and echocardiographic data in these patients were collected prospectively from March 2020 to August 2021 at Chris Hani Baragwanath Academic Hospital prosthetic valve clinic.
The study included 186 participants with a median (interquartile range (IQR)) age of 52 (41 - 60) years. Of these, 96% were of black African ethnicity (79% female). The median (IQR) body mass index (BMI) among participants was 27 (23.5 - 30.4) kg/m2, with 29% of participants classified as obese (BMI >30 kg/m2). Eighty-two percent of patients had New York Heart Association class 1 dyspnoea. The most common complications were atrial fibrillation (AF, 39%), heart failure (HF, 25%) and stroke (13%). There were two cases of previously documented prosthetic valve thrombosis, two cases of prosthetic valve endocarditis, two of paravalvular regurgitation and one with structural valve deterioration. Seventy percent of patients had subtherapeutic international normalised ratios (INRs), with a median (IQR) INR of 2.55 (2.03 - 2.92). Forty-seven percent of patients had a left ventricular ejection fraction (EF) of <40%. Seventy-four percent of participants were on some combination of guideline-directed medical therapy for HF with reduced EF, although only 12% were on at least three medications. Pulmonary hypertension was present in 37% of patients, with a median (IQR) pulmonary artery systolic pressure of 28.5 (17 - 41) mmHg. Tricuspid annuloplasty ring was noted in a minority (12 patients).

Case reports,"Mechanical circulatory support devices, such as microaxial flow pumps (mAFP), are used in the management of cardiogenic shock, particularly in the setting of ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction. While these devices are potentially life-saving, their use is not without risk and might be associated with rare but serious complications, including structural cardiac injury.
We report the case of a 41-year-old male with known polysubstance abuse who experienced an out-of-hospital cardiac arrest due to ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction. Following successful return of spontaneous circulation and emergent percutaneous coronary intervention, a mAFP was implanted for haemodynamic stabilization. Echocardiographic monitoring initially confirmed correct positioning without evidence of valvular dysfunction. However, on Day 4, imaging revealed entrapment of the mAFP within the mitral valve's subvalvular apparatus. Following careful device explantation, the patient showed new-onset severe mitral regurgitation (MR) due to posterior leaflet chordal rupture. Transoesophageal echocardiography confirmed a flail P3 segment. The presence of severe MR hindered adequate recompensation and complicated the weaning process from ventilatory support. The immediately consulted multidisciplinary Heart Team recommended early surgical intervention. The patient subsequently underwent successful mitral valve repair, resulting in clinical stabilization and eventual discharge to a rehabilitation facility in improved condition.
This case highlights a potential rare iatrogenic complication of mAFP support and emphasizes the necessity of meticulous echocardiographic surveillance, timely recognition of complications, and guideline-based multidisciplinary decision-making in the management of critically ill patients."

Preoperative LV end-systolic diameter (LVESD) and LV ejection fraction (LVEF) are used in guidelines as indices for LV dysfunction, with cut-off values of 60% for LVEF and 40 mm for LVESD. However, these factors have received little validation in Japanese patients.
We evaluated preoperative echocardiographic data in 322 Japanese patients who underwent MV repair for DMR to identify factors associated with postoperative LV dysfunction. Postoperative LV dysfunction was observed in 31 (10%) patients, who had greater LVESD (39±6 mm vs. 33±5 mm; P<0.001) and lower LVEF (62±5% vs. 67±5%; P<0.001) preoperatively, compared with the non-LV dysfunction group. The optimal threshold of preoperative LVESD and LVEF for predicting postoperative LV dysfunction in receiver operating characteristic curve analysis was 36 mm (AUC=0.819; P<0.001) and 61% (AUC=0.706; P<0.001), respectively. Kaplan-Meier analysis showed a significantly lower rate of avoided adverse cardiac events in the LV dysfunction group (P<0.001).
The criteria for LVESD in MV repair in patients with DMR should be lower than the values indicated by the guidelines. Adoption of these revised criteria may improve prognosis after surgery in Japanese patients."

Left atrial volume index and strain parameters were evaluated preoperatively and 1 year postoperatively. Predictors of postoperative left atrial enlargement (left atrial volume index ≥34 mL/m2) were assessed by logistic regression and receiver operating characteristic analyses. Postoperatively, left atrial volume index decreased significantly (from 64.4±23.1 to 36.6±10.5 mL/m2; P<0.01) and there was a significant decline in left atrial strain parameters.

We retrospectively reviewed 1,410 consecutive patients who underwent initial catheter ablation for AF at Kobe University Hospital between January 2014 and December 2022. Of these patients, 56 (4%; mean [±SD] age 68±8 years; 68% male) had significant (moderate, n=48; severe, n=8) atrial FMR based on pre-ablation transesophageal echocardiography. At follow-up echocardiography, a reduction in the left atrial diameter (LAd) was observed in 30 patients, whereas improvement in mitral regurgitation (MR) was noted in 26. During a mean follow-up period of 835 days, AF recurred in 23 (41%) patients. Kaplan-Meier curves for AF recurrence did not differ based on LAd reductions or MR improvements alone. However, recurrence rates were significantly lower in patients who achieved both LAd reduction and MR improvement than in those who did not achieve both changes (P=0.0259). Multivariate analysis revealed that the combination of LAd reduction and MR improvement was the only significant predictor of a decrease in AF recurrence (hazard ratio 0.275; 95% confidence interval 0.091-0.826; P=0.021).
In AF patients with significant atrial FMR, achieving both LAd reduction and MR improvement after ablation is important to reduce the risk of AF recurrence."

In its severe, untreated form, MR is associated with high morbidity and mortality. Current therapeutic approaches include pharmacological management, surgical interventions, and emerging transcatheter mitral valve repair (TMVR) techniques. While medical therapy provides symptomatic relief, it lacks disease-modifying effects in advanced cases. Surgical repair or replacement remains the gold standard; however, it is often unsuitable for high-risk or inoperable patients. TMVR has emerged as a transformative, minimally invasive alternative, offering improved outcomes with reduced procedural risks. Devices such as MitraClip, Cardio band, and other novel TMVR technologies have demonstrated encouraging results in clinical trials, improving survival rates and quality of life. Despite its advantages, challenges such as anatomical variability, device durability, and long-term efficacy remain. With continuous technological advancements, optimized patient selection, and collaborative efforts in research and innovation, TMVR is poised to revolutionize the management of MR, bridging the gap between conventional surgery and medical therapy.

To develop AI algorithms for standardizing M-TEER eligibility assessment using TTE and TEE echocardiograms, supporting all stages of mitral valve regurgitation evaluation to assist non-expert centers throughout the entire process, from severe mitral valve regurgitation diagnostic to M-TEER procedure.
Three deep learning algorithms were developed using echocardiographic data from M-TEER patients performed at Montreal Heart Institute (2018-2025). 1. ECHO-PREP was trained to identify key diagnostic views in TTE (n = 530) and diagnostic and procedural views in TEE (n = 2,222) examinations to determine the level of quality images needed to do a M-TEER. 2. 4D TEE segmentation with automated mitral valve area (MVA) quantification (n = 221), and 3. 2D TEE scallop-level segmentation of leaflets and sub-valvular structures (n = 992).
Preliminary results on test sets showed 95.7% accuracy in TTE view classification and 91% accuracy for TEE view classification. The 4D segmentation module demonstrated excellent agreement with manual MVA measurements (R = 0.84, p < 0.001), successfully discriminating patients undergoing M-TEER from those referred for surgical replacement (p = 0.046 for AI predictions). The 2D scallop-level analysis achieved a mean Dice score of 0.534 across 11 anatomical structures, with better performance in commonly represented configurations (e.g., A2-P2, P1-A2-P3).
ECHO-PREP demonstrates the feasibility of an integrated AI-assisted workflow for MR assessment, combining quality control, dynamic 4D valve quantification, and scallop-level anatomy interpretation.

PubMed,mitral regurgitation,Does Preliminary Chest Shape Assessment Improve the Prognostic Risk Stratification of Symptomatic Individuals with Primary Mitral Regurgitation? A Narrative Review of Traditional and Innovative Prognostic Indicators.,Andrea Sonaglioni; Gian Luigi Nicolosi; Michele Lombardo; Massimo Baravelli,10.3390/jcm14238297,2025-11-22,Journal of clinical medicine,"Primary mitral regurgitation (PMR) is the most common mitral valve disorder in clinical practice. Although several prognostic indicators derived from resting transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) and exercise stress echocardiography (ESE) are available, patient outcomes remain highly variable, with substantial differences in complication rates and mortality. Identifying individuals at lower cardiovascular risk is therefore clinically relevant, as they represent a large proportion of cases. Current guidelines recommend an integrative approach-combining qualitative, semi-quantitative, and quantitative indices-to determine the timing of intervention, but they do not specifically address risk stratification in low-risk PMR populations. Recent studies have highlighted the potential prognostic value of chest wall configuration, assessed noninvasively using the Modified Haller Index (MHI). Defined as the ratio of latero-lateral thoracic diameter to the antero-posterior (A-P) sternum-spine distance, MHI appears to influence myocardial deformation indices obtained by speckle-tracking echocardiography (STE). Patients with PMR due to mitral valve prolapse (MVP) often show a reduced A-P thoracic diameter caused by sternal depression. Among these, those with an MHI > 2.5 or A-P diameter ≤ 13.5 cm display greater impairment in global and basal strain, particularly in longitudinal and circumferential directions. These abnormalities likely reflect extrinsic geometric constraints and cardiac displacement leading to apparent dyssynchrony rather than intrinsic myocardial dysfunction. A reduced A-P diameter was also independently associated with mitral annular disjunction (MAD) in MVP and emerged as a determinant of impaired strain in this subgroup. In a retrospective cohort of 424 symptomatic MVP patients with moderate MR undergoing ESE, positive tests and exercise-induced severe MR were uncommon. Importantly, an MHI > 2.5 or an A-P diameter ≤ 13.5 cm was associated with a favorable medium-term prognosis, with few adverse cardiovascular events. This narrative, non-systematic review, based on a structured but non-PRISMA literature search, summarizes current evidence on conventional and novel echocardiographic prognostic markers and their implications for risk stratification in PMR. As such, it carries inherent limitations, including potential selection bias, incomplete retrieval of unpublished or negative studies, and reliance on single-center observational data. The findings should therefore be interpreted cautiously and validated through larger, independent, multicenter investigations."

Methods: A retrospective cohort of 423 patients who underwent the Maze procedure for persistent or paroxysmal atrial fibrillation from 2010 to 2025 was analyzed. Patients were categorized on the basis of the need for PPM postoperatively. Risk factors and rhythm outcomes were compared using multivariable Cox and logistic regression with backward stepwise selection according to the Akaike Information Criterion. Results: Forty-five patients (10.6%) required PPM implantation following the Maze procedure. The PPM group demonstrated a significantly higher AFMR prevalence than the non-PPM group (28.9% vs. 10.4%, p = 0.001). Preoperative fine P waves and older age were additional significant predictors. The PPM group exhibited lower postoperative sinus rhythm rates and higher junctional rhythm rates. AFMR (hazard ratio [HR], 2.10; p = 0.030), fine P wave (HR, 2.03; p = 0.049), and age (HR, 1.04; p = 0.018) independently predicted PPM implantation. AFMR particularly elevated the late PPM implantation risk. Conclusions: AFMR is an independent risk factor for late nodal dysfunction requiring PPM following Maze procedures. To detect delayed pacemaker requirements postoperatively, extended monitoring is recommended for patients with AFMR."

However, the clinical implications of M-TEER in patients requiring mechanical circulatory support (MCS) for unstable hemodynamics remains unclear. This study aimed to evaluate the outcomes of MCS-assisted M-TEER in critically ill patients.
Consecutive patients who underwent M-TEER for significant mitral regurgitation were identified from the Japanese multicenter OCEAN-Mitral (Optimized Catheter Valvular Intervention-Mitral) registry. All-cause death was compared between the cohort undergoing MCS-assisted M-TEER and a virtual control group receiving MCS alone without undergoing M-TEER, estimated using the Seattle Heart Failure Model. Additionally, logistic regression analysis was conducted to identify factors associated with in-hospital death following MCS-assisted M-TEER.
A total of 3764 patients were included in the analysis (mean age, 81 years; 54.9% men; 70.1% with secondary mitral regurgitation), of whom 105 underwent MCS-assisted M-TEER. Procedure success exceeded 95%, irrespective of MCS use. The 1-year mortality rate in the MCS-assisted M-TEER group was lower than the estimated mortality rate in the virtual control group (43.2% versus 69.5%). Factors associated with in-hospital death included frailty, inflammation, and hypoalbuminemia. In a landmark analysis starting from discharge date, there was no statistically significant difference in cardiovascular death or heart failure hospitalization between the groups with or without the use of MCS (hazard ratio, 1.45 [95% CI, 0.93-2.26]; P=0.10).
MCS-assisted M-TEER appears to be a viable and effective therapeutic strategy for carefully selected patients with significant mitral regurgitation and unstable hemodynamics.

Additionally, we aimed to investigate whether these values are useful in predicting the long-term development of chronic rheumatic heart disease in these patients. A total of 27 patients diagnosed with ARF with who were referred to the Pediatric Cardiology outpatient clinic between January 2019 and August 2023 were included in this study. The retrospective records of the patients were reviewed. Twenty-seven ARF patients (14 females, 13 males; mean age 10.3 ± 2.3 years) and 27 controls (12 females, 15 males; mean age 8.9 ± 3.2 years) were evaluated. Carditis was present in 85.2% of ARF cases at diagnosis, with mitral regurgitation being the most common lesion (29.6%). Leukocyte count, PLR, and NLR were significantly elevated in the ARF group compared to controls (P = .04, .001, .014), while lymphocyte counts were reduced (P = .001). Severe valve involvement was associated with lower PLR (P = .022), but not with NLR (P = .12). Although ARF incidence is declining in developed countries, it remains a significant health issue in developing regions. Consistent with global data, carditis - especially mitral regurgitation - was the predominant finding in our cohort. NLR and PLR have emerged as stable markers for cardiovascular risk, unaffected by exercise or dehydration. Our results demonstrate increased leukocyte counts, NLR, and PLR alongside decreased lymphocytes in ARF patients. Importantly, lower PLR correlated with more severe valve disease, unlike NLR. These findings highlight PLR's potential as a prognostic biomarker, meriting further research in larger populations."

Promising outcomes using various approaches have been reported; however, limited literature is available for urgent scenarios.
We report our surgical approach in a young female patient with Marfan syndrome and PEx status after multiple sternal reconstruction procedures who presented with acute congestive heart failure due to mitral valve insufficiency caused by chordae rupture. A thoracic surgeon first removed the previously implanted Nuss bars. Subsequently, the cardiac procedure was performed, including a standard midline incision with median sternotomy preceded by peripheral cannulation for cardiopulmonary bypass via the right common femoral artery and vein. Dense adhesions were expected, and adequate mitral valve exposure was achieved after meticulous dissection and usual left atriotomy. Valve analysis revealed a classic Barlow-type mitral valve prolapse with A1-A2 chordae rupture. Two sets of CV-4 sutures attached to both papillary muscles were used to restore chordal attachments, followed by secondary chordae transfer and 36 mm Physio-2 annuloplasty ring implantation. A piece of bovine pericardium was used to cover the heart. Postprocedural transesophageal echocardiography revealed trace mitral regurgitation without systolic anterior motion. The patient was weaned off the cardiopulmonary bypass, and hemostasis was achieved in preparation for sternal reconstruction and closure. The thoracic surgery team rejoined for Nuss bar re-implantation to complete the procedure. The patient's recovery was uneventful, and she was discharged on postoperative day 19.
Our case report on complex mitral valve repair with concomitant Nuss bar reimplantation demonstrates the feasibility and safety of this procedure in challenging scenarios. The median sternotomy approach is safe for urgent open-heart surgery, even in patients with a previously corrected sternum due to PEx."

It is known that exposure to EDCs increases the risk of various diseases in humans, but in veterinary medicine, the pathogenic impact of these substances is usually marginalised. Therefore, the aim of the present study was to determine whether exposure to EDCs is associated with a higher risk of chronic degenerative valve disease (CDVD) in dogs. The study included hair samples collected from 60 male and female dogs of various breeds and ages ranging from 9 months to 15 years. Hair samples collected from healthy dogs and dogs with CDVD were analysed for the presence of 15 EDCs (including bisphenol A, parabens, benzophenones and polyfluoroalkyl substances) using liquid chromatography and tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) technique. Concentration levels of methylparaben, ethylparaben, propylparaben, perfluoroheptanoic acid and perfluorooctanoic acid in samples collected from dogs with CDVD were statistically significantly higher than those noted in healthy dogs. Differences in concentrations of other EDCs studied between ill and healthy dogs were not statistically significant. The results may suggest that greater exposure of dogs to certain EDCs (such as methylparaben, ethylparaben, propylparaben, perfluoroheptanoic acid, and perfluorooctanoic acid) may increase the risk of CDVD, but further comprehensive clinical and toxicological research is necessary to fully clarify this issue."

It is a significant cause of sudden cardiac death, particularly in young individuals, often remaining undiagnosed until autopsy. Methods: A systematic review of the literature was conducted following PRISMA guidelines to revisit the main postmortem findings (gross, microscopic, and genetic) useful to perform the postmortem diagnosis of DCM. Scientific databases (PubMed and Scopus) were searched for articles published up to February 2025 describing postmortem findings in individuals diagnosed with DCM. Inclusion criteria were focused on studies reporting macroscopic cardiac findings, and microscopic and genetic variants identified postmortem or in related familial studies. Data were extracted and categorized to identify consistent diagnostic markers and to assess the frequency and relevance of genetic findings in autopsy-confirmed DCM cases. From 2081 initial records, 30 studies met inclusion criteria. Two reviewers independently performed study selection and data extraction, and methodological limitations of the included studies were considered qualitatively to inform the synthesis. Results: Common macroscopic features included increased heart weight (often > 350 g), dilated left or biventricular chambers, and thinning of the ventricular walls. Histologically, the most consistent findings were diffuse interstitial fibrosis, myocyte hypertrophy, and nuclear atypia. Particular attention was given to morphological features essential to distinguish between genetic and nongenetic forms of DCM and, thus, useful to perform a differential diagnosis with disease having a DCM-like pattern. Notably, truncating variants in genes such as TTN, FLNC, DSP, PKP2, and MYH7 were frequently reported, particularly in young decedents with no significant history of cardiac disease. However, only about half of reviewed studies included any form of genetic analysis, reflecting a significant gap in current practice for forensic pathologists. Conclusions: DCM may cause sudden death without prior symptoms, making genetic testing essential to uncover the diagnosis, especially in cases with a negative phenotype. Therefore, molecular autopsy combined with careful macroscopic and microscopic analysis can strengthen the forensic assessment."

Cardiovascular interventions,"The prognostic value of fractional flow reserve (FFR) in assessing coronary stenosis before transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) is unclear.
The aim of this study was to evaluate cardiovascular risks associated with significant and nonsignificant FFR values of coronary stenosis prior to TAVR.
Patients were enrolled from the NOTION-3 (Nordic Aortic Valve Intervention-3) randomized trial and registry, including those with severe aortic stenosis scheduled for TAVR and ≥50% coronary stenosis. Patients with FFR ≤0.80 or stenosis ≥90% were randomized to conservative therapy (FFR ≤0.80 conservative group) or percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI; FFR ≤0.80 PCI group). Those with FFR >0.80 were included in the registry (FFR >0.80 defer group). Outcomes were cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction, and/or urgent revascularization through 36 months.
Of 587 patients, 232 were in the FFR ≤0.80 conservative group, 220 in the FFR ≤0.80 PCI group, and 135 in the FFR >0.80 defer group. The cumulative incidence rates of cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction, or urgent revascularization were 21.6%, 11.5%, and 10.5%, respectively (P = 0.003). Excess risk in the FFR ≤0.80 conservative group was due mainly to higher myocardial infarction and urgent revascularization rates compared with the other groups. At a coronary lesion level, revascularization occurred in 12.6% of conservatively treated FFR ≤0.80 segments vs 1.3% of PCI-treated FFR ≤0.80 segments and 0.9% of deferred FFR >0.80 segments (P < 0.0001).
Conservative management of FFR ≤0.80 lesions was linked to higher cardiovascular risk compared with either PCI of FFR ≤0.80 lesions or deferral of FFR >0.80 lesions, which had similar outcomes. These findings support an FFR threshold of 0.80 to guide coronary revascularization in patients undergoing TAVR.

Cardiovascular interventions,"Transcatheter tricuspid valve annuloplasty (TTVA) with the Cardioband has proved to be safe and effective in acutely reducing tricuspid regurgitation (TR). However, long-term outcomes, especially regarding right heart remodeling (RHR), are scarce.
The aim of this study was to assess long-term efficacy as well as RHR following TTVA.
This retrospective, multicenter study included consecutive patients undergoing TTVA for severe TR at 2 German high-volume centers from 2019 to 2023. Right atrial and right ventricular (RV) parameters and NYHA functional class were assessed at baseline and follow-up.
A total of 156 patients were included, and the median time to follow-up was 435 days (Q1-Q3: 156-704 days). TR reduction to ≤2+ was observed in 71% and NYHA functional class improved to ≤II in 68% (P < 0.001 for both). Compared with baseline, right atrial area (36.0 ± 10.1 cm2 vs 30.4 ± 10.7 cm2), RV length (67.5 ± 9.4 mm vs 63.7 ± 9.1 mm), RV midventricular dimension (42.6 ± 8.6 mm vs 35.6 ± 7.8 mm), and RV basal dimension (47.8 ± 6.8 mm vs 42.6 ± 7.5 mm)were significantly reduced at follow-up (P < 0.001 for all). Notably, torrential to severe TR reduction still yielded remodeling (RV basal diameter 50 ± 8.1 mm vs 44 ± 8 mm; P = 0.007). RHR was associated with a decrease in vena contracta width (OR: 1.14; 95% CI: 1.03-1.30; P = 0.015).

Cardiovascular Imaging,"The primary quantitative measure of tricuspid regurgitation (TR) severity uses the proximal isovelocity surface area (PISA) method to calculate effective regurgitant orifice area (EROA) and regurgitant volume (RegVol). However, EROAPISA has been demonstrated to underestimate TR severity due to reliance of several geometric assumptions. The aim of this study was to evaluate if correcting for these parameters would improve this underestimation.
Patients with at least mild TR identified on transthoracic echocardiography were included in the study. EROAPISA and EROACORRECTED were compared with quantitative Doppler (EROADOPPLER) and 3-dimensional vena contracta area (3D-VCA). EROAPISA was corrected for flow, leaflet angle, and regurgitant orifice ellipticity (EROACORRECTED). Of 100 patients included in the study, EROAPISA (0.62 ± 0.47 cm2) was significantly lower than EROADOPPLER (1.40 ± 1.11 cm2) and 3D-VCA (1.66 ± 1.18 cm2). EROACORRECTED reduced the underestimation (1.31 ± 1.19 cm2, p = 0.73). Both EROAPISA and EROACORRECTED correlated well to EROADOPPLER (r = 0.81, r = 0.8, p < 0.001 for both) and 3D-VCA (r = 0.76, r = 0.70, p < 0.001 for both), although EROACORRECTED had higher agreement to both methods. EROACORRECTED ≥ 0.75 independently predicted morbidity and mortality on univariate (HR 1.84, CI 1.10-3.15, p = 0.02) and multivariate analysis (HR 2.00, CI 1.10-3.90, p = 0.04). EROADOPPLER and 3D-VCA ≥ 0.75 were also associated with worse outcomes on multivariate analysis.
Correcting PISA for flow, leaflet angle, and regurgitant orifice shape reduced its underestimation, and demonstrated high correlation and improved agreement with other quantitative methods."

Investigations revealed vegetation on both the aortic and mitral valves, severe aortic stenosis, and a non-ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction. Autoimmune testing confirmed antiphospholipid antibodies, which led to a diagnosis of PAPS with Libman-Sacks endocarditis, as well as secondary coronary embolic complications. After multidisciplinary consultation, the patient received anticoagulation, immunosuppressive therapy, and plasmapheresis.
This case report underlines the aggressive nature of PAPS, particularly given its presentation of severe aortic stenosis and dual valve involvement in a relatively young patient. To our knowledge, this is the first reported case of such a presentation.
PAPS can manifest with fulminant cardiac manifestations including severe aortic stenosis, dual valve vegetations, and myocardial infarction, emphasizing the importance of early recognition and management."

The objective of this study was to evaluate the association between frequently adding salt to food and depressive symptoms, as well as the underlying mechanisms.
A total of 15,471 adults from the 2007 to 2018 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) were included in the study. Depressive symptoms were defined as a total score of ≥10 on the Patient's Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9). Participants self-reported the frequency of adding salt to their foods, categorized as never or rarely, sometimes, usually, or always. Multivariable logistic regression analyses were conducted to evaluate the association between frequently adding salt to food and risk of depression. Bidirectional Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis was employed to investigate the potential causal relationship.
In the multivariate model, a significant positive association was observed between frequently adding salt to food and the risk of depression. After adjusting for covariates, a higher self-reported frequency of adding salt to food was significantly associated with an elevated risk of depression (OR: 1.26; 95% CI: 1.16-1.38; P < 0.001). Furthermore, MR analysis indicated that higher salt intake was causally linked to an 11% increased risk of depressive symptoms and 28% increased risk of major depressive disorder.
Frequently adding salt to food is positively associated with depression. These findings suggest that reducing the frequency of adding salt to foods at the table may be an effective strategy to lower risk of depression in the general population."

This study sought to analyze the association between CTA-GLS and perioperative aortic regurgitation (AR), and its prognostic value in TAVI patients.
Consecutive TAVI recipients at Beijing Anzhen Hospital were enrolled in this retrospective study from June 2021 to January 2024. The patients underwent transthoracic echocardiography (TTE), and pre-TAVI CTA. Nonlinear relationships between CTA-GLS and AR were evaluated using restricted cubic splines (RCSs). The performance of the multivariate Cox proportional hazards models were assessed by the concordance index (C-index), integrated discrimination improvement (IDI), and net reclassification improvement (NRI).
The study included 369 TAVI patients with a median age of 73.0 years, of whom 56.1% were male. CTA-GLS exhibited a strong nonlinear correlation with pre-procedural AR (P<0.001) and post-operative AR improvement (P=0.004). In the multivariate Cox proportional hazards regression, each 1% absolute decrease in CTA-GLS remained a significant predictor of all-cause mortality and heart failure hospitalization (HFH) post-TAVI [hazard ratio (HR): 1.47; 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.22-1.78; P<0.001]. The following three nested models were developed: Model 1, which included clinical parameters; Model 2, which included CTA-GLS, and Model 3, which combined both. Adding CTA-GLS improved the C-index from 0.66 (95% CI: 0.53-0.79) to 0.81 (95% CI: 0.75-0.87) (P=0.028), which was also reflected in the NRI [0.89 (95% CI: 0.56-1.22), P<0.001] and IDI [0.05 (95% CI: 0.02-0.09), P=0.003].
Pre-TAVI CTA-GLS is nonlinearly linked to pre-procedural AR and its improvement. It can be used to independently predict post-TAVI outcomes and adds incremental value to clinical parameters."

While metabolic dysfunction and chronic inflammation are associated with cardiovascular calcification, their combined role in MAC remains unclear. This observational study enrolled 259 patients (130 MAC+, 129 MAC-) undergoing echocardiography. We calculated the triglyceride-glucose (TyG) index as Ln (fasting triglycerides [mg/dL] × fasting plasma glucose [mg/dL]/2) and derived inflammatory markers (neutrophil-to-lymphocyte [N/L] ratio, lymphocyte-to-monocyte [L/M] ratio, systemic immune-inflammation index) from complete blood counts. Multivariate logistic regression and receiver operating characteristic analyses were used to assess the predictors of MAC. MAC+ patients showed higher TyG index (9.02 ± 0.58 vs 8.76 ± 0.52, P < .001), N/L ratio (P < .001), and lower L/M ratio (P = .001). TyG index > 8.76 predicted MAC with 64.6% sensitivity (area under the curve = 0.621, P = .001), while N/L ratio > 2.08 showed 60.8% sensitivity (area under the curve = 0.615, P = .001). In multivariate analysis, age (odds ratio [OR], 1.09, P < .001), TyG index (OR, 2.76, P = .001), and L/M ratio (OR, 0.79, P = .008) independently predicted MAC. MAC is associated with insulin resistance (reflected by TyG index) and systemic inflammation (elevated N/L ratio, reduced L/M ratio). These findings position MAC as a multifactorial process linked to metabolic and inflammatory pathways. The TyG index, as a simple and cost-effective marker, could potentially be used alongside inflammatory markers in risk stratification for MAC. Future studies should investigate if modulating these factors can alter MAC progression."

Cardiovascular Imaging,"Aortic regurgitation (AR) is a prevalent valvular disease. Cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) imaging is emerging as an accurate and precise method for assessing AR. However, its role in guiding interventions and risk stratification for outcomes remains to be fully defined.
This systematic review and meta-analysis evaluate the predictive utility of CMR-derived AR fraction (ARF) in determining intervention timing and clinical outcomes.
A systematic search identified observational studies assessing CMR-derived ARF in AR prognostication. Hazard ratios (HRs) for intervention timing, mortality, and heart failure were pooled using a random-effects model. Study heterogeneity (I² statistic) was assessed, and publication bias was evaluated using a funnel plot.
A total of 1,235 studies were screened, with 12 meeting the inclusion criteria. Eight studies (n=1,996 patients) were included in the meta-analysis. ARF severity thresholds ranged from 30% to 43% (mean 33.7%). Follow-up ranged from 2 to 5.1 years. The pooled HR for clinic outcomes with an ARF >33% was 4.12 (95% CI: 2.31-7.34, P value <0.01). The highest reported HR was 24.59, while the lowest was 1.04. Studies demonstrated that a higher ARF correlates with an increased risk of adverse outcomes, supporting CMR as a key tool for risk stratification and intervention timing.
CMR-derived ARF is strongly predictive of clinical outcomes. ARF >33% is associated with significantly increased risk, warranting its integration into clinical decision-making frameworks."

The QUEST trial demonstrated that Qiliqiangxin (QLQX) capsules could improve outcomes for Chinese HFrEF patients, but the cost-effectiveness of QLQX has not been previously evaluated.
We developed a lifetime Markov model to assess the cost-effectiveness of adding QLQX to standard therapy compared to standard therapy alone in a simulated cohort of 63-year-old HFrEF patients. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER), defined as incremental cost per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY), was the primary outcome. A willingness-to-pay (WTP) threshold was set at three times China's per capita GDP. One-way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were performed to test the robustness of the results.
Adding QLQX to standard treatment resulted in an additional 0.53 QALYs (4.74 vs. 4.22 QALYs) at an incremental cost of 28,760 Chinese Yuan (CNY) (USD 4,081), yielding an ICER of 54,522 CNY (USD 7,737) per QALY. This ICER was significantly below the WTP threshold. Sensitivity analyses confirmed the robustness of these findings.
QLQX capsules, as adjunctive therapy to standard treatment, represent a cost-effective strategy for managing HFrEF in China, supporting their inclusion in clinical guidelines and reimbursement policies. Real-world studies are needed to validate these results further."

The approach employs a deep representation based on multi-head cross-attention, refined with morphological characterization learned from independent maps according to the degree of polyp malignancy. The proposed method was validated on the BKAI-IGH dataset, comprising 1200 samples (1000 white-light imaging and 200 NICE samples) with fine-grained segmentation masks. The results show an average IoU of 83.5% and a recall of 94%. Additionally, external dataset validation demonstrated the model's generalization capability. Inspired by conventional expert characterization, the proposed method integrates textural and morphological observations, allowing both tasks, polyp segmentation and the corresponding malignancy stratification. The proposed strategy achieves the state-of-the-art performance in public datasets, showing promising results and demonstrating its ability to generate a polyp representation suitable for multiple tasks."

PubMed,deep learning,Large Language Model Evaluation in Traditional Chinese Medicine for Stroke: Quantitative Benchmarking Study.,Hulin Long; Yang Deng; Yaoguang Guo; Zifan Shen; Yuzhu Zhang; Ji Bao; Yang He,10.2196/81545,2025-12-11,JMIR formative research,"The application of large language models (LLMs) in medicine is rapidly advancing. However, evaluating LLM capabilities in specialized domains such as traditional Chinese medicine (TCM), which possesses a unique theoretical system and cognitive framework, remains a sizable challenge.
This study aimed to provide an empirical evaluation of different LLM types in the specialized domain of TCM stroke.
The Traditional Chinese Medicine-Stroke Evaluation Dataset (TCM-SED), a 203-question benchmark, was systematically constructed. The dataset includes 3 paradigms (short-answer questions, multiple-choice questions, and essay questions) and covers multiple knowledge dimensions, including diagnosis, pattern differentiation and treatment, herbal formulas, acupuncture, interpretation of classical texts, and patient communication. Gold standard answers were established through a multiexpert cross-validation and consensus process. The TCM-SED was subsequently used to comprehensively test 2 representative LLM models: GPT-4o (a leading international general-purpose model) and DeepSeek-R1 (a large model primarily trained on Chinese corpora).
The test results revealed a differentiation in model capabilities across cognitive levels. In objective sections emphasizing precise knowledge recall, DeepSeek-R1 comprehensively outperformed GPT-4o, achieving an accuracy lead of more than 17% in the multiple-choice section (96/137, 70.1% vs 72/137, 52.6%, respectively). Conversely, in the essay section, which tested knowledge integration and complex reasoning, GPT-4o's performance notably surpassed that of DeepSeek-R1. For instance, in the interpretation of classical texts category, GPT-4o achieved a scoring rate of 90.5% (181/200), far exceeding DeepSeek-R1 (147/200, 73.5%).
This empirical study demonstrates that Chinese-centric models have a substantial advantage in static knowledge tasks within the TCM domain, whereas leading general-purpose models exhibit stronger dynamic reasoning and content generation capabilities. The TCM-SED, developed as the benchmark for this study, serves as an effective quantitative tool for evaluating and selecting appropriate LLMs for TCM scenarios. It also offers a valuable data foundation and a new research direction for future model optimization and alignment."

However, their adoption in health care remains limited by uncertainties surrounding trust, privacy, and digital readiness, particularly in low- and middle-income contexts.
This study aimed to examine how trust, information behavior, and sociotechnical readiness influence the willingness of health care professionals (HCPs) and patients or caregivers (PCs) in China to adopt LLMs for medical information and decision support.
We conducted a multicenter, cross-sectional mixed methods observational study across five tertiary hospitals, combining surveys of 240 HCPs and 480 PCs with semistructured interviews (n=30). Quantitative analyses included logistic regression (LR), random forest (RF), and extreme gradient boosting models with Shapley additive explanations-based interpretability. Qualitative data were thematically analyzed to capture role-specific concerns and expectations.
Among HCPs, mean age 39.9 (SD 6.5 years; 159/240, 66.2% physicians), 69.2% (166/240) were aware of LLMs and 36.7% (88/240) had previous experience. Among PCs (mean age 50.1, SD 12.6 years; 242/480, 50.4% male), only 26% (125/480) had previous exposure. Trust, perceived usefulness, and digital readiness were the strongest facilitators of adoption. Multivariable models identified trust as the dominant predictor for both groups (HCPs: odds ratio [OR] 3.78, 95% CI 2.15-6.63; PCs: OR 36.34, 95% CI 18.41-71.74; P<.001). For HCPs, previous use (OR 5.61, 95% CI 3.02-10.44; P<.001) and legal clarity (OR 1.56, 95% CI 1.07-2.27; P=.02) increased willingness, while privacy concerns reduced it (OR 0.72, 95% CI 0.53-0.97; P=.03). Among PCs, perceived usefulness (OR 2.01, 95% CI 1.52-2.67; P<.001), education, and digital tool use were positive predictors. Model performance was high (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve [AUC] 0.83-0.85 for HCPs and 0.93-0.96 for PCs). Qualitative findings identified 11 themes: HCPs stressed workflow integration and accountability, while PCs emphasized comprehensibility, reassurance, and equitable access; trust consistently linked technical credibility with social legitimacy.
Adoption of LLMs in health care depends less on algorithmic performance than on the management of trust, literacy, and institutional readiness. Trust functions as a multidimensional construct rooted in transparency, reliability, and contextual validation. Theoretically, this study extends technology adoption frameworks by embedding ethical trust, digital literacy, and institutional support within a unified sociotechnical readiness model, advancing information management theory beyond performance-centric paradigms. Empirically, trust and perceived usefulness outweighed demographic or structural factors, with predictive accuracy exceeding 0.9 across user groups. Practically, these findings offer actionable guidance for the design and governance of artificial intelligence systems, emphasizing role-sensitive interfaces, plain-language communication, and transparent accountability mechanisms to promote equitable and trustworthy adoption."

We conducted a classroom experiment in which graduate students used LLMs to solve biomedical data science challenges on Kaggle, focusing on tabular data prediction. While their submissions did not top the leaderboards, their prediction scores were often close to those of leading human participants. LLMs frequently recommended gradient boosting methods, which were associated with better performance. Among prompting strategies, self-refinement, where the LLM improves its own initial solution, was the most effective, a result validated using additional LLMs. While LLMs are capable of handling more complex data science tasks beyond tabular data prediction, their performance is substantially worse. These findings demonstrate that LLMs have the potential to design competitive machine learning solutions, even when used by nonexperts."

It consists of four phases - two growth phases (G1 and G2), a replication phase (S), and a division phase (M) - each characterized by distinct transcriptional programs and impacting most other cellular processes. In imaging assays, the cell cycle phase can be identified using specific cell-cycle markers. However, the use of dedicated cell-cycle markers can be impractical or even prohibitive, as they occupy fluorescent channels that may be needed for other reporters. To address this limitation we propose a method to infer the cell cycle phase from a widely used fluorescent reporter: SiR-DNA, thereby bypassing the need for phase-specific markers while leveraging information already present in common experimental setups. Our method is based on a Variational Auto-Encoder (VAE), enhanced with two auxiliary tasks: predicting the average intensity of phase-specific markers and enforcing temporal consistency through latent space regularization. The reconstruction task ensures that the latent space captures cell cycle-relevant features, while the temporal constraint promotes biological plausibility. The resulting model, CC-VAE, classifies cell cycle phases with high accuracy from widely used DNA markers and can thus be applied to high-content screening datasets not specifically designed for cell cycle analysis. CC-VAE is freely available, along with a new, publicly released dataset comprising over 600,000 labeled HeLa Kyoto nuclear images to support further development and benchmarking in the community."

Most deep learning-based approaches for fake news detection yield accurate predictions but lack explainability. Existing models focusing on explainability visualize key components from results or generate surface causes via Large Language Models. However, they can hardly provide the deep rationale behind the fabrication of fake news, which is indispensable for misinformation mitigation. Thus, we approach explainability from a different perspective, focusing on explaining how fake news is fabricated, which we term deceptive patterns, at its very source. First, four types of deceptive patterns are pre-established, namely Image Manipulation, Cross-modal Inconsistency, Image Repurposing and Others. Based on this, we propose GE-NSLM, a General Explainable Neuro-Symbolic Latent Model that integrates the power of Large Vision Language Models, which not only provides accurate judgments but also offers insights on deceptive patterns. Specifically, each deceptive pattern is represented as a binary learnable latent variable, obtained through amortized variational inference and weak supervision guided by logical rules. Experiments show GE-NSLM achieves competitive performance. More importantly, it provides interpretable insights into the underlying reasons why specific news items are fake.

Recently, a few efforts have aimed to develop more task-independent or universal audiovisual embedding networks, encoding advanced representations for use in various audiovisual downstream tasks. This is typically achieved by fine-tuning large pretrained transformers, such as Swin-V2-L and HTS-AT, in a parameter-efficient manner through techniques such as tuning only a few adapter layers inserted into the pretrained transformer backbone. Although these methods are parameter-efficient, they suffer from significant training memory consumption due to gradient backpropagation through the deep transformer backbones, which limits accessibility for researchers with constrained computational resources. In this paper, we present Meta-Token Learning (Mettle), a simple and memory-efficient method for adapting large-scale pretrained transformer models to downstream audio-visual tasks. Instead of sequentially modifying the output feature distribution of the transformer backbone, Mettle utilizes a lightweight Layer-Centric Distillation (LCD) module to distill in parallel the intact audio or visual features embedded by each transformer layer into compact meta-tokens. This distillation process considers both pretrained knowledge preservation and task-specific adaptation. The obtained meta-tokens can be directly applied to classification tasks, such as audio-visual event localization and audio-visual video parsing. To further support fine-grained segmentation tasks, such as audio-visual segmentation, we introduce a Meta-Token Injection (MTI) module, which utilizes the audio and visual meta-tokens distilled from the top transformer layer to guide feature adaptation in earlier layers. Extensive experiments on multiple audiovisual benchmarks demonstrate that our method significantly reduces memory usage and training time while maintaining parameter efficiency and competitive accuracy."

Recent studies incorporated energy-efficient Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) to build Spiking DRL methods and lower energy consumption by setting a shorter simulation duration for SNNs to compute fewer gradients. However, these existing Spiking DRL methods fail to sample sufficient high-quality samples within a fixed-size replay buffer and perform poorly when the simulation duration is small, introducing the challenging tradeoff between energy consumption and model performance. Motivated by such observations, we develop a generic resilient experience replay method that can be seamlessly integrated into existing spiking DRL methods to effectively address the above tradeoff. Specifically, we allow the replay buffer to dynamically expand as the number of training samples increases, thereby accommodating more potentially valuable candidate samples for policy training. Meanwhile, we introduce an adaptive approach to manage the buffer size by determining when to shrink the replay buffer and removing redundant samples automatically. This strategy prevents the buffer from expanding unnecessarily, thereby mitigating the potential negative impact on model performance. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our approach significantly enhances the performance of five state-of-the-art (SOTA) spiking DRL methods across various simulation durations in sixteen tasks, in terms of return, without compromising their energy efficiency."

Traditionally, these parameters are manually tuned by imaging experts, a time-consuming and subjective process. Recent deep learning approaches predict ISP parameters, but often treat the process as a black box and overlook the intrinsic relationships among ISP modules. To address these fundamental issues, we introduce a novel ISP parameter optimization model based on single-agent reinforcement learning (RL) (i.e., SARL-ISP), formulating the hardware ISP parameter tuning as a sequential optimization problem. During the optimization process, the agent updates ISP parameter tuning strategies for different tasks through interaction with the environment. In order to explore the influence of the sequential structure of hardware ISP modules and the coupling relationships among ISP parameters on the tuning process, we further propose a sequential ISP framework based on collaborative multi-agent RL (i.e., MARL-ISP). Specifically, the serialized parameter tuning module (SPTM) realistically simulates the process of manual prediction and module pipeline. Additionally, the feature selection module (FSM) facilitates the transmission and fusion of agent features, thereby selecting more appropriate feature inputs for downstream tasks. Extensive experiments across various tasks (e.g., object detection, instance segmentation) validate the effectiveness and efficiency of our models. Even with minimal training data, our models also outperform current state-of-the-art methods in both quantitative metrics and qualitative evaluations."

Existing computational methods often struggle to integrate the diverse structural information inherent in these complex molecules, resulting in suboptimal predictive accuracy. Here, we introduce MCPerm, a multi-modal deep learning framework that synergistically integrates 1D SMILES, 2D topological, and 3D geometric information through a novel modality share and contrastive learning strategy to accurately predict cyclic peptide permeability. MCPerm fine-tunes a pretrained peptide language model for SMILES encoding and uses a parameter-sharing graph transformer for structural representation, while a dual contrastive learning mechanism enforces representational consistency both within and between modalities. On the benchmark PAMPA dataset, MCPerm achieves state-of-the-art performance, significantly outperforming leading methods. We further demonstrate its robustness and competitive transferability across three independent assays (Caco-2, MDCK, and RRCK). Our work presents a robust in silico framework that holds potential to accelerate the rational design and discovery of cell-permeable cyclic peptide drugs. Furthermore, to move beyond predictive accuracy, we introduced an attention-based visualization analysis. The results demonstrate that our model is not a ""black box""; it has learned key chemical principles governing cyclic peptide permeability."

It is crucial to develop a learning framework through cross-disease transfer learning that can extract more information from the limited data.

Specifically, we propose a novel prompt learning framework called BPformer, which integrates knowledge transferred across diseases via specific prompts while keeping the original architecture of BPformer unchanged. The specific prompts incorporate 1) a mask prompt to determine whether the edges are noisy or discriminating, 2) disorder prompts for modeling consistent and disorder-specific knowledge, and 3) adaptive instance-level prompts to account for inter-individual variations. We evaluate BPformer on the private center Nanjing Medical University dataset, the public Autism Brain Imaging Data Exchange dataset, and the public Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative dataset. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model across various disease classification tasks, including major depressive disorder, bipolar disorder, alzheimer's disease, and autism spectrum disorder diagnoses.

This approach parses the mutual influence of heterogeneous attention in drug-gene relationships by constructing an interpretable KAN network.

Although deep learning-based denoising methods have shown promise in restoring low-dose CT (LDCT) to normal-dose CT (NDCT) quality, most approaches rely on structurally aligned paired data, which are difficult to acquire in clinical practice. Models trained on synthetic pairs often exhibit limited generalizability to real LDCT data. Unconditional diffusion models demonstrate outstanding generalizability, but fail to preserve structural fidelity. To address these challenges, we propose an enhanced diffusion posterior sampling (E-DPS) framework that combines a one-step denoiser U-Net with an unconditional diffusion model. Specifically, the U-Net estimator, trained on simulated LDCT-NDCT pairs, provides preliminary denoised outputs as structural constraints, whereas the diffusion model captures the prior distribution of NDCT images to enhance realism and generalizability. During inference, the U-Net predictions are integrated as constraints with tunable weights, thereby guiding diffusion posterior sampling. In addition, an intermediate-stage initialization strategy is introduced, significantly reducing the number of required sampling steps. Extensive experiments on simulated LDCT datasets across three dose levels demonstrate the superiority of our method, yielding average PSNR gains of +5.2% and +4.3% at unseen dose levels compared with state-of-the-art approaches. Moreover, on real LDCT images, E-DPS exhibits strong zero-shot generalizability, achieving better noise suppression while preserving anatomical detail. These results highlight the robustness and clinical potential of E-DPS for LDCT denoising."

Specifically, in deep generative models, the incorporation of OT helps address issues such as training instability, vanishing gradients, and mode collapse. However, in these models, most of the OT mappings learned by neural networks are typically implicit, making it difficult to explicitly model the relationship between the source and target domains. This limitation reduces the interpretability of the model and hinders its applicability in conditional generation tasks. To address this issue, we introduce Nesterov's smoothing technique to smooth the Brenier potential, enabling the derivation of an explicit OT mapping that serves as the foundation for constructing an advanced generative model. The proposed model offers the following advantages. First, it explicitly captures the mapping between the source and target domains, thereby enhancing the interpretability of the generative process and enabling a novel pathway for conditional sample generation based on a smoothed approximation of OT mapping. Second, the model can generate new samples directly through an explicit OT mapping, eliminating the need for interpolation and rejection sampling commonly seen in traditional methods, thereby improving generation efficiency. Moreover, extensive experiments show that our proposed model achieves superior performance in both unconditional and conditional generation tasks."

Their mechanism of action can effectively combat fungal resistance, offering broad-spectrum efficacy, high safety, and other advantages. However, traditional laboratory methods for identifying AFPs are inefficient and expensive. Consequently, with the development of artificial intelligence, computational models for identifying and predicting AFPs have emerged. But existing methods often rely on datasets compiled from literature and inadequately consider AFP representation, such as ignoring spatial features. Furthermore, single Graph neural Networks (GNNs) can suffer from feature bias in capturing features. To this end, this study constructed a state-of-the-art and comprehensive dataset and developed a deep learning model, AFP-GFuse, that integrates sequence and structural information and three complementary GNNs. A hierarchical cross-attention mechanism is designed to dynamically align and fuse multi-graph feature representations. Experiments demonstrate that AFP-GFuse outperforms state-of-the-art models in predicting AFPs, achieving an accuracy of 0.9140. Ablation experiments further validate the effectiveness of structural representation. Furthermore, comparisons with three individual GNNs demonstrate that integrating a cross-attention mechanism effectively complements their representational limitations and improves overall model performance. To facilitate broader application, we also provide open data 8.4and an online service, AFP-GFuse, publicly available at http://www.bioai-lab.com/AFP-GFuse ."

Kinovea, as an accessible motion-analysis software, provides both visual and quantitative feedback. However, its application in supporting technique development among beginner athletes remains insufficiently explored. Aim: This study aims to describe the use of Kinovea in biomechanics training and examine its contribution to the awareness of kinematic characteristics and movement techniques among beginner athletes. Methods: A descriptive qualitative design involved 72 beginner athletes aged 18–25 years selected through purposive sampling. Data were collected over 16 weeks through interviews, field observations, and motion video recordings analyzed using Kinovea. Kinematic data focused on joint angles, stride behavior, and movement phases during walking, running, and the flight phase. Qualitative data were analyzed using content analysis with NVivo 12, while kinematic results were interpreted descriptively to identify performance patterns and areas for technical refinement. Result: Kinematic analysis showed coordinated joint-angle patterns across all phases. Walking analysis identified arm swing angles of 50.9°–58.8° and leg separation angles of 64.3°–67.2°, indicating a stable gait rhythm. The running analysis revealed knee angles of 68.8°–69.8° and elbow angles of 87.6°–89.1°, indicating efficient propulsive mechanics. The flight phase demonstrated knee angles of 81.2°–87.8° and elbow angles of 80.4°–88.3°, suggesting effective momentum use and postural stability. These measurements supported stride-efficiency assessment and technique evaluation. Qualitative findings revealed that Kinovea enabled athletes to interpret movement phases and identify technical inefficiencies through slow-motion and frame-by-frame visualization. Conclusion: Kinovea supports basic motion analysis by providing clear kinematic information and helping beginner athletes observe and refine their movement techniques. The findings also offer practical value for coaches by enabling more precise identification of inefficient patterns and guiding targeted corrections during early-stage training."
