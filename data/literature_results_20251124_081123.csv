PubMed,aortic stenosis,COMPERA 2.0 risk stratification in patients with severe aortic stenosis: implication for group 2 pulmonary hypertension.,Zongye Cai; Xinrui Qi; Dao Zhou; Hanyi Dai; Abuduwufuer Yidilisi; Ming Zhong; Lin Deng; Yuchao Guo; Jiaqi Fan; Qifeng Zhu; Yuxin He; Cheng Li; Xianbao Liu; Jian'an Wang,10.1631/jzus.B2400057,2025-09-26,Journal of Zhejiang University. Science. B,"COMPERA 2.0 risk stratification has been demonstrated to be useful in patients with precapillary pulmonary hypertension (PH). However, its suitability for patients at risk for post-capillary PH or PH associated with left heart disease (PH-LHD) is unclear. To investigate the use of COMPERA 2.0 in patients with severe aortic stenosis (SAS) undergoing transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR), who are at risk for post-capillary PH, a total of 327 eligible SAS patients undergoing TAVR at our institution between September 2015 and November 2020 were included in the study. Patients were classified into four strata before and after TAVR using the COMPERA 2.0 risk score. The primary endpoint was all-cause mortality. Survival analysis was performed using Kaplan-Meier curves, log-rank test, and Cox proportional hazards regression model. The study cohort had a median (interquartile range) age of 76 (70‒80) years and a pulmonary arterial systolic pressure of 33 (27‒43) mmHg (1 mmHg=0.133 kPa) before TAVR. The overall mortality was 11.9% during 26 (15‒47) months of follow-up. Before TAVR, cumulative mortality was higher with an increase in the risk stratum level (log-rank, both P<0.001); each increase in the risk stratum level resulted in an increased risk of death (hazard ratio (HR) 2.53, 95% confidential interval (CI) 1.54‒4.18, P<0.001), which was independent of age, sex, estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), hemoglobin, albumin, and valve type (HR 1.76, 95% CI 1.01‒3.07, P=0.047). Similar results were observed at 30 d after TAVR. COMPERA 2.0 can serve as a useful tool for risk stratification in patients with SAS undergoing TAVR, indicating its potential application in the management of PH-LHD. Further validation is needed in patients with confirmed post-capillary PH by right heart catheterization."

The aim of this study was to characterize the specificities of cardiac involvement in patients with TTR V30M mutation.
This retrospective study included patients diagnosed with TTR V30M that were referred to a cardiology appointment during 2019 (median follow-up of 57 months). Data on cardiomyopathy (CM), conduction abnormalities, aortic stenosis, and atrial fibrillation (Afib) were collected. V30M ATTR-CM patients were compared to a contemporary cohort with wtATTR-CM.
A total of 238 TTR V30M patients were enrolled: mean age 54 years old, 52 % male, and 69 % with early onset disease. vATTR-CM occurred in 20 % of patients and was associated with male gender, older age at presentation, liver transplantation, ophthalmologic manifestations, and lower creatinine clearance. Age at presentation, male gender, liver transplant, and ophthalmologic manifestations were independent predictors of CM. vATTR-CM was associated with worse outcomes. Significant electric conduction disease was present in 32 % of patients and AFib in 11 %. Patients with vATTR-CM, compared to those without CM, had a higher prevalence of significant electric conduction changes, pacemaker implantation, and AFib when compared to those without CM. Most patients with electric disease had neuropathy and more than 12 years of symptoms. Significant aortic stenosis was rare. Compared to patients with wtATTR-CM, patients with vATTR-CM had a higher prevalence of significant conduction disease, a lower prevalence of AFib, and less severe hypertrophy. In vATRR-CM, age at presentation and male predominance were lower and orthostatic hypotension was more prevalent.
Our findings highlight the need for thorough cardiovascular evaluation in TTR V30M patients due to common conduction issues and the significant impact of CM on outcomes."
PubMed,aortic stenosis,Simplified surgical conversion of mechanical to bioprosthetic Bentall with leaflet fracture technique.,Yasuhiko Kawaguchi; Jennifer Higgins; Kassem Ashe; Gary Salasidis,10.1093/icvts/ivaf277,2025-11-22,Interdisciplinary cardiovascular and thoracic surgery,"We report a case of simplified surgical conversion from a prior mechanical composite valved conduit to a bioprosthetic aortic valve using a leaflet fracture technique. A 69-year-old man presented with progressive heart failure seven years after aortic root replacement for bicuspid aortic stenosis and root aneurysm. Imaging revealed severe prosthetic valve stenosis and suspected pannus formation. Given significant comorbidities, simplified approach was chosen to avoid full root re-replacement. Following redo sternotomy and graft incision, the mechanical valve leaflets were fractured and removed. A Foley balloon inserted into the left ventricular outflow tract prevented leaflet embolization. Pannus excision revealed a hypertrophic subvalvular septum, prompting a septal myectomy. A 23-mm bioprosthetic valve was implanted above the retained mechanical housing using interrupted mattress sutures. The patient's postoperative course was uneventful and echocardiography confirmed good valve function. This case highlights the utility of leaflet fracture as a safe and efficient option in high-risk reoperative settings and underscores the added benefit of direct subvalvular visualization for detecting underlying anatomic contributors to prosthetic dysfunction not detected preoperatively."

Enhanced imaging techniques could improve prognostic accuracy. This study investigates myocardial resting perfusion and metabolism using [13N]-NH3 and 2-[18F]FDG PET/CT and their correlation with HCM SCD risk scores. Thirty non-obstructive HCM patients (mean age 54 years, 57% male) with a mean SCD risk score of 3.7 ± 2.5% were evaluated. Myocardial 2-[18F]FDG metabolism and rest [13N]-NH3 perfusion PET/CT were analyzed. Hypermetabolism (2-[18F]FDG uptake with normal perfusion) occurred in 53% of cases (mean extension 11.8 ± 17.2%), while fibrosis (reduced perfusion without 2-[18F]FDG uptake) averaged 10.3 ± 10.2%. Mean rest myocardial blood flow (MBF) was 0.75 ± 0.21 ml/min/g, increasing with hypermetabolism extension (0.83 ± 0.32 ml/min/g for ≥ 20%, p = 0.019) but decreasing with SCD scores ≥ 6% (0.58 ± 0.05 ml/min/g, p = 0.034). Hypermetabolism correlated moderately with SCD risk scores (rho = 0.38, p = 0.036), with hypermetabolism peaking at intermediate risk (23.5 ± 27.1%) before declining. Fibrosis extension consistently increased with SCD risk (rho = 0.38, p = 0.039). In conclusion, our findings identify important correlations between myocardial hypermetabolism and fibrosis and SCD risk in HCM. Hypermetabolism peaks in intermediate-risk patients, reflecting earlier disease stages, while fibrosis increases with higher SCD risk, signaling disease progression and structural damage."

Adventitial lymphatic vessels employ lymphatic valves to eliminate infiltrated harmful substances from arterial walls, thereby preserving vascular wall integrity. The traditional Chinese medicine ""Gualou-Xiebai"" (GLXB) has been shown to have a definite therapeutic effect on AS by inhibiting aortic plaque deposition and reducing vascular damage. However, whether the effect of GLXB on ameliorating vascular damage in AS is related to lymphatic drainage and lymphatic valves formation has not been clarified.
To investigate whether GLXB alleviates the plaque lesions of AS by regulating the function of lymphatic drainage and its potential mechanism.
Doppler ultrasound imaging were used to validate AS lesions to confirm successful model establishment. HE staining and morphological photography were used to evaluate the plaque area. The bilateral branches of the left common carotid artery were ligation to block the lymphatic drainage of the aortic ventricular duct in AS mice, and the mouse lymphatic vessel blockade model was established. The lymphatic vessel contraction frequency and leakage were detected by near-infrared two-zone imaging and Evans blue staining, and the lymphatic drainage function was evaluated. Lymphatic valve formation was evaluated through immunofluorescence analysis of specific biomarker expression. After lymphatic endothelial cells (LECs) were treated with serum containing GLXB or transfected with VEGFR3 in LECs, the proliferation and migration of LECs were evaluated by CCK8 method, transwell and immunofluorescent staining of Ki67. The expression of lymphatic-associated proteins was detected by Western blot, and the expression of IL-1β and IL-18 in serum was detected by ELISA kit.
GLXB promotes lymphatic drainage in the adventitia and ameliorates vasculopathy in AS mice by maintaining lymphatic drainage function, which is related to the promotion of lymphatic valve formation. Meanwhile, GLXB promotes lymphatic valve formation based on the fact that GLXB promoted the proliferation and migration of LECs, while also the expression of various markers of lymphatic valve formation in LECs. Mechanistically, we demonstrated that VEGFR3 is a key target of GLXB in promoting LECs development and maintaining the function of adventiolar lymphatic drainage to improve vasculopathy in AS. Rutin, and Kaempferol-3-O-β-rutinoside are the key active components of GLXB targeting VEGFR3 to improve the proliferation and migration of LECs after injury.
GLXB inhibits LECs injury by targeting VEGFR3, promotes lymphatic valve formation, maintains lymphatic drainage function, and reduces AS."

Patients who underwent AVR between 2012 and 2021 at our center were retrospectively analyzed in two groups, AS and AR. The final 278 samples possessed detailed clinical information of the patients. The six items were measured in preoperative CT and compared in significant difference in number.
No significant differences were found in the patients' characteristics between the AS and AR groups except for age, sex and body surface area. The number of younger and male patients was higher in the AR group than in the AS group (P <  0.01), including a larger body surface area (P <  0.01). The AR group had larger rightward laterality aorta and third ICS (AS vs AR - 3.9 ± 8.9 vs 0.6 ± 8.9 mm, P < 0.01; 14.2 ± 1.3 vs 15 ± 1.6 cm, P <  0.01, respectively).
Preoperative CT revealed thoracic anatomical differences between AS and AR patients undergoing MIAVR. Although no direct correlation with cross-clamp time was observed except for AP distance in both AR and AS, surgeons should be aware that these anatomical features-particularly the rightward aorta and deeper and more caudally positioned AV in AR patients to make surgical decision making, surgical planning. CT-based evaluation is a valuable tool for guiding approach strategy and patient selection in MIAVR."

Case reports,"Left ventricular (LV) thrombus is traditionally a contraindication to transcatheter aortic valve replacement due to embolic risk. Consequently, management of valvular cardiogenic shock complicated by LV thrombus identifies unique challenges that require innovative strategies.
A 58-year-old woman with critical bioprosthetic aortic stenosis, cardiogenic shock, and large LV thrombus (2.8 × 2.6 cm) underwent successful valve-in-valve transcatheter aortic valve replacement after systemic fibrinolysis bridge therapy.
Current guidelines contraindicate transcatheter aortic valve replacement in patients with LV thrombus. This case demonstrates the novel use of low-dose, slow infusion tissue plasminogen activator as a bridge therapy to enable life-saving intervention.
Pulsed delivery of small doses of systemic fibrinolytic with hemodynamic and echocardiographic monitoring may be suitable as a bridge to definitive management in valvular shock patients with LV thrombus. Minimizing instrumentation during structural heart procedures complicated by LV thrombus is critical.
Low-dose, slow-infusion fibrinolysis coupled with echocardiographic monitoring may serve as bridge therapy to urgent structural cardiology intervention in carefully selected patients with LV thrombus and cardiogenic shock."
PubMed,aortic stenosis,Does Left Atrial Size and E/e' Predict Outcomes in Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy?,Brandon Tillson; Stephen Lord; Christopher Eggett,10.1111/echo.70345,2025-11,"Echocardiography (Mount Kisco, N.Y.)","Atrial arrhythmia is prevalent in patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) and is prognostically deleterious. Catheter ablation (CA) has poor efficacy in HCM, making predictors of outcome valuable. Left atrial size is associated with morbidity and mortality, and E/e' has been proposed. The current study evaluates whether these predict non-paroxysmal atrial arrhythmia, interventions for atrial arrhythmia and all-cause mortality.
233 patients from the echocardiography database were included; patients with any mitral annular calcification were excluded. Medical records were reviewed for sample characteristics. Survival analysis was performed for left atrial diameter (LAD), left atrial volume index (LAVi, by area-length method), and E/e' with respect to endpoints, namely: non-paroxysmal atrial arrhythmia; atrial intervention (composite of CA and pace-and-ablate); and all-cause mortality. If LAD or LAVi were significant in multivariate analysis, ROC analysis and DeLong's test were performed to evaluate and compare their discriminative power.
Over a median follow-up of 8 years (median age 53, 73% male), the overall prevalence of non-paroxysmal atrial arrhythmia was 31%. In multivariate models, LAVi was predictive of non-paroxysmal atrial arrhythmia and atrial intervention; LAD was only predictive of arrhythmia. LAVi demonstrated greater discriminative power for predicting atrial intervention. E/e' was not predictive of any outcome. No echocardiographic variable predicted death in multivariate analysis.
LAVi may have greater clinical utility compared to two-dimensional measurements like LAD. Future work should clarify which measures of left atrial size are most appropriate in clinical practice."

However, RV echocardiographic assessment is challenging due to RV geometric changes. Currently, a 3D-derived RV assessment is recommended. Previous studies have shown that RV function is reduced more in surgical aortic valve replacement (SAVR) than in transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR); however, RV assessment in these studies was mostly performed using 2-dimensional echocardiography. Moreover, very few studies have assessed the difference in RV function between full sternotomy (full-SAVR) and mini-sternotomy AVR (mini-SAVR). This study assessed RV function in three types of AVR using 3D RV ejection fraction (RVEF), tricuspid annular plane systolic excursion (TAPSE), and RV fractional area change (RVFAC).
This is a prospective, observational study at a university hospital setting. Participants are adult patients who underwent TAVR, mini-SAVR, and full-SAVR.
Sixty-seven patients were enrolled in this study (22, 22, and 23 patients in the TAVR, mini-SAVR, and full-SAVR groups, respectively). The % change (pre- and post-procedure) in 3D RVEF, RVFAC, and TPASE in TAVR, mini-SAVR, and full-SAVR were as follows: 3D RVEF: 4.51 ± 10.89 (TAVR), -13.67 ± 19.81 (mini-SAVR), and -8.36 ± 18.24 (full-SAVR) (p = 0.003).

MW has been widely used to assess LV function after TAVI in patients with aortic stenosis (AS); however, its application in this context for pure aortic regurgitation (AR) remains rare. This study aims to (1) assess the specific and overall trends of conventional echocardiographic and MW indices after TAVI in patients with pure AR, providing insight into the process and mid-term outcomes of post-TAVI LV functional improvement in this population; (2) evaluate the post-TAVI functional recovery patterns in patients with preserved vs. reduced left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF); and (3) explore the relationship between MW indices and LV reverse remodeling (LVRR) following TAVI in patients with pure AR.
In this prospective cohort study, 43 patients with pure AR who underwent TAVI between January 2023 and July 2024 were enrolled. Serial transthoracic echocardiography was performed at baseline and at 1 week, 1 month, 3 months, and 6 months post-TAVI. Conventional echocardiographic parameters and noninvasive MW indices were analyzed offline.
LVEF, LVGLS, LVGWI, LVGCW, and LVGWE exhibited an overall trend of initial decline followed by subsequent improvement after TAVI, whereas GWW showed an initial increase followed by a decrease. In contrast, LVEDD and LVEDV demonstrated a continuous decline throughout the follow-up period. At 6 months post-TAVI, LVGWI, LVGCW, and LVGWE were significantly reduced, while LVGWW was significantly increased compared with baseline (all p < 0.05). At baseline, post-TAVI, and at 6-month follow-up, LVGLS, LVGWI, and LVGCW were all significantly higher in the LVRR group compared to the non-LVRR group (p < 0.05).
TAVI effectively improves LV function in pure AR, irrespective of baseline LVEF. Noninvasive MW analysis proved to be an effective tool for assessing postoperative improvements in LV myocardial function. The reduction in MW indices at 6 months post-TAVI may reflect partial recovery rather than functional deterioration. Better MW indices at baseline may be associated with LVRR."

Following stabilization, staged TAVR was performed within 15 hours through the same femoral access. The patient was discharged on day 12 with complete left ventricular recovery (ejection fraction, 65% to 70%) at 6 months.

Echocardiography revealed a peak/mean pressure gradient of 101/61 mm Hg and a membranous ventricular septal aneurysm protruding into the right ventricular outflow tract without shunt flow. Right heart catheterization demonstrated right ventricular outflow tract obstruction with a peak pressure gradient of 11 mm Hg. Aortic valve replacement using a bioprosthetic valve and enfolding repair of the membranous ventricular septal aneurysm were performed. The folded aneurysmal tissue was compressed and reinforced with double-applied patches from both the left and right ventricular sides via aortotomy and right atriotomy, respectively. The postoperative course was uneventful. This novel Bi-Patch Enfolding Repair, termed the ""egg muffin technique,"" provides a simple and effective method for volume reduction of aneurysmal tissue. Unlike aneurysm resection with defect closure, it mitigates the risk of iatrogenic shunt formation and atrioventricular block."

Ultra-high resolution (UHR) photon-counting detector CT (PCD-CT) reduces calcium blooming. This study aimed to evaluate the diagnostic performance of UHR CCTA with PCD-CT for detecting coronary stenoses in patients with a high coronary calcium burden compared to invasive coronary angiography (ICA).
In this IRB-approved single-center study, patients with Agatston scores > 600 were included, who underwent ICA and coronary UHR PCD-CT angiography within 2 months. 94% of patients underwent CT prior to transcatheter aortic valve replacement. Coronary arteries were graded for diameter stenosis severity (> 50, > 70%) by two blinded, independent readers. Accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity of CCTA were calculated using ICA as the reference standard. Subgroup analyses were performed across Agatston score groups (600-999, 1000-1999, 2000-2999, and > 3000).
62 patients (mean age, 76 ± 9 years, 16 women) were included. The median Agatston score was 2423 (IQR: 1085-3340). Across all Agatston categories, CCTA demonstrated high diagnostic accuracy and strong agreement with ICA (Cohen's kappa 0.71-1.00). In patients with Agatston scores > 3000 (n = 18), the diagnostic performance of coronary UHR PCD-CT angiography for detecting > 50% (sensitivity 92-100%, specificity 83-100%) and > 70% diameter stenosis (sensitivity 88-100%, specificity 89-100%) remained high for both readers. There was no correlation between the Agatston score and diagnostic error (p > 0.05).
UHR CCTA with PCD-CT provides high diagnostic performance even in patients with extensive coronary calcifications.
Question In patients with severe coronary calcification, conventional coronary CT angiography often suffers from blooming artifacts, reducing accuracy and causing unnecessary invasive procedures. Findings Ultra-high resolution coronary angiography with photon-counting detector CT showed high sensitivity and specificity for detecting stenoses, even at Agatston scores > 3000. Clinical relevance Ultra-high resolution coronary CT angiography enables accurate noninvasive detection of stenoses in heavily calcified vessels, potentially reducing invasive coronary angiography."

This study aimed to compare outcomes of TAVR between patients with MMAVD and those with isolated severe AS. Between January 2019 and June 2024, 848 patients who underwent TAVR at our center were identified for analysis, including 75 with MMAVD and 773 with isolated severe AS. To minimize confounding, 73 MMAVD patients were matched with 264 isolated AS patients using 1:4 propensity score matching for comparative analysis. The primary endpoint was all-cause mortality; secondary endpoints included heart failure rehospitalization, left ventricular (LV) reverse remodeling, and procedural complications. Continuous variables were compared using independent samples t-tests, categorical variables using chi-square or Fisher's exact tests, and survival using Kaplan-Meier curves with log-rank tests. At baseline, MMAVD patients exhibited greater LV dilation (LV end-diastolic diameter [LVEDD]: 56.07±9.04 vs. 50.68±7.70, p<0.001) and hypertrophy (LV mass index [LVMI]: 163.68±50.17 vs. 151.59±44.38, p=0.026). Post-TAVR, MMAVD showed superior reverse remodeling (ΔLVEDD: -7.18±9.75 vs. -2.52±7.64, p<0.001), though LVEF recovery was comparable (ΔLVEF: 5.47±13.98 vs. 6.88±15.20, p=0.52). Survival rates were similar (log-rank p=0.370), but MMAVD had higher 1-year heart failure rehospitalization (5.97% vs. 0.96%, p=0.032). In conclusion, TAVR with self-expandable valves yields comparable survival in MMAVD and isolated AS, with more pronounced reverse remodeling in MMAVD despite advanced baseline disease."

The purpose of this study was to compare simulated mechanical metrics post-TAVR between BAV and trileaflet patients with calcific aortic stenosis.
Pre-TAVR computed tomography scans of trileaflet (n = 22) and BAV (n = 25) were used to segment the aortic valve. Simulated balloon-expandable stent deployment was performed from a previously developed protocol. The bioprosthetic leaflets were then pressurized under a physiological pressure. Stent waist expansion ratio, aspect ratio (AR), leaflet systolic normalized geometric orifice area (GOA), and maximum leaflet diastolic stress were measured.
BAVs had lower waist expansion ratio (87.8% ± 2.6% vs 89.4% ± 1.4%; P < 0.001), lower waist AR (94.6% ± 2.8% vs 98.2% ± 1.0%; P < 0.001), lower normalized GOA (88.9% ± 0.8% vs 89.5% ± 0.7%; P < 0.01), and higher maximum stress (2.81 ± 0.44 vs 2.29 ± 0.25 MPa; P < 0.001) on average compared to trileaflet patients, respectively. Within the BAV group, calcium volume was correlated with waist AR (r = -0.75, P < 0.001), normalized GOA (r = -0.68, P < 0.001), and maximum stress (r = 0.66, P < 0.001).
Balloon-expandable TAVR for BAV has worse simulated mechanical metrics compared to TAVR for trileaflet aortic valve patients and is associated with high calcium volume."

A 74-year-old man with severe symptomatic aortic stenosis and a prior left-subclavian-to-descending aortic bypass presented for TAVR. CT showed a large, calcified annulus (perimeter-derived diameter 27.6 mm; area 573.7 mm²) and a serpiginous, calcified bypass graft. After initial failure to advance the system through the graft, we pre-shaped a Lunderquist wire with an acute bend ~40 cm from the tip to redirect the delivery vector. A 27.5-mm balloon-expandable MyVal was then advanced and deployed uneventfully, with no paravalvular leak.
Intentional pre-shaping of a stiff wire can facilitate TF device traversal across aorto-subclavian bypass grafts with severe tortuosity, enabling safe, precise deployment when TF remains the preferred route."
PubMed,aortic stenosis,Impact of Early Atrioventricular Nodal Blocker Use Post-Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement.,Jocelyn Edwards; Zachary Carroll; Mikayla Lovelace; Jorden Mandel; Lindsay Carter; Theresa Kline,10.1002/ccd.70357,2025-11-20,Catheterization and cardiovascular interventions : official journal of the Society for Cardiac Angiography & Interventions,"High-degree atrioventricular block (AVB) and permanent pacemaker (PPM) implantation remain common complications following transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR). Limited evidence exists on whether early postprocedural administration of atrioventricular (AV) nodal blocking medications impacts these outcomes.
This study aimed to evaluate the safety of AV nodal blocker use within the first 48 h after TAVR.
A retrospective cohort study was conducted in adults who underwent TAVR from January 1, 2016 to April 2, 2024. The population was divided into two cohorts based on administration of an AV nodal blocker within the first 48 h. The primary endpoint was the rate of second-degree or higher AVB at 30 days.
A total of 756 patients met the study criteria, with 381 (50.4%) receiving an AV nodal blocker within 48 h. The primary outcome occurred in 2.7% of patients who did not receive an AV nodal blocker and 1.6% of those who did (p = 0.297). No significant difference was observed in second-degree or higher AVB at discharge, PPM placement at 30 days, or hospital length of stay. All-cause mortality at 30 days was significantly higher in the AV nodal blocker group (2.4% vs. 0.3%, p = 0.011), but this difference did not remain significant after adjusting for covariates.
AV nodal blocker use within 48 h following TAVR was not associated with an increased rate of second-degree or higher AVB or PPM placement. These findings suggest that AV nodal blockers may be considered in the immediate post-TAVR period based on risk-benefit assessment."

This review examines the structure, pathophysiology, and epidemiology of Lp(a), with a focus on its contribution to ASCVD and related conditions such as aortic valve stenosis and peripheral artery disease. The main research question addresses how Lp(a) influences cardiovascular risk and how emerging therapies may modify this risk.
This review synthesizes published evidence describing the biological characteristics of Lp(a), its mechanistic roles in disease, and its epidemiologic associations with cardiovascular outcomes. It also evaluates current and investigational therapeutic approaches by examining clinical trial data for agents targeting Lp(a).
Lp(a) contributes to residual cardiovascular risk through proatherogenic, proinflammatory, and prothrombotic mechanisms. Current evidence highlights its involvement in ASCVD, aortic valve stenosis, and peripheral artery disease. Clinical studies of antisense oligonucleotides, small interfering RNAs, oral small molecules, and CRISPR-based gene editing, including pelacarsen, olpasiran, zerlasiran, lepodisiran, muvalaplin, and obicetrapib, demonstrate promising efficacy and safety. These agents show potential to significantly reduce Lp(a) levels and influence future cardiovascular prevention strategies.
As novel therapies advance and clinical guidelines evolve, Lp(a) is emerging as a central determinant in personalized cardiovascular care. The increasing emphasis on Lp(a) testing underscores its importance in risk stratification and future therapeutic decisionmaking."

Current tissue-based transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) devices are designed for TAV anatomy and merely approved for BAV, leading to poor annular fit, paravalvular leak, thrombosis, and limited durability-especially problematic for younger BAV patients. This study presents PolyV-B, a first-of-its-kind polymeric TAVR device tailored to BAV anatomy, aimed at improving durability, hemodynamics, and outcomes through advanced computational modeling.
PolyV-B features a sutureless, eccentric valve with asymmetric xSIBS polymeric leaflets and a fatigue-optimized nitinol stent with a centerline groove. The 29-mm device incorporates a rhombic stent profile and large cells to enhance anchoring and coronary access. Developed on the 3DExperience platform, it was virtually deployed in six patient-specific BAV anatomies. Its performance was compared to the Evolut R using finite element modeling and fluid-structure interaction (FSI) simulations.
Simulations demonstrated that PolyV-B offers a 50% strain reduction during crimping, improved annular fit, enhanced sealing, and reduced thrombogenic risk. Flow simulations confirmed superior hemodynamics and a larger orifice area compared to Evolut R.
The PolyV-B TAVR device introduces design innovations that enhance durability, hemodynamics, and usability. Simulations in six patient-specific BAV anatomies demonstrated advantages over the Evolut R device. Optimization enabled efficient feasibility assessment, supporting the development of a tailored, clinically impactful solution for the BAV patient population facing unmet clinical needs."

The objective of the study was to examine trends in mortality related to AS in the United States (U.S.). Methods: The U.S. CDC WONDER dataset was analyzed, extracting age-adjusted mortality rates (AAMR) per 100,000 and calculating annual percentage change (APC) through Joinpoint regression. The results were stratified to identify temporal, sex-specific, racial/ethnic, and regional differences. Results: From 1999 to 2020, 267,515 deaths among older adults (&gt;65 years old) were attributed to AS, with the AAMR declining from 28.00 to 23.69. Males had a higher AAMR (30.35) compared to females (27.42), though more deaths occurred in females (164,104 vs. 103,411). Non-Hispanic (NH) Whites exhibited the greatest AAMR (31.61), trailed by NH American Indian/Alaska Native individuals (16.62), whereas NH Asians/Pacific Islanders had the least (11.50). Significant state-wise variations were noted, with AAMRs ranging from 60.55 in Oregon to 17.23 in Mississippi, and 19 states depicting a concerning rise over the study duration. Regionally, the Northeast (32.09) had the highest AAMRs, while the South (23.06) had the lowest. Micropolitan (32.28) and noncore (28.43) areas reported higher AAMRs compared to large central metropolitan areas (24.32). Conclusions: While there is a trend towards decreased mortality due to AS in the U.S., significant disparities based on race, sex, and region persist and may be worsening. The underlying causes of these discrepancies require further investigation, and targeted strategies must be developed to address them effectively."

We searched MEDLINE, Embase, and Scopus from January 2021 through September 2025 and included 59 studies. Owing to heterogeneity in study designs, protocols, and endpoints, the findings were synthesized narratively across five domains (coronary, myocardial, structural/valvular, pulmonary-cardiopulmonary function, and aortic/visceral/peripheral arteries). In coronary imaging, a routine-practice cohort (n = 7.833) reported a per-patient specificity of 98% vs. 93%, lower invasive angiography of 9.9% vs. 13.1%, and a higher revascularization yield of 43.4% vs. 35.5% [PCD-CT vs. energy-integrating detector CT (EID-CT); ultra-high-resolution protocols achieved a vessel-level area under the curve (AUC) of up to 0.99. Low-dose CCTA was feasible at a CTDIvol of 1.72 mGy, and contrast-saving protocols supported diagnostic studies with a volume of 30 mL. Virtual non-contrast calcium scoring showed an intraclass correlation coefficient of 0.98 vs. true non-contrast. In myocardial tissue characterization, PCD-CT-derived extracellular volume differed from cardiovascular magnetic resonance by ≤2% in selected cohorts, with a kappa of up to 0.956 for late-enhancement agreement; segment-level inflammation classification reached an AUC of 0.95. For structural/valvular assessment, a comparative cohort reported an effective dose of 8.8 ± 4.5 vs. 15.3 ± 5.8 mSv, with visual image quality scores of 4.8 vs. 3.3, respectively, for PCD-CT vs. EID-CT. Lung-perfusion iodine maps for chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension achieved an accuracy of 0.85-0.88 at approximately one-fifth of the dose of single-photon emission CT. For aortic/peripheral applications, thoracoabdominal protocols reported a dose of 4.2 ± 1.4 vs. 7.2 ± 2.2 mGy, with a higher signal-to-noise ratio/contrast-to-noise ratio (PCD-CT vs. EID-CT); infrapopliteal imaging used 60 versus 140 mL of contrast, respectively, with improved vessel sharpness for PCD-CT vs. EID-CT; diagnostic performance for peripheral stenosis reached a sensitivity of 91% and a specificity of 95%, respectively, when compared with digital subtraction angiography. Overall, the evidence-predominantly single center-indicates that PCD-CT may enable dose- and contrast-efficient cardiovascular imaging with strong diagnostic metrics, and confirmation in multicenter outcome and cost-effectiveness studies remains a priority."

While certain LMNA gene mutations are known to cause cardiomyopathy and conduction system disease, severe early-onset calcific valvular heart disease is not conventionally considered a typical feature of MADA. This report describes two brothers from a consanguineous Han Chinese family who presented with classical MADA phenotypes alongside severe, early-onset cardiac valvular calcification. Genetic investigation revealed that both affected brothers carried a homozygous missense mutation, c.785A &amp;gt; G (p.Glu262Gly), in the LMNA gene. The elder brother, aged 41, successfully underwent transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) due to severe aortic valve stenosis. This finding represents the first association, to our knowledge, between the homozygous LMNA c.785A &amp;gt; G (p.Glu262Gly) mutation and significant severe early-onset cardiac valvular calcification manifesting as a prominent feature within the MADA phenotype, thus expanding the clinical spectrum associated with MADA and this specific LMNA variant. This case highlights a potentially underrecognized cardiovascular manifestation in MADA patients and underscores the importance of comprehensive cardiac assessment in affected individuals, particularly those from consanguineous families."

The aim of this study is to describe long-term outcomes after the ASO in patients with TGA, and to explore anatomical and clinical factors potentially associated with adverse outcomes, comparing simple and complex TGA. Since December 2001 to October 2023, 233 patients underwent arterial switch operation (158 simple TGA and 75 complex TGA). Kaplan–Meier analysis assessed survival and reoperation risk, Chi-square test and T-student test have been performed in order to analyse pre-, intra- and post-operative data among the two groups. In-hospital mortality was 1.7%. Overall survival rates were 97.9%, 96.8% and 96.8% at 5, 10 and 15 years, respectively. Freedom from surgical reoperation at 15 years was 98.3% in simple TGA and 91% in complex TGA at 15 years ( p = 0.039). Reinterventions were infrequent and mainly related to pacemaker implantation and right ventricular outflow tract obstruction. Coronary artery stenosis occurred in 5 patients (2.2%). Risk factors analysis suggested that anatomical complexity such as intramural coronary artery ( p = 0.003), aortic arch hypoplasia ( p = 0.004), aortic arch interruption ( p = &lt; 0.001) and coronary reimplantation with button technique ( p = 0.018) are predictive factors for mortality. In addition, complex TGA ( p = 0.022) and post-operative aortic regurgitation ( p &lt; 0.001) are identified as potential predictive factors for reintervention. Arterial switch operation provides excellent long-term survival and low reintervention rates in TGA. These results support tailored long-term surveillance, particularly for patients with complex anatomy or coronary anomalies."
OpenAlex,aortic stenosis,Numerical Simulation of Aortic Valve Leaflets Calcification Influence on Hemodynamic Performance Using Fluid–Structure Interaction Approach,Polina Fedotova; Nikita Pil; Alex G. Kuchumov; Ekaterina Barbashina; Vladimir Tsilibin; Fulufhelo Nemavhola; Thanyani Pandelani; Bakytbek Kadyraliev; Truong Sang Ha,10.3390/pr13113750,2025-11-20,Processes,"Aortic valve calcification is the process of calcium buildup on the leaflets of the aortic valve, preceding functional insufficiency. Calcification underlies the development of aortic stenosis by stiffening the valve leaflets, leading to restricted aortic valve opening during systole and obstructed blood flow. However, a more comprehensive understanding of the hemodynamic effects of altered valve properties is required. Therefore, it is crucial to investigate the biomechanical properties of aortic valve leaflets susceptible to calcification. To examine fluid flow in an aorta segment with leaflets of different stiffness, a two-way fluid–structure interaction model was developed. The leaflet’s behavior was modeled using two constitutive laws—linear-elastic and isotropic hyperelastic—followed by numerical testing and comparative analysis. Using the material parameter values c01 and c10 within the ranges of 22–60 and 22–60 kPa, respectively, the hyperelastic model was examined. The valve leaflets’ Young’s modulus ranged from 1 to 22 MPa, while their Poisson’s ratio ranged from 0.35 to 0.45. A high correlation between Poisson’s ratio and wall shear stress was found. With an elastic modulus of 22 MPa and the highest Poisson’s ratio of 0.45, the maximum wall shear stress was 81.78 Pa during peak flow velocity and complete valve opening, while the lowest wall shear stress was 0.38 Pa. We can infer from the study’s results that, when considering the isotropic structure and nonlinear characteristics of valve leaflets, the Delfino hyperelastic model more accurately depicts their complex behavior."

Methods: We conducted a single-center, randomized, open-label, proof-of-concept study with blinded endpoint assessment using 1F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography/computed tomography (1F-FDG PET/CT). Adults with asymptomatic carotid stenosis (20-80%) and baseline carotid inflammation (target-to-background ratio [TBR] 1.6) were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive either aspirin (100 mg/day) plus rivaroxaban (2.5 mg twice daily) or aspirin (100 mg/day) alone. The primary endpoint was the percent change in the most diseased segment (MDS) TBR of the index carotid artery from baseline to 12 months. Secondary endpoints included whole-vessel carotid TBR, aortic TBR, and changes in lipids and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein. Results: Between September 2021 and December 2023, 92 patients were randomized (mean age 69.4 years; 88% men); 81 (88%) completed 12-month imaging. Mean percent changes in carotid MDS TBR were 7.25% (95% CI, 11.03 to 3.48) and 7.36% (95% CI, 11.06 to 3.67) in the combination therapy and aspirin-alone groups, respectively. The adjusted between-group difference (combination therapy minus aspirin alone) was 1.50 percentage points (95% CI, 6.20 to 3.21; P=0.53). No significant between-group differences were observed in whole-vessel carotid or aortic TBR, or in laboratory parameters. Minor bleeding occurred in four patients (8.7%) receiving combination therapy and in one (2.2%) receiving aspirin alone, with no major bleeding or deaths. Conclusions: In patients with carotid atherosclerosis, adding low-dose rivaroxaban to aspirin did not reduce arterial inflammation beyond aspirin alone over 12 months on 1F-FDG PET/CT."

Cooper; Sahas Chandragiri; Amir F Mohani; Deepika Devuni,10.5500/wjt.v15.i4.102995,2025-11-18,World Journal of Transplantation,"Aortic stenosis (AS), a progressive disease affecting aortic valve function, is common among individuals with metabolic and degenerative conditions, and is notably challenging to manage in patients with cirrhosis. Patients with cirrhosis frequently experience exacerbated AS symptoms due to the hyperdynamic circulatory state induced by portal hypertension, which masks early AS signs, resulting in delayed diagnosis. The coexistence of AS and liver disease significantly complicates management, particularly for those awaiting liver transplantation (LT), where untreated AS can increase perioperative morbidity and mortality. This review examines the pathophysiology, clinical manifestations, and management of AS in cirrhotic patients, with a focus on implications for LT candidates. Available treatment options, including surgical aortic valve replacement and transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR), are discussed, with TAVR emerging as a preferred approach due to favorable outcomes in high-risk patients. We also explore the potential role of TAVR as a bridge to LT, with case reports showing promising, albeit anecdotal, success in restoring LT candidacy. Limitations in current perioperative risk assessment tools, which inadequately address the unique risks faced by cirrhotic patients undergoing cardiac procedures, highlight the need for multi-disciplinary care and further research to improve outcomes of patients with concomitant end-stage liver disease and AS."
