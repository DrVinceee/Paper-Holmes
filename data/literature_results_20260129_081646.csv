PubMed,aortic stenosis,Prevalence and clinical implications of angiodysplasia in patients with aortic stenosis: a systematic review and meta-analysis.,Muhammad Abdel-Gawad; Yahya Almansoury; Hanaa Nagdy; Fathiya El-Raey; Mohamed El-Kassas,10.1097/MEG.0000000000003133,2026-01-22,European journal of gastroenterology & hepatology,"Gastrointestinal angiodysplasia is frequently observed in patients with aortic stenosis and may present with bleeding and anemia. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to estimate its prevalence in this population and to summarize outcomes after valve intervention. Following PRISMA 2020, we searched PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science and registered the protocol in PROSPERO (CRD42024550839). Eligible observational studies reporting angiodysplasia, von Willebrand factor abnormalities, or both in aortic stenosis were appraised for quality and pooled using a random effects model; heterogeneity and publication bias were assessed with I² and Egger's test. Eleven studies were included. The pooled prevalence of gastrointestinal angiodysplasia among patients with aortic stenosis was 6.3% (95% confidence interval: 4.51-8.38, I² = 98.68, P < 0.0001), with no evidence of publication bias. Across studies that reported longitudinal outcomes, aortic valve replacement or transcatheter aortic valve implantation was associated with a reduction in lesion burden and lower rates of gastrointestinal bleeding, anemia, transfusion, and readmission, although early postprocedural bleeding could occur and typically declined over follow-up. These findings indicate that angiodysplasia is a clinically relevant comorbidity in aortic stenosis and support proactive gastrointestinal evaluation in patients with anemia or unexplained bleeding. Standardized diagnostic criteria and prospective studies are needed to clarify long-term outcomes after valve therapy and to define screening and management pathways."
PubMed,aortic stenosis,AI-assisted computed tomography analysis for pre-procedural planning prior to TAVI.,Mani Arsalan; Hanna Schneider; Kerstin Piayda; Philipp Christian Seppelt; Arnaud Van Linden; Stephan Fichtlscherer; Florian Hecker; David Leistner; Thomas Walther,10.1007/s00392-025-02790-6,2025-11-12,Clinical research in cardiology : official journal of the German Cardiac Society,"Several software programs have specifically been developed to analyse cardiac computed tomography prior to transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI). However, they are not able to perform a complete analysis independently. We report the performance of a fully automated, deep learning-based algorithm for pre-procedural CT analysis as compared to the current clinical standard.
Patients with symptomatic severe aortic stenosis undergoing TAVI were retrospectively enrolled. The pre-procedural dataset was analysed by both a standard TAVI CT-analysis software and by a fully automated CT analysis platform with a deep learning-based algorithm.
Ninety-eight patients were included in the analysis. The mean annulus diameter was 24.4 ± 2.4 mm (conventional = 3mensio, Pie Medical Imaging, 3 M) vs. 24.0 ± 2.4 mm (artificial intelligence = AI), mean absolute error (MAE): 0.64 mm, mean absolute percentage error (MAPE): 2.6%. The mean annulus perimeter was measured at 77.7 ± 7.4 mm (3 M) vs. 76.1 ± 7.5 mm (AI), MAE: 2.26 mm, MAPE: 2.9%. The mean annulus area was calculated at 468.9 ± 92.1 mm2 (3 M) vs. 455.6 ± 91.0 mm2 (AI), MAE: 22.4 mm2, MAPE: 4.8%. The intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs) of all abovementioned parameter were > 0.95 showing an excellent correlation between the two methods. The distance from the annulus to the left coronary artery depicted to 14.0 ± 3.2 mm (3 M) vs. 12.6 ± 2.8 mm (AI), MAE: 2.1 mm, MAPE: 14.3%. The distance to the right coronary artery was 17.1 ± 2.7 mm (3 M) vs. 16.5 ± 3.2 mm (AI), MAE: 1.7 mm, MAPE: 10.1%. The ICCs of the distances to the coronary ostia showed good correlation between both methods.
In this retrospective analysis, a deep learning-based analysis of pre-procedural CT datasets showed good to excellent correlation with conventional assessment for the preprocedural TAVI CT measurements. AI-based fully automated CT analysis could emerge to a valuable alternative to conventional CT assessment in the pre-procedural-planning for TAVI."

Arginine vasopressin (AVP) promotes myofibroblast proliferation and collagen synthesis through V1a receptors. While hepatic studies suggest that AVP deficiency attenuates fibrosis, its cardiac impact remains unclear. This study evaluated the effects of AVP deficiency induced by neurointermediate pituitary lobectomy (NIL) and pharmacological V1a/V2 blockade with conivaptan (CV) in rats with fibrosis from abdominal aortic stenosis (AAC). Wistar rats were divided into seven groups with 10 animals each. Clinical variables and histopathology (H&E, Masson's trichrome, picrosirius red) were assessed. ANOVA, Fisher and Mantel-Cox tests were applied. The Fibrosis (F) group developed hypertrophy, hypertension, higher arrhythmia risk and increased fibrosis. In contrast, F+NIL and F+CV showed blood pressure and cardiac morphology comparable to controls, reduced arrhythmia risk and significantly less fibrosis. Histologically, F+NIL achieved partial regression, whereas F+CV nearly normalized tissue architecture. In conclusion, AVP deficiency or receptor blockade decreases and reverses AAC-induced fibrosis, improving hemodynamic, electrical, and structural outcomes. V1a/V2 blockade emerges as a potential therapeutic strategy."

Cardiovascular imaging,"Racial and ethnic differences have been reported for aortic valve calcium (AVC) and long-term aortic stenosis (AS). Whether these differences are due to differing risk factor profiles or the burden of AVC is unknown.
Baseline AVC was quantified using the Agatston method among 6812 MESA (Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis) participants. AVC scores were not reported to participants. The primary outcome of long-term moderate or severe AS was adjudicated using standard clinical criteria. We calculated multivariable Cox proportional hazards with log-transformed AVC as a continuous variable for each race and ethnicity.
The mean age was 62 years, and 47% of participants were women. Over a median follow-up of 16.7 years, 140 participants were diagnosed with moderate (n=56) and severe AS (n=84). The prevalence of baseline AVC >0 by self-reported race and ethnicity was White (15.8%), Hispanic (13.3%), Black (12.3%), and Chinese (8.3%). The rate of long-term incident moderate-severe AS was highest for White participants (2.1/1000 person-years) and lowest for Chinese participants (0.5/1000 person-years). The association of AVC with moderate-severe AS was significant for all race and ethnicity groups: White hazard ratio, 1.82 (95% CI, 1.62-2.03); Hispanic hazard ratio, 2.18 (95% CI, 1.82-2.62); Black hazard ratio, 2.28 (95% CI, 1.78-2.93); and Chinese hazard ratio, 3.65 (95% CI, 1.05-12.71) per 1 unit higher log transformed AVC. There was no interaction by race and ethnicity (P=0.26) when modeling Black versus non-Black participants.
The racial and ethnic groups with a higher baseline prevalence of AVC had a higher long-term incidence of moderate-severe AS, but a similar relative association between AVC and moderate-severe AS regardless of baseline atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease risk. Our findings suggest that differences in AS by race and ethnicity may likely be explained by the burden of AVC."

However, the response of LVEF to transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) is variable, with some patients even demonstrating a decline. The mechanisms underlying this phenomenon are incompletely characterized. Accordingly, we investigated changes in systolic function in the near-term postoperative period following TAVR.
We studied consecutive patients with severe AS referred for TAVR without identifiable perioperative sources of negative inotropy or ventricular dyssynchrony. Preoperative and postoperative day one echocardiograms were compared with respect to hemodynamics, LV geometry, LVEF, and midwall fractional shortening (FSmw). Contractility was assessed by comparing observed FSmw values to those predicted based on the stress-shortening relation of healthy controls.
Thirty-six patients were included (61% women; mean age 77 years; mean Society of Thoracic Surgeons mortality risk score 3.6%). Following TAVR, there was a precipitous decline in circumferential end-systolic wall stress from 122 ± 47 to 74 ± 32 kdyn/cm2 (p < 0.001) and a slight increase in LVEF. Surprisingly, however, there was also an increase in the percentage of patients with depressed contractility from 22% (8) to 78% (28) (p < 0.001). Heart rate and ventricular volumes remained unchanged.
Contractility declined in the near-term postoperative period following TAVR. We interpret this finding to suggest that contractility is augmented by high afterload in severe AS and declines in parallel with afterload reduction. We speculate that autoregulatory mechanisms triggered by high valvular resistance support LVEF in severe AS and rapidly abate following TAVR."
PubMed,aortic stenosis,Association between inflammatory hematological ratios and aortic valve stenosis: a propensity-matched analysis.,Xin Gong; Min Wang; Liang Wang; Shangwei Huang; Bijun Huang; Tian Chen; Lianghua Xia; Wei Wei; Qi Zhang; Jianqiang Hu; Jing Xu,10.3389/fcvm.2025.1482313,2025,Frontiers in cardiovascular medicine,"Relationship between systemic inflammation and aortic valve stenosis (AVS) has been well demonstrated. This investigation aimed to evaluate the link between various inflammation hematological ratios and patients with AVS.
Patients with AVS (n = 229) and control (n = 1716) were identified. Propensity score matching (PSM) was performed with the proportion of 1:1 using logistic regression based on the variables of age, sex, hypertension, diabetes, creatinine (Cr) and glutamate transpeptidase (γ-GT). The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis was used to estimate the performance of inflammation hematological ratios for distinguishing AVS. Univariate and multivariate analysis were performed to identify the independent risk factors of AVS. In addition, restricted cubic splines (RCS) regression analysis revealed the non-linear correlation between inflammation hematological ratios and AVS.
After PSM, 392 patients (196:196) were included. Univariate analysis showed monocyte/high density lipoprotein ratio (MHR) and neutrophil/lymphocyte ratio (NLR) were significantly higher in AVS group (MHR, 0.49 ± 0.23 vs 0.32 ± 0.20, p < 0.001, NLR, 3.52 ± 2.52 vs 2.87 ± 1.89, p < 0.001) while lymphocyte/monocyte ratio (LMR) was significantly lower (3.27 ± 1.72 vs 4.08 ± 1.76, p < 0.001). But the level of platelet/lymphocyte ratio (PLR) and systemic inflammation index (SII) (PLR, 146.27 ± 82.68 vs 143.27 ± 66.95, p = 0.927, SII, 690.22 ± 602.69 vs 610.58 ± 403.33, p = 0.100) did not differ significantly between the two groups. However, in multivariate logistic regression models, only MHR remained to be an independent risk factor of AVS (OR 2.010 with 95%CI 1.040-3.887, p = 0.038). Besides MHR, atrial fibrillation (AF), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), triglycerides (TG) and hemoglobin (Hgb) were also performed to be independent risk factors of AVS. ROC analysis showed that the cut-off value of MHR (0.2750) indicated AVS with 85.2% sensitivity and 51.5% specificity [95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.691-0.788, the area under the curve [AUC] = 0.740, P < 0.001]. Further, RCS revealed the non-linear correlation between MHR and AVS (p for non-linearity <0.001).
Elevated MHR was independently associated with the presence of AVS. MHR demonstrated stronger associational strength with AVS compared to other inflammatory hematological ratios such as SII, NLR, PLR and LMR."
PubMed,aortic stenosis,Transcatheter or sutureless/rapid-deployment aortic valve replacement? Contemporary insights from an individual patient data meta-analysis.,Jae-Sung Choi; Jong-Ho Park; Se Jin Oh; You Jung Ok; Sohee Oh; Yong Won Seong; Hyeon Jong Moon; Jae Hwa Jeong,10.1097/JS9.0000000000004918,2026-01-28,"International journal of surgery (London, England)","Transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) and sutureless/rapid-deployment aortic valve replacement (SUAVR) have each undergone rapid technological advances and expanding indications. However, direct comparative evidence between the two, particularly for long-term outcomes, remains limited.
We conducted an updated meta-analysis of propensity score-matched studies using reconstructed individual patient data (IPD) to compare TAVR with SUAVR. The protocol was registered in PROSPERO (CRD420251046330). Published Kaplan-Meier survival curves were digitized, IPD reconstructed, and pooled analyses performed. Meta-regression was conducted on the pooled population.
A total of 6604 matched patients from 14 studies were included (TAVR: 3298; SUAVR: 3306). TAVR was associated with lower long-term survival (52.5% vs. 64.6% at 9 years; hazard ratio = 1.48, 95% CI: 1.27-1.72; P < 0.001), higher 30-day mortality [odds ratio (OR) = 2.26, 95% CI: 1.36-3.76], and increased rates of permanent pacemaker implantation (PPI; OR = 1.85, 95% CI: 1.10-3.10) and moderate-or-greater paravalvular leak (PVL; OR = 4.46, 95% CI: 2.58-7.71). In contrast, mean pressure gradient (mean PG) was lower with TAVR (standardized mean difference = -0.52, 95% CI: -0.75 to -0.29). Meta-regression suggested that higher rates of PPI, prosthesis-patient mismatch, and moderate-or-greater PVL may attenuate the survival advantage of SUAVR, although the magnitude of this effect appeared modest.
SUAVR was associated with superior long-term survival and favorable early outcomes compared with TAVR, whereas mean PG favored TAVR. These findings suggest that SUAVR may mitigate the surgical trauma inherent to conventional AVR, narrowing the gap with TAVR, and the choice of TAVR or SUAVR should be carefully individualized, especially in patients with longer life expectancy."

Emerging evidence suggests that these agents may also affect valvular pathobiology, particularly in degenerative aortic stenosis (AS), through anti-inflammatory and antifibrotic mechanisms. Objectives: This study evaluated whether SGLT2 inhibitor use is associated with improved clinical outcomes in degenerative AS, including all-cause mortality and the need for SAVR or TAVR, recognizing that these endpoints represent surrogate rather than direct measures of valve hemodynamic progression. Methods: A retrospective cohort analysis was conducted using TriNetX, a federated electronic medical record-based research network. Diagnoses are captured using ICD-9/ICD-10-CM codes and medications using ATC codes. Adults with non-rheumatic AS were stratified by SGLT2 inhibitors use. Propensity score matching (1:1) was performed to balance baseline characteristics between treated and untreated groups (n = 10,912 per group). Primary outcomes included all-cause mortality, TAVR, and SAVR during follow-up. Echocardiographic parameters (AVA, Vmax, mean gradient) were not systematically available. Results: After adjustment for comorbidities, SGLT2 inhibitor use was independently associated with lower all-cause mortality (6.15% vs. 9.34% HR 0.595; 95% CI 0.552-0.641; p < 0.001), TAVR (2.81% vs. 2.89% HR 0.835; 95% CI 0.746-0.934; p = 0.002), SAVR (1.28% vs. 1.90% HR 0.514; 95% CI 0.442-0.599; p < 0.001), cardiac arrest (0.82% vs. 1.21% HR 0.71; 95% CI 0.582-0.867; p < 0.001), and end-stage kidney disease (0.40% vs. 1.0% HR 0.292; 95% CI 0.222-0.384; p < 0.001). Although these associations may suggest slower disease progression, interpretation is limited by the lack of systematic echocardiographic follow-up. Conclusions: In addition to their established benefits in heart failure and renal protection, SGLT2 inhibitors may have valve-preserving effects in degenerative AS. Because true hemodynamic progression could not be evaluated, these results should be viewed as associations with surrogate clinical endpoints. Prospective studies with standardized imaging are required to determine whether SGLT2 inhibition can directly alter the course of this currently untreatable disease."

The ratio of blood urea nitrogen to left ventricular ejection fraction (BUN/EF) integrates renal and cardiac status into a single physiological index. This study aimed to evaluate the prognostic value of both baseline and temporal (48-72 h) BUN/EF ratios for predicting mortality after TAVR. Methods: A total of 429 patients (mean age 76 ± 8 years; 51% female) who underwent TAVR for severe aortic stenosis between 2017 and 2025 were retrospectively analyzed. The primary endpoint was long-term all-cause mortality; in-hospital mortality was secondary. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves, Cox regression, and reclassification metrics (NRI, IDI) assessed prognostic performance. Restricted cubic spline (RCS) analysis explored non-linear associations. Results: During a median follow-up of 733 days, overall and in-hospital mortality rates were 37.8% and 7.9%, respectively. Both baseline and 48-72 h BUN/EF ratios were independently associated with mortality (HR = 3.46 and 3.79 per 1 SD increase; both p < 0.001). The temporal ratio showed superior discrimination for in-hospital mortality (AUC = 0.826 vs. 0.743, p = 0.007). Adding baseline BUN/EF to EuroSCORE II significantly improved model performance (AUC 0.712 vs. 0.668, p = 0.031; NRI = 0.33; IDI = 0.067). RCS analysis revealed a linear relationship for baseline and a steep, non-linear association for temporal ratios with mortality risk. Conclusions: The 48-72 h BUN/EF ratio is a robust dynamic biomarker that predicts early mortality after TAVR, while baseline BUN/EF identifies patients at long-term risk. Integrating this simple bedside index into risk algorithms may refine postoperative monitoring and improve outcome prediction in TAVR populations."

With its progressive course, AS leads to ventricular hypertrophy, impaired diastolic and systolic function, and symptomatic deterioration. The natural history of AS is closely linked to the extent of myocardial and extracardiac damage in association with the patients comorbidities. Diagnosis relies primarily on transthoracic echocardiography, which assesses valve morphology, quantifies stenosis severity, and evaluates cardiac remodeling. However, discordant grading is frequent, necessitating advanced imaging to clarify the severity and the mechanism of the stenosis and stratify risk. Treatment is predominantly interventional, as no medical therapy is able to stop disease progression. Surgical aortic valve replacement (SAVR) and transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) are the two treatment options. Special clinical scenarios-such as cardiogenic shock or concomitant cardiac amyloidosis-pose additional diagnostic and therapeutic challenges and require individualized, multidisciplinary management. Overall, contemporary AS care increasingly integrates multimodality imaging, refined risk stratification, and tailored interventional strategies to optimize outcomes."
PubMed,aortic stenosis,Aortic Stenosis as a Mechanical Stressor and Tissue Energetics: Consistent Clue with Hypertensive Stress Septal Sign.,Fatih Yalcin; Nagehan Kücükler; Boran Cagatay; M Roselle Abraham; Theodore P Abraham; Mario J Garcia,10.3390/jcm15020623,2026-01-13,Journal of clinical medicine,"Background: Hemodynamic overload induces left ventricular remodeling and heart failure across various clinical presentations. While geometric remodeling is classically associated with increased vascular resistance in hypertension, distinct patterns emerge under the mechanical stress of aortic stenosis (AS). Concept: The ""Stress Septal Sign"" (Triple S) represents a marker of stress-mediated hemodynamic overload driven by diverse stimuli, ranging from mechanical stress in AS to emotional triggers in acute stress cardiomyopathy. Within this spectrum, Stressed Heart Morphology describes a specific phenotype characterized by a predominant and hyperdynamic LV septal base. Results: Chronic hemodynamic stress in severe AS results in prominent basal septal hypertrophy. This remodeling is characterized by distinct tissue energetics: hypermetabolic activity at the basal septum contrasted with reduced metabolic activity or hypokinesis in the apical regions. These findings on myocardial geometry, function, and energetics align with the adaptive phase of LV remodeling. Conclusions: The presence of adaptive myocardial basal tissue suggests an advanced remodeling stage that may require timely therapeutic intervention in severe AS. Therefore, identifying these specific tissue characteristics offers a unifying imaging paradigm (Triple S) for assessing cardiac stress, independent of the primary etiology."

Therefore, simple and practical biomarkers for NOAF prediction remain a clinical priority. Increasing evidence indicates that malnutrition is linked to postoperative complications, including the onset of atrial fibrillation. The Prognostic Nutritional Index (PNI), which reflects the immunonutritional and inflammatory status through serum albumin concentration and lymphocyte count, has emerged as a reliable prognostic indicator in cardiovascular disease. The present study aimed to investigate the association between PNI and the development of NOAF in patients undergoing surgical aortic valve replacement (SAVR). Methods: A total of 241 consecutive patients who underwent AVR for severe aortic stenosis or regurgitation were enrolled in this study. The population was stratified into two groups according to the development of NOAF (NOAF group) or the lack thereof (no NOAF group). Results: In both univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses adjusted for several established NOAF determinants, age and PNI, both as continuous variables, were independently associated with NOAF in both univariate (OR = 1.03; CI 95% = 1.01-1.06, p = 0.009, and OR = 0.9; CI 95% = 0.8-0.9, p = 0.01, respectively) and multivariate models (OR = 1.02; CI 95% = 1.01-1.06, p = 0.05, and OR = 0.9; CI 95% = 0.8-0.9, p = 0.03, respectively). When PNI was analyzed by tertiles, patients in the lowest tertile (PNI < 41.5) showed a significantly higher risk of developing NOAF at both univariate (OR = 1.9; CI 95% = 1.2-2.8, p = 0.004) and multivariate analysis (OR = 1.6; CI 95% = 1-2.6, p = 0.03), whereas age lost statistical significance (OR = 1.0; 95% CI = 0.9-1.05; p = 0.06). Furthermore, when the study population was divided into two groups based on the median age (70 years), PNI values differed significantly between NOAF and no NOAF patients only in patients under 70 years (p = 0.01). In this younger subgroup, PNI remained an independent predictor of NOAF, both when considered as a continuous variable (OR = 0.86; CI 95% = 0.74-0.98, p = 0.02), and nominal variable (PNI < 41.5, OR = 0.88; CI 95% = 0.80-0.97, p = 0.01). Conclusions: Overall, these findings identify PNI as an independent predictor of NOAF following SAVR, particularly in patients younger than 70 years. This study underlines the potential clinical value of preoperative nutritional assessment for risk stratification. Incorporating nutritional parameters such as PNI into current predictive models may enhance the accuracy of prognostic evaluation and support targeted perioperative management strategies."
PubMed,aortic stenosis,Assessment of Potential Predictors of Aortic Stenosis Severity Using ECG-Gated Multidetector CT in Patients with Bicuspid and Tricuspid Aortic Valves Prior to TAVI.,Piotr Machowiec; Piotr Przybylski; Elżbieta Czekajska-Chehab,10.3390/jcm15020551,2026-01-09,Journal of clinical medicine,"Background/Objectives: The aim of this study was to evaluate the usefulness of selected predictive parameters obtainable from cardiac multidetector computed tomography for assessing the severity of aortic valve stenosis in patients scheduled for transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI). Methods: A detailed retrospective analysis was performed on 105 patients with a bicuspid aortic valve (BAV), selected from a cohort of 1000 patients with BAV confirmed on ECG-gated CT, and on 105 patients with a tricuspid aortic valve (TAV) matched for sex and age. All patients included in both groups had significant aortic stenosis confirmed on transthoracic echocardiography. Results: Across the entire cohort, a trend toward higher aortic valve calcium scores was observed in patients with bicuspid compared to tricuspid aortic valves (4194.8 ± 2748.7 vs. 3335.0 ± 1618.8), although this difference did not reach statistical significance (p = 0.080). However, sex-stratified analysis showed higher calcium scores in males with BAV than with TAV (5596.8 ± 2936.6 vs. 4061.4 ± 1659.8, p = 0.002), with no significant difference observed among females (p > 0.05). Univariate regression analysis showed that the aortic valve calcium score was the strongest statistically significant predictor of aortic stenosis severity in both groups, with R2 = 0.224 for BAV and R2 = 0.479 for TAV. In the multiple regression model without interaction terms, the explanatory power increased to R2 = 0.280 for BAV and R2 = 0.495 for TAV. Conclusions: In patients scheduled for TAVI, linear regression models assess the severity of aortic stenosis more accurately than any individual predictive parameter obtainable from ECG-CT, with the aortic valve Agatston score emerging as the most reliable single CT-derived predictor of stenosis severity in both TAV and BAV subgroups."

Advanced glycation end products (AGEs) and their receptor (RAGE) promote cardiovascular tissue inflammation. This study aimed to investigate whether inflammatory activity within the EAT, particularly involving the AGEs-RAGE axis, is associated with AS. Methods: We studied 42 patients (isolated AS, n = 15; AS with CAD, n = 15; and CAD alone, n = 12) undergoing surgical intervention, along with 10 autopsy controls. EAT volume was assessed via computed tomography and indexed to body surface area. Furthermore, macrophage infiltration (CD68) and RAGE expression in EAT samples were analyzed using immunohistochemistry and immunofluorescence imaging. Results: EAT volume index was significantly higher in all surgical groups than in the controls (p < 0.001). These surgical groups also had markedly increased CD68- and RAGE-positive cells compared with the controls (p < 0.001), with colocalization detected by means of immunofluorescence imaging. Additionally, the EAT volume index independently and positively correlated with CD68-positive cell counts (p = 0.021), and causal mediation analysis suggested that it promotes CD68-positive macrophage activation through pathways mediated by RAGE-positive cells (p = 0.024). Inflammatory cells did not correlate with AS severity (maximum aortic jet velocity, mean pressure gradient, aortic valve area). Conclusions: EAT in AS exhibits increased macrophage infiltration and RAGE expression. Therefore, the AGEs-RAGE axis may contribute to local inflammatory activity, and EAT can be a potential biomarker and therapeutic target in AS."

This study evaluated whether BMI independently predicts early complications, mortality, or infection following TAVR in a Saudi Arabian cohort. We conducted a retrospective analysis of 197 patients who underwent TAVR between 2015 and 2024, stratified by BMI < 25, 25-29.9, and ≥30 kg/m2. The primary endpoint was the in-hospital Valve Academic Research Consortium-3 (VARC-3) composite safety outcome, with secondary outcomes including individual complications, infection, length of stay, and 30-day mortality or readmission. Overall, patients had a mean age of 74.9 ± 8.8 years and 52.3% were female; in-hospital mortality was 2.0%, technical success 99%, and 30-day readmission 12.7%. BMI category was not independently associated with in-hospital complications or mortality, while advanced age ≥ 75 years (adjusted OR 2.52, p = 0.009), moderate Society of Thoracic Surgeons (STS) risk (adjusted OR 3.75, p = 0.008), and high STS risk (adjusted OR 2.26, p = 0.033) independently predicted complications. Overweight patients had higher in-hospital infection rates (14.1% vs. ~3%, p = 0.020). These findings suggest that physiologic vulnerability and operative risk, rather than BMI alone, should guide early TAVR risk assessment."

Approximately 45% of patients with VHD have been diagnosed with HTN. This association increases with age, but cannot be explained solely by the rising prevalence of both conditions. HTN promotes the onset or worsening of VHD by mechanically stressing the valves and by modified blood flow dynamics through increased filling pressures and afterload. It has been shown that a 20 mmHg rise in BP triples the risk of aortic valvular disease and mitral regurgitation. This review will address the impact of HTN on the occurrence and progression of valvular lesions, its effect on the prognosis of patients with VHD, and the available data on blood pressure management. As long as relatively well-documented data on aortic valve disease are available, studies are still needed to clarify target blood pressure values under therapy and the most appropriate drug classes for mitral regurgitation, especially in its primary forms."

It is also indicated for younger patients with significant comorbidities, for valve-in-valve interventions, and in selected patients with severe aortic insufficiency. We aimed to evaluate procedural and clinical outcomes of transfemoral TAVI performed over the course of 12 years by the same operators using different bioprosthetic valves. Materials and Methods: Between 2012 and 2023, 375 patients underwent TAVI in our clinic, with six types of bioprosthetic valves (Edwards Sapien XT, Medtronic Valves [CoreValve and Evolut R], Portico, Myval, Acurate Neo, and Direct Flow Medical). A transfemoral approach was used in all patients. The procedural and clinical outcomes were defined according to Valve Academic Research Consortium-3 (VARC-3) criteria. Results: The mean age of the patients was 78.4 ± 7.3, and their median STS score was 4.2 (2.9-5.9). Of the 375 patients, 361 had severe AS, 4 had severe aortic insufficiency, 5 were valve-in-valve, and 5 were valve-in-TAVI. Seven patients required a second valve implantation: four due to embolization of the prosthetic valve and three due to deep implantation of the prosthetic valve. Based on the VARC-3 criteria, the rates of technical success and device success were 90.4% and 85.3%, respectively. Major vascular complications were observed in 18 (4.8%) patients. Also, 42 (11.2%) patients required permanent pacemaker implantation. The incidence of moderate or worse paravalvular leak was 2.9%. The peri-procedural, 30-day, 1-year, and 5-year mortality rates were 5.1%, 4.3%, 15.2%, and 45.6%, respectively. STS scores (HR:1.129, 95%CI: 1.068-1.192, p < 0.001) and post-TAVI acute kidney injury (HR:3.993, 95%CI:1.629-9.785, p = 0.002) were detected as independent predictors of mortality in Cox regression analysis. Conclusions: This registry demonstrated the evolution of TAVI procedures at a single center over 12 years. A high level of collaboration between experienced operators and innovations in devices seem to be the key features for achieving high procedural success and low complication rates."

Here, we show that γ-ORZ markedly attenuates PCM-induced intracellular ROS elevation, osteogenic differentiation, and calcium phosphate deposition in porcine VICs (pVICs). In addition, RT-qPCR and Western blot analyses revealed significant downregulation of calcification markers (RUNX2, OPN, BMP2), along with suppressed SMAD1/5/9 transcription and phosphorylation, decreased p38/ERK MAPK activation, and reduced ALP activity. Collectively, these findings indicate that γ-ORZ mitigates oxidative stress-mediated valvular calcification by inhibiting both canonical and non-canonical BMP2-SMAD/MAPK signaling, suggesting its potential as a medicinal candidate for early intervention in CAVS."

The HALP (hemoglobin, albumin, lymphocyte, and platelet) score is an easily obtainable composite index that reflects nutritional status and systemic inflammation. Methods: In this single-center retrospective study, 140 patients who underwent TAVR between 1 April 2021, and 31 October 2024, were included. Patients were stratified according to the median HALP score (32.65) into low (<32.65)- and high (≥32.65)-HALP groups. In-hospital outcomes were mortality, bleeding requiring transfusion of >5 units of red blood cells, acute kidney injury (AKI), need for mechanical ventilation >24 h, and length of hospital stay. Associations between the HALP score and clinical outcomes were evaluated using multivariable regression analyses, and the discriminatory performance of HALP was assessed using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves. Results: Patients with low HALP scores had higher rates of in-hospital mortality (11.4% vs. 4.2%; p = 0.002), bleeding (28.6% vs. 5.7%; p < 0.001), AKI (11.4% vs. 2.9%; p < 0.001), and need for mechanical ventilation >24 h (25.7% vs. 14.4%; p = 0.002), as well as longer hospital stay (4.82 ± 1.50 vs. 3.62 ± 1.94 days; p = 0.001) compared with the high-HALP group. In multivariable models, a lower HALP score remained independently associated with all adverse in-hospital outcomes. ROC analysis showed good discriminatory ability of the HALP score for mortality (area under the curve [AUC] = 0.816; cut-off = 20.16), bleeding (AUC = 0.798; cut-off = 24.94), AKI (AUC = 0.737; cut-off = 26.21), and need for mechanical ventilation (AUC = 0.735; cut-off = 27.36). Conclusions: The HALP score is independently associated with adverse in-hospital clinical outcomes in patients undergoing TAVR and may serve as a simple and practical tool for early risk stratification in this population."

To investigate the effect of long-term oral ivabradine on heart rate (HR), haemodynamics, cardiac function and apoptosis in dogs with MMVD stage B2.
Four dogs with MMVD stage B2 received ivabradine (1 mg/kg orally, q12h) for 3 months. Under general anaesthesia (propofol and isoflurane), electrocardiograms and invasive measurements of left ventricular, aortic, pulmonic, right atrial and pulmonary capillary wedge pressures were obtained at baseline and 3 months. Endomyocardial biopsies were collected at both timepoints for histopathology and immunohistochemical evaluation of Bcl-2 and Bax expression to assess apoptosis.
Ivabradine decreased HR by 30.4% (p < 0.05) without significantly affecting systemic or pulmonary pressures, vascular resistance or systolic/diastolic function. Histopathological analysis showed significant reductions in myocyte vacuolization (68.5%), glycogen accumulation (47.6%), interstitial fibrosis (57.3%) and fibrofatty infiltration (77.8%) (p < 0.05). The apoptosis index was reduced by 17.0% (p < 0.05), and Bcl-2 expression tended to increase (p = 0.06).
Chronic ivabradine treatment lowered HR and reduced cardiac structural remodelling and apoptosis without impairing cardiac function in dogs with MMVD stage B2. These findings support the potential of ivabradine as a therapeutic option for asymptomatic canine heart disease."

This report focuses on challenges encountered with pericardiocentesis, the role of hemodynamic support, and the importance of invasive blood pressure monitoring.
An 11-year-old, weighing 2.9 kg, male Chihuahua was scheduled for mitral valve plasty due to severe MR. The dog developed acute collapse and dyspnea and was diagnosed with LAR and pulmonary edema; pericardiocentesis was withheld due to relatively stable hemodynamics. Despite inotropic support and diuretics administration, a second LAR occurred the following day during transport for echocardiographic examination, with a large intrapericardial clot preventing pericardiocentesis and causing shock. Although fluid therapy and ephedrine administration improved blood pressure, invasive blood pressure monitoring and strict rest were subsequently employed to maintain a lower systolic pressure, enabling safe anesthetic induction. Under cardiopulmonary bypass, clot removal was performed. Intraoperatively, due to inadequate venous return, the heart enlarged and a third LAR occurred, necessitating repair of the rupture site with a pericardial patch under cardioplegic arrest alongside chordae tendineae reconstruction. Postoperatively, the dog developed dyspnea potentially related to lung injury, transfusion effects, or residual pulmonary edema, which resolved with medical management. Marked thrombocytopenia emerged soon after switching antibiotics but improved rapidly following corticosteroid administration and discontinuation of the suspected antibiotic. The dog was discharged in good condition and remained clinically stable 1 year later.
This case provides a detailed account for the stepwise medical and anesthetic management of recurrent LAR secondary to severe MR. During conservative treatment, pericardiocentesis was not always effective, particularly in the presence of intrapericardial clots, which might have interfered with drainage. In the setting of cardiac tamponade, increasing pre- and after-load along with positive inotropic support appeared to contribute to temporary hemodynamic stabilization. Invasive arterial pressure monitoring allowed for stable hemodynamic control and safe anesthetic induction, underscoring its importance for preoperative management. Furthermore, the third intraoperative rupture was successfully repaired using a pericardial patch, which achieved effective hemostasis and demonstrated its potential value as a surgical option for LAR repair."

Therefore, this study aimed to comprehensively assess the outcomes of mitral valve repair across different MR etiologies, including primary MR, left ventricle functional MR (LVFMR), ischemic MR, left atrial functional MR (LAFMR), and rheumatic MR, by examining in-hospital, short-term, and medium-term outcomes, as well as the change in cardiac function through echocardiographic parameters and strain analysis.
This retrospective study included 911 patients who underwent mitral valve repair at a single center from 2015 to 2021. Echocardiographic and strain analyses were performed preoperatively and at 6 months post-surgery. Mortality outcomes were assessed at in-hospital and at 6, 12, and 51 months postoperatively.
There were significant differences in outcomes across MR etiologies. The primary and rheumatic groups demonstrated the lowest mortality rates, whereas the LVFMR, LAFMR, and ischemic groups exhibited markedly higher mortality, both in the early postoperative period and during long-term follow-up. Echocardiographic analysis showed improvements in cardiac dimensions and volumes, but concurrent declines in myocardial function, particularly in ejection fraction, global longitudinal strain, and left atrial reservoir strain.
This study highlights the importance of etiology-specific risk stratification. While mitral valve repair effectively reduces MR, myocardial recovery may be delayed or insufficient in certain subgroups, especially those with pre-existing myocardial dysfunction. Tailored therapeutic strategies that address the multifactorial nature of functional and ischemic MR are warranted to improve long-term outcomes."

To evaluate whether a deep learning model can accurately detect significant valvular and ventricular dysfunction using only a single two-dimensional apical four-chamber echocardiographic view, including images acquired by non-cardiologists with handheld ultrasound devices.
We retrospectively analyzed 120,127 echocardiographic studies from a tertiary medical center to train and validate a deep learning model for identifying moderate-or-greater mitral or tricuspid regurgitation, right ventricular dysfunction, and reduced left ventricular ejection fraction (≤40%). A prospective cohort of 209 patients underwent handheld point-of-care cardiac ultrasound performed by non-cardiologist physicians, with same-hospitalization comprehensive echocardiography as the reference standard.
In retrospective testing, model areas under the curve (AUCs) were 0.883 for mitral regurgitation, 0.913 for tricuspid regurgitation, 0.940 for right ventricular dysfunction, and 0.982 for reduced ejection fraction. In the prospective cohort, AUCs were 0.72, 0.87, 0.95, and 0.97 for the same respective targets.
A single-view deep learning model demonstrated strong diagnostic accuracy for detecting significant valvular and ventricular dysfunction across both standard and handheld ultrasound acquisitions. This approach may facilitate rapid, scalable cardiac function screening by non-cardiologists in diverse clinical environments.

The Japanese Circulation Society recommends a volumetric method which uses mitral annular diameters from apical four-chamber (A4C) and two-chamber (A2C) views. However, given the elliptical shape of the mitral annulus, use of apical long-axis (A3C) and A2C views, which reflect the anatomical long and short axes, may improve measurement accuracy. This study aimed to determine the optimal echocardiographic view combination for precise EROA quantification in degenerative MR (DMR). Methods: We retrospectively analyzed 98 patients with DMR who underwent both transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) and three-dimensional transesophageal echocardiography (3D TEE) within three months between April 2018 and December 2023. EROA was calculated using volumetric methods based on two TTE view combinations, A4C-A2C (EROA 4/2) and A3C-A2C (EROA 3/2). These were compared with 3D TEE-derived vena contracta area (VCA), which served as reference standard. Results: Mean values of EROA were 0.57 ± 0.23 cm2 for EROA 4/2, 0.50 ± 0.21 cm2 for EROA 3/2, and 0.49 ± 0.18 cm2 for 3D TEE VCA. EROA 4/2 was significantly larger than VCA (p < 0.01), whereas EROA 3/2 did not significantly differ from VCA (p = 0.41) and showed a stronger correlation with VCA than EROA 4/2 (r = 0.829 vs. r = 0.638, p < 0.01). Conclusions: Volumetric EROA assessment using A3C and A2C views provides more accurate quantification in DMR than the conventional A4C and A2C approach. Anatomically appropriate imaging planes should be prioritized to enhance the accuracy of MR severity evaluation."

In this study, the mitral valve geometry is parameterized using twelve geometric variables, and a global sensitivity analysis based on Sobol indices is performed to quantify their relative importance. Because global sensitivity analysis requires many simulations, a Gaussian Process regressor is developed to efficiently predict the orifice area from the geometric inputs. Structural simulations of the mitral valve are carried out in Abaqus, focusing exclusively on the valve mechanics. The predicted distribution of orifice areas obtained from the Gaussian Process shows strong agreement with the ground-truth simulation results, and similar agreement is observed when only the most influential geometric parameters are varied. The analysis identifies a subset of geometric parameters that dominantly govern the mitral valve orifice area and can be reliably extracted from medical imaging modalities such as echocardiography. These findings establish a direct link between echocardiographic measurements and physics-based simulations and provide a framework for patient-specific assessment of mitral valve mechanics, with potential applications in guiding interventional strategies such as MitraClip placement."

We tested whether machine learning (ML) can improve classification of LVFP and investigated which parameters were deemed most important by different ML models.
In a multicentre study, echocardiography was performed simultaneously with, or within 24 hours of, heart catheterization in 250 patients. Eight different ML models were trained and tested using a nested cross-validation procedure to classify LVFP as normal or elevated. The training included a search and selection of the most useful parameters. Performance was assessed from the test sets not seen during training.
The eight ML models could classify all patients regardless of missing parameter values with accuracy ranging from 82% to 86%. The 2016 ASE/EACVI guidelines algorithm left 13% unclassified due to missing values and had an accuracy of 81% in the remaining patients. On average the eight ML models selected 13 parameters, and left atrial strain was included in three of these. The five highest ranked parameters by the ML models were: mitral E/left atrial reservoir strain, log(NT-proBNP), tricuspid regurgitation velocity, septal E/e' and E/A.
ML can improve classification of LVFP, particularly with a higher feasibility. The study unveiled less used parameters as some of the most valuable for evaluating LVFP."

Cheetah CO was obtained concurrently with thermodilution CO (TD CO). Bias data was non-normally distributed; therefore, a non-parametric equivalent to Bland and Altman limits of agreement was used. Additionally, the proportions of differences between the experimental and reference method that were ≤ 0.5 L/min, ≤ 1 L/min, and >1 L/min were calculated. Twenty-seven subjects were enrolled and completed the study. The median difference between Cheetah and TD CO measurements was - 0.82 L/min, and the 5th and 95th centiles were - 6.05 L/min and 3.25 L/min, respectively.

This study examined the utility of Doppler-derived transseptal flow velocity as a non-invasive method to estimate peak left atrial pressure.
A retrospective analysis was performed in 41 patients who underwent transcatheter mitral edge-to-edge repair at a single center. Immediately after the procedure, transesophageal echocardiography was used to obtain maximum continuous-wave Doppler velocity across the iatrogenic atrial septal defect. The simplified Bernoulli equation, combined with invasively measured right atrial pressure, was applied to calculate Doppler-derived peak left atrial pressure. Invasively measured peak left atrial pressure served as the reference standard.
The median invasive peak left atrial pressure following the procedure was 15 mmHg (interquartile range, 12-20), while the median Doppler-derived peak left atrial pressure was 14 mmHg (interquartile range, 12-18). Doppler-derived estimates demonstrated a strong correlation with invasive measurements (correlation coefficient = 0.90), whereas peak Doppler velocity alone showed only a moderate correlation (correlation coefficient = 0.61). Lin's concordance correlation coefficient demonstrated strong agreement (0.86; 95 % confidence interval, 0.73-0.95). Bland-Altman analysis demonstrated a mean bias of - 1.54 mmHg, with narrow limits of agreement (-6.2 to + 3.1).
Doppler-derived assessment of transseptal flow provides a practical and accurate non-invasive method for estimating peak left atrial pressure after transcatheter mitral edge-to-edge repair. This approach may augment current post-procedural evaluation strategies and support clinical decision-making in the management of patients undergoing mitral valve intervention."

Five studies comprising 315 patients (n = 141 Levosimendan, n = 174 controls) met the inclusion criteria. Pooled analysis showed no significant difference in postprocedural LVEF between Levosimendan-treated patients and controls (mean difference 0.45%, 95% CI [-1.46-2.35] p = 0.65) and no significant change from baseline. Similarly, postprocedural sPAP did not differ significantly. Procedural success was higher with Levosimendan, and procedure duration was shorter. These hypothesis-generating findings highlight the need for larger, prospective randomized trials to clarify the role of Levosimendan in this setting."

Advances in imaging have refined diagnostic criteria, reducing historical overdiagnosis and clarifying the morphologic continuum from fibroelastic deficiency to extensive myxomatous degeneration (Barlow's disease). Beyond mitral regurgitation and infective endocarditis, a small but clinically important subset of patients is at increased risk of malignant ventricular arrhythmias and sudden cardiac death, giving rise to the concept of arrhythmogenic MVP. This phenotype is characterized by a combination of clinical, anatomical, myocardial, and electrical features rather than a single abnormality. Key associated findings include bileaflet prolapse, female sex, electrocardiographic repolarization changes, frequent or complex ventricular ectopy, myocardial fibrosis detectable by cardiac magnetic resonance, abnormal tissue Doppler signals, and mitral annular disjunction (MAD). MAD, including both true MAD and the more common pseudo-MAD, contributes to excessive mobility of the mitral valve apparatus, abnormal systolic annular motion (""curling""), and repetitive mechanical stress on the papillary muscles and inferobasal left ventricular myocardium, promoting fibrosis and arrhythmogenesis. Importantly, arrhythmic risk may persist even after surgical correction of mitral regurgitation, likely due to established myocardial substrate. Contemporary registry data confirm the heterogeneity of MVP and suggest that true primary arrhythmogenic MVP is relatively uncommon but identifiable using detailed echocardiographic and electrocardiographic assessment. Overall, arrhythmogenic MVP should be viewed as a syndrome spanning a spectrum from benign to malignant, underscoring the need for integrated risk stratification and targeted follow-up. This review summarizes the recent progress in understanding of this complex entity summarizing recent expert recommendations and novel registry data."

This study aimed to compare LA strain parameters in patients with mitral stenosis (MS) and mitral regurgitation (MR) to identify discriminators between these conditions.
This cross-sectional study included 44 patients with moderate-to-severe MR and 44 patients with severe-to-very severe MS, all with normal left ventricular ejection fraction. Patients with left ventricular systolic dysfunction, ischemic mitral regurgitation, or atrial fibrillation were excluded. Clinical data were collected, and LA strain analysis was performed offline using EchoPAC software. The study analyzed LA reservoir, conduit, and contractile strain components.LAstrainSR, LAstrainCD and LAstrainCT were derived and analyzed for their diagnostic performance. Data were analyzed using SPSS version 26.0, with one-way ANOVA used to compare LA strain parameters between groups.
LAstrainCD demonstrated the highest diagnostic accuracy (81.8%) for differentiating MS from MR, making it the most reliable strain parameter. LAstrainCT showed the best performance for assessing MR severity, with a moderate accuracy of 61.5%.
This study elucidates the distinct impacts of mitral stenosis and regurgitation on left atrial function, as reflected by LA strain parameters. LAstrainCD emerges as a key discriminator between these conditions, highlighting differences in atrial remodeling due to pressure and volume overload. Furthermore, LAstrainCT's correlation with MR severity enhances our understanding of atrial adaptation to regurgitant volume. These findings advance the knowledge of mitral valve disease pathophysiology, providing a foundation for improved diagnostic and therapeutic strategies."

In this study, we showed that the sequential development of bilateral CRVO in an elderly patient was related to increased venous pressure in the right heart system. A 71-year-old man developed CRVO in the right eye, and one year later, he developed CRVO in the left eye. He had undergone pacemaker implantation for sick sinus syndrome 10 years earlier and had started hemodialysis three months prior for chronic renal failure, probably caused by hypertensive nephrosclerosis. The right CRVO resulted in neovascular glaucoma and loss of light perception despite intensive treatment with panretinal laser photocoagulation, intravitreal bevacizumab injection, and additional laser therapy. In contrast, the left CRVO remained at an impending stage, was treated only with panretinal laser photocoagulation, and had a favorable outcome for 11 years until his death. In retrospect, half a year after the onset of left CRVO, the patient underwent open-heart surgery to repair aortic, mitral, and tricuspid valve regurgitation through aortic valve replacement, mitral valve annuloplasty, and tricuspid valve annuloplasty, respectively. Based on the temporal sequence of events, elevated venous pressure due to right heart dysfunction may have contributed to the poor outcome of the right CRVO, whereas improvement of venous stasis after cardiac surgery may have led to the better long-term outcome of the left CRVO. Venous stasis in the right heart system should therefore be considered an underlying factor in the development of bilateral CRVO."

However, a subsequent ECG obtained during spontaneous heart rate deceleration to 143 bpm showed narrow QRS complexes with discernible sinus P waves and a markedly prolonged PR interval (300 ms). These findings establish the diagnosis of sinus rhythm with biatrial enlargement and first-degree atrioventricular (AV) block. Comparative analysis of these ECGs revealed that the initial tracing did not represent a true wide QRS complex but rather a ""pseudo-wide QRS complex"" tachycardia. This phenomenon occurs when profound PR prolongation results in concealed sinus P waves overlapping the terminal portion of the preceding QRS complex, thereby mimicking a wide QRS complex. The significant PR interval prolongation, reflecting first-degree AV block, is likely attributable to underlying anatomical abnormalities leading to atrial enlargement and consequent impaired AV nodal conduction. This case report highlights the critical importance of meticulously identifying concealed sinus P waves within wide QRS rhythms to prevent misdiagnosis and inappropriate interventions."

Over the past two decades, tissue-engineered heart valves (TEHVs) have emerged as a promising alternative, combining biomaterials and patient-specific strategies to overcome these limitations. However, persistent issues, such as immune rejection, poor hemocompatibility, and inconsistent remodeling - continue to hinder clinical translation. Recent advances in immunomodulation, scaffold engineering, and personalized therapies show promise in mitigating these challenges, yet a fully integrated, comprehensive strategy remains elusive. This review critically explores the convergence of TEHVs and immunomodulation, focusing on how biomaterial-based immune engineering, nanoparticle-driven tolerance strategies, and advanced scaffold design can reshape heart valve therapy. By synthesizing recent innovations and highlighting key translational gaps, this paper lays the groundwork for a new generation of TEHVs that integrate, adapt, and regenerate, moving beyond passive mechanical replacements toward truly personalized cardiovascular solutions."

Methods: We analyzed 3239 individuals with cardiovascular diseases (81.2% males) who participated in a three-week cardiac rehabilitation program at Bad Schallerbach center (Upper Austria). Training success was measured by maximal oxygen consumption (VO2 max). Sex-specific differences in baseline characteristics were assessed using t-tests/chi2 tests. Associations between covariates and the outcome were evaluated with baseline-adjusted univariate analysis of variance/linear regression models. Covariates significant at α = 0.05 were included in a multivariable linear regression model, which was refined by backward selection based on the best Akaike information criterion. The final model was used to test the relationship between sex and the outcome. Results: The mean age and BMI were 63.9 years and 27.5 kg/m2 for males and 67.2 years and 27.4 kg/m2 for females. Males had higher baseline VO2 max compared to females (26.18 mL/min/kg vs. 23.55 mL/min/kg, p < 0.001), and a greater change in VO2 max after rehabilitation was seen in males compared to females (3.64 mL/min/kg vs. 2.77 mL/min/kg, p < 0.001). Female sex was associated with a 1.4-point-lower change in VO2 max after adjustment for comorbidities, sex, and training intensity (β coefficients = -1.409; CI 95% -0.410, -0.104; p < 0.001). Heart valve surgery (β coefficients = -0.90; CI 95% -1.444, -0.366; p < 0.001) and diabetes mellitus (β coefficients = -1.207; CI 95% -1.926, -0.488; p < 0.0001) were associated with lower changes in VO2 max in both sexes. Conclusions: Our findings suggest that females and individuals with specific comorbidities benefit less from cardiac rehabilitation and support the creation of personalized rehabilitation programs."

Early postoperative IE of the autograft is exceptionally rare, with only isolated cases reported in major registries. Case Summary: We report a 40-year-old man with bicuspid aortic valve and a history of two previous episodes of native valve endocarditis who underwent Ross procedure with Ozaki modification. Ten days postoperatively, he developed fever and was diagnosed with early autograft IE with perivalvular abscess formation. Despite negative blood cultures (due to prior antibiotic administration), clinical findings met modified Duke criteria for possible IE. Imaging revealed perivalvular abscess with subsequent pseudoaneurysm development, while the autograft leaflets remained functional. The patient was successfully treated with 6-week combination antibiotic therapy without requiring surgical reintervention. After one year of follow-up, he remains asymptomatic with stable pseudoaneurysm size and preserved valvular function. Conclusions: Early IE following Ross procedure, though rare, should be considered in patients presenting with postoperative fever. This case demonstrates that conservative management with appropriate antibiotic therapy can be successful even with perivalvular complications, provided there is hemodynamic stability and close multidisciplinary monitoring. Long-term surveillance remains essential given the persistent structural abnormalities."

While left ventricular assessment has traditionally dominated prognostic evaluation, right ventricular (RV) dysfunction and RV-pulmonary artery (PA) coupling have emerged as critical determinants of outcomes. Objectives: This review synthesizes current evidence on RV-PA coupling as a prognostic marker in cardiac amyloidosis, examining measurement methodologies, prognostic significance, pathophysiological mechanisms, and clinical applications. Methods: We comprehensively reviewed the recent literature on RV-PA coupling in CA, focusing on studies published from 2020 to 2025, including both AL and ATTR subtypes. We analyzed data from multicenter cohorts, prospective registries, and validation studies examining the relationship between RV-PA coupling indices and clinical outcomes. Results: RV-PA coupling, most commonly assessed using the tricuspid annular plane systolic excursion to pulmonary artery systolic pressure (TAPSE/PASP) ratio, consistently demonstrates strong independent prognostic value for mortality and heart failure outcomes in CA patients. Impaired coupling (TAPSE/PASP < 0.45 mm/mmHg) identifies high-risk patients with hazard ratios ranging from 1.98 to 4.17 for adverse outcomes. In a multicenter cohort of 283 patients, TAPSE/PASP < 0.45 mm/mmHg was independently associated with death or heart failure hospitalization (HR 1.98, 95% CI 1.32-2.96, p = 0.001) and significantly improved risk reclassification (NRI 0.46-0.49). In ATTR-specific populations receiving disease-modifying therapy, impaired coupling (TAPSE/PASP ≤ 0.382 mm/mmHg) predicted three-year mortality with an adjusted HR of 2.99. The coupling index provides incremental value over individual RV parameters by accounting for afterload conditions and demonstrates consistent prognostic performance across both AL and ATTR subtypes. Conclusions: RV-PA coupling represents a robust, easily obtainable prognostic marker that should be routinely assessed in CA patients for risk stratification and clinical decision-making. The TAPSE/PASP ratio can be calculated from standard echocardiographic examinations without additional cost or time, making it practical for widespread implementation. Future research should focus on standardizing measurement protocols, establishing disease-specific thresholds, evaluating coupling trajectories with novel therapies, and integrating coupling assessment into staging systems and management algorithms. The strong prognostic signal, pathophysiological relevance, and ease of measurement position RV-PA coupling as an essential component of comprehensive cardiac amyloidosis evaluation."

We conducted a retrospective cohort study of adults with definite infective endocarditis treated at a tertiary referral center between 2017 and 2022, comparing patients with DUA-IE to those with non-drug use-associated infective endocarditis. Of the 189 patients, 43 (22.8%) had DUA-IE. These patients were significantly younger and had higher rates of HIV and hepatitis C coinfections. Staphylococcus aureus was the predominant pathogen, and right-sided valve involvement was more frequent; however, left-sided disease predominated among patients requiring valve surgery. Compared with non-DUA-IE patients, those with DUA-IE had larger vegetations, higher inflammatory markers, more frequent complications(including sepsis, embolic events, and heart failure), higher rates of emergency surgical intervention, longer hospitalizations, and increased in-hospital mortality rates. In conclusion, DUA-IE represents a distinct and more aggressive form of infective endocarditis, characterized by severe infection, increased complication rates, and a substantial surgical burden despite the younger patient age, underscoring the need for integrated infectious disease, surgical, and addiction-focused care models for these patients."

A deeper understanding of SVD pathogenesis, particularly of the immune-mediated processes altering current BHV materials, is therefore critical. To this end, commercially available BHV tissues of bovine, porcine, and equine origin were investigated following subcutaneous implantation into α1,3-galactosyltransferase-knockout (Gal KO) mice. We compared the immune responses between adult and aged animals via histological assessments of explants and measurement of serum anti-galactose α1,3-galactose (Gal) and anti-non-Gal antibodies at 2 months post-implantation. In contrast to adult mice, old Gal KO mice did not show increased levels of serum anti-Gal or -non-Gal antibodies after receiving specific BHV tissue (i.e., Freedom-Solo). Instead, a significant decrease in serum anti-Gal IgM was found in old recipients of Freedom-Solo. Furthermore, the overall cellular immune response was attenuated in explants from old mice compared with adults (i.e., ATS 3f and Crown). Nevertheless, the Freedom-Solo (bovine) and the Hancock-II (porcine) tissues still elicited strong cellular immune infiltration in the old cohorts. Therefore, the Gal KO mouse model offers a valuable platform to investigate age-related differences regarding cellular and humoral immune responses to various BHV tissues, contributing to our understanding of SVD."

We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to evaluate the short-term benefits between these approaches.
To evaluate the short-term benefits of MIMVS versus CMVS in adults.
We searched PubMed/MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cochrane Library, LILACS, SciELO, clinical trial registries and grey literature using MeSH terms, without date or language restrictions. Randomised clinical trials (RCTs) comparing MIMVS and CMVS in adults (≥18 years) were included. Robotic, endovascular and redo procedures were excluded. Two reviewers independently extracted data following Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines. Risk of bias was assessed with the Cochrane tool, and certainty of evidence with Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation. Meta-analyses used random-effects models. Primary outcomes were mortality, acute kidney injury (AKI) and wound infection.
Nine studies (1248 patients) from eight RCTs were included (686 CMVS, 562 MIMVS). MIMVS showed no significant difference in mortality or AKI compared with CMVS. There was a trend towards fewer wound infections (risk ratio=0.47; 95% CI=0.22 to 1.00) and shorter intensive care unit (ICU) stay (mean difference=-0.71 days; 95% CI=-1.47 to 0.04). MIMVS reduced reoperation for bleeding (RR=0.24; 95% CI=0.06 to 0.92) and hospital stay (mean difference=-1.83 days; 95% CI=-3.03 to -0.64). Operative times were longer with MIMVS, but without clinical impact. Stroke, myocardial infarction, mechanical ventilation time and transfusion rates were similar. Most studies had low risk of bias, with moderate to high certainty of evidence. No heterogeneity was detected for primary outcomes.
MIMVS enhances postoperative recovery through shorter hospital stays, fewer reoperations for bleeding and a trend towards fewer wound infections and shorter ICU stays compared with CMVS. Despite longer operative times, key safety is comparable between techniques. The overall certainty of evidence is high for most outcomes, supporting strong clinical recommendations in favour of MIMVS.

The diagnosis of heart muscle disease is likely to have a significant impact on flying privileges, with the risk assessment requiring careful testing and careful follow up. Consideration must also be given to the treatments used in each individual, as these may also pose an aeromedical risk. In athletic aircrew, differentiating athletic adaptation from a cardiomyopathy is essential to decide if flying restrictions are necessary.
This article provides insights into the appropriate investigation of aircrew with suspected or proven heart muscle disease, to assist with licensing decisions. Four case vignettes are presented (myocarditis, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, dilated cardiomyopathy, and athletic heart) to give a broad overview of the commonest areas of heart muscle disease seen in aircrew. The relevant features of evaluation, treatment, and aeromedical relevance are provided in a brief discussion of each case.

This study develops an efficient 3D deep-learning framework to generate T1-contrast enhanced images (T1C) from pre-contrast multiparametric MRI.&#xD;Approach: We propose the 3D latent rectified flow (T1C-RFlow) model for generating high-quality T1C images. First, T1w and T2-FLAIR images are input into a pretrained autoencoder to acquire an efficient latent space representation. A rectified flow diffusion model is then trained in this latent space representation. The T1C-RFlow model was trained on a curated dataset comprised of the Brain Tumor Segmentation (BraTS) 2024 glioma (GLI; 1480 patients), meningioma (MEN; 1141 patients), and metastases (MET; 1475 patients) datasets. Selected patients were split into training (N=2860), validation (N=612), and test (N=614) sets. Model performance was evaluated with the normalized mean squared error (NMSE) and structural similarity index measure (SSIM).&#xD;Results: Both qualitative and quantitative results demonstrate that the T1C-RFlow model outperforms benchmark 3D models (pix2pix, denoising diffusion probability models (DDPM), Diffusion Transformers (DiT-3D)) trained in the same latent space. T1C-RFlow achieved the following metrics - GLI: NMSE 0.044 ± 0.047, SSIM 0.935 ± 0.025; MEN: NMSE 0.046 ± 0.029, SSIM 0.937 ± 0.021; MET: NMSE 0.098 ± 0.088, SSIM 0.905 ± 0.082. Further studies showed T1C-RFlow to have the best tumor reconstruction performance and significantly faster denoising times (6.9 s/volume, 200 steps) than conventional DDPM models in both latent space (37.7s, 1000 steps) and patch-based in image space (4.3 hr/volume).&#xD;Significance: Our proposed method generates synthetic T1C images that closely resemble radiological features of ground truth T1C in much less time than previous diffusion models. Further development may permit a practical method for contrast-agent-free MRI for brain tumors.&#xD."

However, electronic health record (EHR) inefficiencies burden clinicians and contribute to their cognitive overload and burnout. This study evaluated the impact of a large language model (LLM)-enabled clinical decision support (LLM-CDS) platform compared with a simulated EHR (SimEPR) on workflow efficiency and user experience in generating accurate clinical summaries during tumor board preparation and explored its applicability to consultation preparation, referrals, treatment planning, and patient communication.
In a remote, within-participant simulation, 26 oncologists from the United Kingdom, United States, Spain, and Singapore reviewed synthetic breast cancer cases and created comprehensive summaries for tumor board discussions using both LLM-CDS and SimEPR. LLM-CDS provided editable LLM-generated summaries; SimEPR required manual composition. Time to task completion was recorded. An independent reviewer assessed summary quality based on completeness, correctness, and conciseness. Participants also completed surveys on usability, cognitive load, and feature acceptability.
LLM-CDS significantly reduced the summary completion time compared with SimEPR (6:55 v 8:47 minutes; P < .001). Summary completeness was rated higher with LLM-CDS (mean score, 3.93 v 3.13), whereas correctness and conciseness were similar. Overall, 87% of participants would recommend LLM-CDS and 96% would anticipate time savings. The system usability scale score for LLM-CDS was 65.7. Although perceived cognitive load was lower with LLM-CDS, the difference was not statistically significant. The LLM summary was the most valued, with 92% finding it useful for the tumor board and consultation preparation.
The LLM-CDS platform improved the efficiency and completeness of clinical summarization. Strong user acceptance and anticipated time savings underscore the potential for streamlining a range of oncology workflows."

Lower-flux and shorter dwell time scans mitigate this problem, but the resulting signal loss can only partially be compensated by adding detector elements, a strategy limited by the instrument's geometry and cost. We introduce an self-supervised machine learning (ML) pipeline that recovers signal by exploiting the intrinsic redundancy in the data captured by multielement detectors. Inspired by the Noise2Noise approach, we train a deep convolutional neural network directly on the multiple, statistically independent noisy images collected by individual detector elements, without requiring clean training targets. Tested on a resolution target and a cryogenically fixed biological cell, the method markedly improved signal-to-noise ratios over classical filters while preserving spatial resolution and elemental quantification even for small images. To our knowledge, this is the first ML-based denoiser demonstrated for XRF. This approach reduces the dependence of image quality on photon dose and enables rapid, low-dose chemical imaging. It is readily transferable to any modality that records parallel, noise-independent views of the same sample."

While artificial intelligence (AI) offers potential solutions, existing models often lack interpretability and fail to address uncertainty, limiting clinical utility. CLinNET, a multi-modal deep neural network with a dual-branch design integrating sequencing data, gene expression, biological pathways, and gene ontology (GO) is introduced to enhance gene curation and VUS interpretation. CLinNET employs a biologically informed architecture, confidence-based uncertainty quantification, and layer-wise SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) for robust interpretability. Its sparse networks, enriched with pathway and GO data, prioritize tissue-expressed genes to improve prediction accuracy and biological relevance. Trained on ND datasets, CLinNET outperformed existing methods with an F1-score of 76.4%, accuracy of 77.2%, and area under the precision-recall curve (AUC-PR) of 84%. Incorporating uncertainty filtering further improved precision to 87% while retaining 73% of predictions as high-confidence. CLinNET identified significantly more ND-associated genes than random permutations, with minimal overlap with cardiovascular-associated genes, confirming specificity. Among the top decile of ranked genes, 78 were linked to NDs (p-value = 1.2e-11), and 372 to rare diseases involving nervous system abnormalities, highlighting their diagnostic potential.

Circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) has emerged as a dynamic biomarker for MRD detection. It enables real-time disease monitoring, prognostication, and often therapeutic decision-making. Two major ctDNA approaches exist, tumor-informed and tumor-agnostic, and they differ in sensitivity, specificity, and clinical feasibility. Recent clinical trials have supported a prognostic and predictive utility of ctDNA MRD in gastrointestinal, lung, breast, and other malignancies, with positive postoperative or post-treatment MRD status correlating with higher recurrence risk and inferior survival outcomes. However, integration into clinical practice remains limited by challenges, including tumor heterogeneity, variable ctDNA shedding across tumor stage, location and timing, lack of standardized assay interpretation, and cost-effectiveness concerns. Emerging technologies such as methylation-based sequencing, ultra-deep next-generation sequencing, and machine learning-driven risk models hold promise for improving detection accuracy and clinical applicability. Ongoing clinical trials are expected to determine the impact of earlier MRD detection and intervention on patient outcomes, potentially supporting the broader adoption of ctDNA MRD. In this article, the authors reviewed the recent clinical applications, limitations and future directions of MRD in solid tumors."

The latter are built by training a neural network on a very extended collection of molecular data, with the DM21, the aPBE0-ML, and the Skala functionals now available using such a strategy. This degree of development could have not been possible without the knowledge achieved so far, after more than half a century of investigations and applications of DFT to all kind of systems, and it is rooted on the traditional local (LDA), semi-local (GGA or meta-GGA) and non-local (hybrid and double-hybrid) functionals, which are still important pillars of DFT and are expected to coexist with deep-learned models, as well as on the creation of large and diverse datasets of nearly-exact reference results, which are also needed to train any of the deep-learned models envisioned."

Our engineering strategy commenced with a deep mechanistic analysis of PUP using GaMD simulations. This provided the blueprint for our first key step: engineering PUPdel, a truncated variant that achieved a pivotal breakthrough by incorporating 3'-terminally blocked nucleotides and enabling controlled template-independent synthesis. Subsequently, we screened single-point mutations using protein language models (e.g. ESM1v) combined with Rosetta-based stability predictions, yielding a 47.78% hit rate for functionally active variants. Iterative ML models predicted synergistic multi-mutant combinations, increasing success rates to 63%. Finally, ESM3-based generative design produced PUPdel2, with 16 mutations conferring 3.4°C higher thermostability, 3.7-fold improved expression, and up to 5.4-fold enhanced catalytic efficiency for 3'-O-allyl-UTP.

Traditional bubble detection methods generally operate on the mixture of bubble and ambient sounds, which cannot achieve satisfactory performance in low SNR environments. In this study, we propose a deep learning (DL) based bubble sound separation method to extract the bubble waveform from the noisy mixture prior to detection, thereby enhancing the bubble detection performance. To obtain the labeled training data, we developed a numerical simulation framework based on bubble acoustic theories to generate the ground truth bubble sounds, which are then mixed with diverse noises. Experiments were conducted with both simulated data and realistic PAM recordings. The simulation experiments under different noise conditions demonstrate that the DL models can effectively extract bubble sound, even when their features are barely visible in the time-frequency domain. In the real-world experiment, the trained model was applied to the PAM recordings collected in Haima cold seep, and we found a negative correlation between bubble release rate and ambient pressure when the hydrophones were near the gas plumes, which is in accordance with existing literature and further validates the proposed method's effectiveness."

The application of machine learning (ML) models offers a promising approach for image assessment. We compared three ML models in their ability to classify mouse skeletal muscle images based on store-operated calcium entry (SOCE) activity, as an indicator of prolonged muscle activity and/or disease.
Immunofluorescent images were collected from muscle fibers obtained from calpain-3 null mice and wildtype mice at rest or following exercise. Images were categorized with respect to SOCE activity and disease status, then split into training, validation, and testing sets. Data were then utilized by three deep learning models: Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), EfficientNet, and Support Vector Machines (SVM).
CNN exhibited strongest performance in accuracy (0.91) and F1 score (0.88), and SVM exhibited the highest precision (0.92). Both models achieved similar area under the receiver operating characteristic curves (0.91). Performance differences between CNN and SVM yielded a p-value of 0.19, indicating no significant differences in their ability to classify SOCE activity in muscle images.
This study demonstrated that CNN and SVM machine learning models provide a promising approach in classifying SOCE activity in muscle images. These models offer scalable solutions for automating tissue classification, with potential to transform clinical classification in muscle pathologies. Future research can explore using larger datasets and integration of other techniques, such as transformer-based models, to improve performance in more complex muscle conditions."

198 patients who underwent pancreaticobiliary rFOV T2WI were included. The protocol included rFOV T2WI with 2 NEX (rFOV T2WIN2) and 1 NEX (rFOV T2WIN1). DLR was applied to generate corresponding datasets: rFOV T2WIN2-DLR and rFOV T2WIN1-DLR datasets. Three observers evaluated the noise, respiratory motion artifacts (RMA), overall image quality (OIQ), and diagnostic confidence (DC). Two observers measured the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR). Image quality metrics were compared using either ANOVA or Friedman test. Lesion detection rates were tested using the Cochran's Q test and McNemar test.
The noise, RMA, OIQ, and DC scores of rFOV T2WIN1-DLR were notably higher than those of rFOV T2WIN1. The noise, OIQ, and DC scores of rFOV T2WIN2 were notably higher than those of rFOV T2WIN1 (P < .001). The SNR and CNR of rFOV T2WI with DLR were notably higher than those of rFOV T2WI without DLR (P < .05). The rFOV T2WIN1-DLR sequence yielded a higher lesion detection rate (92.5%; 491/531) compared to rFOV T2WIN1 (76.5%; 406/531).
Pancreaticobiliary rFOV T2WI with DLR is feasible and yields superior image quality compared to rFOV T2WI without DLR. A 37.1% to 74.4% reduction in acquisition time is achievable without increasing image noise or compromising overall image quality and lesion detection rate.

This model was aimed to predict the risk of developing chronic hydrocephalus in aSAH patients.
This study enrolled 410 patients diagnosed with subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) in the Neurosurgery Department of the Affiliated People's Hospital of Jiangsu University between January 2020 and December 2023. Clinical and imaging characteristic data were collected from these patients. Using radiomic methods, we extracted features from the white matter surrounding the anterior horns of both lateral ventricles, ultimately selecting seven radiomic features to calculate the radiomics score. An automatic segmentation model based on the 3D-Unet architecture was specifically developed to measure hematoma volume. Initially, univariate analysis was conducted on all features, and the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression model was applied for feature selection using 10-fold cross-validation to optimize the penalty parameter. Key risk factors were identified, and various ML algorithms were used to construct and validate a predictive model, leading to the development of a clinical-radiological nomogram. To evaluate the model's discriminative ability, we performed receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis and calculated the area under the curve (AUC). Additionally, the consistency between model predictions and actual outcomes was assessed using calibration curves. Further evaluation included plotting precision-recall (P-R) curves, decision curve analysis (DCA), and clinical impact curves (CIC) to demonstrate the net benefit of the model at various thresholds in the training and test sets, validating its clinical utility.
A total of 180 patients were included, and a 3D-Unet automatic segmentation model was developed to accurately identify and quantify SAH volume. In the test set, the model achieved a Dice similarity coefficient (DSC) of 0.85 ± 0.04, an intersection over union (IoU) of 0.74 ± 0.06, a Hausdorff distance (HD) of 20.4 ± 12.3, and an average symmetric surface distance (ASSD) of 0.31 ± 0.23, demonstrating excellent performance in identifying SAHs. After screening features such as hematoma volume and radiomic score through univariate logistic regression (LR), 21 potential risk factors were identified. LASSO regression further refined these to nine key risk factors. Combining the results from both analyses, 6 independent predictive factors were determined: cerebrospinal fluid lactic acid level, sodium (Na), corpus callosum angle, interval to blood clearance, periventricular white matter changes, and hematoma volume. Among 8 ML models, the LR model showed the best performance, with AUC values of 0.884 [95% confidence interval (CI): 0.826-0.942] in the training cohort and 0.860 (95% CI: 0.758-0.962) in the test cohort. The calibration curve of the LR model showed a high agreement between predicted probabilities and observed outcomes. Additionally, DCA and CIC analyses demonstrated significant net benefits across different risk thresholds, confirming high consistency between predictions and actual outcomes.
The developed 3D-Unet automatic segmentation model accurately identified hematomas and calculated their volume, addressing the challenge of quantitatively assessing SAH volume in clinical practice. Hematoma volume, a key risk factor, was integrated with clinical and radiological features from computed tomography (CT) scans using ML methods to construct a clinical-radiological nomogram. This nomogram effectively predicted the development of chronic hydrocephalus in patients with aSAH."

Our objective was to conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis to evaluate the diagnostic performance of Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL) techniques in differentiating these disorders. We aimed to identify the most effective approaches, compare their diagnostic outcomes, and offer recommendations for improving their applicability across multiple clinical centers and for future research.
Following the PRISMA 2020 guidelines, a systematic search in PubMed and Web of Science was conducted to identify relevant articles published between 2000 and 2024 that fell within the scope of our research. QUADAS-2 tool was assessed to evaluate the risk of bias and applicability concerns. The performed meta-analysis allowed us to estimate the overall accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity of the developed models providing quantitative insights from this analysis.
Of 4,470 articles identified, 19 met inclusion criteria: 9 (47.4%) used ML and 10 (52.6%) used DL. Most models relied on MRI data to differentiate multiple sclerosis from neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorders. Pooled accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity were 0.87, 0.86, and 0.84, respectively. Substantial heterogeneity was observed, which decreased in a sensitivity analysis excluding larger-sample studies and varied between ML and DL models, with ML showing lower heterogeneity.
New AI tools, primarily utilizing MRI data, are emerging and demonstrate the potential to differentiate between various neuroimmunological disorders. While most neuroimmunological conditions have accessible antibody tests with strong diagnostic performance, AI efforts should concentrate on seronegative diseases. This approach should incorporate clinical and epidemiological data into diagnostic algorithms for improved accuracy."
PubMed,deep learning,Artificial intelligence techniques for cardiovascular disease diagnosis via X-ray sensor-based coronary angiography: A bibliometric and systematic review.,Hao Ren; Fengshi Jing; Yan Fang; Weibin Cheng,10.1177/20552076261417142,2026,Digital health,"To systematically evaluate the application of artificial intelligence (AI) techniques in X-ray sensor-based coronary angiography for cardiovascular disease (CVD) diagnosis, mapping publication trends, geographic and topical hotspots via bibliometric analysis, and critically reviewing disease-specific AI methodologies and performance to inform future research and clinical integration. Non-angiographic inputs were considered only when angiography served as the reference standard or when the algorithm was explicitly integrated into an angiography-based workflow.
A two-part approach was undertaken. In Part I, we performed a bibliometric analysis of English-language original research and reviews published between 1 June 2010 and 1 June 2025, retrieved from Web of Science, Scopus, and PubMed. Records (n = 123) were screened using a PRISMA flowchart and analyzed with CiteSpace v6.3.R1 to identify annual publication trends, country contributions, co-authorship networks, and keyword clusters. In Part II, we conducted a structured literature review of the AI methods reported in these studies, organizing findings by three major clinical categories-acute myocardial infarction, ischemic cardiomyopathy, and unstable angina-and extracting model architectures, data sources, and diagnostic performance metrics (accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and AUC).
Bibliometric analysis revealed three publication phases: a formative period (2010-2017) with <3 papers/year; rapid growth (2018-2021) culminating in a peak of 28 papers in 2022; and sustained interest into 2025. The United States (n = 39) and China (n = 34) led contributions, and keyword clustering highlighted central themes around ""artificial intelligence,"" ""coronary artery disease,"" and ""computed tomography angiography."" In disease-specific review, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and CNN-LSTM hybrids predominated, achieving AUCs from 0.724 to 0.997: for acute myocardial infarction detection, accuracies of 90%-95% and AUCs up to 0.99; for ischemic cardiomyopathy differentiation, accuracies of 75%-98% and AUCs up to 0.93; and for unstable angina prediction, overall accuracies of 89%-95%. Classical machine-learning models (XGBoost and random forest) also showed robust performance (AUC 0.77-0.94). Key challenges include dataset heterogeneity, limited multicenter validation, and model interpretability.
AI, particularly deep-learning frameworks, substantially enhances the accuracy and efficiency of CVD diagnosis via X-ray coronary angiography. However, current evidence is constrained by small single-center datasets, limited external validation, inconsistent leakage safeguards, and scarce calibration/decision-curve reporting. To advance clinical adoption, future efforts should emphasize large-scale, multicenter validation studies, development of explainable AI models, and seamless integration into cardiology workflows."
PubMed,deep learning,Benchmarking survival machine learning models for 10-year cardiovascular disease risk prediction using large-scale electronic health records.,Tianyi Liu; Andrew Krentz; Lei Lu; Yanzhong Wang; Vasa Curcin,10.1177/20552076251408534,2026,Digital health,"To evaluate the performance of machine learning (ML)-based survival models for 10-year cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk prediction using large-scale electronic health records (EHRs). The study benchmarks these models against the QRISK3 score and conventional Cox proportional hazards (CoxPH) models currently used in UK primary prevention, with the aim of assessing their potential to capture complex risk patterns beyond traditional approaches.
This study utilized individual-level data from the CPRD Aurum, covering 40 million UK primary care records from 2011 to 2021. A total of 469,496 patients aged 40-85 was analysed. Predictor variables were selected based on QRISK3 definitions, with additional phenotyping for comorbidities and pre-stratified risk scores. ML models, including deep neural networks (e.g., DeepSurv and DeepHit) and ensemble survival models (e.g., random survival forest [RSF] and gradient boosting), were developed for CVD risk prediction. Model performance was assessed using calibration and discrimination metrics, with 'spatial external validation' conducted using a London-held dataset.
A total of 849,651 records were analysed, including 117,421 for 'spatial validation' and 732,230 for development. QRISK3 scores effectively differentiated CVD patients, particularly among females, showing stronger predictive performance. Ensemble methods and neural networks outperformed CoxPH models, with RSF achieving the best discrimination and calibration: AUROC values of 0.738 (95% CI: 0.723-0.752) for males and 0.778 (95% CI: 0.762-0.793) for females, with Brier scores of 0.088 and 0.055.
ML models enhance CVD risk prediction, outperforming conventional approaches in calibration and discrimination. Integrating pre-stratified risk scores further improves performance, highlighting the value of augmenting tools like QRISK."

With a focus on the prevalent psychological complications following the onset of this condition, this study aimed to explore the correlation between antenatal depression and Corona disease anxiety, personality traits, and postpartum depression during the COVID-19 pandemic.                                                           Materials and Methods:                     This cross-sectional descriptive-analytical study investigated women receiving care at health centers affiliated with Kerman University of Medical Sciences during the last month of their pregnancy and the postpartum period in 2022. Following the acquisition of informed consent, participants were assessed using various measures, including demographic and obstetric information, the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale, the Corona Disease Anxiety Scale (CDAS), and the NEO Personality Inventory-Revised during their third trimester of pregnancy. The same group of participants completed the Edinburgh Depression Scale and the Corona Disease Anxiety Scale (CDAS) 4-6 weeks after childbirth.                                                           Results and Discussion:                     There was a significant correlation between family income, unwanted pregnancy as perceived by both the mother and father, and antenatal depression. Additionally, marital satisfaction played a significant role in postpartum depression. Furthermore, antenatal depression was significantly associated with neuroticism, agreeableness, and physical symptoms related to Corona disease anxiety. Personality traits, with the exception of extroversion and conscientiousness, and various domains of Corona disease anxiety, excluding psychological symptoms, were also significantly associated with postpartum depression.                                                           Conclusion:                     During pandemics or epidemics, such as the COVID-19 outbreak, experiencing mental distress during pregnancy can contribute to mental health issues during the postpartum period. This risk is particularly true in individuals with unique personality traits, emphasizing the need for increased focus on mental health within prenatal care during these crises."
Crossref,valvular heart disease,The Severity of Disease and Hospital Length of Stay for the First and Second Admission of COVID-19 Patients: An Observational Study from Southeastern Iran,Milad Ahmadi Gohari; Mohammad Hossein Mehrolhassani; Shoboo Rahmati; Elham Sharifpoor; Hossein Mirzaei; Yunes Jahani,10.2174/0126667975341163241129050027,2026-10,Coronaviruses,"Background:                     This study aimed to investigate the severity of disease and length of hospital stay for COVID-19 patients admitted to a hospital in southeastern Iran.                                                           Method:                     This cross-sectional study was conducted in Kerman, Iran. Data were collected from patients who visited Afzalipour Hospital in Kerman more than twice during the COVID-19 epidemic from the end of February 2020 to March 21, 2021. We conducted two key analyses: 1. Mixed effect logistic regression was used to check the relationship between the variables and COVID-19 severity. 2. Mixed effect linear regression was used to check the relationship between the variables and the length of stay in the hospital.                                                           Results:                     The findings indicated that the most important risk factors for the severity of COVID-19 were heart diseases (OR=1.67,95%CI:1.20-2.30), increasing age (OR=2.23 for age&gt;54, 95%CI:1.70- 2.90), male gender (OR=1.47,95%CI:1.10-1.96), respiratory diseases other than asthma, and frequency of admission (OR=1.60,95%CI:1.20-2.15). All patients who underwent readmission experienced a shorter duration of hospitalization during their subsequent admission (OR=0.94,95%CI:0.91,0.96) and had a higher mortality rate (30% within 14 days, 26.6% between 14-90 days). Patients readmitted at intervals of 14-90 days and greater than 90 days exhibited lower disease severity compared to those readmitted within the 0-14 day period.                                                           Conclusion:                     Examining readmissions, the severity of COVID-19, and the length of hospital stay in affected patients are important factors for planning and allocating resources for COVID-19 management and treatment. These factors can help policymakers develop effective clinical guidelines for hospitalization or outpatient treatment of COVID-19 patients and contribute to reducing the burden of disease in the community."

Kinovea, as an accessible motion-analysis software, provides both visual and quantitative feedback. However, its application in supporting technique development among beginner athletes remains insufficiently explored. Aim: This study aims to describe the use of Kinovea in biomechanics training and examine its contribution to the awareness of kinematic characteristics and movement techniques among beginner athletes. Methods: A descriptive qualitative design involved 72 beginner athletes aged 18–25 years selected through purposive sampling. Data were collected over 16 weeks through interviews, field observations, and motion video recordings analyzed using Kinovea. Kinematic data focused on joint angles, stride behavior, and movement phases during walking, running, and the flight phase. Qualitative data were analyzed using content analysis with NVivo 12, while kinematic results were interpreted descriptively to identify performance patterns and areas for technical refinement. Result: Kinematic analysis showed coordinated joint-angle patterns across all phases. Walking analysis identified arm swing angles of 50.9°–58.8° and leg separation angles of 64.3°–67.2°, indicating a stable gait rhythm. The running analysis revealed knee angles of 68.8°–69.8° and elbow angles of 87.6°–89.1°, indicating efficient propulsive mechanics. The flight phase demonstrated knee angles of 81.2°–87.8° and elbow angles of 80.4°–88.3°, suggesting effective momentum use and postural stability. These measurements supported stride-efficiency assessment and technique evaluation. Qualitative findings revealed that Kinovea enabled athletes to interpret movement phases and identify technical inefficiencies through slow-motion and frame-by-frame visualization. Conclusion: Kinovea supports basic motion analysis by providing clear kinematic information and helping beginner athletes observe and refine their movement techniques. The findings also offer practical value for coaches by enabling more precise identification of inefficient patterns and guiding targeted corrections during early-stage training."

This has informed the recommendation for urgent intervention upon diagnosis, especially when symptoms develop. Asymptomatic severe aortic stenosis has a four-year mortality between 30 and 50% if left untreated, which is similar to some metastatic cancers. Conservative management for patients with severe asymptomatic aortic stenosis was previously advocated, likely owing to the relative invasiveness of surgical aortic valve replacement. The advent of low-risk transcatheter aortic valve implantation with good medium-term durability has prioritized the need for a paradigm shift in the treatment of asymptomatic severe aortic stenosis towards a more proactive strategy of early intervention to reduce significant adverse events. This article provides a state-of-the-art overview of the contemporary management of patients with asymptomatic severe aortic stenosis."
OpenAlex,aortic stenosis,Vascular Sociology: Integrating Vascular Surgery and Medical Sociology for a Comprehensive Understanding of Vascular Health,Davide Costa; Raffaele Serra,10.3390/jvd5010005,2026-01-26,Journal of Vascular Diseases,"Vascular diseases remain a major global health burden despite remarkable technological advances in vascular surgery and endovascular therapies. Conditions such as peripheral arterial disease, abdominal aortic aneurysm, carotid stenosis, chronic venous disease, diabetic vasculopathies, and vascular chronic ulcers are not only biological entities but are deeply shaped by social structures, cultural norms, and economic inequalities. This article introduces Vascular Sociology as an interdisciplinary field that integrates vascular surgery with medical sociology to provide a more comprehensive understanding of vascular health and disease. Drawing on classical and contemporary sociological theory, including concepts such as social determinants of health, embodiment, illness narratives, and the disease–illness–sickness triad, the article argues that vascular pathology reflects cumulative social exposures across the life course. Socially patterned behaviors, work conditions, food environments, healthcare access, gender norms, and geographic inequalities profoundly influence disease onset, progression, treatment decisions, and outcomes. The paper highlights how surgical success is contingent not only on technical excellence but also on patients’ social contexts, including health literacy, trust in institutions, caregiving resources, and the capacity to adhere to long-term follow-up and rehabilitation. By outlining conceptual foundations, epidemiological evidence, and mixed-methods research strategies, the article positions Vascular Sociology as a framework capable of bridging biomedical knowledge with lived experience. This approach expands the definition of vascular outcomes to include social reintegration, identity transformation, and equity of care, ultimately aiming to improve patient-centered practice, reduce disparities, and inform more socially responsive vascular health policies."

To identify the main differences in patients undergoing surgical treatment of acquired mitral valve (MV) disease depending on the preoperative type of pulmonary hypertension (PH), as well as to identify factors associated with PH persistence and its type one year after surgical treatment of MV disease. Material and methods . This open-label, single-­center prospective study included 40 patients with valvular heart disease (VHD) undergoing MV surgery. These patients had verified PH according to the right heart catheterization (RHC) as follows: 15 patients with isolated post-capillary PH and 25 patients with a combined post-/precapillary PH. Intraoperatively, 26 patients with PH underwent a right lung tissue biopsy with subsequent histological examination. One year after surgery, RHC was performed to assess PH dynamics. The significance ranks of the predictors were used to assess the contribution of factors to PH dynamics after surgery. Results . Patients with VHD and combined post/precapillary PH were characte­rized by more impaired right ventricle-­pulmonary artery coupling, increased le­vels of myocardial strain markers, severe changes in pulmonary circulation hemodynamics, arteriolization of venules, and a higher frequency of pandemic arterial thrombosis (53,3%) compared to patients with isolated postcapillary PH (9%). According to RHC data one year after surgery (n=21), PH regression was observed in 28,5%, while isolated postcapillary PH persisted in 42,85%, and combined post/precapillary PH — in 28,5%. The factors, that made the most significant contribution to PH regression one year after surgery included mitral valve stenosis (100 units), atrial fibrillation (73 units), type 2 diabetes (72 units), combined intervention on the mitral valve and aortic valve (61 units), obesity class (56 units), male sex (48 units). The character of morphological lung changes did not significantly contribute to perioperative dynamics of PH. Conclusion . Patients with VHD and combined post/precapillary PH are characterized by more impaired right ventricle-­pulmonary artery coupling, elevated levels of myocardial strain markers, severe changes in pulmonary circulation hemodynamics with arteriolization of venules and a higher prevalence of pandemic arterial thrombosis. For the first time, potentially modifiable factors have been identified as making the greatest impact on the PH dynamics one year after surgery."

Despite its clinical importance, Lp(a) remains largely unaffected by traditional lipid-lowering therapies, contributing to significant residual cardiovascular risk. Aim: This review aims to synthesize current knowledge regarding the clinical significance of elevated lipoprotein(a) levels and to explore the landscape of emerging therapeutic strategies designed to specifically address this challenging cardiovascular risk factor. Materials and Methods: An extensive synthesis of the current literature, prioritizing comprehensive review articles and meta-analyses published within the last five years, was conducted using multiple electronic databases (PubMed, Scopus, Google Scholar). Results: Epidemiological data indicate that 20–30% of the global population has elevated Lp(a) levels (&gt;30–50 mg/dL). While lifestyle and statins show negligible effects on Lp(a) concentration, novel nucleic acid-based therapies - specifically antisense oligonucleotides (pelacarsen) and small interfering RNAs (olpasiran, lepodisiran, zerlasiran) have demonstrated the ability to reduce Lp(a) levels by 70% to over 95%. Furthermore, oral small-molecule inhibitors like muvalaplin offer promising alternatives by disrupting the assembly of the Lp(a) particle. Conclusion: The emergence of targeted RNA-based and small-molecule therapies represents a paradigm shift in cardiovascular prevention. As phase 3 clinical trials progress, these interventions may provide the first definitive means of mitigating the residual risk associated with elevated Lp(a)."

Optimal management requires integrated risk stratification, multimodality imaging, tailored revascularization timing, and post-procedural care. This review synthesizes evidence on preoperative assessment (invasive angiography vs CT-angiography), decision-making for percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), staged vs concomitant approaches, and long-term antithrombotic and surveillance strategies to optimize outcomes. Introduction Severe aortic stenosis (AS) and CAD frequently coexist due to shared risk factors and pathophysiology. While TAVI has transformed AS treatment, untreated significant CAD may impair periprocedural hemodynamics and long-term prognosis. Preoperative Evaluation Coronary computed tomography angiography (CCTA) is increasingly preferred for its high negative predictive value and ability to assess anatomy for TAVI planning. Invasive coronary angiography remains the gold standard when revascularization is anticipated. Functional assessment (fractional flow reserve [FFR] or instantaneous wave-free ratio [iFR]) is recommended for intermediate lesions (50–70%) to guide intervention. Revascularization Strategies Staged PCI (prior to TAVI) is favored in most guidelines for complex or high-risk anatomy, minimizing contrast load and procedural time during valve deployment. Concomitant PCI during the same session may be considered in straightforward single-vessel disease or unstable presentations, though it carries higher acute kidney injury risk. Post-TAVI PCI is emerging as a viable option in select cases with favorable valve positioning. Multidisciplinary Heart Team Integration The Heart Team should weigh SYNTAX score, frailty, bleeding risk, and life expectancy. Hybrid approaches (e.g., PCI of proximal lesions pre-TAVI, distal optimization post-TAVI) are gaining traction. Antithrombotic Management and Follow-up Post-PCI/TAVI regimens typically involve dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) for 1–6 months, transitioning to single antiplatelet therapy (SAPT) or anticoagulation if indicated. Long-term surveillance includes echocardiography, stress testing, and symptom monitoring. Conclusion A structured, multidisciplinary strategy incorporating advanced imaging, physiology-guided PCI, and individualized timing improves safety and durability in TAVI recipients with coexistent CAD."

Younger patients often present with unique anatomical challenges, including bicuspid aortic valves, and are expected to outlive their first valve prosthesis, making lifetime management a central concern. While new valve technologies show promise, long-term data remain limited. Careful patient selection, shared decision-making, and ongoing prospective studies are essential to guide the role of TAVR in this population."

METHODS: We analyzed 2 multicenter registries that consecutively enrolled patients with severe aortic stenosis before and after the introduction of transcatheter AVR in Japan (CURRENT AS [CURRENT AS, Contemporary Outcomes After Surgery and Medical Treatment in Patients With Severe Aortic Stenosis] Registry-1: 2003–2011; Registry-2: 2018–2020). Data were derived from hospital electronic health records. The primary outcome was 1-year all-cause mortality. Secondary outcomes included hospitalization for heart failure, cardiovascular death, and noncardiovascular death. we Multivariable Cox proportional hazards models were adjusted for age, sex, body mass index, hypertension, current smoking, diabetes on insulin therapy, prior myocardial infarction, prior symptomatic stroke, atrial fibrillation or flutter, aortic or peripheral vascular disease, creatinine level, hemodialysis, anemia, liver cirrhosis (child B or C), malignancy currently under treatment, chronic lung disease (moderate or severe), coronary artery disease, peak aortic jet velocity, any combined moderate or severe valvular disease, and tricuspid regurgitation pressure gradient. RESULTS: A total of 6645 patients (Registry-1: 3448 patients, and Registry-2: 3197 patients) were included. Patients in Registry-2 were older than those in Registry-1 (81.7 versus 77.8 years), and an initial AVR strategy was more frequently selected (49.9% versus 31.3%). The cumulative 1-year incidence and adjusted risk of 1-year all-cause mortality were lower in Registry-2 than in Registry-1 (10.2% versus 16.0%, P &lt;0.001, hazard ratio, 0.55 [95% CI, 0.47–0.63]). In contrast, the incidence and adjusted risk of hospitalization for heart failure did not differ between Registry-2 and Registry-1 (8.5% versus 9.0%, P =0.66, hazard ratio, 0.88 [95% CI, 0.75–1.04]). CONCLUSIONS: The overall 1-year mortality outcome of patients with severe aortic stenosis improved in the posttranscatheter AVR era compared with the pretranscatheter AVR era, with no noticeable improvement in hospitalization for heart failure."

Merlet; Stéphane Avril; Léonard Féasson; F. Hoffmann-La Roche; M. Bäck; David Hupin,10.3389/fcvm.2025.1625436,2026-01-23,Frontiers in Cardiovascular Medicine,"Postoperative atrial fibrillation (POAF) affects 38%–63% of patients undergoing surgical replacement for calcific aortic valve stenosis (CAVS), increasing morbidity, stroke risk, and hospital stay. POAF results from an interplay between pre-existing arrhythmogenic substrates, acute surgical triggers, unresolved inflammation, and autonomic nervous system (ANS) imbalance. Specialized pro-resolving mediators (SPMs) orchestrate inflammation resolution and tissue homeostasis; their deficiency may sustain valvular inflammation and promote arrhythmogenesis. Transcutaneous vagus nerve stimulation (tVNS) is a non-invasive approach that enhances parasympathetic tone, restores sympathovagal balance, and modulates inflammatory pathways. While tVNS has been applied postoperatively, its preoperative, preventive use in POAF has not been explored, representing a novel therapeutic strategy. In patients with CAVS, preoperative tVNS could reduce POAF by regulating ANS activity and limiting perioperative inflammation. Mechanistic insights may be gained through perioperative sampling, analysis of excised valvular and atrial tissue, and biomechanical assessments comparing stimulated and control groups. Preoperative tVNS thus offers a promising strategy to prevent POAF while addressing valvular inflammation, bridging translational physiology with clinical cardiology and potentially opening new avenues for the management of CAVS."

In patients considered inoperable, minimally invasive approaches often remain the only alternative. However, there are limited data on treatment strategies and outcomes in patients with LFLG AS and severe ischemic cardiomyopathy undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) and transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR), especially in cases with challenging transfemoral access. Case summary An 87-year-old male presented with progressive dyspnea and angina. Diagnostics revealed a non-ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI), acute heart failure, acute-on-chronic renal failure, LFLG AS (aortic valve area of 0.7 cm²), and a left ventricular ejection fraction of 10%. Coronary angiography showed severe coronary artery disease requiring revascularization. Due to excessive surgical risk, we planned a staged interventional treatment by Heart Team consensus. First, high-risk PCI with mechanical circulatory support was performed, followed by transfemoral TAVR using a self-expandable 29-mm bioprosthesis via a femoral Y-graft conduit. The patient reported immediate relief of symptoms. Follow-up echocardiography at discharge and at three months showed improvement of the aortic valve function and an increase of the ejection fraction to 35%. The patient remained asymptomatic and resumed his daily activities. Discussion This case demonstrates that Impella®-supported PCI prior to transfemoral TAVR is feasible and safe, even in the presence of a femoral Y-graft, in a patient with LFLG AS and severely reduced ejection fraction."

Makkar,10.1161/jaha.125.043880,2026-01-22,Journal of the American Heart Association,"Background Limited data are available comparing clinical outcomes between patients with small and large annuli following transcatheter aortic valve replacement using balloon‐expandable valves. This study sought to investigate 5‐year clinical outcomes in patients with severe aortic stenosis with a small annulus compared with those with a large annulus following transcatheter aortic valve replacement with newer‐generation balloon‐expandable valves. Methods A total of 3182 patients with aortic stenosis treated with balloon‐expandable valves were divided into small‐annulus (≤430 mm 2 ) and large‐annulus (&gt;430 mm 2 ) groups. A 1:1 propensity‐matched analysis was performed to adjust baseline differences. The primary end point was all‐cause death at 5‐year follow‐up. Secondary end points included heart failure hospitalization, bioprosthetic valve failure, and aortic valve reintervention. Results Among 533 matched pairs, compared with the large‐annulus group, the small‐annulus group had higher rates of aortic valve mean gradients ≥20 mm Hg (14.1% versus 2.9%; P &lt;0.001) and severe prosthesis–patient mismatch (9.8% versus 5.2%; P =0.019). At 5 years, there were no significant differences in all‐cause death (hazard ratio, 0.75 [95% CI, 0.52–1.09]; P =0.13). The incidence of heart failure rehospitalization, bioprosthetic valve failure, and aortic valve reintervention were similar between groups. Both groups achieved similar sustained improvements in New York Heart Association functional class and Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire–Overall Summary scores. Conclusions Despite higher transvalvular gradients and a greater rate of severe prosthesis–patient mismatch, 5‐year clinical outcomes in patients with a small annulus were comparable to those with a large annulus following transcatheter aortic valve replacement using newer‐generation balloon‐expandable valves."
