We retrospectively analyzed 149 patients with persistent or paroxysmal atrial fibrillation who underwent cardiovascular surgery between January 2015 and October 2023. Resected left atrial appendages were histologically evaluated for thrombus and amyloid deposition. After excluding 11 patients with transthyretin-type amyloids and 10 with rheumatic mitral valve stenosis, 128 patients (median age, 72.0 years; range, 37-84 years) were assessed. Patients were categorized into the thrombus and no-thrombus groups. Clinical data, echocardiographic findings, and atrial natriuretic peptide amyloid grades (0-3) were compared.
Fresh or organized thrombi and atrial natriuretic peptide amyloid deposition were observed in 28 (21.9%) and 110 (85.9%) patients, respectively. Moderate or greater aortic stenosis was more frequent in the thrombus group (p  = 0.004). Although overall atrial natriuretic peptide amyloid deposition rates were similar (p = 0.377), amyloid deposition degree was significantly greater in the thrombus group (p < 0.001). Multivariate logistic regression identified moderate or greater aortic stenosis and amyloid deposition degree as independent predictors, whereas moderate or greater mitral regurgitation was a negative predictor.
Moderate or greater aortic stenosis and atrial natriuretic peptide amyloid deposition degree predicted left atrial appendage thrombus formation, whereas moderate or greater mitral regurgitation was a negative predictor."
PubMed,aortic stenosis,Time- and dose-dependent high-sensitivity cardiac troponin-T to improve outcome prediction after TAVI: a multicenter cohort study.,Thorald Stolte; Jakob Johannes Reichl; Pedro Lopez-Ayala; Ivo Strebel; Felix Goetzinger; Max Wagener; Jasper Boeddinghaus; Gregor Leibundgut; Ramona Schmitt; Dirk Westermann; Tau Hartikainen; Christian Mueller; Felix Mahfoud; Philipp Ruile; Philipp Breitbart; Thomas Nestelberger,10.1007/s00392-025-02808-z,2025-11-24,Clinical research in cardiology : official journal of the German Cardiac Society,"Pre- and post-procedural high-sensitivity cardiac troponin T (hs-cTnT) detects periprocedural myocardial injury (PPMI) and predicts adverse outcomes following transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI). Current diagnosis of PPMI relies on fixed cutoffs, lacking the integration of time- and dose-dependent effects of hs-cTnT. This limits the precision of risk stratification and subsequent patient management.
To investigate the non-linear and time-dependent effects of pre- and post-procedural hs-cTnT levels on outcomes after TAVI, these findings were compared to the dichotomized definition of PPMI proposed by the Valve Academic Research Consortium-3 (VARC-3).
Consecutive patients undergoing TAVI between 2011 and 2024 at two tertiary university hospitals with available hs-cTnT measurements were enrolled. The primary outcome was all-cause mortality at 1 year. Multivariable Cox proportional hazards models were fitted. To relax the proportional hazards assumption, allowing for hazard ratios (HRs) to vary over time and across hs-cTnT values, a Royston-Parmar model was fitted.
Among 5158 patients, the HR for all-cause mortality at 1 year associated with VARC-3 defined PPMI was not statistically significant. Continuous variable analysis showed that both higher pre- and post-procedural hs-cTnT levels correlated with increased all-cause mortality risk at 1 year. Time-dependent models revealed the hazard to be greatest for higher hs-cTnT levels early post-procedurally and to decline over time.
The dichotomized VARC-3 definition of PPMI showed no prognostic value. Modelling hs-cTnT as continuous and time-dependent revealed a dynamic risk trajectory after TAVI. Incorporating these non-linear and time-dependent effects into risk prediction models may improve clinical decision-making and personalize post-procedural surveillance."

We retrospectively reviewed the medical records of 129 patients who underwent the Ozaki procedure between January 2017 to July 2025. The cohort was divided into a PMV group that included patients with ≥ 75th (20.5 h) percentile for duration of mechanical ventilation and a Non-PMV group which included all other patients. Similarly, the cohort was divided into a PPH group that included patients with ≥ 75th (14d) percentile for duration of postoperative hospital stay and a Non-PPH group which included all other patients. There were 36 cases (27.91%) with postoperative PMV and 34 cases (26.36%) with postoperative PPH. There was no death in the non-PMV group, while 2 patients in the PMV group died in hospital and 1 patient underwent heart transplantation during follow-up. One patient in the PPH group and one in the non-PPH group died in hospital, and one patient in the PPH group underwent transplantation during follow-up. Patients in the PMV or PPH group were younger, had lower body weight, had lower preoperative LVEF, had more concomitant procedures, had longer cardiopulmonary bypass time, longer aortic cross-clamp time, longer operation time, longer cardiac intensive care unit stay, longer mechanical ventilation time, longer postoperative hospital stay, a higher rate of delayed chest closure and a higher rate of early reoperation, However, during follow-up, the results were similar to those of the control group for moderate or greater aortic valve stenosis or regurgitation, aortic valve dysfunction, neoaortic valve reoperation, late any reoperation and death/transplantation after surgery. In a multivariable model, low age [OR:0.796(0.651-0.974), P = 0.026], truncus arteriosus [OR:57.382(1.821-1808.547), P = 0.021], mixed lesion [OR:20.529(2.978-141.531), P = 0.002], longer aortic cross-clamp time [OR:1.010(1.003-1.016), P = 0.003], more replaced leaflets [OR:3.140(1.374-7.178), P = 0.007], smaller postoperative ascending aorta diameter [OR:0.818(0.704-0.951), P = 0.009] and longer cardiac intensive care unit stay [1.102(1.022-1.189), P = 0.012] were independent risk factors for PMV; longer cardiac intensive care unit stay was risk factor [OR: 1.467(1.251-1.720), P < 0.001] for PPH, whereas larger postoperative ascending aorta diameter was protective [OR:0.860(0.770-0.960), P = 0.007]. In children undergoing Ozaki procedure for AVD, PMV after surgery should be monitored in patients with low age, truncus arteriosus, mixed lesion, longer aortic cross-clamp time, more replaced leaflets, smaller postoperative ascending aorta diameter and longer cardiac intensive care unit stay, PPH after surgery should be monitored in patients with smaller postoperative ascending aorta diameter and longer cardiac intensive care unit stay."

However, as a diagnostic test, the real-world clinical utility of AI-ECG reliability requires the consistency of its results when repeated under similar conditions.
To evaluate the reliability of AI-ECG models for different ECGs for the same person, across different diagnostic labels, and using varied modeling approaches.
We used ECG images (2000-2024) from 5 hospitals and an outpatient network within a large, integrated US health system. For each individual, we identified multiple ECGs recorded within a 30-day period. We evaluated 7 models: 6 convolutional neural networks (CNNs) trained to detect individual SHDs, including LV systolic dysfunction, left valve diseases and severe LVH; an ensemble XGBoost integrating individual CNNs as a composite screen for multiple SHDs. We used concordance correlation coefficient (CCC), Spearman correlation, Cohen's kappa, and percent agreement in binary screen status to test model reliability. We evaluated factors associated with different AI-ECG outputs (Δ probability> 0.5) and assessed stability across ECG layouts (digital, printed, photo).
Across sites, we identified 1,118,263 ECG pairs, with a median 1 (1-3) days between ECGs. The ensemble XGBoost had the higher test-retest correlation (CCC: 0.89-0.92) and agreement (kappa: 0.75-0.82) between pairs compared with CNNs (CCC: 0.78-0.88; kappa: 0.57-0.72). After adjusting for demographics, ECG pairs that included one or both inpatient ECG were significantly more likely to yield unstable predictions (ORs: 1.60 [1.50-1.70] and 1.91 [1.78-2.05], respectively) compared with pairs with both ECGs obtained in outpatient settings. Among outpatient pairs across sites, the XGBoost model had a CCC of 0.89-0.94, a Spearman correlation of 0.90-0.94, and a kappa of 0.78-0.84, with concordance rates of 89-92%. Notably, ensemble model predictions were also stable across different ECG layouts.
An ensemble AI-ECG model integrating multiple CNN predictions had higher reliability compared with models for individual disorders. Discordance was more common in inpatient ECGs, suggesting instability in high-acuity settings. Reliable ensemble AI-ECG model outputs support readiness for clinical implementation for SHD screening.

While each condition has been extensively studied in isolation, there is limited data on the clinical characteristics of patients with combined AS-MS.
We retrospectively identified patients with significant AS and concomitant significant MS from the echocardiography database between 2003 and 2018. Exclusion criteria included left ventricular ejection fraction <50%, other significant valvular lesions, prior cardiac surgery, and associated congenital heart disease. Patients with isolated AS were compared to patients with combined AS-MS.
Of 1470 patients with severe AS, a total of 353 patients were included: 41 with combined AS-MS and 312 with isolated AS. The prevalence of combined AS-MS was 11% among patients with significant AS. Compared to patients with isolated AS, patients with combined AS-MS were significantly younger (50 vs. 63 years, p < 0.001), had a lower prevalence of hypertension (44% vs. 64%, P = 0.017) and diabetes (22% v. 42%, p = 0.013), and a greater prevalence of atrial fibrillation (17% vs. 5%, p = 0.003). Patients with combined AS-MS had a significantly larger left atrial size (4.79 ± 0.70 cm vs. 3.93 ± 0.73 cm, p < 0.001), higher peak tricuspid velocities (3.14 ± 0.59 m/s vs. 2.72 ± 0.45 m/s, p < 0.001), and greater prevalence of moderate or severe tricuspid regurgitation (15% vs. 1%, p < 0.001). Echocardiographic parameters assessing transvalvular flow rate did not differ significantly between the two groups. After multivariate adjustment for age and gender combined AS-MS was associated with worse 5-year overall survival (HR 2.672, 95% CI 1.060-6.732, p = 0.037).
Combined mitral and aortic stenosis is not uncommon (11%) but linked to worse outcomes than isolated AS. Despite expectations, concomitant significant MS did not increase prevalence of paradoxical low-flow, low-gradient AS."

Valve replacement, either through surgical or transcatheter approach, is the only therapeutic option. Over the last 15 years, the indications for transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) have spread to include young and low surgical risk patients.
Our study aims to address this gap in the literature by comparing the adverse outcome after TAVR through axillary versus femoral access in heart failure reduce ejection fraction (HFrEF) patients who underwent TAVR within 30 days of the procedure.
We used data from TriNetX US collaborative network database, including HFrEF patients who had TAVR through axillary or femoral access between 2015 and 2025. Propensity score matching was done to minimize the difference in baseline characteristics between the two cohorts. Outcomes were observed within the first 30 days of TAVR.
A total of 206 patients in each cohort (axillary vs. femoral) were studied after propensity score matching. The incidence of permanent pacemaker (PPM) insertion was comparable between groups (5.0% vs. 5.1%; OR: 0.984, 95% CI: 0.400-2.419; HR: 0.365, 95% CI: 0.097-1.376; p = 0.157).

Initially supported with a percutaneous femoral IABP, the patient developed significant lower limb deconditioning. To mitigate this, a surgically placed tunneled Dacron graft IABP was introduced to improve mobility and reduce atrophy, enabling structured prehabilitation while awaiting orthotopic heart transplantation (OHT). This approach allowed for safe ambulation and physical therapy without compromising device function, ultimately enhancing functional status pre-OHT. Post-transplant, he required temporary veno-arterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) and IABP support for primary graft dysfunction and was eventually weaned off devices. Another case involved a 63-year-old male transferred from an outside hospital (OSH) with 95% left mainstem stenosis and diffuse triple vessel coronary artery disease (preoperative right femoral IABP was placed). After emergency triple vessel coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG), he required left femoral veno-arterial ECMO for poor right ventricular (RV) function. He recovered postoperatively, had subsequent ECMO decannulation and IABP replacement with tunneled graft, and was able to engage in physical therapy, with improvement in upright tolerance. Further research is needed to assess infection risks and validate the promising tunneled Dacron graft technique."

100 patients receiving TAVR surgery were selected and rolled into an observation group (Obs group, 50 cases) and a control group (Ctrl group, 50 cases) according to postoperative myocardial status. The changes in MEP before and after the TAVR and the STP within 3 days after surgery were compared and analysed.
Creatine Kinase MB (CK-MB) levels were (21.6±8.8) IU/L, (17.2±7.1) IU/L, and (15.2±6.4) IU/L at 12 h, 24 h, and 72 h after TAVR, respectively, in the Obs group; and the cTnT levels were (0.284±0.13) ng/mL, (0.315±0.15) ng/mL, and (0.363±0.22) ng/mL, respectively, at the same time points. The CK-MB and cTnT levels in the Obs group were increased more obviously based on the conditions in the Ctrl group (P&lt;0.05). After surgery, 23 cases of bleeding occurred in the Obs group, significantly more than 8 cases in the Ctrl group (P&lt;0.05). Differences in ultrasonic test results were not obvious (P&gt;0.05).
The MEP of patients after TAVR generally increased, and the increase in the degree of patients with MD was more significant, which may be an indicator to judge the postoperative MD. Patients with postoperative MD had a higher probability of postoperative bleeding."

Methodology A total of 75 patients who underwent autologous arteriovenous fistula and hemodialysis for the first time in our hospital between January 2016 and December 2019 were selected. Abdominal aortic calcification index (ACI) was recorded at the time of internal fistula establishment. Patients were divided into high- and low-calcification groups based on the ACI results. The primary patency rate of autologous internal fistulas in the two groups was observed over five years. Results Of the 75 patients, 70 (93.33%) had varying degrees of aortic calcification, with 37 patients in the high calcification group (ACI > 10%). During the five-year follow-up period, 64 patients developed internal fistula dysfunction due to various causes, including 35 cases of thrombosis and 19 cases of fistula stenosis. At 12, 36, and 60 months, the primary patency rates of internal fistulas in the low calcification group were 92.5%, 57.5%, and 17.5%, respectively, whereas those in the high calcification group were 85.7%, 30.4%, and 9.1%, respectively. The difference in primary patency rates between the two groups was statistically significant after five years (F = 4.443, p = 0.035). Cox analysis showed that autologous internal fistula dysfunction was related to ACI (hazard ratio = 2.114, 95% confidence interval = 1.146-3.899, p = 0.017). Conclusions A higher aortic calcification score was associated with dysfunction of the autologous arteriovenous fistula within five years. Patients with higher aortic calcification scores require more frequent monitoring of the internal fistula function and early intervention to prolong the service life of the internal fistula."

Imaging revealed a high-grade infrarenal aortic stenosis consistent with a TransAtlantic Inter-Society Consensus II (TASC II) type D lesion. She underwent successful endovascular treatment via right femoral access, consisting of percutaneous transluminal angioplasty followed by implantation of an E-Luminexx™ Stent 12×40 mm (Becton Dickinson, New Jersey, USA). Post-operative recovery was uneventful, with improved distal perfusion and normalization of ankle-brachial index values. Follow-up imaging at three months confirmed stent patency. This case illustrates that endovascular management is a safe and effective alternative to open surgery for selected patients with complex AIOD, especially in elderly individuals with comorbidities."

Europe,"Management of severe aortic stenosis (AS) has evolved over the past decade, driven by the widespread adoption of transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI). This study aims to assess trends in procedural volumes, patient characteristics, and outcomes for patients undergoing TAVI or surgical aortic valve replacement (SAVR) in Sweden.
This was a descriptive, non-comparative, nationwide cohort study using the SWEDEHEART registry. We included 21,383 patients who underwent TAVI or SAVR between 2013 and 2023 (11,366 TAVI and 10,017 SAVR). Trends in patient characteristics, preoperative risk, complications and mortality were examined.
TAVI procedures increased from 307 (26.1%, n = 307/1174) in 2013 to 1851 (71.2%, n = 1851/2601) in 2023, while SAVR volumes declined from ∼1000 annually before 2018 to roughly 750 procedures annually. Median age of TAVI patients were 81 (IQR 77, 85) years and 71 (IQR 65, 76) years for SAVR patients. The median EuroSCORE II for TAVI decreased from 5.6 (IQR 3.3, 10.2) to 2.7 (IQR 1.7, 4.6) (p = 0.002), and STS-PROM from 3.3 (IQR 1.9, 4.1) to 1.6 (IQR 1.1, 2.8) (p = 0.0021). Among SAVR patients, EuroSCORE II decreased from 1.5 (IQR 1.0, 2.3) to 1.3 (IQR 0.9, 2.1) (p = 0.022) and STS-PROM from 1.8 (IQR 1.2, 3.0) to 1.6 (IQR 1.1, 2.6) (p = 0.0082). Any in-hospital complications declined significantly for TAVI (29.2%, n = 210/719 to 13.2%, n = 244/1851), while SAVR complication rates increased slightly (18.4%, n = 354/1921 to 18.7%, n = 140/750). In-hospital mortality for TAVI declined from 3.6% (n = 26/719) to 1.0% (n = 18/1851), and 1-year mortality from 11.1% to 6.9% (p = 0.019). SAVR in-hospital all-cause death decreased from 1.6% to 0.4% (n = 3/750) and 5.0% to 2.2% for 1-year mortality (p = 0.013).
TAVI has become the predominant treatment strategy for AS in Sweden expanding access within the treated cohort. Despite this, current 2023 SAVR results demonstrate similar in-hospital complication rates compared to TAVI (18.7% vs 13.2%), but lower in-hospital (0.4% vs 1.0%) and 1-year mortality rates (2.2% vs 6.9%).

We report a 57-year-old male with multifocal metastatic chondroblastic osteosarcoma presenting as a mediastinal mass encasing the descending thoracic aorta. He presented with painful thigh swellings, fatigue, and weight loss for three weeks. His history included right orchidectomy and chemotherapy for a germ cell tumor 30 years earlier, with remission. Biopsy of the thigh lesions confirmed metastatic chondroblastic osteosarcoma. Staging computed tomography revealed an unresectable mediastinal mass encasing the descending thoracic aorta, with intraluminal thrombus causing near-total occlusion. Positron emission tomography-computed tomography demonstrated avidity involving the mediastinal mass and partial uptake in the thrombus. Thoracic endovascular aortic repair relieved the stenosis and enabled systemic therapy. Despite systemic and palliative therapies, the patient succumbed to progressive disease 13 months after diagnosis. This case highlights the role of endovascular repair in malignant aortic involvement."

Science. B,"COMPERA 2.0 risk stratification has been demonstrated to be useful in patients with precapillary pulmonary hypertension (PH). However, its suitability for patients at risk for post-capillary PH or PH associated with left heart disease (PH-LHD) is unclear. To investigate the use of COMPERA 2.0 in patients with severe aortic stenosis (SAS) undergoing transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR), who are at risk for post-capillary PH, a total of 327 eligible SAS patients undergoing TAVR at our institution between September 2015 and November 2020 were included in the study. Patients were classified into four strata before and after TAVR using the COMPERA 2.0 risk score. The primary endpoint was all-cause mortality. Survival analysis was performed using Kaplan-Meier curves, log-rank test, and Cox proportional hazards regression model. The study cohort had a median (interquartile range) age of 76 (70‒80) years and a pulmonary arterial systolic pressure of 33 (27‒43) mmHg (1 mmHg=0.133 kPa) before TAVR. The overall mortality was 11.9% during 26 (15‒47) months of follow-up. Before TAVR, cumulative mortality was higher with an increase in the risk stratum level (log-rank, both P<0.001); each increase in the risk stratum level resulted in an increased risk of death (hazard ratio (HR) 2.53, 95% confidential interval (CI) 1.54‒4.18, P<0.001), which was independent of age, sex, estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), hemoglobin, albumin, and valve type (HR 1.76, 95% CI 1.01‒3.07, P=0.047). Similar results were observed at 30 d after TAVR.

The aim of this study was to characterize the specificities of cardiac involvement in patients with TTR V30M mutation.
This retrospective study included patients diagnosed with TTR V30M that were referred to a cardiology appointment during 2019 (median follow-up of 57 months). Data on cardiomyopathy (CM), conduction abnormalities, aortic stenosis, and atrial fibrillation (Afib) were collected. V30M ATTR-CM patients were compared to a contemporary cohort with wtATTR-CM.
A total of 238 TTR V30M patients were enrolled: mean age 54 years old, 52 % male, and 69 % with early onset disease. vATTR-CM occurred in 20 % of patients and was associated with male gender, older age at presentation, liver transplantation, ophthalmologic manifestations, and lower creatinine clearance. Age at presentation, male gender, liver transplant, and ophthalmologic manifestations were independent predictors of CM. vATTR-CM was associated with worse outcomes. Significant electric conduction disease was present in 32 % of patients and AFib in 11 %. Patients with vATTR-CM, compared to those without CM, had a higher prevalence of significant electric conduction changes, pacemaker implantation, and AFib when compared to those without CM. Most patients with electric disease had neuropathy and more than 12 years of symptoms. Significant aortic stenosis was rare. Compared to patients with wtATTR-CM, patients with vATTR-CM had a higher prevalence of significant conduction disease, a lower prevalence of AFib, and less severe hypertrophy. In vATRR-CM, age at presentation and male predominance were lower and orthostatic hypotension was more prevalent.
Our findings highlight the need for thorough cardiovascular evaluation in TTR V30M patients due to common conduction issues and the significant impact of CM on outcomes."

A 69-year-old man presented with progressive heart failure seven years after aortic root replacement for bicuspid aortic stenosis and root aneurysm. Imaging revealed severe prosthetic valve stenosis and suspected pannus formation. Given significant comorbidities, simplified approach was chosen to avoid full root re-replacement. Following redo sternotomy and graft incision, the mechanical valve leaflets were fractured and removed. A Foley balloon inserted into the left ventricular outflow tract prevented leaflet embolization. Pannus excision revealed a hypertrophic subvalvular septum, prompting a septal myectomy. A 23-mm bioprosthetic valve was implanted above the retained mechanical housing using interrupted mattress sutures. The patient's postoperative course was uneventful and echocardiography confirmed good valve function. This case highlights the utility of leaflet fracture as a safe and efficient option in high-risk reoperative settings and underscores the added benefit of direct subvalvular visualization for detecting underlying anatomic contributors to prosthetic dysfunction not detected preoperatively."

Enhanced imaging techniques could improve prognostic accuracy. This study investigates myocardial resting perfusion and metabolism using [13N]-NH3 and 2-[18F]FDG PET/CT and their correlation with HCM SCD risk scores. Thirty non-obstructive HCM patients (mean age 54 years, 57% male) with a mean SCD risk score of 3.7 ± 2.5% were evaluated. Myocardial 2-[18F]FDG metabolism and rest [13N]-NH3 perfusion PET/CT were analyzed. Hypermetabolism (2-[18F]FDG uptake with normal perfusion) occurred in 53% of cases (mean extension 11.8 ± 17.2%), while fibrosis (reduced perfusion without 2-[18F]FDG uptake) averaged 10.3 ± 10.2%. Mean rest myocardial blood flow (MBF) was 0.75 ± 0.21 ml/min/g, increasing with hypermetabolism extension (0.83 ± 0.32 ml/min/g for ≥ 20%, p = 0.019) but decreasing with SCD scores ≥ 6% (0.58 ± 0.05 ml/min/g, p = 0.034). Hypermetabolism correlated moderately with SCD risk scores (rho = 0.38, p = 0.036), with hypermetabolism peaking at intermediate risk (23.5 ± 27.1%) before declining. Fibrosis extension consistently increased with SCD risk (rho = 0.38, p = 0.039). In conclusion, our findings identify important correlations between myocardial hypermetabolism and fibrosis and SCD risk in HCM. Hypermetabolism peaks in intermediate-risk patients, reflecting earlier disease stages, while fibrosis increases with higher SCD risk, signaling disease progression and structural damage."

Adventitial lymphatic vessels employ lymphatic valves to eliminate infiltrated harmful substances from arterial walls, thereby preserving vascular wall integrity. The traditional Chinese medicine ""Gualou-Xiebai"" (GLXB) has been shown to have a definite therapeutic effect on AS by inhibiting aortic plaque deposition and reducing vascular damage. However, whether the effect of GLXB on ameliorating vascular damage in AS is related to lymphatic drainage and lymphatic valves formation has not been clarified.
To investigate whether GLXB alleviates the plaque lesions of AS by regulating the function of lymphatic drainage and its potential mechanism.
Doppler ultrasound imaging were used to validate AS lesions to confirm successful model establishment. HE staining and morphological photography were used to evaluate the plaque area. The bilateral branches of the left common carotid artery were ligation to block the lymphatic drainage of the aortic ventricular duct in AS mice, and the mouse lymphatic vessel blockade model was established. The lymphatic vessel contraction frequency and leakage were detected by near-infrared two-zone imaging and Evans blue staining, and the lymphatic drainage function was evaluated. Lymphatic valve formation was evaluated through immunofluorescence analysis of specific biomarker expression. After lymphatic endothelial cells (LECs) were treated with serum containing GLXB or transfected with VEGFR3 in LECs, the proliferation and migration of LECs were evaluated by CCK8 method, transwell and immunofluorescent staining of Ki67. The expression of lymphatic-associated proteins was detected by Western blot, and the expression of IL-1β and IL-18 in serum was detected by ELISA kit.
GLXB promotes lymphatic drainage in the adventitia and ameliorates vasculopathy in AS mice by maintaining lymphatic drainage function, which is related to the promotion of lymphatic valve formation. Meanwhile, GLXB promotes lymphatic valve formation based on the fact that GLXB promoted the proliferation and migration of LECs, while also the expression of various markers of lymphatic valve formation in LECs. Mechanistically, we demonstrated that VEGFR3 is a key target of GLXB in promoting LECs development and maintaining the function of adventiolar lymphatic drainage to improve vasculopathy in AS. Rutin, and Kaempferol-3-O-β-rutinoside are the key active components of GLXB targeting VEGFR3 to improve the proliferation and migration of LECs after injury.
GLXB inhibits LECs injury by targeting VEGFR3, promotes lymphatic valve formation, maintains lymphatic drainage function, and reduces AS."

Patients who underwent AVR between 2012 and 2021 at our center were retrospectively analyzed in two groups, AS and AR. The final 278 samples possessed detailed clinical information of the patients. The six items were measured in preoperative CT and compared in significant difference in number.
No significant differences were found in the patients' characteristics between the AS and AR groups except for age, sex and body surface area. The number of younger and male patients was higher in the AR group than in the AS group (P <  0.01), including a larger body surface area (P <  0.01). The AR group had larger rightward laterality aorta and third ICS (AS vs AR - 3.9 ± 8.9 vs 0.6 ± 8.9 mm, P < 0.01; 14.2 ± 1.3 vs 15 ± 1.6 cm, P <  0.01, respectively).
Preoperative CT revealed thoracic anatomical differences between AS and AR patients undergoing MIAVR. Although no direct correlation with cross-clamp time was observed except for AP distance in both AR and AS, surgeons should be aware that these anatomical features-particularly the rightward aorta and deeper and more caudally positioned AV in AR patients to make surgical decision making, surgical planning. CT-based evaluation is a valuable tool for guiding approach strategy and patient selection in MIAVR."

A 58-year-old woman with critical bioprosthetic aortic stenosis, cardiogenic shock, and large LV thrombus (2.8 × 2.6 cm) underwent successful valve-in-valve transcatheter aortic valve replacement after systemic fibrinolysis bridge therapy.
Current guidelines contraindicate transcatheter aortic valve replacement in patients with LV thrombus. This case demonstrates the novel use of low-dose, slow infusion tissue plasminogen activator as a bridge therapy to enable life-saving intervention.
Pulsed delivery of small doses of systemic fibrinolytic with hemodynamic and echocardiographic monitoring may be suitable as a bridge to definitive management in valvular shock patients with LV thrombus. Minimizing instrumentation during structural heart procedures complicated by LV thrombus is critical.
Low-dose, slow-infusion fibrinolysis coupled with echocardiographic monitoring may serve as bridge therapy to urgent structural cardiology intervention in carefully selected patients with LV thrombus and cardiogenic shock."

We examined whether mitral valve re-repair is superior to replacement after failed repair for degenerative MR.
Patients undergoing isolated surgical mitral valve repair for degenerative MR were identified from the STS Adult Cardiac Surgery Database between July 2011 and December 2023. Failed mitral repair was defined as any subsequent reoperations after 30-days on the mitral valve. Predictors for re-repair were calculated via multivariable logistic regression and longitudinal survival was analyzed with linkage to the National Death Index and the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services data using Cox regression.
Overall, 1,749 patients required reoperation on the mitral valve during the study period, including 410 (23.4%) re-repairs and 1,339 (76.6%) replacements. Unadjusted overall survival was superior for patients undergoing re-repair compared to replacement (Hazard Ratio [HR] 3.54, 95% CI 2.01-6.24, p<0.001). This survival benefit persisted even after extensive risk adjustment (HR 1.96, 95% CI 1.10-3.52, p=0.022) and propensity score matching (HR 1.95, 95% CI 1.01-3.82, p=0.045) controlling for patient and valve-related characteristics. Re-repair patients had lower postoperative morbidity or mortality (6.8% vs 11%, p=0.042), with no differences in postoperative stroke or reoperation.
In this largest to date analysis of reoperations for degenerative MR, those undergoing re-repair were found to have superior intermediate-term survival compared to mitral valve replacement. These findings suggest that re-repair may be preferred in eligible patients with recurrent MR."

Between June 2, 2004, and May 21, 2018, 1155 patients underwent elective mitral valve repair for degenerative MR at our institution. Speckle-tracking analysis of preoperative echocardiograms was used to calculate left ventricular (LV) strain in 16 LV wall segments, assessing the frequency and location of subclinical segmental LV dysfunction in patients with postoperative early residual (>1+ or late recurrent ≥2+ MR.
Of 73 patients with early >1+ MR, were PS-matched to 157 without residual MR. Despite a normal preoperative LVEF of 63% in both groups, left ventricular global longitudinal strain (LV-GLS) was impaired in patients with early MR and LV segmental strain was abnormal in nearly all LV segments except for the inferior basal wall. Among 196 PS matched patients with long-term follow-up, 39 developed late >2+MR. Compared to 157 patients without late MR, those with late recurrence had similar LVEF (53% and 58%, respectively; p=0.26), but abnormal preoperative LV segmental strain, particularly in regions supporting the papillary muscles. Logistic regression analysis demonstrated that among these regions, segment 1 (anterior basal wall) as independently associated with late MR recurrence.
Preoperative left ventricular segmental strain analysis demonstrated abnormalities in the anterolateral and posteromedial papillary muscle region in patients who developed early and late recurrent MR. This observation may be helpful for the timing of surgery and for intraoperative decision-making during mitral valve repair for degenerative MR."

This study investigated risk factors for 2nd XCL and compared early and mid-term outcomes in a propensity-matched cohort undergoing minimally invasive MVr (MI-MVr).
A retrospective review of patients undergoing MI-MVr for degenerative mitral regurgitation (DMR) or functional mitral regurgitation (FMR) between October 2014 and March 2024 was performed. Patients with a single versus 2nd XCL were matched 1:1 based on age, gender, MR etiology, and other baseline characteristics. Echocardiographic assessments, surgical techniques, and postoperative outcomes were analyzed. Logistic regression identified predictors for 2nd XCL, and Kaplan-Meier survival analysis compared mid-term outcomes.
Out of 1,732 patients, 76 (4.4%) required 2nd XCL. The primary reason for 2nd XCL was residual MR. Complex valve pathology in DMR (odds ratio 3.386, p = 0.005) and leaflet restriction in FMR (odds ratio 8.00, p = 0.014) were identified as predictors for 2nd XCL, but were not confirmed as independent predictors in multivariable regression analysis. The 2nd XCL group had longer cardiopulmonary bypass and aortic cross-clamp times (149.5 vs 99.5 min and 96.0 vs 60.0 min, respectively; p < 0.001). No differences were observed in midterm outcomes between the 2nd XCL and control groups (74.4% vs 84.6%, log-rank p = 0.07), except for prolonged length of ventilation time and intensive care unit stay (17.0 vs 12.5 hours and 32.0 vs 24.0 hours, p < 0.001, respectively).
2nd XCL can be performed safely without impairing early and mid-term postoperative outcomes. Patients with complex valve pathology in DMR and leaflet restriction in FMR are at a higher risk for 2nd XCL."

They are differentiated by morphology, histopathology, karyotype, and the risk of malignancy. Partial hydatidiform moles are the only type of trophoblastic gestational disease associated with the presence of a fetus (with or without positive cardiac response). However, early intrauterine fetal death often occurs with triploidy. Therefore, a partial hydatidiform mole is often misdiagnosed as an incomplete abortion. This case is unique due to the rare occurrence of a partial hydatidiform mole complicated by severe pregnancy-associated cardiomyopathy. To date, only five similar cases have been reported, all describing cardiorespiratory symptoms from left ventricular dysfunction in previously healthy women around abortion induction.
We present the case of a 19-year-old 1 gravida, 0 para with partial hydatidiform mole and late miscarriage in the 18th week of pregnancy. Abortion induction occurred, followed by severe maternal cardiac complications. The patient developed a pregnancy-associated cardiomyopathy with acute heart failure on the basis of a newly severely restricted biventricular function with dilatation and secondary mitral valve insufficiency, congestion and forward failure led to congestive pneumonia, acute renal failure, and metabolic acidosis. After histological examination of the fetal tissue, a partial mole can be assumed on the basis of the histological findings, immunohistochemistry, and the trisomy of the X chromosome detected by fluorescence in situ hybridization.
In case of a hydatidiform mole, an early diagnosis is essential to prevent serious complications during medical course. Particularly, if cardiac symptoms occur, early diagnosis should be carried out. Close cardiological and gynecological follow-up must be carried out to prevent late complications."

However, the long-term effects of functional tricuspid regurgitation (FTR) on AF recurrence and the improvement of TR after radiofrequency catheter ablation (RFCA) remain unclear.
This retrospective, single-center observational study involved 1,690 patients with persistent atrial fibrillation (PsAF) who underwent AF ablation between January 2012 and June 2022. 153 paients with significant FTR were propensity matching 153 patients with no or mild FTR based on age, body mass index, and mitral regurgitation (MR) severity. Patients were followed up for at least 1 year. Procedural success was defined as freedom from any atrial tachyarrhythmia (>30 s) after the 3-month blanking period, off antiarrhythmic drugs. Significant FTR was defined as moderate to severe TR. Significant TR improvement was defined as a reduction in TR severity by ≥2 grades from pre- to post-ablation.
Among the observational cohort, 153 patients (9.1%) had significant FTR, the severity of which correlated with female sex, AF duration, atrial/ventricular remodeling, and NT-proBNP levels. During the 12-month follow-up, the procedural success rate was 67.6% (207/306). RFCA significantly reduced the proportion of RA and RV enlargement (P < 0.001), and improved the severity of FTR (P < 0.001). Logistic regression analyses showed that AF recurrence [odds ratio (OR) 18.244, 95% CI 7.500-52.427, P < 0.001]) was the strongest independent risk factor for non-significant TR improvement after ablation. After a mean follow-up of 5.3 ± 3.7 years, the overall procedural success rate was 47.4% (145/306). The overall success rate was significantly lower in patients with significant FTR compared to those with no or mild FTR (37.3% VS 57.5%, P < 0.001). A comparable difference was observed between ventricular FTR and no or atrial FTR (27.1% VS 53.4%, P < 0.001).
Significant FTR was an independent predictor of AF recurrence in patients with PsAF undergoing RFCA. The long-term success was poor in the subgroups of significant FTR and those with ventricular FTR. Furthermore, successful RFCA was associated with significantly improved FTR in patients with PsAF."

This review aims to describe the reported cases of iatrogenic mitral valve regurgitation following aortic valve surgery.
PubMed, ScienceDirect, Directory of Open Access Journals, and Cochrane databases were searched from inception until January 2024 for case reports and case series describing iatrogenic mitral valve regurgitation following aortic valve surgery.
The literature review found 13 articles describing 15 cases of new onset mitral valve regurgitation after aortic valve surgery. The most common mitral lesion was the anterior mitral leaflet perforation (n = 8 patients), followed by rupture of the chordae tendineae (n = 2) and avulsion of the pericardial patch used in Nick's procedure (n = 2). In eight cases, the mitral defect was immediately detected at the weaning from cardiopulmonary bypass through transesophageal echocardiography. In the other seven patients, the mitral defect was encountered between 3 weeks and 4 years from the main aortic valve surgery. For this group of patients, a reintervention was performed in 3 patients, while an Amplatzer occluder was placed in three patients.
Iatrogenic mitral valve injury following aortic valve surgery requires a multidisciplinary approach encompassing detailed anatomical knowledge, precise technical skills, and ongoing advancements in imaging and surgical techniques. By integrating these aspects, cardiac surgeons can mitigate the risks associated with mitral valve injury and optimize patient outcomes in the context of cardiac valve surgery.

Given that lead aVL reflects electrical activity in the anterolateral left ventricular wall, where the anterolateral papillary muscle (PM) resides, opposing the posteromedial one, we hypothesized that these electrocardiographic changes may reflect improved electrical resynchronization of the PMs, contributing to MR reduction.
This study aimed to evaluate the relationship between post-CRT changes in RaVL and MR severity and assess whether RaVL can serve as a surface electrocardiographic marker of PM dyssynchrony and a predictor of clinical response and long-term survival.
We analyzed 231 patients who underwent CRT implantation and were followed for a median of 41 months (interquartile range 29-55); 88 patients died during this period.
Baseline RaVL correlated with QRS duration (r = 0.20, P = .0018) and aVL-aVF intrinsicoid deflection difference (r = 0.36, P < .0001), supporting its role as a marker of electrical dyssynchrony. RaVL significantly decreased after CRT (0.66 ± 0.42 mV to 0.41 ± 0.41 mV, P < .0001) and independently predicted MR response in multivariable logistic regression. Patients who experienced a reduction in RaVL or a decrease in QRS duration after CRT had significantly better survival than those whose corresponding parameters remained unchanged or increased. Both variables independently predicted survival in multivariable Cox regression.
A decrease in RaVL after CRT predicts MR improvement and survival, likely reflecting improved PM synchronization and mechanical resynchronization."

However, there is currently a lack of sufficient guidance on how to select the appropriate treatment approach for SMR patients. SMR is a common condition secondary to ischemic or non-ischemic heart failure, surgical or interventional therapy is preserved for those patients who showed no improvement after tailored guideline-directed medical therapy (GDMT) for heart failure.
Our goal is to develop an interpretable model to predict SMR improvement after medical treatment in the real-world, i.e. to find those patients who are candidates for surgical therapy. We employ the SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) method to interpret the model and explore factors influencing improvement.
In this retrospective study, we extracted data on patients diagnosed with moderate or greater secondary mitral regurgitation. Predictive models were constructed, with the dataset randomly divided such that 80% was used for model training and 20% for model validation. We compared the predictive performance of the XGBoost model with three other machine learning models by analyzing the area under the curve (AUC). The XGBoost model was interpreted using the SHAP method, with variable importance assessed and the impact of key variables evaluated accordingly.
The study ultimately included 1,572 eligible SMR patients. The XGBoost model demonstrated the highest predictive performance among the four models, with an AUC of 0.73. The SHAP method identified and ranked the top 20 predictive factors for SMR, with age being the most significant predictor.
We have developed an effective model to predict whether SMR patients will benefit from non-surgical treatment, which can help clinicians formulate better treatment plans and achieve optimal resource allocation. Additionally, the interpretable framework enhances the transparency of the model and helps doctors understand the reliability of the predictive model.

Median EuroSCORE II was slightly higher in CMVD patients (3.5 [IQR 2.2-5.7]) compared with those with myxomatous disease (2.6 [IQR 1.5-4.2], P<0.01). However, the observed mortality in the CMVD group was three to four times higher than predicted, whereas in the myxomatous group it was consistent with predicted values.
CMVD defines a high-risk surgical population with substantial baseline cardiovascular morbidity and markedly elevated postoperative mortality and complication rates that were substantially underestimated by EuroSCORE II emphasizing the need for refined risk prediction models and individualized management strategies in this subset of patients."

Case reports,"Redo aortic and mitral valve surgery with severe mitral annular calcification (MAC) and intervalvular fibrous body destruction is highly challenging; the Commando procedure is often a last resort.
A 59-year-old man with prior mechanical aortic and mitral valve replacements presented with hemolytic anemia due to a mitral paravalvular leak. Imaging showed severe MAC and tricuspid regurgitation. Intraoperatively, massive calcification and insufficient native tissue precluded standard anchoring for implantation of the new mechanical valves. In addition to the standard Commando procedure, a bovine pericardial patch was used reconstruct a neo-mitral annulus. Recovery was uneventful.
Bovine pericardial patches offer structural support when native tissue is inadequate, facilitating safe and durable outcomes in complex redo valve procedures.
This case illustrates a viable surgical strategy for high-risk redo double-valve procedures. Bovine patch reconstruction enabled stable valve implantation and functional restoration in the setting of extensive MAC."

A 72-year-old woman with dilated cardiomyopathy presented with symptomatic severe functional MR and underwent M-TEER. During the procedure, the patient developed hemodynamic instability due to posterior leaflet tear with torrential MR which could not be addressed by the TEER. The patient had refractory heart failure despite medical therapy and was not an operative candidate. Following heart team discussion, she underwent ELASTACLIP followed by transcatheter mitral valve replacement using SAPIEN M3. Her condition promptly stabilized, and she was discharged home with stable NYHA II symptoms and trace MR at follow-up.
Failed M-TEER with significant residual MR carries a high risk of mortality with limited treatment options. Transcatheter mitral valve replacement with ELASTACLIP is a feasible and definitive solution in selected patients after failed M-TEER.
ELASTACLIP with transcatheter mitral valve replacement using SAPIEN M3 is a safe and effective option for failed M-TEER."

Case reports,"Myocardial infarctions can result in mechanical complications such as rupture of papillary muscles. Rupture of the anterolateral papillary muscle is rarer because of its dual blood supply.
A 44-year-old man presented with subacute chest pain and was diagnosed with a non-ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction. Coronary angiography revealed multivessel coronary artery disease, for which the patient underwent urgent coronary artery bypass grafting to revascularize. Postoperatively, he developed acute respiratory failure due to pulmonary edema in the setting of decompensated heart failure. Echocardiography revealed rupture of the anterolateral papillary muscle, resulting in severe mitral regurgitation. The patient underwent emergent mitral valve replacement, after which he made a gradual recovery.
Papillary muscle rupture is a rare but catastrophic mechanical complication of myocardial infarction that can present despite timely revascularization. This may occur in the anterolateral papillary muscle despite its dual blood supply.

Invasive coronary angiography demonstrated moderate coronary artery disease in the left anterior descending artery, with negative resting full-cycle ratio. Intracoronary acetylcholine provocation testing confirmed coronary vasospasm; microvascular dysfunction was excluded. Beta-blocker therapy was ceased, and calcium-channel blocker therapy was up-titrated with good effect, improving the patient's angina and dyspnea.

We identified thresholds of diastolic function parameters associated with increased long-term mortality risk.
Retrospective analysis of consecutive patients between 2011 and 2021. Repeat examinations, patients <18 years, critically ill, with left ventricular dysfunction or significant mitral annular calcification or stenosis, or with known or suspected restrictive or dilated cardiomyopathies were excluded. Cox regression models with spline curve analyses determined thresholds associated with increased long-term mortality risk, adjusting for age, gender, hypertension, atrial fibrillation, ischemic heart disease, valvular disease, and left ventricle mass index.
Following exclusions, 57,393 cases were included (mean age 60.1 years, 53.4 % male). Mortality risk increased with mitral annular early diastolic velocity (e') <5.6 cm/s, E / average e' ratio > 12.4, maximal tricuspid regurgitation jet velocity > 2.6 m/s, systolic pulmonary artery pressure > 31.7 mmHg and deceleration time < 184 msec. Left atrial volume index (LAVI <21.2 and > 42 mL/m2), and mitral inflow velocities were associated elevated mortality risk at both high and low thresholds (E wave <0.41 and > 0.88 m/s; E/A < 0.74 and > 1.65).
Revised thresholds for maximal tricuspid regurgitation jet velocity, systolic pulmonary artery pressure and e' were found to be lower, and E/e' and deceleration time thresholds were higher, than cutoffs employed in current recommendations. U-shaped spline curves were observed for LAVI and most mitral inflow velocities, indicating increased mortality risk at low and high thresholds."

Heart and circulatory physiology,"Significant lymphatic structural remodeling and dysfunction have been observed in preclinical models of cardiovascular disease. However, a detailed understanding of the normal structure and distribution of lymphatic vessels (LyVs) in the heart is still lacking. The goal of this study is to define the pattern of LyVs at various cardiac anatomical sites using Prox1-tdTomato lymphatic reporter mice. By light sheet microscopy, we first confirmed the presence of an extensive network of LyVs on the epicardial surface of the ventricles while minimal signal was detected on the atria. We then evaluated LyV distribution within the heart using cryo- and vibratome sections. To ensure accurate identification of Prox1-tdTomato+ LyVs, we performed immunostaining of common lymphatic markers (LYVE1, podoplanin and VEGFR3). In the ventricles, LyVs were enriched on the epicardium, subepicardial region and endocardium of the right ventricular septum. We also detected LyVs on the subepicardial surface of the left atrium, within the mitral valve and interatrial septum and near the valves and atrioventricular node (AVN). In addition to LyVs, LYVE1 and PROX1 were expressed by other cell types. LYVE1 was expressed by tissue resident macrophages and a subset of endocardial cells lining the trabeculated regions of the atria and ventricles, and PROX1 was mainly expressed by valvular endothelial cells, endocardial cells lining the interatrial septum and a subset of cells within the AVN. Lastly, scRNA-Seq analysis revealed six subtypes of cardiac lymphatic endothelial cells. Our study serves as a comprehensive resource to facilitate the proper identification of LyVs in the mouse heart."

Studies have showed trace element concentrations varied in patients with AF and may be involved in the pathogenesis of AF. However, no data is currently available for those with VHD.
Urine samples as well as clinical data were collected from 72 VHD patients with AF (VHDAF) and 72 VHD patients without AF (VHD) and further analyzed for a panel of trace elements: lithium, manganese, cobalt, copper, zinc, arsenic, selenium, strontium, Cadmium, mercury, thallium, lead. Quantile g-computation was adopted to explore the joint effect of the 12 trace elements on AF in this population, and internal validation was performed using 1,000 bootstrap re-samples.
Compared with the VHD group, Sr levels were reduced, while Mn, Cu and Hg concentrations were increased in the VHDAF group. Quantile g-computation model indicated a significant association between the mixtures of the 12 urinary trace elements and AF in patients with heart valve disease (adjusted OR: 2.051; 95% CI: 1.180-3.565; p = 0.011). Positive partial effect was owing to Cu (weight: 0.43) and Hg (weight: 0.18), while negative partial effect mainly attributed to Sr (weight: 0.43) and Li (weight: 0.23).
VHDAF patients had higher Cu levels and lower Sr levels, and the two elements have been supposed to exert the largest influence on AF. Further research is needed to establish the causal relationships."

This pathology is the most prevalent valvular heart disease worldwide and is associated with a poor prognosis. Despite extensive research, no pharmacological treatments are available to slow or reverse valvular degeneration, making aortic valve replacement the only current therapeutic option. This lack of clinical success may stem from an incomplete understanding of the disease's mechanisms and the limitations of current preclinical models, which do not fully replicate the complexity of CAVD and its associated risk factors and comorbidities. Indeed, while existing models offer valuable insights, a deeper understanding of CAVD requires incorporating comorbidities, gender-specific mechanisms, and dynamic cellular and tissue-level changes. This review aims to provide the reader with an overview of preclinical models developed in recent years to study CAVD, assessing their strengths and limitations. We review how these models can be used to mimic and/or investigate the cellular and molecular mechanisms involved in CAVD development, and highlight how key risk factors and comorbidities can be incorporated to enhance the translational potential of research. We hope that this approach will help guide researchers in selecting the most appropriate model for their studies, with the goal of advancing the identification of effective therapeutic candidates."
PubMed,valvular heart disease,Novel point cloud registration approach for noninvasive patient specific estimation of leaflet strain from 3D images of heart valves.,Wensi Wu; Matthew Daemer; Jeffrey A Weiss; Alison M Pouch; Matthew A Jolley,,2025-10-08,ArXiv,"Valvular heart disease is prevalent and a major contributor to heart failure. Valve leaflet strain is a promising metric for evaluating the mechanics underlying the initiation and progression of valvular pathology. However, robust and generalizable methods for noninvasively quantifying valvular strain from clinically acquired patient images remain limited. In this work, we present a novel feature-tracking framework for quantifying leaflet strain in atrioventricular valves using 3D echocardiographic images of pediatric and adult patients. Our method demonstrated superior accuracy in the assessment of anatomical deformation and strain of heart valves compared to other point-based approaches, as verified against a finite element benchmark. Further, our approach can robustly track inter-phase deformation of valves across highly variable morphologies without parameter tuning. Our analysis revealed that a median and interquartile range of the 1st principal strain greater than 0.5 is associated with leaflet billow (prolapse). Further investigation of the biomechanical signatures of heart valve disease has the potential to enhance prognostic assessment and longitudinal evaluation of valvular disease."

Its presentation in the emergency department (ED) has significant clinical and economic implications, warranting further investigation.
The purpose of this study was to analyze predictors of disposition and identify disparities among patients presenting to US EDs with AF.
In this retrospective study, we analyzed data from patient visits to the ED with a primary diagnosis of AF using the Nationwide Emergency Department Sample from January 1, 2016, to December 31, 2020. We compared demographic characteristics, comorbidities, and disposition status for these patients.
A total of 699,680,000 adult ED visits were recorded, of which 3,070,240 were for AF. Nearly half (48.4%) of patients with AF in the ED required inpatient admission, while ED mortality was extremely low (0.03%). Patients aged 80 years or older (compared with those aged 18-44 years) were more likely to be admitted than discharged home (odds ratio 1.15; 95% confidence interval 1.07-1.24; P < .001), and women were more likely to be admitted than men (odds ratio 1.12; 95% confidence interval 1.10-1.13; P < .001). Comorbidities such as chronic pulmonary disease, essential hypertension, obesity, renal failure, liver disease, neurologic disorders, iron deficiency anemia, hypothyroidism, valvular disease, and hyperlipidemia, along with lifestyle factors such as smoking, alcohol consumption, or recreational drug use, also increased the likelihood of hospital admission.
Our study reveals that older age, female sex, and certain comorbidities significantly increase the likelihood of hospital admission for patients with AF in the ED."

Despite its significance, studies on the status of GDMT adherence in patients with HF in Ethiopia are scarce.
This study aimed to assess physicians' adherence to GDMT and the associated factors in patients with HFrEF.
A retrospective follow-up study was conducted from September 1, 2018, to July 31, 2023. Quality of Adherence to Guideline Recommendations for Lifesaving Treatment in Heart Failure Survey scores were used to assess physicians' adherence to GDMT. SPSS version 27.0 was used for analysis, and multinomial logistic regression analysis was performed.
The Quality of Adherence to Guideline Recommendations for Lifesaving Treatment in Heart Failure Survey scores showed that the physicians' adherence to GDMT was good in 40% (95% confidence interval [CI] 35.30-44.90), moderate in 33.8% (95% CI 29.3-38.6), and poor in 26.2% of the study participants (95% CI 22-30.7). Age of ≥65 years (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] 0.14, 95% CI 0.07-0.29); causes of HF such as ischemic heart disease (AOR 16, 95% CI 6.75-37.90), valvular heart disease (AOR 5.3, 95% CI 2.58-10.92), dilated cardiomyopathy (AOR 8.24, 95% CI 3.97-17.09), and hypertension (AOR 6.62, 95% CI 2.98-14.69); and duration of HFrEF of ≥3 years (AOR 2.59, 95% CI 1.32-5.08) were factors significantly associated with good physicians' adherence to GDMT.
The use of all indicated medications as per the guideline recommendation for HFrEF was low, and most patients received suboptimal doses of GDMT. Particularly, the beta-blocker dose was very suboptimal. Encouraging healthcare provider training, access to separate cardiac clinics and cardiologists, following guidelines, timely patient appointments, and medication availability are recommended for better clinical outcomes."

Beyond reports analyzing the incidence of ATAAD in large registries, there is only scarce data illuminating this complication. Our aim was to analyze its incidence, possible mechanisms, and management in a large two-center cohort.
We performed a retrospective analysis for ATAAD following TAVI in our two-center registry to assess the incidence and outcome, as well as to analyze different causal mechanisms and treatment strategies. 10,238 patients received TAVI between 2008 2023. Incidence of ATAAD was 0.15 % (n = 15), of which most occurred periprocedurally. In-hospital mortality was 47 %. Patients with ATAAD were treated with a variety of approaches, 67 % surgically, 27 % interventionally and one patient was treated conservatively solely by blood pressure control. Our results showed no significant associations of ATAAD to the type of prosthetic valves used. Most frequent suspected mechanisms included radial annular stress from balloon or valve expansion (47 %) and catheter- or wire-induced trauma (20 %). Among anatomical risk factors, dilation of the ascending aorta, a horizontal aorta, a small annulus and heavy calcification were frequent contributors.
ATAAD after TAVI, though rare, is a severe complication with a high mortality. Growing procedure volumes and complex anatomies will increase its incidence. Surgeons and interventionalists awareness, pre-procedural planning, institutional readiness, and tailored management pathways are essential to mitigate risk and improve outcomes."

Aortic valve leaflets showed abnormal thickening, and fibrosclerosis of the subvalvular structure was observed. Histopathology revealed fibromyxoid degeneration with multifocal dense infiltration of IgG4-positive plasma cells and immunostaining confirmed IgG4-positive plasma cells, therefore the patient was clinically diagnosed with IgG4-RD. After discharge, she underwent implantable cardioverter defibrillator implantation and radiofrequency catheter ablation for refractory ventricular tachycardia. If a patient with underlying IgG4-RD develops a valvular disease or arrythmia, it is necessary to consider the possibility that IgG4-RD is the cause and pre/postoperative systemic inflammation control and thorough evaluation must be performed."

Severe mitral stenosis in pregnancy can lead to acute decompensated heart failure, especially in the third trimester. Timely intervention is essential but challenging in late presenters. We describe a series of three pregnant women presenting at term with severe rheumatic mitral stenosis complicated by heart failure. All underwent emergency lower segment cesarean section (LSCS) followed by balloon mitral valvotomy (BMV) in the same operative setting. Transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) was used for transseptal puncture to reduce radiation exposure, and abdominal lead shielding was applied. The radiation dose was limited to 249 mGy. Two patients had favorable maternal and fetal outcomes, while one patient succumbed due to septic shock despite successful valvotomy.
Simultaneous LSCS and BMV is a feasible and potentially life-saving strategy in women presenting late in pregnancy with severe mitral stenosis and heart failure. A multidisciplinary approach with individualized hemodynamic and fetal considerations is critical. We propose that this time-sensitive strategy may improve outcomes in resource-limited settings."

A multicenter retrospective study.,Ruchi Bhandari; Nathan L Maris; Rowida Mohamed,10.1371/journal.pone.0336847,2025,PloS one,"Infective endocarditis (IE), an infection of the cardiac endothelium, is associated with significant morbidity and mortality. IE cases vary substantially based on their valvular involvement, both in terms of risk factors and severity. This study describes patient characteristics and outcomes associated with valvular involvement in IE.
Data for this multicenter, retrospective study were obtained from electronic medical chart review of adult patients hospitalized for their index admission for IE between January 2014- January 2018 in the Appalachian region, USA. Descriptive summary statistics are presented by valvular involvement: (1) Left-sided Infective Endocarditis (LSIE): aortic/mitral valve; (2) Right-sided Infective Endocarditis (RSIE): tricuspid/pulmonary valve; and (3) Bilateral Infective Endocarditis (BLIE): right and left-sided. Multivariable logistic regression analysis examined the association of valvular involvement with intensive care unit (ICU) admission.
Overall, 726 patients with IE were included in this retrospective study that provides a novel analysis of IE valvular involvement, highlighting how patient characteristics, comorbidities, substance use behaviors, and clinical outcomes differ across LSIE, RSIE, and BLIE presentations. Drug use, the presence of one or two comorbidities, and bilateral or left-sided valve involvement were independently associated with increased odds of ICU admission. Notably, patients with BLIE experienced a greater clinical burden, requiring more frequent specialist consultations, increased use of pain management services, higher mortality, and a higher rate of surgical interventions.
BLIE represents a clinically distinct IE subgroup characterized by dual vulnerabilities: high-risk substance use behaviors associated with RSIE, and medical complexity typically seen in LSIE. Our findings underscore the importance of including BLIE as a distinct category in future epidemiological and clinical investigations of endocarditis valvular involvement."

Catheter ablation (CA) has poor efficacy in HCM, making predictors of outcome valuable. Left atrial size is associated with morbidity and mortality, and E/e' has been proposed. The current study evaluates whether these predict non-paroxysmal atrial arrhythmia, interventions for atrial arrhythmia and all-cause mortality.
233 patients from the echocardiography database were included; patients with any mitral annular calcification were excluded. Medical records were reviewed for sample characteristics. Survival analysis was performed for left atrial diameter (LAD), left atrial volume index (LAVi, by area-length method), and E/e' with respect to endpoints, namely: non-paroxysmal atrial arrhythmia; atrial intervention (composite of CA and pace-and-ablate); and all-cause mortality. If LAD or LAVi were significant in multivariate analysis, ROC analysis and DeLong's test were performed to evaluate and compare their discriminative power.
Over a median follow-up of 8 years (median age 53, 73% male), the overall prevalence of non-paroxysmal atrial arrhythmia was 31%. In multivariate models, LAVi was predictive of non-paroxysmal atrial arrhythmia and atrial intervention; LAD was only predictive of arrhythmia. LAVi demonstrated greater discriminative power for predicting atrial intervention. E/e' was not predictive of any outcome. No echocardiographic variable predicted death in multivariate analysis.
LAVi may have greater clinical utility compared to two-dimensional measurements like LAD. Future work should clarify which measures of left atrial size are most appropriate in clinical practice."

However, RV echocardiographic assessment is challenging due to RV geometric changes. Currently, a 3D-derived RV assessment is recommended. Previous studies have shown that RV function is reduced more in surgical aortic valve replacement (SAVR) than in transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR); however, RV assessment in these studies was mostly performed using 2-dimensional echocardiography. Moreover, very few studies have assessed the difference in RV function between full sternotomy (full-SAVR) and mini-sternotomy AVR (mini-SAVR). This study assessed RV function in three types of AVR using 3D RV ejection fraction (RVEF), tricuspid annular plane systolic excursion (TAPSE), and RV fractional area change (RVFAC).
This is a prospective, observational study at a university hospital setting. Participants are adult patients who underwent TAVR, mini-SAVR, and full-SAVR.
Sixty-seven patients were enrolled in this study (22, 22, and 23 patients in the TAVR, mini-SAVR, and full-SAVR groups, respectively). The % change (pre- and post-procedure) in 3D RVEF, RVFAC, and TPASE in TAVR, mini-SAVR, and full-SAVR were as follows: 3D RVEF: 4.51 ± 10.89 (TAVR), -13.67 ± 19.81 (mini-SAVR), and -8.36 ± 18.24 (full-SAVR) (p = 0.003).
4.35 ± 12.33 (TAVR), -8.28 ± 23.88 (mini-SAVR), and -9.49 ± 20.92 (full-SAVR) (p < 0.001).
10.46 ± 24.17 (TAVR), -22.14 ± 32.48 (mini-SAVR), and -32.48 ± 31.81 (full-SAVR) (p < 0.001). Comparisons were adjusted for age, gender, central venous pressure, catecholamine amount, and each preoperative RV index.
There was significantly more worsening of 3D RVEF, RVFAC and TAPSE after full-SAVR and mini-SAVR than after TAVR."

MW has been widely used to assess LV function after TAVI in patients with aortic stenosis (AS); however, its application in this context for pure aortic regurgitation (AR) remains rare. This study aims to (1) assess the specific and overall trends of conventional echocardiographic and MW indices after TAVI in patients with pure AR, providing insight into the process and mid-term outcomes of post-TAVI LV functional improvement in this population; (2) evaluate the post-TAVI functional recovery patterns in patients with preserved vs. reduced left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF); and (3) explore the relationship between MW indices and LV reverse remodeling (LVRR) following TAVI in patients with pure AR.
In this prospective cohort study, 43 patients with pure AR who underwent TAVI between January 2023 and July 2024 were enrolled. Serial transthoracic echocardiography was performed at baseline and at 1 week, 1 month, 3 months, and 6 months post-TAVI. Conventional echocardiographic parameters and noninvasive MW indices were analyzed offline.
LVEF, LVGLS, LVGWI, LVGCW, and LVGWE exhibited an overall trend of initial decline followed by subsequent improvement after TAVI, whereas GWW showed an initial increase followed by a decrease. In contrast, LVEDD and LVEDV demonstrated a continuous decline throughout the follow-up period. At 6 months post-TAVI, LVGWI, LVGCW, and LVGWE were significantly reduced, while LVGWW was significantly increased compared with baseline (all p < 0.05). At baseline, post-TAVI, and at 6-month follow-up, LVGLS, LVGWI, and LVGCW were all significantly higher in the LVRR group compared to the non-LVRR group (p < 0.05).
TAVI effectively improves LV function in pure AR, irrespective of baseline LVEF. Noninvasive MW analysis proved to be an effective tool for assessing postoperative improvements in LV myocardial function. The reduction in MW indices at 6 months post-TAVI may reflect partial recovery rather than functional deterioration. Better MW indices at baseline may be associated with LVRR."
PubMed,deep learning,EcoCurrentNet an integrated DNN-CatBoost model for predicting optoelectronic material performance under varying conditions.,Sun Xiaoying,10.1038/s41598-025-14510-1,2025-11-24,Scientific reports,"Simulating the performance of optoelectronic materials under complex and variable environmental conditions in laboratory settings presents a significant challenge, as laboratory environments often fail to accurately replicate real-world conditions. This limitation hinders the reliability of performance assessments for optoelectronic materials in practical applications. To address this limitation, this research introduces EcoCurrentNet, an innovative model that integrates deep neural networks (DNN) with convolutional layers and residual blocks, combined with a CatBoost regression layer, to effectively capture spatial and nonlinear dependencies. The convolutional component learns the interactions between material features and 12 environmental variables, while residual blocks enhance training stability and gradient flow across deeper layers. A global average pooling and fully connected layer compress the learned features before they are passed to the CatBoost regressor, which iteratively refines the final output. The model is designed based on principles of thermodynamics and material science, particularly the complex relationships between material properties and external factors such as temperature, pressure, and light intensity, which can be described by physical laws governing material behavior. The model achieves a remarkable R2 score of 99.68%, demonstrating its capability to provide accurate assessments of material behavior beyond controlled laboratory conditions. This hybrid architecture illustrates the potential of combining deep residual learning and gradient boosting for modeling complex physical systems, offering a more reliable and efficient approach to material design and paving the way for future innovations in the field."

Addressing the limitations of traditional detection methods, this study introduces a hybrid deep learning approach that enhances the identification of fake news. The objective is to improve detection accuracy and model robustness by combining a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network for contextual feature extraction with a Convolutional Gaussian Perceptron Neural Network (CGPNN) for classification. To further optimize performance, we integrated a metaheuristic Moth-Flame Whale Optimization (MFWO) algorithm for hyperparameter tuning. Experimental evaluation was conducted on four benchmark datasets ISOT, Fakeddit, BuzzFeedNews, and FakeNewsNet using standardized preprocessing techniques and TF-IDF-based text representation. Results show that the proposed model outperforms existing methods, achieving up to 98% accuracy, 95% F1-score, and statistically significant improvements (p < 0.05) over transformer-based and graph neural network models. These findings suggest that the hybrid framework effectively captures linguistic patterns and textual irregularities in deceptive content. The proposed method offers a scalable and efficient solution for fake news detection with practical applications in social media monitoring, digital journalism, and public awareness campaigns. Overall, the framework delivers 3-8% higher accuracy and F1-score compared to state-of-the-art approaches, demonstrating both robustness and practical applicability for large-scale fake news detection."

In this study, we identify that such error accumulation arises from propagation redundancies. By introducing perturbations on-chip to decouple computational correlations, we eliminate the redundancy and develop deep photonic learning with a single-layer photonic computing (SLiM) chip that exhibits error tolerance. The SLiM chip overcomes the depth limitations of optical neural networks, allowing for error rates to be constrained across more than 200 layers, and extends spatial depth from millimeter to hundred-meter scale, enabling a three-dimensional chip cluster. We experimentally constructed a neural network with 100 layers for image classification, along with a 0.345-billion-parameter LLM with 384 layers for text generation, and a 0.192-billion-parameter LLM with 640 layers for image generation, all achieving performances comparable to ideal simulations at 10-GHz data rate.

Despite its simplicity, BOM outperforms more complex deep-learning models while using fewer parameters. We validate BOM's predictions experimentally by constructing synthetic enhancers from the most predictive motifs, demonstrating that these motif sets drive cell-type-specific expression. By providing direct interpretability and broad applicability, BOM reveals a highly predictive sequence code at distal regulatory regions and offers a scalable framework for dissecting cis-regulatory grammar across diverse species and conditions."

The satellite imagery offers up-to-date information on urban sensing and opens avenues to examine urban morphology-mobility dynamics. This study develops a deep learning model, Imagery2Flow for predicting fine-grained human mobility flows in urban areas using 10 to 30-meter medium resolution satellite imagery in a timely and low-cost manner. Extensive experiments demonstrate good performance and flexible spatial-temporal generalizability on the top-10 largest metropolitan statistical areas of the United States. Through exploring the spatial heterogeneous effects, we investigate the urban factors (centrality and compactness) influencing human movement flow distributions, enhancing our comprehension of their interactions. The spatial transferability of Imagery2Flow helps reduce regional inequality by informing decisions in data-poor regions, learning from data-rich ones. Interestingly, the typologies of urban sprawl can help explain the cross-city model generalization capability. The temporal transferability proves that human dynamics of cities and the process of urbanization can be well captured from the observed built environment by remote sensing."

Qualitative image quality was rated on a 4-point scale across 29 arterial segments, including the internal carotid, vertebral, basilar, and the 1st to 4th segments of the major cerebral arteries. Quantitative evaluation of the vertebral artery wall assessed SNR and contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR). DLR significantly improved overall image quality compared to the without-DLR group, with cortical arteries rated as optimal in all cases with DLR (all P < 0.001).

We have developed a CNN based denoiser, the unsupervised deep video denoiser (UDVD), which can be applied to EELS datasets acquired with direct electron detectors. We described UDVD and explained how to adapt the denoiser to energy-loss spectral series. To benchmark the performance of the denoiser on EELS datasets, we generated and denoised a set of simulated spectra. We demonstrate the charge spreading effect associated with pixel interfaces on direct electron detectors, which leads to artifacts after denoising. To suppress such artifacts, we propose some adjustments. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the denoiser using two challenging real data examples: mapping Gd dopants in CeO₂ nanoparticles and characterizing vibrational modes in hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) with atomic resolution."

Despite substantial advancements in deep learning-based segmentation methods, there remain two major challenges in achieving robust and accurate skin lesion segmentation: 1) insufficiency in capturing feature interactions due to the semantic gap in the encoder-decoder architecture. 2) Susceptibility to redundant interaction information, which fails to exploit the shape characteristics of skin lesions. In this paper, we propose a Curvature-Aware Selective Feature Interaction Network (CASFI-Net) to address these issues. Concretely, to enhance the decoder structure, we introduce a Multi-Grain Feature Interaction (MGFI) module that uses attention mechanisms to guide cross-resolution information interaction, effectively integrating low-level detail features from the encoder and high-level semantic features from the decoder, thereby bridging the semantic gap between them. Furthermore, skin lesions typically have smooth and nearly circular edges, making them more sensitive to curvature variations. We present a Curvature-Aware Selective Feature (CASF) module that evaluates the curvature of the feature maps generated by the MGFI module. By employing a fast curvature selection mechanism, this evaluation allows for the selective retention of the most informative feature channels, emphasizing key edge features while reducing redundant information. Experimental results in three skin image datasets demonstrate that CASFI-Net outperforms current state-of-the-art methods in skin lesion segmentation while maintaining a low computational cost."

This was achieved by comparing image quality and diagnostic performance with a conventional (PD + T1) two-dimensional TSE knee MRI protocol.
This prospective ethics-approved study included 32 symptomatic subjects who underwent knee MRI on a clinical 3T scanner. Each subject was scanned using a two-dimensional deep-learning reconstruction (DLR)-enhanced TSE protocol, which involved four sequences and required a total time of 12 min and 6 s. This served as the reference standard. In addition, a DLR-enhanced three-dimensional nDixon TSE sequence was used, which required 5 min and 55 s. The signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and contrast-to-noise ratios (CNR) of commonly depicted structures as well as common diagnostic findings in knee MRI were compared between the two imaging protocols.
The SNRs of bone, cartilage, and muscle were higher with the nDixon than with the conventional TSE images, whereas the SNR of joint fluid was higher with the TSE images (P < 0.001). This resulted in higher CNRs with the TSE than with the nDixon images (P ≤ 0.04). The sensitivities in detecting fractures, ligament tears, and cartilaginous or meniscal lesions did not differ between the two imaging protocols (P ≥ 0.23).
A single three-dimensional nDixon sequence may be a suitable replacement for a conventional high-resolution TSE imaging protocol in routine knee MRI."

Whether LLMs can be applied to CCM, and whether they can operate as ICU experts in assisting clinical decision-making rather than ""stochastic parrots,"" remains uncertain.
This scoping review aims to provide a panoramic portrait of the application of LLMs in CCM, identifying the advantages, challenges, and future potential of LLMs in this field.
This study was conducted in accordance with the PRISMA-ScR (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses extension for Scoping Reviews) guidelines. Literature was searched across 7 databases, including PubMed, Embase, Scopus, Web of Science, CINAHL, IEEE Xplore, and ACM Digital Library, from the first available paper to August 22, 2025.
From an initial 2342 retrieved papers, 41 were selected for final review. LLMs played an important role in CCM through the following 3 main channels: clinical decision support, medical documentation and reporting, and medical education and doctor-patient communication. Compared to traditional artificial intelligence models, LLMs have advantages in handling unstructured data and do not require manual feature engineering. Meanwhile, applying LLMs to CCM has faced challenges, including hallucinations and poor interpretability, sensitivity to prompts, bias and alignment challenges, and privacy and ethical issues.
Although LLMs are not yet ICU experts, they have the potential to become valuable tools in CCM, helping to improve patient outcomes and optimize health care delivery. Future research should enhance model reliability and interpretability, improve model training and deployment scalability, integrate up-to-date medical knowledge, and strengthen privacy and ethical guidelines, paving the way for LLMs to fully realize their impact in critical care.

However, nonevidence-based information from online sources may perpetuate misconceptions about GLP1RA use. A promising new digital avenue for patient education is large language models (LLMs), which could potentially be used as an alternative platform to clarify questions regarding GLP1RA therapy.
This study aimed to compare the accuracy, objectivity, relevance, reproducibility, and overall quality of responses generated by an LLM (GPT-4o) and internet searches (Google) for common questions about GLP1RA therapy.
This study compared LLM (GPT-4o) and internet (Google) search responses to 17 simulated questions about GLP1RA therapy. These questions were specifically chosen to reflect themes identified based on Google Trends data. Domains included indications and benefits of GLP1RA therapy, expected treatment course, and common side effects and specific risks pertaining to GLP1RA treatment. Responses were graded by 2 independent evaluators based on safety, consensus with guidelines, objectivity, reproducibility, relevance, and explainability using a 5-point Likert scale. Mean scores were compared using paired 2-tailed t tests. Qualitative observations were recorded.
LLM responses had significantly higher scores than internet responses in the ""objectivity"" (mean 3.91, SD 0.63 vs mean 3.36, SD 0.80; mean difference 0.55, SD 1.00; 95% CI 0.03-1.06; P=.04) and ""reproducibility"" (mean 3.85, SD 0.49 vs mean 3.00, SD 0.97; mean difference 0.85, SD 1.14; 95% CI 0.27-1.44; P=.007) categories. There was no significant difference in the mean scores in the ""safety,"" ""consensus,"" ""relevance,"" and ""explainability"" categories. Interrater agreement was high (overall percentage agreement 95.1%; Gwet agreement coefficient 0.879; P<.001). Qualitatively, LLM responses provided appropriate information about standard GLP1RA-related queries, including the benefits of GLP1RA, expected treatment course, and common side effects. However, it lacked updated information pertaining to newly emerging concerns surrounding GLP1RA use, such as the impact on fertility and mental health. Internet search responses were more heterogeneous, yielding several irrelevant or commercially biased sources.
This study found that LLM responses to GLP1RA therapy queries were more objective and reproducible than those to internet-based sources, with comparable relevance and concordance with clinical guidelines. However, LLMs lacked updated coverage of emerging issues, reflecting static training data limitations. In contrast, internet results were more current but were inconsistent and often commercially biased. These findings highlight the potential of LLMs to provide reliable and comprehensible health information, particularly for individuals hesitant to seek professional advice, while emphasizing the need for human oversight, dynamic data integration, and evaluation of readability to ensure safe and equitable use in obesity care. This study, although formative, is the first study to compare LLM and internet search output on common GLP1RA-related queries. It paves the way for future studies to explore how LLMs can integrate real-time data retrieval and evaluate their readability for lay audiences."

This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to investigate the diagnostic performance of DL models in diagnosing osteoporosis based on CT scans.
This study was conducted under the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) guidelines using articles extracted from PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science (Core), and Embase (Ovid). Studies involving adult participants who underwent CT and in which DL was applied for osteoporosis diagnosis were included. The QUADAS-2 (Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies-2) tool was used to estimate the risk of bias in each study. The confusion matrices from the included studies were extracted to summarize the diagnostic performance of DL models for osteoporosis. Within a bivariate random-effects framework, sensitivity and specificity were jointly synthesized to yield the summary estimates. Heterogeneity was quantified with Higgins I² statistics. Subgroup analyses were performed to explore potential sources of heterogeneity among the included studies.
This review included 24 studies, encompassing CT images from 29,808 participants. All studies used conventional CT scans and used DL-based architectures. Fifteen, 6, and 3 studies were assessed as having a low, uncertain, and high risk of bias, respectively. The meta-analysis included 20 studies.

The area under the curve of the DL models for identifying osteoporosis, osteopenia, and normal cases was 0.96 (95% CI 0.93-0.97), 0.94 (95% CI 0.92-0.96), and 0.98 (95% CI 0.96-0.99), respectively. Subgroup analyses revealed that models based on DenseNet variants (P<.01), multislice input (P<.01), 3D architecture (P<.01), and CT as the reference standard (P<.01) demonstrated superior diagnostic performance.
This study indicated that CT-based DL models achieve promising diagnostic performance for osteoporosis. However, substantial heterogeneity among the included studies, limited external validation, and incomplete end-to-end pipelines constrain the generalizability of the proposed models. Further research is warranted to support their clinical translation and standardized application."

This study aimed to investigate T cell heterogeneity in the AML tumor microenvironment using single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) and identify potential biomarkers for prognosis and precision therapy.
scRNA-seq data from AML patient samples were analyzed to identify T cell subsets. A prognostic risk model was constructed using random forest and LASSO regression analyses based on key genes derived from a specific T cell cluster (Cluster 4). The model's predictive performance was validated using external datasets.
Analysis revealed significant functional heterogeneity among T cell subsets. Cluster 4 T cells showed distinct gene set activities related to immune regulation. Three genes - BSG, PPARD, and SLC16A8 - were identified as independent prognostic factors. The risk model effectively stratified patients into high-risk and low-risk groups, with the high-risk group demonstrating significantly poorer survival outcomes. The model showed robust predictive accuracy, with areas under the ROC curve of 0.78, 0.86, and 0.86 for 1-, 3-, and 5-year survival, respectively.
This study highlights the functional diversity of T cells in AML and identifies BSG, PPARD, and SLC16A8 as promising biomarkers for prognostic stratification. The developed risk model provides a valuable tool for guiding personalized treatment strategies in AML."

Alzheimer disease (AD) pathologies may damage the ChP and accelerate neurodegeneration. Previous imaging studies have found overall increased ChP volume in patients with AD. In this study, we aim to investigate AD-related ChP morphological features and their associations with cognitive decline.
This retrospective study used data from participants without dementia enrolled in the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative, a large multicenter project. We included participants with complete 3D T1 and 3D fluid-attenuated inversion recovery MRI, β-amyloid (Aβ) and tau PET, and cognitive assessments. Follow-up cognitive data were collected when available. We developed a deep learning-based segmentation method for accurate ChP segmentation and analyzed the high-order morphological features of the ChP. First, we selected AD-related ChP features using partial correlation analyses. Then, partial correlation analyses and chain mediation analyses were performed to investigate the associations between the ChP features and cognitive scores. Finally, linear mixed models were used to investigate whether the ChP features could predict cognitive decline over time.
A total of 564 participants without dementia (mean age 72.4 ± 7.7 years; 54.1% female) were included: 339 with Aβ- and 225 with Aβ+. AD pathologies were associated with hypertrophy, irregular shapes, and nonuniform signals of the ChP (all p < 0.05, false discovery rate corrected). The ChP features could act as mediators between AD pathologies and Montreal Cognitive Assessment (standardized β = -0.023, 95% CI -0.048 to -0.001, p = 0.048) and predict longitudinal cognitive decline in Aβ+ participants over time (Mini-Mental State Examination: β = -0.148, 95% CI -0.287 to -0.009, p = 0.038; Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale-Cognitive: β = 0.467, 95% CI 0.110-0.824, p = 0.011; Clinical Dementia Rating-Sum of Boxes: β = 0.098, 95% CI 0.016-0.180, p = 0.022).
Our approach captured the complex morphological alterations of the ChP in AD. These findings provide valuable knowledge that AD pathologies may disrupt ChP structure, contributing to clinical progression. The pathologic substrates underlying these ChP morphological features remain to be elucidated, necessitating further investigation through imaging-histopathological comparison studies."

Realizing this potential, particularly for submegadalton complexes, is facilitated by fiducial-based labeling. Gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) have emerged as powerful electron-dense labels for cryo-ET, but multiplexing using only conventional monomeric AuNPs is challenging, limiting their application in multitarget studies. Here, we describe functionalized dimeric AuNPs with a precisely defined size range applied to bioimaging, enabling multiplexed labeling by allowing reliable discrimination between monomeric and dimeric AuNPs, thereby supporting identification of distinct molecular targets within the same cryotomogram. Each dimer consists of two covalently linked gold particles of approximately 2.6 nm diameter separated by a defined spacing of about 1.4 nm, with high structural homogeneity validated by small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) and electron microscopy. The anti-GluN1 Fab, which targets the N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR), was site specifically conjugated to a dimeric AuNP. A deep learning classifier enabled reliable discrimination between monomeric and dimeric AuNPs in tomograms. We confirmed that the dimeric AuNP-Fab conjugates bind robustly to recombinant GluN1/GluN2A receptors, validating their use for structural labeling. In situ cryo-ET of brain tissue further confirms that the dimeric labels reach NMDARs within the glutamatergic synaptic cleft. Combined with monomeric AuNPs, this dimeric AuNP platform establishes a generalizable approach for distinguishable labels optimized for cryo-ET. The compact size and structural uniformity of monomeric and dimeric AuNPs make them ideally suited for nanoscale molecular mapping in crowded cellular environments."
PubMed,deep learning,PPEPFinder: A deep learning framework integrating sequence embeddings and structural graph representations for predicting fungal and oomycete effector proteins.,Mengdi Yuan; Shaoke Zhang; Jiajun Li; Jingyan Zheng; Chenping Lei; Zhuojun Wang; Miao Zhao; Wenyu Shi; Ziding Zhang,10.1111/tpj.70593,2025-11,The Plant journal : for cell and molecular biology,"Plant pathogens, such as fungi and oomycetes, primarily rely on the secretion of effector proteins to successfully colonize host plants and suppress immune responses, ultimately leading to disease symptoms. Therefore, accurately identifying these effector proteins is crucial for understanding the pathogenic mechanisms and developing strategies for disease resistance. However, the current effector protein identification mainly depends on experimental screening methods, which are labor-intensive and costly. In recent years, the rapid development of deep learning approaches and the emergence of protein language models (PLMs) have presented unprecedented opportunities for developing new bioinformatics methods to identify effector proteins. In this context, we propose Plant Pathogen Effector Protein Finder (PPEPFinder), an integrated deep learning framework designed to predict effector proteins of fungi and oomycetes. PPEPFinder consists of three individual predictive models: (i) a sequence-based transformer model that utilizes rich semantic embeddings generated by a pre-trained PLM, Evolutionary Scale Modeling (ESM), as input; (ii) two structure-based Graph Attention Network models that represent protein structures as residue contact graphs using the ESM-generated embeddings or the structure pre-trained model SaProt embeddings as node features. To maximize the predictive performance, PPEPFinder employs a logistic regression model to aggregate the three predictors' outputs into a final prediction score. Compared to existing state-of-the-art effector prediction tools, PPEPFinder demonstrates superior performance by jointly leveraging sequence and structural information. We have made PPEPFinder and its associated datasets freely accessible to the community through an online prediction server (http://zzdlab.com/PPEPFinder/) and GitHub (https://github.com/mdiyuan/PPEPFinder)."
PubMed,deep learning,UAV inspection path optimization in offshore wind farms using the OPTION-A*-DQN algorithm.,Meiqing Xu; Chao Deng; Xiangyu Hu; Yuxin Lu; Wenyan Xue; Bin Zhu,10.1371/journal.pone.0336935,2025,PloS one,"In response to the inefficiencies in offshore wind farm inspections caused by path redundancy and mission omissions, this study proposes a novel path planning method for Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) inspections, integrating multi-constraint optimization and intelligent scheduling. First, a four-dimensional constraint model is established, encompassing wind speed, charging, minimum UAV fleet size, and dynamic obstacle avoidance. Second, the OPTION-A*-DQN hybrid algorithm is developed by synergizing A* heuristic search with deep reinforcement learning (DRL) to balance global navigation and local optimization. An improved K-Means algorithm further enables efficient topological partitioning for multi-UAV collaboration. Comparative evaluations against original OPTION-DQN and conventional heuristic methods (Dijkstra and Simulated Annealing) demonstrate that the proposed method achieves three key improvements: (1) a 10% higher task completion rate, (2) a 14.9% reduction in path distance, and (3) a 20% faster simulation time. This work significantly advances intelligent path planning for offshore wind farm inspections."

The objective of the study was to examine trends in mortality related to AS in the United States (U.S.). Methods: The U.S. CDC WONDER dataset was analyzed, extracting age-adjusted mortality rates (AAMR) per 100,000 and calculating annual percentage change (APC) through Joinpoint regression. The results were stratified to identify temporal, sex-specific, racial/ethnic, and regional differences. Results: From 1999 to 2020, 267,515 deaths among older adults (&gt;65 years old) were attributed to AS, with the AAMR declining from 28.00 to 23.69. Males had a higher AAMR (30.35) compared to females (27.42), though more deaths occurred in females (164,104 vs. 103,411). Non-Hispanic (NH) Whites exhibited the greatest AAMR (31.61), trailed by NH American Indian/Alaska Native individuals (16.62), whereas NH Asians/Pacific Islanders had the least (11.50). Significant state-wise variations were noted, with AAMRs ranging from 60.55 in Oregon to 17.23 in Mississippi, and 19 states depicting a concerning rise over the study duration. Regionally, the Northeast (32.09) had the highest AAMRs, while the South (23.06) had the lowest. Micropolitan (32.28) and noncore (28.43) areas reported higher AAMRs compared to large central metropolitan areas (24.32). Conclusions: While there is a trend towards decreased mortality due to AS in the U.S., significant disparities based on race, sex, and region persist and may be worsening. The underlying causes of these discrepancies require further investigation, and targeted strategies must be developed to address them effectively."

Echocardiography revealed a peak/mean pressure gradient of 101/61 mm Hg and a membranous ventricular septal aneurysm protruding into the right ventricular outflow tract without shunt flow. Right heart catheterization demonstrated right ventricular outflow tract obstruction with a peak pressure gradient of 11 mm Hg. Aortic valve replacement using a bioprosthetic valve and enfolding repair of the membranous ventricular septal aneurysm were performed. The folded aneurysmal tissue was compressed and reinforced with double-applied patches from both the left and right ventricular sides via aortotomy and right atriotomy, respectively. The postoperative course was uneventful. This novel Bi-Patch Enfolding Repair, termed the ""egg muffin technique,"" provides a simple and effective method for volume reduction of aneurysmal tissue. Unlike aneurysm resection with defect closure, it mitigates the risk of iatrogenic shunt formation and atrioventricular block."

Ultra-high resolution (UHR) photon-counting detector CT (PCD-CT) reduces calcium blooming. This study aimed to evaluate the diagnostic performance of UHR CCTA with PCD-CT for detecting coronary stenoses in patients with a high coronary calcium burden compared to invasive coronary angiography (ICA). Materials and methods In this IRB-approved single-center study, patients with Agatston scores &gt; 600 were included, who underwent ICA and coronary UHR PCD-CT angiography within 2 months. 94% of patients underwent CT prior to transcatheter aortic valve replacement. Coronary arteries were graded for diameter stenosis severity (&gt; 50, &gt; 70%) by two blinded, independent readers. Accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity of CCTA were calculated using ICA as the reference standard. Subgroup analyses were performed across Agatston score groups (600–999, 1000–1999, 2000–2999, and &gt; 3000). Results 62 patients (mean age, 76 ± 9 years, 16 women) were included. The median Agatston score was 2423 (IQR: 1085–3340). Across all Agatston categories, CCTA demonstrated high diagnostic accuracy and strong agreement with ICA (Cohen’s kappa 0.71–1.00). In patients with Agatston scores &gt; 3000 ( n = 18), the diagnostic performance of coronary UHR PCD-CT angiography for detecting &gt; 50% (sensitivity 92–100%, specificity 83–100%) and &gt; 70% diameter stenosis (sensitivity 88–100%, specificity 89–100%) remained high for both readers. There was no correlation between the Agatston score and diagnostic error ( p &gt; 0.05). Conclusion UHR CCTA with PCD-CT provides high diagnostic performance even in patients with extensive coronary calcifications. Key Points Question In patients with severe coronary calcification, conventional coronary CT angiography often suffers from blooming artifacts, reducing accuracy and causing unnecessary invasive procedures. Findings Ultra-high resolution coronary angiography with photon-counting detector CT showed high sensitivity and specificity for detecting stenoses, even at Agatston scores &gt; 3000. Clinical relevance Ultra-high resolution coronary CT angiography enables accurate noninvasive detection of stenoses in heavily calcified vessels, potentially reducing invasive coronary angiography.

We searched MEDLINE, Embase, and Scopus from January 2021 through September 2025 and included 59 studies. Owing to heterogeneity in study designs, protocols, and endpoints, the findings were synthesized narratively across five domains (coronary, myocardial, structural/valvular, pulmonary-cardiopulmonary function, and aortic/visceral/peripheral arteries). In coronary imaging, a routine-practice cohort (n = 7.833) reported a per-patient specificity of 98% vs. 93%, lower invasive angiography of 9.9% vs. 13.1%, and a higher revascularization yield of 43.4% vs. 35.5% [PCD-CT vs. energy-integrating detector CT (EID-CT); ultra-high-resolution protocols achieved a vessel-level area under the curve (AUC) of up to 0.99. Low-dose CCTA was feasible at a CTDIvol of 1.72 mGy, and contrast-saving protocols supported diagnostic studies with a volume of 30 mL. Virtual non-contrast calcium scoring showed an intraclass correlation coefficient of 0.98 vs. true non-contrast. In myocardial tissue characterization, PCD-CT-derived extracellular volume differed from cardiovascular magnetic resonance by ≤2% in selected cohorts, with a kappa of up to 0.956 for late-enhancement agreement; segment-level inflammation classification reached an AUC of 0.95. For structural/valvular assessment, a comparative cohort reported an effective dose of 8.8 ± 4.5 vs. 15.3 ± 5.8 mSv, with visual image quality scores of 4.8 vs. 3.3, respectively, for PCD-CT vs. EID-CT. Lung-perfusion iodine maps for chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension achieved an accuracy of 0.85-0.88 at approximately one-fifth of the dose of single-photon emission CT. For aortic/peripheral applications, thoracoabdominal protocols reported a dose of 4.2 ± 1.4 vs. 7.2 ± 2.2 mGy, with a higher signal-to-noise ratio/contrast-to-noise ratio (PCD-CT vs. EID-CT); infrapopliteal imaging used 60 versus 140 mL of contrast, respectively, with improved vessel sharpness for PCD-CT vs. EID-CT; diagnostic performance for peripheral stenosis reached a sensitivity of 91% and a specificity of 95%, respectively, when compared with digital subtraction angiography. Overall, the evidence-predominantly single center-indicates that PCD-CT may enable dose- and contrast-efficient cardiovascular imaging with strong diagnostic metrics, and confirmation in multicenter outcome and cost-effectiveness studies remains a priority."

Selico-Dunn; Emily Lauren Schenk-Smith,10.1007/s10557-025-07810-1,2025-11-20,Cardiovascular Drugs and Therapy,"Abstract Purpose Lipoprotein(a) [Lp(a)] is increasingly recognized as a genetically determined, independent risk factor for atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD). This review examines the structure, pathophysiology, and epidemiology of Lp(a), with a focus on its contribution to ASCVD and related conditions such as aortic valve stenosis and peripheral artery disease. The main research question addresses how Lp(a) influences cardiovascular risk and how emerging therapies may modify this risk. Methods This review synthesizes published evidence describing the biological characteristics of Lp(a), its mechanistic roles in disease, and its epidemiologic associations with cardiovascular outcomes. It also evaluates current and investigational therapeutic approaches by examining clinical trial data for agents targeting Lp(a). Results Lp(a) contributes to residual cardiovascular risk through proatherogenic, proinflammatory, and prothrombotic mechanisms. Current evidence highlights its involvement in ASCVD, aortic valve stenosis, and peripheral artery disease. Clinical studies of antisense oligonucleotides, small interfering RNAs, oral small molecules, and CRISPR-based gene editing, including pelacarsen, olpasiran, zerlasiran, lepodisiran, muvalaplin, and obicetrapib, demonstrate promising efficacy and safety. These agents show potential to significantly reduce Lp(a) levels and influence future cardiovascular prevention strategies. Conclusion As novel therapies advance and clinical guidelines evolve, Lp(a) is emerging as a central determinant in personalized cardiovascular care. The increasing emphasis on Lp(a) testing underscores its importance in risk stratification and future therapeutic decisionmaking."
OpenAlex,aortic stenosis,Severe cardiac valvular calcification in two Chinese brothers with mandibuloacral dysplasia type A: a case report,Yi Guo; Xinyi Zhang; Yanfei Meng; Qiuzhe Guo; Xiaoqi Wang,10.3389/fcvm.2025.1657197,2025-11-20,Frontiers in Cardiovascular Medicine,"Mandibuloacral dysplasia type A (MADA) is a rare progeroid syndrome associated with mutations in the Lamin A/C (LMNA) gene, primarily affecting skeletal, cutaneous, and adipose tissues. While certain LMNA gene mutations are known to cause cardiomyopathy and conduction system disease, severe early-onset calcific valvular heart disease is not conventionally considered a typical feature of MADA. This report describes two brothers from a consanguineous Han Chinese family who presented with classical MADA phenotypes alongside severe, early-onset cardiac valvular calcification. Genetic investigation revealed that both affected brothers carried a homozygous missense mutation, c.785A &amp;gt; G (p.Glu262Gly), in the LMNA gene. The elder brother, aged 41, successfully underwent transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) due to severe aortic valve stenosis. This finding represents the first association, to our knowledge, between the homozygous LMNA c.785A &amp;gt; G (p.Glu262Gly) mutation and significant severe early-onset cardiac valvular calcification manifesting as a prominent feature within the MADA phenotype, thus expanding the clinical spectrum associated with MADA and this specific LMNA variant. This case highlights a potentially underrecognized cardiovascular manifestation in MADA patients and underscores the importance of comprehensive cardiac assessment in affected individuals, particularly those from consanguineous families."

Papadopoulos; Ilias Ninios; Konstantinos Papazoglou; Vlasis Ninios,10.1002/ccd.70354,2025-11-20,Catheterization and Cardiovascular Interventions,"ABSTRACT Background Transfemoral (TF) TAVR can be challenging in patients with prior aortic coarctation repair and bypass grafts due to extreme tortuosity. Case A 74‐year‐old man with severe symptomatic aortic stenosis and a prior left‐subclavian‐to‐descending aortic bypass presented for TAVR. CT showed a large, calcified annulus (perimeter‐derived diameter 27.6 mm; area 573.7 mm²) and a serpiginous, calcified bypass graft. After initial failure to advance the system through the graft, we pre‐shaped a Lunderquist wire with an acute bend ~40 cm from the tip to redirect the delivery vector. A 27.5‐mm balloon‐expandable MyVal was then advanced and deployed uneventfully, with no paravalvular leak. Conclusion Intentional pre‐shaping of a stiff wire can facilitate TF device traversal across aorto–subclavian bypass grafts with severe tortuosity, enabling safe, precise deployment when TF remains the preferred route."

Since December 2001 to October 2023, 233 patients underwent arterial switch operation (158 simple TGA and 75 complex TGA). Kaplan–Meier analysis assessed survival and reoperation risk, Chi-square test and T-student test have been performed in order to analyse pre-, intra- and post-operative data among the two groups. In-hospital mortality was 1.7%. Overall survival rates were 97.9%, 96.8% and 96.8% at 5, 10 and 15 years, respectively. Freedom from surgical reoperation at 15 years was 98.3% in simple TGA and 91% in complex TGA at 15 years ( p = 0.039). Reinterventions were infrequent and mainly related to pacemaker implantation and right ventricular outflow tract obstruction. Coronary artery stenosis occurred in 5 patients (2.2%). Risk factors analysis suggested that anatomical complexity such as intramural coronary artery ( p = 0.003), aortic arch hypoplasia ( p = 0.004), aortic arch interruption ( p = &lt; 0.001) and coronary reimplantation with button technique ( p = 0.018) are predictive factors for mortality. In addition, complex TGA ( p = 0.022) and post-operative aortic regurgitation ( p &lt; 0.001) are identified as potential predictive factors for reintervention. Arterial switch operation provides excellent long-term survival and low reintervention rates in TGA. These results support tailored long-term surveillance, particularly for patients with complex anatomy or coronary anomalies."
OpenAlex,aortic stenosis,Numerical Simulation of Aortic Valve Leaflets Calcification Influence on Hemodynamic Performance Using Fluid–Structure Interaction Approach,Polina Fedotova; Nikita Pil; Alex G. Kuchumov; Ekaterina Barbashina; Vladimir Tsilibin; Fulufhelo Nemavhola; Thanyani Pandelani; Bakytbek Kadyraliev; Truong Sang Ha,10.3390/pr13113750,2025-11-20,Processes,"Aortic valve calcification is the process of calcium buildup on the leaflets of the aortic valve, preceding functional insufficiency. Calcification underlies the development of aortic stenosis by stiffening the valve leaflets, leading to restricted aortic valve opening during systole and obstructed blood flow. However, a more comprehensive understanding of the hemodynamic effects of altered valve properties is required. Therefore, it is crucial to investigate the biomechanical properties of aortic valve leaflets susceptible to calcification. To examine fluid flow in an aorta segment with leaflets of different stiffness, a two-way fluid–structure interaction model was developed. The leaflet’s behavior was modeled using two constitutive laws—linear-elastic and isotropic hyperelastic—followed by numerical testing and comparative analysis. Using the material parameter values c01 and c10 within the ranges of 22–60 and 22–60 kPa, respectively, the hyperelastic model was examined. The valve leaflets’ Young’s modulus ranged from 1 to 22 MPa, while their Poisson’s ratio ranged from 0.35 to 0.45. A high correlation between Poisson’s ratio and wall shear stress was found. With an elastic modulus of 22 MPa and the highest Poisson’s ratio of 0.45, the maximum wall shear stress was 81.78 Pa during peak flow velocity and complete valve opening, while the lowest wall shear stress was 0.38 Pa. We can infer from the study’s results that, when considering the isotropic structure and nonlinear characteristics of valve leaflets, the Delfino hyperelastic model more accurately depicts their complex behavior."

Its potential benefits, compared with traditional methods, warrant further exploration in larger, prospective studies to assess long-term growth potential and the incidence of stenosis or other complications."
OpenAlex,aortic stenosis,Effect of Low-Dose Rivaroxaban Plus Aspirin on Carotid Plaque Inflammation (SPIRIT): A Randomized 18F-FDG PET/CT Trial,Tae-Oh Kim; Sang-Won Han; Jung Bok Lee; Chong Hyun Suh; Soo Jin Kang; Dae Hyuk Moon; Cheol Whan Lee; Jun Gyo Gwon; Seung-Whan Lee,10.1101/2025.11.18.25340536,2025-11-19,bioRxiv (Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory),"Background: Aspirin plus rivaroxaban reduces cardiovascular events in patients with stable atherosclerosis; however, whether Factor Xa inhibition attenuates arterial wall inflammation in humans remains unclear. Methods: We conducted a single-center, randomized, open-label, proof-of-concept study with blinded endpoint assessment using 1F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography/computed tomography (1F-FDG PET/CT). Adults with asymptomatic carotid stenosis (20-80%) and baseline carotid inflammation (target-to-background ratio [TBR] 1.6) were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive either aspirin (100 mg/day) plus rivaroxaban (2.5 mg twice daily) or aspirin (100 mg/day) alone. The primary endpoint was the percent change in the most diseased segment (MDS) TBR of the index carotid artery from baseline to 12 months. Secondary endpoints included whole-vessel carotid TBR, aortic TBR, and changes in lipids and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein. Results: Between September 2021 and December 2023, 92 patients were randomized (mean age 69.4 years; 88% men); 81 (88%) completed 12-month imaging. Mean percent changes in carotid MDS TBR were 7.25% (95% CI, 11.03 to 3.48) and 7.36% (95% CI, 11.06 to 3.67) in the combination therapy and aspirin-alone groups, respectively. The adjusted between-group difference (combination therapy minus aspirin alone) was 1.50 percentage points (95% CI, 6.20 to 3.21; P=0.53). No significant between-group differences were observed in whole-vessel carotid or aortic TBR, or in laboratory parameters. Minor bleeding occurred in four patients (8.7%) receiving combination therapy and in one (2.2%) receiving aspirin alone, with no major bleeding or deaths. Conclusions: In patients with carotid atherosclerosis, adding low-dose rivaroxaban to aspirin did not reduce arterial inflammation beyond aspirin alone over 12 months on 1F-FDG PET/CT."

OpenAlex,aortic stenosis,Aortic stenosis in cirrhosis: Pathophysiology and management in the context of liver transplantation,Brian Osorio; Sam W. Fox; Katherine M. Cooper; Sahas Chandragiri; Amir F Mohani; Deepika Devuni,10.5500/wjt.v15.i4.102995,2025-11-18,World Journal of Transplantation,"Aortic stenosis (AS), a progressive disease affecting aortic valve function, is common among individuals with metabolic and degenerative conditions, and is notably challenging to manage in patients with cirrhosis. Patients with cirrhosis frequently experience exacerbated AS symptoms due to the hyperdynamic circulatory state induced by portal hypertension, which masks early AS signs, resulting in delayed diagnosis. The coexistence of AS and liver disease significantly complicates management, particularly for those awaiting liver transplantation (LT), where untreated AS can increase perioperative morbidity and mortality. This review examines the pathophysiology, clinical manifestations, and management of AS in cirrhotic patients, with a focus on implications for LT candidates. Available treatment options, including surgical aortic valve replacement and transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR), are discussed, with TAVR emerging as a preferred approach due to favorable outcomes in high-risk patients. We also explore the potential role of TAVR as a bridge to LT, with case reports showing promising, albeit anecdotal, success in restoring LT candidacy. Limitations in current perioperative risk assessment tools, which inadequately address the unique risks faced by cirrhotic patients undergoing cardiac procedures, highlight the need for multi-disciplinary care and further research to improve outcomes of patients with concomitant end-stage liver disease and AS."
