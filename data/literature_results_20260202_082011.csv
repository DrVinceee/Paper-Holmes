PubMed,aortic stenosis,Detection of left ventricular hypertrophy through ECG: diagnostic performance and comparison of ten ECG scores in different hypertrophic conditions.,Davide Antonio Mei; Kevin Serafini; Jacopo Francesco Imberti; Marco Vitolo; Federica Pollicino; Elisa Battigaglia; Gennaro Procaccia; Michele Cervini; Federico Massari; Andrea Barbieri; Giuseppe Boriani,10.1016/j.ejim.2026.106725,2026-01-31,European journal of internal medicine,"Different electrocardiographic (ECG) criteria were proposed to improve ECG-based detection of left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH), but external validation data are limited and their diagnostic performances in different conditions leading to LVH are not extensively assessed.
to assess the robustness and limitations of ECG scores across distinct LVH phenotypes.
The LVH-MORE registry included 408 patients across four cohorts: HTN (n = 103), HCM (n = 104), sAS (n = 101), and controls (n = 100). LVH was defined by echocardiographic left ventricular mass index (LVMi) >115 g/m2 in male subjects and >95 g/m2 in female subjects. Ten ECG criteria were calculated, including Peguero-Lo Presti, Sokolow-Lyon, Cornell, Perugia, Romhilt-Estes, and others. Diagnostic performance was assessed using ROC curves (AUC), sensitivity (Sn), specificity (Sp).
In the HTN cohort, Peguero-Lo Presti achieved the highest AUC for LVH detection (0.752 [95% CI: 0.616-0.888]), with Sn = 31% and Sp = 94%. Other scores showed similar or lower AUCs, with Perugia score showing higher sensitivity (54%). The highest specificity were reached by Sokolow-Lyon and Gubner-Ungerleider (100%). In the HCM cohort, all ECG scores showed modest diagnostic performance (AUC 0.529-0.628). The Perugia and Romhilt-Estes scores achieved the highest sensitivities (94% and 71%, respectively), whereas Sokolow-Lyon showed the highest specificity (90%). In the sAS cohort, AUCs ranged from 0.519 to 0.671. Sensitivity was higher for Perugia (66%) and Romhilt-Estes ≥4 (57%). Highest specificity was shown by Gubner-Ungerleider (95%).
No single ECG criterion provided consistent diagnostic accuracy across different causes of LVH. Voltage-only ECG scores performed better in HTN patients while multi-parametric scores showed relatively better performance in HCM and sAS."

This study aimed to assess the outcomes of TAVR compared with those of surgical aortic valve replacement (SAVR) and examine the impact of BAV type, aortopathy, excess leaflet calcification, and raphe calcification on BAV TAVR outcomes.
We searched PubMed/MEDLINE, Embase, and Cochrane Library for studies that assessed the outcomes of TAVR in the BAV population. We also included studies of patients with BAV undergoing TAVR and SAVR, and those assessing anatomical predictors of TAVR outcomes. Random-effects models were used to calculate the pooled risk ratios, mean differences, and hazard ratios.
Patients with BAV who underwent TAVR showed significantly lower risks of major bleeding and acute kidney injury, and shorter hospital stays than those who underwent SAVR. However, BAV TAVR had a higher pacemaker implantation rate. Among the BAV types, Type 0 showed a higher risk of coronary obstruction, whereas Type 1 had a lower risk of pacemaker implantation following BAV TAVR. Additionally, BAV TAVR had a higher risk of long-term mortality in patients with aortopathy (ascending aortic diameter >4.5 cm) and excessive leaflet calcification.
Compared with SAVR, TAVR in BAV is associated with favourable in-hospital outcomes. Anatomical features, such as BAV type, aortopathy, excess leaflet calcification, and calcified raphe, significantly influence the outcomes of TAVR in the BAV population."

Asia,"Biological age acceleration (BAA) is a promising aging surrogate, but its prognostic value in moderate to severe aortic valve stenosis (AVS) remains undetermined.
In this study, we sought to explore the association between BAA and all-cause mortality in patients with moderate to severe AVS.
A total of 559 patients were selected in the ARISTOTLE (Aortic Valve Diseases Risk Factor Assessment and Prognosis Model Construction) study. BAA was measured with the use of clinical biomarkers based on the KDM-BA and PhenoAge algorithms. Cox regression, restricted cubic spline (RCS) regression, and incremental predictive value analyses were used to evaluate the association between BAA and mortality.
Among 559 patients (mean age 64.80 years, 315 [56.4%] male), there were 153 cases (27.4%) of all-cause mortality during median 35.50 months of follow-up (range: 18.47-57.03 months). Kaplan-Meier curves revealed significantly elevated mortality in the highest quartile of BAA for both measures (KDM-BA: 38.8% [HR: 2.72; 95% CI: 1.73-4.29]; PhenoAge: 41.1% [HR: 3.26; 95% CI: 2.01-5.27]; both log-rank P < 0.0001). After fully adjusting for confounders, each SD increase in BAA was significantly associated with higher mortality (KDM-BA acceleration: HR: 1.36 [95% CI: 1.15-1.61]; PhenoAge acceleration: HR: 1.35 [95% CI: 1.17-1.56]). RCS regression revealed a significant linear BAA-mortality relationship. The addition of BAA into the basic model for all-cause mortality improved C-statistics (both P < 0.001), continuous-free net reclassification improvement value (both P = 0.013), and integrated discrimination improvement value (both P < 0.05).
Biomarker-derived BAA is independently associated with increased all-cause mortality in moderate to severe AVS patients, highlighting its potential as a prognostic indicator."

Asia,"Little information exists about national-based data on patients undergoing transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) in Asia and the associated costs.
This study aims to assess the baseline characteristics, procedural patterns, clinical outcomes, and cost expenses of patients with severe aortic stenosis who underwent TAVR in Korea.
We used the patient-level data from the National Health Insurance Review and Assessment Service registry, spanning from May 2015 to June 2021. The primary clinical outcome was all-cause mortality. Rehospitalization rates and procedural costs were also analyzed.
During the study period, 3,463 patients (mean age: 80.5 ± 5.9 years; 54.0% female) underwent TAVR at 39 hospitals in Korea. The annual number of TAVR procedures and the number of performing centers increased steadily. The proportion of low-risk patients (Society of Thoracic Surgeons Predicted Risk of Mortality ≤4%) was 41.7%. The transfemoral approach was conducted in 99.0% of cases, and the procedural success rate was 99.7%. All-cause mortality rates at 30 days, 2 years, and 5 years were 2.7% (95% CI: 2.1-3.2), 12.9% (95% CI: 11.8-14.0), and 19.5% (95% CI: 18.0-21.1), respectively. Rehospitalization related to cardiovascular causes occurred in 31.7% (95% CI: 29.3-34.1) at 2 years and 40.5% (95% CI: 34.1-46.9) at 5 years. The estimated mean index cost per patient was $32,173 ± $7,552, with 83.2% attributed to material expenses.
The number of TAVR recipients and performing centers in Korea has substantially increased over time. The procedural and survival outcomes were favorable. The overall medical costs for TAVR procedures are still substantial, mainly driven by device costs."

Asia,"Transcatheter aortic valve replacement is a promising alternative treatment for patients with severe aortic stenosis (AS), but uncertainties remain regarding its long-term durability.
This study aimed to evaluate the safety and feasibility of Sikelia transcatheter heart valve with polymeric leaflets in AS.
In this first-in-human, prospective, nonrandomized, single-arm, multicenter study, patients with severe symptomatic AS eligible for the novel valve were recruited. Clinical outcomes and hemodynamic performance were reported at discharge and 30-day, 6-month, and 1-year follow-up.
Twelve patients (73.75 ± 7.28 years, 25% female, mean Society of Thoracic Surgeons score 4.51% [4.07%-4.87%], 66.67% bicuspid valve) were enrolled. Procedural success was achieved in 83.33% (1 fully device retrieval and 1 death due to coronary obstruction). All patients successfully underwent transcatheter aortic valve replacement were in NYHA functional class I/II at the 30-day follow-up, and significant improvement was shown in 6-minute walk distance and Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire score (all P < 0.001). At 1 year, the effective orifice area (2.31 ± 0.33 cm2 vs 0.82 ± 0.14 cm2) and mean pressure gradient (6.33 ± 2.54 mm Hg vs 47.50 ± 13.82 mm Hg) improved substantially, so did those in bicuspid patients (all P < 0.001). No moderate/severe paravalvular leakage was recorded, and computed tomography scans revealed no evidence of subclinical leaflet thrombosis during follow-up. After discharge, no patients reported death, stroke, new pacemakers, or valve-related reintervention.
The preliminary outcomes of the novel transcatheter heart valve demonstrated a favorable hemodynamic performance with an acceptable safety profile at 1 year. Long-term follow-up is warranted to assess its durability in treating patients with AS."

The onset of diabetes mellitus has been reported to precede cardiovascular complications including cardiomyopathy, aortic stenosis, cardiac hypertrophy and hypertension. In addition to metabolic derangements, chronic medications such as HIV-antiretrovirals have also been associated with the risk factors of CVDs such as insulin resistance, dyslipidaemia, inflammation and oxidative stress and impaired glucose tolerance. Previous ART regimens have been associated with systemic insulin resistance and ectopic fat accumulation, leading to impaired glucose tolerance. The underlying molecular mechanisms behind the development of diabetic cardiomyopathies in persons chronically taking HIV-antiretrovirals remains unclear. Prediabetes is a condition of impaired glucose tolerance that is associated with low-grade inflammation and oxidative stress, which are precursors of CVDs. The link between chronic HIV-antiretroviral medication and prediabetes remains elusive. However, the increase in dispensation of HIV-antiretroviral medications has been associated with an increase in cases of prediabetes and diabetes, which could contribute to the development of CVDs. Hence, this review aims to provide insight into how the use of ARVs interacts with glucose metabolism and cardiovascular disease risk factors in patients on chronic HIV antiretrovirals."

In this scoping review, we critically appraised the literature on IgG4-related CAI, aiming to explore clinical, radiological and histopathological characteristics as well as treatment strategies and prognosis.
A comprehensive search was performed on January 02, 2025 in PubMed® to identify studies describing individuals with IgG4-related CAI, including both coronaritis (true arteritis of the coronary vessel wall) and periarteritis (peri-coronary involvement), and considering case reports, case series, retrospective cohort studies and observational studies. Two reviewers independently conducted the revision of literature under the guidance of the methodologist to identify eligible studies. Data extraction included clinical presentation, imaging findings, histopathology, treatment, and outcomes. Given the heterogeneity of the studies, descriptive statistical analysis was used whenever possible to summarise the data.
Out of 964 screened references, 143 articles met the above-mentioned inclusion criteria. Most CAI cases were included in case reports (90.2 %), 7 % in case series and 2.8 % in retrospective cohort studies or observational studies. CAI predominantly affected males in the sixth decade of life and frequently coexisted with aortic and large vessel involvement. All segments of the coronary arterial tree could be involved, even the smallest branches. Images detected by various methods revealed several types of lesions: stenosis, wall-thickening, aneurysm, ectasia, pseudotumor, pseudoaneurysm, dissection, and soft tissue masses. Increase serum IgG4 levels and increased inflammatory markers were reported. Histopathology was consistent with IgG4-RD in all coronary samples obtained. Glucocorticoid therapy, alone or combined with immunosuppressants and/or surgical interventions, was the most commonly reported treatment. Rituximab seemed to be an effective therapy for IgG4-related CAI even without associated glucocorticoids. Despite treatment, relapse and progression of coronary lesions were noted in some cases.
Early identification and multidisciplinary management og IgG4-related CAI are crucial to reduce morbidity and mortality. Available data on the response to various treatments are limited, as dedicated coronary artery imaging was not consistently obtained soon enough after treatment to assess response. In addition, long-term follow-up was not available for all patients. Further studies are required to understand the real prevalence, natural history, optimal diagnostic strategies, and therapeutic approaches for this serious condition."

This study evaluated the early safety and performance of the new Myval Octacor Transcatheter Heart Valve (THV) (Meril Life Sciences), for which limited clinical data exist.
The authors retrospectively analyzed 43 consecutive patients with severe AS who underwent TAVI using the Myval Octacor THV at a tertiary cardiac center. Primary outcomes included all-cause mortality, stroke, major vascular complications, conduction abnormalities, new pacemaker implantation, paravalvular leak, and valve failure at 30 days follow-up.
The median age was 81 years (IQR: 7), and 22 patients (51.2%) were female. Coronary artery disease was present in 24 (55.8%). Technical success rate was 100%. Mean pressure gradient decreased significantly post-procedure (55 mm Hg [IQR: 24] vs 5 mm Hg [IQR: 2]; P ≤ .001). No in-hospital deaths occurred. Two patients (4.7%) received permanent pacemakers during hospitalization, and 3 (7.0%) required pacemakers within a week because of conduction issues. Two patients (4.7%) experienced Bleeding Academic Research Consortium Type 3a bleeding. At 30 days, 42 patients remained in follow-up (98%), with 55% improved to New York Heart Association Class I. No vascular complications, stroke, acute kidney injury, valve thrombosis, or endocarditis occurred. One patient had valve failure from a significant paravalvular leak and 1 noncardiac death occurred 2 weeks post-discharge.
Early outcomes suggest that the Myval Octacor THV is a safe and effective option for TAVI in severe AS; however, larger studies with longer follow-up are required."

This study aimed to evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of fetal echocardiography (FE) and its ability to predict the postnatal surgical plan in fetuses with D-TGA or DORV-SPV.
This was a single-center retrospective cohort study of fetuses with D-TGA or DORV-SPV who were liveborn, had a recorded plan for postnatal intervention and were managed at Lucile Packard Children's Hospital, Palo Alto, CA, USA, between January 2013 and January 2024. In cases with serial FE examinations, all available FE reports were included in the analysis, in addition to the first postnatal echocardiogram report. For echocardiograms with incomplete measurement data, a single reader retrospectively obtained FE and postnatal echocardiogram measurements while blinded to clinical outcomes. Prenatal predictions for postnatal surgical repair were extracted from the fetal cardiology consultation notes and postnatal clinical data were obtained by chart review. Final FE and postnatal echocardiogram diagnoses, as well as prenatal surgical-plan predictions and subsequent postnatal surgical repairs performed, were compared and the percentage concordance was calculated to obtain FE diagnostic accuracy. Receiver-operating-characteristics (ROC) curves were generated to evaluate the association of FE aortic and pulmonary measurements with postnatal CoA repair.
The study included 99 fetuses, of which 45 were diagnosed postnatally with simple D-TGA with no associated lesions (i.e. D-TGA with intact ventricular septum), 38 with complex D-TGA with associated lesions and 15 with DORV, and one neonate was diagnosed prenatally with DORV-SPV but postnatally diagnosed with truncus arteriosus. In the majority (65%) of patients, serial FE was performed. The percentage concordance between fetal and postnatal echocardiogram diagnoses was high for simple D-TGA (95% (42/44)) and D-TGA with VSD and PS (100% (3/3)). The concordance was progressively lower for diagnoses of D-TGA with VSD (93% (25/27)), DORV-SPV (60% (3/5)), DORV-SPV with CoA (40% (4/10)), D-TGA with VSD and CoA (29% (2/7)), D-TGA with isolated CoA (0% (0/2)) and DORV-SPV with PS (0% (0/1)). Similarly, surgical-plan accuracy between prenatal prediction and postnatal repair performed was highest for cases of simple D-TGA and D-TGA with VSD and PS, while it was lower for other diagnoses. Qualitative descriptions of VSD size changed frequently over serial FE examinations, with VSDs generally described as larger on later FE. However, between the final FE and postnatal echocardiogram, in those with discordance, the description of VSD size usually became smaller. Only 50% of small VSDs identified on postnatal echocardiography required repair. All patients who underwent postnatal repair of CoA had a VSD present. All area under the ROC curve values for aortic measurements and for ratios of aortic-to-pulmonary dimensions in predicting the need for postnatal CoA repair were greater than 0.9.
Challenges remain in the accurate diagnosis and prediction of the postnatal surgical plan in fetuses with complex D-TGA and DORV-SPV. The assessment of qualitative VSD size description changed frequently over serial FE evaluations, and between final FE and postnatal echocardiogram, with small defects often not requiring repair. Aortic and aortic-to-pulmonary ratio measurements in fetuses with D-TGA or DORV-SPV appear to have improved the discriminatory ability in identifying cases that undergo postnatal CoA repair relative to fetuses with isolated CoA. © 2026 International Society of Ultrasound in Obstetrics and Gynecology."

FoCUS can be applied in stroke assessments performed by stroke neurologists when a cardioembolic stroke is suspected.
An international multicenter, prospective validation study was conducted to assess neurologists' ability to perform FoCUS. The FoCUS examination was defined as a simplified 2D transthoracic echocardiography. Neurologists and cardiologists performed the FoCUS independently and blinded. A twenty-question test evaluated neurologists' ability to recognize sources of cardioembolic stroke from recorded FoCUS studies.
A total of 432 paired studies involving 216 patients were conducted across 11 centers. No significant differences were found between neurologists and cardiologists in detecting: Left Ventricle (LV) dysfunction (7.4% vs 7.9%, p = 0.834), LV dilation (2.8% vs 2.3%, p = 0.766), VC collapsibility (7.2% vs 9.1%, p = 0.501), Right Ventricle dysfunction (0.9% vs 0.9%, p = 0.999), and pericardial effusion (0.5% vs 1.9%, p = 0.212). Cohen Kappa showed substantial agreement for LV dysfunction (0.640), moderate for LV dilation (0.589), and fair for VC collapsibility (0.226). Neurologists demonstrated 93.82% sensitivity and 92.92% specificity for detecting embolic sources. Success rate for LV akinesia was 88% (16/18), LV dysfunction 83% (15/18), complex aortic plaque 88% (16/18), and mitral stenosis 55% (10/18).
Properly trained neurologists can reliably perform FoCUS, particularly for assessing LV function and dilation, with better results in patients with favorable echocardiographic windows. While VC assessment requires further training, neurologists demonstrated high accuracy in identifying cardioembolic sources (over 90% of cases correctly identified). This study supports implementing standardized FoCUS training for neurologists through collaboration with cardiology specialists to enhance stroke diagnostics and management."

The prognostic relevance of AI-enabled electrocardiography-derived diastolic dysfunction (DD) in patients undergoing transcatheter aortic valve replacement had not been assessed.
We analyzed 3197 patients undergoing transcatheter aortic valve replacement for severe aortic stenosis between 2010 and 2023 with baseline 12-lead ECGs processed by a validated AI model to classify diastolic function (grades 0-3). Multivariable Cox models and nested model comparisons assessed associations with all-cause mortality, including a prespecified analysis in patients with indeterminate echocardiographic grading. Trajectories were defined by change in AI-enabled electrocardiography DD grade (<2 versus ≥2) from baseline to 30-day or 1-year follow-up.
At baseline, 21% had grade 3, 57% had grade 2, 8% had grade 1, and 14% had grade 0 AI-enabled electrocardiography DD. Higher grades were associated with adverse cardiac remodeling and comorbidities. Over a median follow-up of 3.4 years, grade 3 AI-enabled electrocardiography DD independently predicted mortality (hazard ratio [HR], 1.80 [95% CI, 1.47-2.20]; P<0.001). AI-enabled electrocardiography DD improved prognostic discrimination beyond clinical and echocardiographic measures (ΔHarrell concordance statistic, 0.016; Δχ2=57; P<0.001). Among 1259 patients with indeterminate echocardiographic grading, AI-enabled electrocardiography added prognostic value (ΔHarrell concordance statistic, 0.02; Δχ2=13; P=0.006). Worsening or persistently high-risk trajectories were associated with increased mortality (HRs, 1.45-1.80; all P<0.05).
AI-enabled electrocardiography-derived DD independently predicts mortality after transcatheter aortic valve replacement, adds value beyond echocardiographic grading, and enables dynamic risk stratification through longitudinal tracking."

We hypothesized that computational flow simulation could identify adverse hemodynamic features associated with postfenestrated and branched endovascular aneurysm repair branch occlusion.
Patients undergoing 4-vessel fenestrated and branched endovascular aneurysm repair for Extent II to IV thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysms were retrospectively reviewed. Branches that occluded without identifiable kinking or stenosis on computed tomography were included, along with an equal cohort of anatomy-matched patent controls. Patient-specific pulsatile rigid-wall simulations were performed using SimVascular with individualized geometries and boundary conditions. Abnormal time-averaged wall shear stress (TAWSS) was defined as <10 or >70 dynes/cm2.
Nine patients (36 target vessels) experienced 10 branch occlusions. Postoperative pressure and flow did not differ significantly between occluded and patent renal or mesenteric branches. However, occluded renal and mesenteric branches demonstrated significantly larger postoperative areas of abnormal TAWSS compared with controls (renal: 14.5% versus 5.9%, P=0.003; mesenteric: 17.7% versus 9.9%, P=0.035). Logistic generalized estimating equation modeling showed abnormal TAWSS to be a significant predictor of renal branch occlusion (P=0.0085). Model estimates suggested occlusion probabilities of 1.1%, 31%, and 94% at 0%, 10%, and 20% abnormal TAWSS surface area, respectively. A cluster-bootstrapped receiver operating characteristic curve (area under the curve, 0.876) identified a >10.2% threshold that correctly classified 92% of renal occlusions. Abnormal TAWSS frequently localized to distal stent-artery interfaces.
Elevated abnormal TAWSS within stented renal branches is associated with subsequent branch occlusion after fenestrated and branched endovascular aneurysm repair. Computational flow simulation-derived TAWSS thresholds may help identify high-risk branches before failure, warranting prospective validation."

While male sex has been implicated as a risk factor for AVC, sex-specific differences, particularly among younger individuals in the general population, are not well characterised.
The Swedish CArdioPulmonary BioImage Study was used, comprising 30 154 individuals between 50 and 64 years, randomly selected from the general population. Study participants were part of a prospective cohort and underwent laboratory tests, clinical examinations, comprehensive questionnaires and cardiac CT. Cardiac CT was used for determining presence of AVC. Logistic regression analysis was performed to assess associations between traditional cardiovascular risk factors and AVC.
In total, 29 160 participants were included and AVC was found in 1291 men (9%) and 730 women (5%). Male sex was an independent predictor of AVC (OR 1.91; 95% CI 1.71 to 2.13). Characteristics associated with AVC were similar between the sexes. In the adjusted analyses, lipoprotein(a), hyperlipidaemia, hypertension and smoking were strongly associated with AVC, whereas low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, diabetes, glycated haemoglobin and estimated glomerular filtration rate showed no significant associations with AVC. Higher body mass index (BMI) was associated with AVC in men but not women.
Male sex was independently associated with AVC, and the prevalence of AVC was nearly twice as high in men as in women. Traditional cardiovascular risk factors, including lipoprotein(a), hyperlipidaemia, hypertension and smoking, were associated with AVC, with similar associations between sexes, except for BMI, which was associated with AVC in men but not in women."

This study evaluates long-term, real-world outcomes according to MDT-selected management strategy within routine clinical practice in this clinically important patient group.
We conducted a retrospective cohort study of all patients with severe AS discussed at a transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) MDT at a tertiary UK centre between January 2014 and December 2016. Patients were categorised as TAVI or non-TAVI (conservatively managed). Demographic, clinical and frailty data were collected, including Charlson Comorbidity Index, Clinical Frailty Scale (CFS) and number of prescribed medications. Survival was analysed using Kaplan-Meier estimates and Cox proportional hazards modelling adjusted for age, sex, frailty, comorbidity burden and medication count.
A total of 373 patients were included (TAVI=178; non-TAVI=195). Patients undergoing TAVI were younger (81.3 years vs 83.5 years; p=0.01) and less frail (CFS 3.9 vs 4.9; p<0.01). Survival at 1 year, 2 years and 5 years was significantly higher following TAVI (87.6%, 74.7%, 44.9%) compared with conservative management (60.8%, 44.2%, 12.1%; p<0.001). Median survival was 53 months after TAVI versus 20 months without intervention. On multivariable analysis, TAVI was independently associated with reduced mortality (HR 0.38, 95% CI 0.28 to 0.50; p<0.001).
In patients with severe AS discussed at MDT, TAVI was associated with a substantial and durable survival advantage compared with conservative management. These findings highlight the poor prognosis of untreated severe AS and support systematic inclusion of conservatively managed patients in interventional registries to better inform MDT deliberation and shared decision-making."

The primary outcome was to assess the clinical benefit of blood pressure control, and the secondary outcome was to assess renal growth.
Patients under 21 years of age with renovascular hypertension who underwent angioplasty and CBA were reviewed. Thirty patients (70% male; median age 7.5 years [IQR: 5.7 - 12.5]) underwent 35 treatment episodes. 57% had fibromuscular dysplasia (FMD), 23% had FMD + mid aortic syndrome (MAS), and 20% had neurofibromatosis type-1 ± MAS. Clinical and follow-up data were reviewed. Renal artery sizing was calculated from the diameter of the normal portion of the involved artery or the contralateral normal renal artery. In patients with persistent stenosis despite optimal sized balloon angioplasty, CBA was performed.
In total, 37 stenoses were targeted, 6 had prior balloon angioplasty in a separate treatment. Technical success (traversal of stenosis) rate was 89% (33/37). Angioplasty improvement (>30% stenosis improvement) rate was 94% (31/33). No significant relationship between technical failure, angiographic failure and stenosis location/length or syndrome. The AE rate was 16% (6/37), with two moderate (segmental and subsegmental thrombus) and two severe (pseudoaneurysm and arterial perforation). Clinical benefit rate at median follow-up of 59 months (IQR: 37 - 95) was 83% (25/30).
CBA offers a promising alternative for the management of resistant RAS, is technically feasible, and demonstrates clinical benefit. However, the observed AEs underscore the need for careful patient selection."

However, the extension of TAVI to younger, low-risk patients has raised important questions regarding the long-term outcomes, valve durability, and lifetime management strategies for these patients. This narrative review summarizes the current evidence from pivotal randomized trials and contemporary registries comparing TAVI and SAVR in young, low-risk patients, integrating the latest 2025 ESC/EACTS guidelines. While short-term outcomes and early recovery favor TAVI, SAVR remains associated with proven durability, lower rates of conduction disturbances, and a potential advantage in long-term outcomes as follow-up data extend beyond five years. Anatomical challenges such as bicuspid valves, coronary access, and patient-prosthesis mismatch further complicate the use of TAVI in this population. A ""SAVR-first"" lifetime management approach appears to provide greater procedural flexibility and a lower reintervention risk. Ultimately, the choice between TAVI and SAVR in young patients should be individualized through a multidisciplinary Heart Team process, balancing early procedural benefits with long-term durability and reintervention considerations. This review highlights the need for dedicated long-term data and patient-tailored strategies in the evolving management of aortic stenosis in young low-risk individuals."

We herein report the case of a 41-year-old woman with prosthetic valve dysfunction and severe LVOT obstruction due to pannus formation in whom a 12-mm sizer could not be passed. Redo aortic valve replacement with the combined Konno-Nicks procedure successfully enlarged the annulus and LVOT, enabling the implantation of a 4-size larger prosthesis based on intraoperative sizer measurements. Postoperative echocardiography and computed tomography confirmed effective valve enlargement and preserved valve function.
Combined anterior-posterior enlargement can be valuable for redo aortic valve replacement in patients with a small annulus and subvalvular stenosis to prevent prosthesis-patient mismatch.
The combined Konno-Nicks procedure can effectively relieve prosthetic valve dysfunction with severe subvalvular stenosis by enabling larger prosthesis implantation."

Cranial systemic hypertension with caudal systemic hypotension, left ventricular thickening with mild mitral and aortic regurgitation, and cardiogenic pulmonary edema were detected from initial diagnostic testing at the referral institution. A non-contrast-enhancing lesion involving the thoracic aorta along the ascending aorta, aortic arch, isthmus, and proximal descending aorta causing near-complete occlusion of the aortic lumen was revealed from computed tomography imaging. Conservative management for congestive heart failure was instituted. Due to poor quality of life, the dog was euthanized. On autopsy, the cranial aorta was obstructed by a large chronic organizing thrombus with mild neutrophilic and lymphoplasmacytic aortic arteritis. The heart was enlarged with left ventricular concentric hypertrophy and myocardial fibrosis with secondary congestive heart failure. Renal necrosis and hepatocellular atrophy were presumed secondary to reduced perfusion and hypoxia. The underlying etiology of the thrombus and arteritis was unresolved. Similar pathologic findings have not been reported in dogs to the best of the authors' knowledge. Aortic thrombus should be considered as a differential for a mass-like occlusive lesion in the proximal aorta in the dog."

Current guidelines lack evidence-based recommendations for optimal postprocedural antithrombotic strategies, leading to heterogeneous clinical practices. And there are no randomized controlled trials (RCTs) available to compare different antithrombotic strategies following TEER.
STAR-TEER trial is an investigator-initiated, multicenter, randomized, parallel controlled, open-label trial, aiming to assess the safety and efficacy of de-escalated antithrombotic strategies with monotherapy in post-TEER patients with or without indications for oral anticoagulation (OAC) respectively. This trial plans to enroll 1,912 patients stratified into two cohorts: patients in Cohort A (requiring long-term OAC, n = 880) will be randomized 1:1 to rivaroxaban monotherapy or rivaroxaban plus clopidogrel, and patients in Cohort B (no OAC indication, n = 1,032) will be randomized 1:1 to aspirin monotherapy or aspirin plus clopidogrel. The primary outcome is all bleeding complications within 12 months post-TEER. The two key secondary outcomes are non-procedure-related bleeding within 12 months post-TEER (key secondary outcome 1) and a composite of ischemic events including all-cause mortality, stroke, systemic embolism, and myocardial infarction within 12 months post-TEER (key secondary outcome 2). A hierarchical hypothesis testing will be performed, with the primary outcome and key secondary outcome 1 tested for superiority, followed by the key secondary outcome 2 tested for noninferiority.
The STAR-TEER trial is the first large RCT to stratify patients based on OAC indication and compare different antithrombotic strategies following TEER in these two distinct cohorts."

We aimed to describe long-term outcomes after mitral valve repair in children and to identify echocardiographic predictors of mitral valve reintervention.
We retrospectively reviewed all consecutive patients younger than 18 years who underwent mitral valve repair between 2000 and 2024 at a single tertiary centre. Patients with atrioventricular septal defects or single-ventricle physiology were excluded. Preoperative and predischarge echocardiography assessed mitral regurgitation grade and mean transmitral gradient. Clinical and echocardiographic follow-up data were reviewed and analysed. Reintervention was analysed using competing-risk methods including postoperative mean transmitral gradient and residual mitral regurgitation at discharge.
A total of 112 children were included (age range 5 days-17 years; body weight 2.3-100 kg). Operative mortality was 0.9% (n = 1), late mortality 3.6% (n = 4), and one patient underwent heart transplantation. The cumulative incidence of mitral valve reintervention was 27.5%, 32.9%, 46.6% and 46.6% at 5, 10, 15 and 20 years, respectively. In the Fine and Gray model, higher postoperative mean transmitral gradient was associated with an increased cumulative incidence of reintervention (subdistribution hazard ratio 1.26 per 1 mmHg, 95% confidence interval 1.16-1.38; p < 0.001), whereas moderate-or-greater residual mitral regurgitation at discharge was not significantly associated (subdistribution hazard ratio 0.54, 95% confidence interval 0.25-1.17; p = 0.12). Death and/or heart transplantation events were rare during follow-up.
In this paediatric cohort, mitral valve repair was associated with low operative mortality and satisfactory long-term survival, but reintervention represented the main late risk. Higher postoperative mean transmitral gradient was associated with reduced valve durability, whereas moderate-or-greater residual regurgitation was not independently associated. These findings support efforts to minimise postoperative transmitral gradients when feasible, while individualising the balance between residual stenosis and regurgitation according to valve pathology and repair complexity."

Cardiovascular imaging,"Current guidelines for degenerative mitral regurgitation (MR) emphasize left ventricular (LV) dysfunction. However, subclinical alterations in left atrial (LA) or LV strain may manifest earlier in severe MR.
This study sought to determine whether combined LA and LV strain measurements improve long-term mortality prediction in severe degenerative MR, especially in asymptomatic individuals.
This retrospective derivation cohort included 1,314 patients (mean age: 55 ± 13 years; 35% women) who underwent valve repair or replacement for severe MR. Preoperative peak atrial longitudinal strain (PALS) and LV-global longitudinal strain (GLS) were measured. Patients were categorized into 4 groups by using spline-derived thresholds (PALS: <21.4%; LV-GLS: >-20.5%). The primary outcome was all-cause mortality (median follow-up, 8.4 years). External validation included 605 independent patients.
Impaired PALS (adjusted HR [aHR]: 2.11; P < 0.001) and impaired LV-GLS (aHR: 1.66; P = 0.008) were independently associated with high mortality. The group with both impaired PALS and LV-GLS demonstrated the worst outcome (aHR: 2.50; P < 0.001). In asymptomatic patients (n = 900), the combined use of both strain parameters outperformed traditional LV dysfunction criteria (LV ejection fraction ≤60% or LV end-systolic dimension ≥40 mm), thereby significantly improving net reclassification (net reclassification index = 0.436; P < 0.001) and discrimination (integrated discrimination improvement = 0.024; P = 0.003). Subgroup analyses demonstrated that the prognostic contribution of each strain parameter varied by the functional status of the other chamber. External validation confirmed these associations.
Concomitant impairment of both PALS and LV-GLS identified patients at the highest mortality risk. These findings support an integrated atrial-ventricular strain assessment to improve prognostic stratification, particularly in asymptomatic patients with severe degenerative MR who are undergoing MV surgery."

This prospective study aimed to develop a novel end-to-end deep learning model for preoperative artificial intelligence assessment in transcatheter edge-to-edge mitral valve repair (TEERAI-pre) candidates using multiview, multimodal echocardiography.
TEERAI-pre, a video vision transformer-based classification model, predicts morphological suitability for transcatheter edge-to-edge mitral valve repair from multiview, multimodal echocardiography. A transformer-based feature-level fusion module was designed in TEERAI-pre to integrate multiview, multimodal features for final prediction. An internal data set of 633 patients (7997 transthoracic echocardiographic videos; 766 pulsed-wave Doppler images) was split for 5-fold cross-validation. An external data set of 150 patients (1735 transthoracic echocardiographic videos; 169 pulsed-wave Doppler images) across 2 hospitals evaluated generalizability. Reference standards were provided by 2 experienced valvular cardiologists per international guidelines.
On the internal data set, TEERAI-pre achieved 75.0% accuracy (95% CI, 71.7%-78.4%) for classifying red (unsuitable), yellow (challenging), and green (ideal) zones, with 77.1% precision, 75.5% recall, and 76.2% F1 score. External validation yielded 73.3% accuracy, 74.0% precision, and 74.0% recall. Multiview multimodal integration improved performance. Binary classification (red versus green) showed TEERAI-pre matched senior experts and outperformed intermediate/junior echocardiologists. Feature-level fusion outperformed output-level fusion and single-view model. Backbone selection and calibration analysis confirmed robust performance.
TEERAI-pre demonstrates strong performance in transcatheter edge-to-edge mitral valve repair preoperative assessment using transthoracic echocardiographic videos and images, supporting more accurate patient selection and enhancing clinical workflow efficiency.

The occurrence of RHF and tricuspid regurgitation represents a critical indicator of hospitalization rates and all-cause mortality. However, RHF has remained understudied, specifically with respect to the tricuspid valve.
Using the outbred sheep (Ovis aries) model of pulmonary artery banding that induces RHF and tricuspid regurgitation, we generated 3 batches of RNA sequencing for 354 samples containing right ventricle, left ventricle, each tricuspid and mitral valve leaflet, and the pulmonary artery representing both male and female sheep. The reads were assembled into a de novo sheep heart transcriptome for differential analysis.
The de novo sheep heart transcriptome enhanced transcript mapping of reads by 43% to 45% in the heart valves relative to the reference transcriptome. Identified transcripts produce validated tissue-specific pathways in ventricles (2756 isoforms), pulmonary arteries (535 isoforms), and valves (1215 isoforms), with transcript differences between the mitral and tricuspid valve involved in extracellular and endocrine signaling. Pulmonary artery banding resulted in the most significant transcriptional changes in the tricuspid valve with alterations in endocrine and immune pathway genes.
This project highlights the complexity of heart valve tissues and their transcriptional activity in a sheep model of RHF. It suggests potential therapeutic interventions in heart valve remodeling in pulmonary artery hypertension, RHF, and tricuspid regurgitation. This work highlights the need for further human and model organism research into the dynamic valve cells and genes."

Despite its prevalence, it remains significantly underdiagnosed clinically. Surgical management of obstructive HCM has advanced extensively, particularly in understanding the mitral valve's contribution to left ventricular outflow tract obstruction (LVOTO). Historically, LVOTO was attributed mainly to septal hypertrophy and treated through isolated septal myectomy. However, contemporary insights highlight the importance of mitral leaflet elongation and abnormal papillary muscle dynamics in this pathology. Mitral leaflet shortening, either through horizontal plication or direct excision (ReLex), alongside the release of abnormal papillary muscle attachments, has emerged as a complementary strategy to standard septal myectomy. These combined approaches have demonstrated improved surgical outcomes, including reduced mitral regurgitation, alleviation of LVOTO, and excellent mid-term survival. This review synthesizes current evidence and clinical experiences, providing insights into mitral leaflet shortening's role and the comprehensive surgical strategies for managing obstructive HCM.

In Ukraine, the estimated burden is approximately 75,000 patients, although national data remain limited. Since 2016, the Amosov National Institute of Cardiovascular Surgery in Kyiv has been a leading center for HOCM surgery, primarily performing septal myectomy (SM) with concomitant mitral valve (MV) repair. This review summarizes the evolution of the Institute's surgical program, outcomes, and challenges faced under extraordinary circumstances.
Institutional experience with SM and MV repair between 2016 and 2025 was reviewed. Preoperative evaluation included transthoracic echocardiography (TTE), cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) imaging, and/or computed tomography (CT). A refined transaortic SM technique was applied to optimize septal resection, relieve left ventricular outflow tract (LVOT) obstruction, and address dynamic mitral regurgitation (MR).
SM consistently reduced LVOT gradients and eliminated MR in the majority of patients. In-hospital mortality remained below 1%, with a low incidence of major complications directly attributable to myectomy. Despite significant external pressures, including the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic and the ongoing full-scale war in Ukraine, surgical activity continued without interruption. Innovations in operative techniques and perioperative management further enhanced safety and outcomes.
The Amosov Institute has established a high-performing national program for HOCM surgery, demonstrating durable results despite unprecedented challenges. Ongoing refinement of minimally invasive strategies and strengthened international collaboration remain essential to address the global shortage of experienced myectomy surgeons and ensure wider access to advanced surgical care.

The operation addresses septal hypertrophy and dynamic systolic anterior motion-mediated mitral valve (MV) regurgitation. Most patients require only isolated septectomy, and adjunctive MV procedures are reserved for patients with additional intrinsic MV pathology. Institutional volume strongly correlates with outcomes of transaortic septal myectomy; centers performing fewer than one myectomy annually have significantly higher rates of MV replacement and complications compared to high-volume institutions. Septal myectomy restores life expectancy to levels comparable with age- and sex-matched populations, and often exceeds outcomes seen with alcohol septal ablation, particularly in patients with marked hypertrophy or complex anatomy. Although novel pharmacologic therapies are emerging, surgical myectomy remains the gold-standard therapy for patients with refractory symptoms due to dynamic LVOT obstruction. Continued refinement of techniques and patient selection has solidified its role as one of the safest and most effective open-heart operations available."

Cardiovascular Imaging,"Mitral valve edge-to-edge repair (M-TEER) is increasingly being used for the treatment of severe mitral regurgitation, however outcomes in inoperable patients with very complex or even unfavorable mitral valve (MV) disease as ""ultima ratio""are unknown. The study aimed to evaluate patient outcomes according to mitral valve anatomical complexity, as recently suggested in a recent review article stratified by MR etiology.
In this single-center, retrospective analysis, consecutive patients who underwent M-TEER were categorized as ""Non-Complex"" (NC), ""Complex"" (C), ""Very Complex"" (VC) and ""Ultimately Complex"" (UC) M-TEER procedures. Study endpoints were MR reduction, symptomatic improvement as expressed by changes in New York Heart Association (NYHA) functional class and two-year survival. The study included 789 consecutive patients at a mean age of 74.9 ±11.1 years (42.7% female; 49% with secondary and 51% with primary or mixed MV disease). 203 patients (25.7%), 409 patients (51.8%), 138 patients (17.5%), and 39 patients (4.9%) were classified as NC, C, VC, UC, respectively. Improvement to NYHA functional class ≤II and two-year survival rates were comparable across anatomical complexity groups (NYHA≤II: 68.4%, 61.8%, 63.5%, 75.0%, p=0.454; survival: 64.6%, 71.2%, 68.0%, 71.0%; p=0.454; for NC, C, VC, UC, respectively). MR reduction was observed in all categories and it was comparable in secondary MV disease, while increasing MV complexity was associated with an increasing prevalence residual MR ≥3+ in primary MV disease (7.9%, 8.3%, 10.9%, 23.0% for NC, C, VC, UC, respectively; p=0.002).
This study provides the first large-scale validation of a recently proposed mitral valve complexity framework. Anatomical complexity showed an etiology-specific impact, with no relevant effect on MR reduction or clinical outcomes in SMR, but increasing residual MR in primary disease. Given an acceptable rate of MR reduction, M-TEER can even be considered in selected patients with unfavorable MV anatomy as ""ultima ratio""."

Cardiovascular interventions,"Large V waves on pulmonary capillary wedge pressure tracings are common in patients with severe mitral regurgitation (MR) and typically decrease after transcatheter mitral valve therapy (TMVT). A persistently elevated V wave despite MR resolution may reflect impaired left atrial (LA) compliance.
The aim of this study was to identify noninvasive predictors of invasive LA compliance and V-wave response in patients undergoing TMVT.
Patients who underwent transcatheter edge-to-edge repair or valve-in-valve transcatheter mitral valve replacement between 2019 and 2023 at the Cleveland Clinic were retrospectively analyzed. Patients were classified as having a compliant LA if their baseline LA mean pressure was ≤12 mm Hg with severe MR or if the V wave decreased by ≥50% after MR resolution following TMVT; all other patients were classified as noncompliant.
Two hundred fifty-five patients were included, of whom 107 (42%) had a compliant LA and 148 (58%) had a noncompliant LA. Noncompliant patients had more atrial fibrillation (AF) or atrial flutter, prior AF intervention or LA appendage (LAA) ligation, and prior cardiac surgery. They also had lower LA reservoir strain and worse left ventricular global longitudinal strain. On multivariable analysis, low LA reservoir strain (OR: 0.89; 95% CI: 0.83-0.95; P = 0.001) and prior AF intervention or LAA ligation (OR: 4.27; 95% CI: 1.43-12.72; P = 0.009) significantly predicted low invasive LA compliance. Low LA compliance was significantly associated with increased composite outcome of heart failure hospitalization and mortality at 1 year.
Low LA strain and prior AF intervention or LAA ligation may predict low invasive LA compliance and limited V-wave reduction after TMVT. LA compliance may explain hemodynamic and clinical responses to mitral valve therapies."

Cardiovascular interventions,"Right ventricular (RV)-pulmonary arterial (PA) coupling, a measure of RV function in relation to pulmonary afterload, has emerged as a promising prognostic marker in critically ill patients and can be readily assessed using echocardiography.
The aim of this study was to evaluate the prognostic significance of RV-PA coupling in patients presenting with ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) undergoing primary percutaneous coronary intervention.
This post hoc analysis of a retrospective study analyzed 973 STEMI patients (derivation and validation cohorts) undergoing primary percutaneous coronary intervention between 2014 and 2023 (median follow-up duration 4.2 years; Q1-Q3: 2.1-6.7 years). RV-PA uncoupling was assessed using echocardiography via the ratio of tricuspid annular plane systolic excursion (TAPSE) to systolic pulmonary artery pressure (sPAP). Using maximally selected log-rank statistics, a cutoff of 0.405 mm/mm Hg for TAPSE/sPAP ratio was identified, effectively stratifying patients into high- and low-risk groups.
As confirmed in an external validation cohort, patients with RV-PA uncoupling showed significantly higher 1-year all-cause mortality compared with those with preserved RV-PA coupling (33.30% [95% CI: 4.65%-53.40%] vs 3.04% [95% CI: 1.40%-4.65%]; HR for 1-year mortality: 12.60; 95% CI: 4.49-35.40; P < 0.001). TAPSE/sPAP ratio outperformed TAPSE alone in predicting 1-year mortality, as demonstrated by receiver-operating characteristic curve analysis (area under the curve: 0.732 [95% CI: 0.643-0.821] vs 0.643 [95% CI: 0.537-0.732]; P = 0.018). Multivariate analysis confirmed that RV-PA uncoupling independently predicted 1-year mortality.
This study highlights the importance of hemodynamic equilibrium between the RV and pulmonary circulation in STEMI patients. RV-PA uncoupling (TAPSE/sPAP ratio < 0.405 mm/mm Hg) is an independent predictor of 1-year all-cause mortality in these patients, aiding in early risk stratification."

Case reports,"Caseous calcification of the mitral annulus (CCMA) fistulizing into the aortic root has not been described.
A 66-year-old man with severe regurgitation from mitral valve prolapse presented with a calcified mass extending from the anterolateral trigone of the mitral valve to the anterolateral papillary muscle. Multimodality imaging revealed a pseudoaneurysm in the anterolateral trigone communicating with the aortic root without aortic valve dysfunction. A 3-dimensional (3D) printed model delineated anatomy and supported valve repair, fistula closure, and aortic valve preservation.
This novel case of CCMA with pseudoaneurysm fistulizing into the aortic root demonstrated how multimodality imaging and 3D modeling facilitate valve-sparing repair.
Fistulization of CCMA into the aortic root is exceptionally rare. Multimodality imaging and 3D modeling enabled precise anatomic characterization, mitral valve repair, and closure of the fistulous tract. Advanced imaging can expand surgical options and support preservation of native valves in anatomically complex diseases."

Case reports,"Carcinoid heart disease (CHD) is a known complication of advanced functional neuroendocrine tumours (NETs), almost exclusively affecting right-sided cardiac valves. Left-sided involvement is rare and usually attributed to intracardiac shunting or pulmonary sources of serotonin. This case report highlights a rare presentation of CHD involving left- and right-sided valves in the absence of an anatomic shunt or bronchopulmonary NET.
A 67-year-old woman with a long-standing, functional, small bowel Grade 1 NET and metastatic liver and peritoneal disease presented with worsening dyspnoea and peripheral oedema. She had a 10-year disease history, previously managed with debulking surgery, somatostatin analogues, peptide receptor radionuclide therapy (PRRT), and everolimus. Echocardiography and cardiac magnetic resonance imaging demonstrated extensive left- and right-sided valvular involvement with severe mitral regurgitation, moderate aortic and pulmonic regurgitation, and mild tricuspid regurgitation, yet without intracardiac shunt. An elevated Qp/Qs ratio of 2.6 was attributed to severe left-sided valvular regurgitation. The patient improved on diuretic therapy and was referred for surgical evaluation of valve replacement prior to additional systemic treatment.
This case illustrates an atypical presentation of bilateral carcinoid valvulopathy in the absence of intracardiac shunting, likely due to overwhelming systemic serotonin from tumour burden. Although serotonin is typically inactivated in the lungs, extensive exposure may surpass this protective mechanism. The potential role of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors remains inconclusive. Multidisciplinary coordination is essential for optimizing cardiac and oncologic outcomes, especially when systemic therapy such as PRRT is considered. Left- and right-sided CHD may develop in patients with small bowel NETs even without anatomic shunting. High tumour burden and systemic serotonin exposure may override pulmonary inactivation, leading to left-sided involvement. Early recognition and multidisciplinary care are critical for effective management."

Despite cardiac clearance, potential KTRs still have structural and functional abnormalities. Identifying the prevalence of these abnormalities and understanding their predictors is vital for optimizing pre-transplant risk stratification and improving post-transplant outcomes.
To determine the prevalence of left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH), left ventricular systolic dysfunction (LVSD), diastolic dysfunction (DD), pulmonary hypertension (PH), and their predictors, and to assess their impact on graft function in pre-transplant candidates.
The study included all successful transplant candidates older than 14 who had a baseline echocardiogram. Binary logistic regression models were constructed to identify factors associated with LVH, LVSD, DD, and PH.
Out of 259 patients, LVH was present in 64% (166), 12% (31) had LVSD, 27.5% (71) had DD, and 66 (25.5%) had PH. Independent predictors of LVH included male gender [odds ratio (OR): 2.51; 95%CI: 1.17-5.41 P = 0.02], PH (OR = 2.07; 95%CI: 1.11-3.86; P = 0.02), DD (OR: 2.47; 95%CI: 1.29-4.73; P = 0.006), and dyslipidemia (OR = 1.94; 95%CI: 1.07-3.53; P = 0.03). Predictors for LVSD included patients with DD (OR = 3.3, 95% CI: 1.41-7.81; P = 0.006) and a family history of coronary artery disease (OR = 4.50, 95%CI: 1.33-15.20; P = 0.015). Peritoneal dialysis was an independent predictor for DD (OR = 10.03; 95%CI: 1.71-58.94, P = 0.011). The presence of LVH (OR = 3.32, 95%CI: 1.05-10.55, P = 0.04) and mild to moderate or moderate to severe mitral regurgitation (OR = 4.63, 95%CI: 1.45-14.78, P = 0.01) were significant factors associated with PH. These abnormalities had no significant impact on estimated glomerular filtration at discharge, 6 months, 1 year, or 2 years post-transplant.
Significant echocardiographic abnormalities persist in a potential transplant candidate despite cardiac clearance, although they don't affect future graft function. Understanding the risk factors associated with these abnormalities may help clinicians address these factors pre- and post-transplant to achieve better outcomes."

We present the first case of C. cynodegmi-associated infective endocarditis (IE) in a 39-year-old man with bicuspid aortic valve and alcohol use disorder. The patient presented with sepsis, aortic valve vegetations, and systemic complications, including heart failure and shock liver. Despite negative blood and valve cultures, metagenomic sequencing of plasma (Karius test) initially detected Capnocytophaga canimorsus, while targeted Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS) of explanted valve tissue confirmed C. cynodegmi (100% match). The patient underwent valve replacement and completed a 6-week course of ampicillin-sulbactam with clinical recovery. This case underscores the diagnostic challenges of fastidious pathogens and demonstrates the potential of C. cynodegmi to cause life-threatening IE. It highlights the necessity of advanced molecular diagnostics, such as NGS, in atypical cases of IE. Clinicians should consider zoonotic Capnocytophaga spp. in culture-negative IE, particularly in high-risk patients with animal exposure or valvular abnormalities."

Artificial intelligence (AI)-enabled stethoscopes offer robust performance characteristics in point-of-care detection of heart failure, atrial fibrillation, and valvular heart disease (VHD). We conducted a pragmatic, cluster-randomised controlled implementation trial to determine the real-world effect and implementation challenges of AI-stethoscopes.
UK primary care practices were cluster randomised 1:1 to intervention (training and implementation in use of AI-stethoscopes in routine care) or control (routine care). Given the nature of the intervention, masking of participants (practices, clinicians, and patients) was not feasible. During cardiac examinations, the AI stethoscope recorded 15 s of single-lead electrocardiogram and phonocardiogram signals for input to three AI algorithms that returned binary predictions for the presence or absence of reduced left ventricular ejection fraction (≤40%), atrial fibrillation, and VHD (all with regulatory approval). The primary endpoint was incidence of any newly coded diagnosis of heart failure (all subtypes), expressed per 1000 patient-years (incidence rate ratio [IRR]), derived from a UK National Health Service Secure Data Environment. A coprimary endpoint stratified detection of heart failure by place of diagnosis (community-based vs via hospital admission). Secondary endpoints included atrial fibrillation and VHD detection rates, performance characteristics of the AI-stethoscope, use rates, and clinician-reported implementation barriers and enablers.
Between Oct 30, 2023, and May 22, 2024, 205 practices were randomly assigned (96 to the intervention arm [701 933 registered patients] and 109 to the control arm [851 242 registered patients]). Intervention practices recorded 12 725 patient examinations with the AI-stethoscope, across 972 clinical users. Intention-to-treat analysis found heart failure detection did not differ between groups (IRR 0·94 [95% CI 0·86-1·02]); with no difference in community-based or hospital-based diagnoses (p>0·05).
Implementation of an AI stethoscope in routine primary care did not significantly increase detection of heart failure or increase community-based diagnosis after 12 months of implementation. AI stethoscope use was independently associated with significantly higher detection rates of heart failure, as well as atrial fibrillation and VHD. This randomised controlled implementation trial establishes a pragmatic design with randomisation that generates real-world data essential for understanding and overcoming the barriers to implementation of innovation in health care.

Its clinical relevance continues to expand as device technology and operator experience evolve.
This review provides an updated synthesis of currently available LAAC devices - including contemporary and emerging technologies - and summarizes comparative evidence from major trials and registries. A structured literature search was performed in PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science. Additional focus is dedicated to expanding clinical applications, including use in chronic kidney disease, persistent left atrial appendage thrombus, stroke despite anticoagulation, and combined procedures such as LAAC with atrial fibrillation ablation.
LAAC is entering a new phase in which its role may broaden beyond traditional indications, driven by improved safety, individualized antithrombotic strategies, and promising innovations such as dual‑seal and exclusion‑based devices. Future research will determine whether LAAC can transition from a selective therapy into a mainstream option for stroke prevention."

While the United States has recognized them since 1990 through the Humanitarian Use Device (HUD) and Humanitarian Device Exemption (HDE) framework, the European Union only introduced a non-binding definition in 2024 (MDCG 2024-10), revealing a deeper asymmetry: flexibility is codified in the US but interpreted in the EU.
We conducted a document-based policy analysis (1990-2025) and examined legislation, regulatory guidance, and academic literature to compare EU and US frameworks across evidentiary standards, access pathways, economic incentives, and reimbursement-post-market alignment. Three illustrative case studies (Berlin Heart EXCOR, Argus II, and the Medtronic Melody valve) were used to assess real-world consequences for access, sustainability, and patient continuity of care.
The EU's Medical Devices Regulation 2017/745 lacks a legal orphan-device designation, dedicated incentives, or a harmonized HTA framework. Access remains fragmented, and recertification under the MDR threatens supply continuity. The US HUD/HDE pathway codifies flexibility through a ""probable benefit"" standard under IRB supervision and an annual distribution cap, though financial sustainability remains limited by profit restrictions and inconsistent reimbursement. Case comparisons reveal: (i) earlier EU access without post-market safeguards (Argus II); (ii) US capacity to transition from humanitarian to full approval when incentives align (Melody); and (iii) vulnerability of SMEs to compliance costs (EXCOR).
Addressing this policy vacuum requires an inflection point equivalent to the 1983 Orphan Drug Act, one that redefines how innovation for the few is valued. Five policy pillars emerge: a legal designation, adaptive evidentiary pathways, sustainable incentives (e.g., pooled procurement), integrated reimbursement mechanisms, and mandatory continuity-of-access or ""exit-insurance"" schemes. Without such reform, essential technologies for rare diseases will remain trapped between regulatory rigidity and market abandonment. This policy paper highlights structural regulatory gaps and proposes actionable reforms to ensure equitable access to orphan medical devices."

This retrospective cohort study was conducted at Fernandez Hospital, a tertiary care referral center in Hyderabad, India, utilizing clinical data from pregnancies managed between January 2011 and December 2023. The primary outcome was the development of composite adverse cardiac events. Discriminative ability was assessed using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), calibration was evaluated via calibration plots, and clinical utility was determined by decision curve analysis (DCA). Categorical variables were reported as frequencies and percentages and continuous variables were presented as means with standard deviations or medians with interquartile ranges. Individual risk assessment was conducted using both the CARPREG II and DEVI risk stratification models, while the ZAHARA score was calculated by aggregating weighted parameters according to established scoring criteria.
The study enrolled 176 women and analyzed 205 pregnancies with adverse cardiac events in 19 pregnancies (9.3%). The DEVI score demonstrated superior discrimination (AUC = 0.846, 95% CI: 0.765-0.927, P < 0.001), followed by mWHO (AUC = 0.826, 95% CI: 0.736-0.917, P < 0.001), CARPREG II (AUC = 0.762, 95% CI: 0.652-0.872, P < 0.001), and ZAHARA (AUC = 0.716, 95% CI: 0.628-0.803, P < 0.001). Calibration plots revealed an overestimation of risk at higher probabilities for DEVI and CARPREG II. DCA indicated net clinical benefit for both tools at 10-30% threshold probabilities.
The DEVI score showed the highest discriminative performance, though its calibration and clinical utility were comparable to CARPREG II. These findings support its use for risk stratification in pregnant women with VHD, particularly in resource-limited settings where rheumatic VHD predominates."

Despite optimal medical management, many patients remain symptomatic. Bronchoscopic lung volume reduction (BLVR) techniques provide minimally invasive alternatives to surgery. This review summarizes the current role and future directions of advanced bronchoscopic therapies for emphysema.
Established BLVR approaches aim to induce atelectasis of diseased, hyperinflated lobes using endobronchial valves or thermal vapor ablation. Patient selection and clinical efficacy is critically influenced by emphysema distribution and the presence of collateral ventilation. To address these limitations, novel therapies are being developed. Sealants are under investigation as adjuncts to valve therapy to overcome collateral ventilation. Endobronchial coils mechanically re-tension the lung parenchyma, improving elastic recoil and airway patency. Airway stents and scaffolds are designed to facilitate expiratory flow by either bypassing or preventing closure of collapsible airways. These emerging modalities may extend treatment options to patients with homogeneous disease and those with significant collateral ventilation, groups traditionally with limited existing interventions.
Current BLVR therapies remain limited in homogeneous disease and collateral ventilation-positive patients. Research into novel treatments have shown promise in an expanding therapeutic landscape, though long-term safety, durability, and patient selection criteria require further study."

Globally, the prevalence of RA is increasing, affecting an estimated 17.6 million people worldwide. Emerging data implicate other environmental and occupational inhaled exposures apart from cigarette smoking as RA risk factors. Risk models integrating clinical, serological, and imaging data are useful in predicting the pre-RA to RA transition. Extra-articular manifestations and multimorbidity are key complications of RA that drive excess mortality and avoidable hospitalizations, though overall mortality trends in RA are improving. RA-associated interstitial lung disease is recognized to affect the lungs of early RA patients, and risk models based on clinical and advanced biomarker phenotyping have shown potential for risk stratification. Large cohort studies have identified heart failure and valvular heart disease as cardiovascular complications in RA, in addition to atherosclerosis. Observational studies continue to evaluate the safety of TNF inhibitors in the setting of cancer.
RA prevalence is rising globally, while mortality rates are declining. Continued investigation aimed at elucidating RA risk factors, the transition from pre-RA to RA, extra-articular involvement, and multimorbidity remains critical to optimize patient outcomes."

Consequently, genetic risk factors for AF may be associated with sick sinus syndrome (SSS). This study evaluated clinical, sociodemographic, laboratory and genetic factors in predicting the SSS incidence by using a polygenic risk score (PRS) for AF, given the absence of a dedicated PRS for SSS.
A total of 502 421 individuals aged 38-73 years across 22 centres from 2006 to 2010 were enrolled in the UK Biobank. After those with incomplete data, prior AF or valvular disease were excluded, 405 869 participants (median age 58.0 (IQR, 50.0-64.0) years; 213 684 (45.2%) male) were analysed. AF PRS categorised the participants into low (first quintile), intermediate (middle three quintiles) and high (fifth quintile) risks. SSS incidence was recorded, and associations were evaluated using Cox regression with sociodemographic, clinical, laboratory and genetic variables.
During the median follow-up of 11.9 years, 769 SSS events occurred. Their incidence increased with age (HR 1.52, 95% CI 1.43 to 1.62 per 5 years), male sex (HR 1.39, 95% CI 1.03 to 1.88), prior myocardial infarction (HR 1.54, 95% CI 1.08 to 2.21) and hypertension (HR 1.21, 95% CI 1.02 to 1.42). The high-PRS and intermediate-PRS groups were related to 82% (HR 1.82, 95% CI 1.45 to 2.29) and 32% (HR 1.32, 95% CI 1.07 to 1.62) higher SSS risks, respectively. Cystatin C (HR 1.71, 95% CI 1.33 to 2.22) was also associated with the increased risk. The model's C-index was 0.752 with sociodemographic and clinical variables, but it increased to 0.760 with genetic and biomarker data.
In addition to sociodemographic and clinical risk factors, AF PRS and cystatin C were linked to the SSS incidence. Although their inclusion modestly improved prediction, these findings highlighted the potential of integrating genetic and biomarker information for comprehensive SSS risk assessments."
PubMed,deep learning,Age-related differences in memory organization: How depth of processing and learning intention affect free recall and temporal contiguity.,Mariana Teles,10.1016/j.archger.2026.106157,2026-01-29,Archives of gerontology and geriatrics,"This exploratory study examined how depth of processing, intention to learn, and age interact to influence free recall performance and the temporal contiguity effect (TCE). A total of 119 participants, being 67 younger adults (M = 19.2 years) and 52 older adults (M = 73.9 years), completed free recall tasks that varied in levels of processing (no-orienting, shallow, deep) and learning intention (intentional vs. incidental). Given modest cell sizes (n = 10-17 per condition), findings should be considered exploratory and hypothesis-generating. Patterns suggest that deeper processing improves overall recall across age groups, while the organization of recall may differ with age and learning intention, though definitive conclusions about interactions require replication with larger samples. Intentional learning strengthened temporal organization compared with incidental learning, but this pattern diverged by age. In younger adults, deeper processing disrupted the TCE during intentional learning, whereas older adults maintained stable temporal organization across processing levels, a pattern that may reflect strategic compensation, reduced encoding flexibility, or preserved temporal binding mechanisms. These findings contribute to understanding how encoding strategies and learning intention shape memory organization across the adult lifespan and highlight potential pathways for supporting episodic memory in aging."

Here, we performed an integrative analysis that uniquely converges three synergistic approaches: meta-analysis, consensus network analysis, and deep learning on Arabidopsis thaliana transcriptomic datasets under drought and salt conditions, comprising 64 samples across multiple studies. This novel framework allowed us to robustly identify 576 differentially expressed genes (397 upregulated, 170 downregulated), including At5g59310 (LTP4) as the most induced and At1g22690 (GASA9) as the most repressed. Functional annotation revealed that upregulated genes were enriched in stress-related pathways, including oxidoreductase and UDP-glycosyltransferase activities, while downregulated genes were associated with growth, hormone signaling, and photosynthesis. Among DEGs, 60 transcription factors spanning 15 families were identified, highlighting the central role of NAC, ERF, WRKY, bHLH, and bZIP families in stress regulation. Consensus co-expression network analysis revealed four modules with coordinated responses across both stresses, reflecting a growth-defense trade-off. Leveraging a deep learning pipeline featuring an Autoencoder for feature extraction and an MLP for classification, we distinguished stress versus normal samples with 94% accuracy and near-perfect AUC (0.992). Crucially, the convergence of these three methods pinpointed three high-confidence hub genes (At2g30250, At2g35070, and At2g30010), which were validated against independent RNA-seq datasets as core components of a general stress response. This work not only presents a powerful analytical blueprint but also delivers validated, high-priority genetic targets for direct application in engineering climate-resilient crops, with At2g35070 and At2g30010 emerging as particularly promising novel biomarkers."

We propose Spectral-Transformer, a deep learning framework for correcting these distortions in broadband lightsource X-ray absorption spectroscopy (BL-XAS). The model fuses spectra and tube current inputs through a bimodal mapping mechanism and applies physics-informed loss functions as feedback to preserve peak positions and total photon numbers. To facilitate robust model training, we also developed a cascade simulation framework that generates high-fidelity training data by coupling the nonlinear effects of polarization and pile-up. Experimental results validate our approach, showing that the corrected spectra achieved exceptional fidelity. Compared to the raw distorted spectra, the Spectral-Transformer reduces the KL divergence to 1.0 × 10-4. This enhanced spectral integrity directly translates to superior analytical performance, boosting material classification accuracy from 86.2% to 95.5%."

Because neurofluid pathways influence waste clearance, inflammation, and the distribution of central nervous system (CNS)-delivered therapeutics, understanding their dysfunction is increasingly important as targeted treatments emerge. We aimed to evaluate structural and physiological changes in two key neurofluid components, the choroid plexus (ChP), which produces cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), and the parasagittal dural (PSD) space, a major CSF outflow pathway, across the HD spectrum and in relation to CSF flow dynamics.
PSD and ChP volumes were assessed using a validated deep learning pipeline on 3-Tesla T2-weighted and FLAIR MRI. CSF flow at the cerebral aqueduct was measured with phase contrast MRI, and ChP perfusion was quantified using pseudo-continuous arterial spin labeling MRI. Linear regression models assessed the relationships between PSD and ChP volume, CSF flow kinetics, ChP hemodynamics, disease severity, disease exposure, and disease presentation, adjusting for age, sex, and intracranial volume.
80 HD participants and 65 age-matched healthy controls were included. HD showed significantly larger ChP and PSD volumes (p < 0.01) and reduced ChP perfusion (p < 0.01). Greater CAG repeat expansion correlated with larger PSD and ChP volume and lower ChP perfusion (p < 0.01). These alterations were associated with worse motor impairment (p < 0.01).
HD is associated with structural and functional alterations in neurofluid pathways. These findings suggest relevance for disease mechanisms and for optimizing CSF-based therapeutic delivery, highlighting the need for further mechanistic studies."

To systematically review and meta-analyse the diagnostic performance of AI models for TMJ anomaly detection on MRI and to identify factors influencing model performance.
A comprehensive search of PubMed, Scopus, Embase, and Web of Science was conducted for studies published between January 2015 and September 2025. Two reviewers independently screened and extracted data. Eligible studies developed and tested AI, machine learning, or deep learning models on human TMJ MRI and reported quantitative performance metrics. Risk of bias was assessed using the QUADAS-2 tool. Pooled sensitivity and specificity were estimated using a bivariate random-effects model, while pooled accuracy was derived using logit transformation. Heterogeneity (I2) was explored through subgroup analyses by model architecture and validation strategy.
Fourteen studies were included in the systematic review, of which six met the criteria for meta-analysis. Across these six studies, 18 models were analyzed for accuracy, 29 for sensitivity, and 24 for specificity. The pooled diagnostic accuracy was 0.487 (95% CI 0.403-0.571), with pooled sensitivity and specificity of 0.399 (95% CI 0.348-0.450) and 0.399 (95% CI 0.343-0.456), respectively, all showing substantial heterogeneity (I2 > 90%). Subgroup analyses indicated that advanced architectures such as ResNet-18, Inception v3, and EfficientNet-b4 achieved higher and more consistent diagnostic performance.
Advanced deep learning architectures such as ResNet-18, Inception v3, and EfficientNet-b4 demonstrated superior diagnostic performance for detecting temporomandibular joint anomalies on MRI. These findings highlight the potential of AI-assisted MRI interpretation to improve diagnostic consistency, efficiency, and early detection of TMJ pathology. However, substantial heterogeneity and limited external validation currently limit clinical translation. Standardized multicenter studies and transparent model validation are essential to ensure reliable integration of AI tools into clinical TMJ imaging workflows."

This study uses global whole-rock geochemical data of igneous rocks to examine As concentration variations over geological time. The results show a correlation between As fluctuations and supercontinent cycles, with lower concentrations during supercontinent assembly, linked to deep mantle-derived magmas, and higher concentrations during breakup, related to crustal recycling and shallower magmatic sources. Deeper magmas (< 34 km) have lower As levels, while shallower sources exhibit higher concentrations. Time-series analysis of As in igneous and sedimentary rocks reveals a 436-million-year cyclic pattern, driven by tectonic and magmatic events, with a 220-million-year lag between magmatic arsenic cycling and its effects on sedimentary systems. This study enhances understanding of arsenic cycling, its connections to magmatic differentiation, tectonic evolution, and mineralization, with implications for resource exploration."

Since ultrasound was first introduced in 1989, UGRA has improved precision and safety, but its success still depends on operator expertise and the ability to interpret complex images. AI, particularly deep learning algorithms, can automatically identify anatomical landmarks, optimize ultrasound settings, and track needle position with high accuracy. These features support anesthesiologists during procedures, shorten the learning curve, and enhance education for trainees. Early studies show that AI-assisted systems improve image quality, increase confidence in sonoanatomy recognition, and provide real-time feedback during both peripheral nerve and fascial plane blocks. Such tools are especially useful in complex scenarios, where fascial layers are difficult to distinguish. However, widespread clinical use remains limited by challenges such as the need for large, diverse datasets, anatomical variations, and ethical considerations around automation. Looking ahead, AI may extend to predictive analytics, estimating anesthetic volume, block success, and even integrating with robotic systems for enhanced precision.

Due to the compressibility and hydrophilicity of sludge, mechanical filter press operations would lead to pore clogging, resulting in poor performance of conventional mechanical dewatering techniques. Skeleton construction technology (SCT) emerges as a promising solution, where the incorporation of rigid materials optimizes sludge cake structure, reduces compressibility, and enhances permeability. In this review, recent advances in sludge deep dewatering through SCT were critically summarized. The mechanisms of physical support and pore reconstruction enabled by SCT were analyzed, with comparative evaluation of organic and inorganic skeleton construction agents in terms of dewatering performance, cost, and environmental impact. Furthermore, combined dewatering technologies integrating SCT with flocculation, electro-dewatering, and other technologies were investigated.

We introduce DeepMultiConnectome, a deep-learning model that predicts structural connectomes directly from tractography, bypassing the need for gray matter parcellation while supporting multiple parcellation schemes. Using a point-cloud-based neural network with multi-task learning, the model classifies streamlines according to their connected regions across two parcellation schemes, sharing a learned representation. By classifying individual streamlines, our method's output serves as a flexible prerequisite for constructing a wide range of differently weighted connectomes. We train and validate DeepMultiConnectome on tractography from the Human Connectome Project Young Adult dataset (n=1000), labeled with an 84 and 164 region gray matter parcellation scheme. DeepMultiConnectome predicts multiple structural connectomes from a 3-million-streamline tractogram in ∼40 seconds. DeepMultiConnectome is evaluated by comparing predicted connectomes with traditional connectomes generated using the conventional method of labeling streamlines using a gray matter parcellation. The predicted connectomes show high agreement with traditionally generated connectomes across two parcellation schemes and multiple weighting strategies, and largely preserve network properties. Pearson correlations were r = 0.992 and 0.986 for streamline-count-weighted connectomes, r = 0.995 and 0.992 for SIFT2-weighted connectomes, and r = 0.775 and 0.727 for mean-FA-weighted connectomes. Test-retest analysis and downstream predictions of age and cognitive function demonstrate performance and reproducibility comparable to traditionally generated connectomes. Overall, DeepMultiConnectome provides a fast and scalable model for generating subject-specific connectomes across multiple parcellation and weighting schemes."

Advances in continuous glucose monitoring and machine learning have improved short-term glucose prediction. However, preprocessing of signals like insulin, carbohydrate intake, heart rate, and activity to better capture metabolic dynamics remains underexplored. Similarly, the integration of predictive models with preventive strategies for guiding interventions is still limited.
We propose a research-only decision-support framework combining signal preprocessing, CNN-based glucose prediction, Shapley Additive Explanations (SHAP) values attribution, and an Actor-Critic Reinforcement Learning (RL) agent. Exponential decay models preprocess inputs, a compact CNN forecasts short-term glucose levels, and SHAP values highlights the most influential input features; however, these attributions reflect associative patterns in the data and do not establish or map to causal clinical mechanisms. These SHAP-derived attributions guide the RL agent, which issues bounded one-step behavioral adjustments. Because SHAP-guided RL remains stochastic and uncertain, the proposed system is exploratory and not clinically safe, serving solely as a simulation framework.
Using the OhioT1DM dataset, the model achieved state-of-the-art RMSE across prediction horizons with a compact size of 7̃4 KB per patient and training under one minute for 1000 epochs. Over 98% of predictions fell within Clarke Error Grid Zones A and B, confirming safe 5-20 min forecasts. The preventive component corrected hyper- and hypoglycemia in 2̃5% of cases within 10 min when predictions were near 80-120 mg/dL (±10 mg/dL). When deviations exceed ±10 mg/dL, the RL agent is unable to fully restore blood glucose to the target range within 10 min but can bring it as close as possible to the defined interval.
This study presents a significant innovation by bridging predictive accuracy, adaptability, and transparency in diabetes management. The integration of a predictive model with Reinforcement Learning (RL) guided by SHAP values, which are typically used for interpretability but here are employed in the learning process, delivers a powerful decision support framework. This approach advances the field toward next-generation, personalized digital health tools."

DeeppestNet, a graph pyramid attention-based Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (GPA-BiLSTM) model, is proposed as a solution to this problem. In order to improve the recognition process, the Contrast adaptive limited histogram equalization (CLAHE) approach is first used to increase the image quality. Rich feature maps of fine-grained feature regions are intended to be provided by the adaptive pyramid attention module with a cross stage partial (AP-CSP) backbone network. In order to acquire multi-scale spatial features and improve recognition skills through graphical relations, a multi-level pyramid structure is also provided. Graph-based BiLSTM (G-BiLSTM) is used for the final classification, and the Grey Wolf-Salp Swarm Optimization (GW-SSO) technique is used to improve the accuracy. Robust multi-dimensional structural features are extracted with spatial and temporal dependencies when combining G-BiLSTM with a CNN backbone. Additionally, the integration of GW and SSO improves the performance by assuring high precision, fast convergence and balance exploration, exploitation strategies are achieved. The IP-102 dataset is used to assess the proposed pest detection method utilizing evaluation measures like f-measure, recall, precision, and so on. DeeppestNet has achieved 4.6 % higher accuracy than EfficientNet. The experimental outcomes demonstrate that the proposed method performs better than the greatest advanced Deep Learning (DL) algorithms. The proposed method is accurate, efficient, and computationally efficient in comparison to other methods."

With a focus on the prevalent psychological complications following the onset of this condition, this study aimed to explore the correlation between antenatal depression and Corona disease anxiety, personality traits, and postpartum depression during the COVID-19 pandemic.                                                           Materials and Methods:                     This cross-sectional descriptive-analytical study investigated women receiving care at health centers affiliated with Kerman University of Medical Sciences during the last month of their pregnancy and the postpartum period in 2022. Following the acquisition of informed consent, participants were assessed using various measures, including demographic and obstetric information, the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale, the Corona Disease Anxiety Scale (CDAS), and the NEO Personality Inventory-Revised during their third trimester of pregnancy. The same group of participants completed the Edinburgh Depression Scale and the Corona Disease Anxiety Scale (CDAS) 4-6 weeks after childbirth.                                                           Results and Discussion:                     There was a significant correlation between family income, unwanted pregnancy as perceived by both the mother and father, and antenatal depression. Additionally, marital satisfaction played a significant role in postpartum depression. Furthermore, antenatal depression was significantly associated with neuroticism, agreeableness, and physical symptoms related to Corona disease anxiety. Personality traits, with the exception of extroversion and conscientiousness, and various domains of Corona disease anxiety, excluding psychological symptoms, were also significantly associated with postpartum depression.                                                           Conclusion:                     During pandemics or epidemics, such as the COVID-19 outbreak, experiencing mental distress during pregnancy can contribute to mental health issues during the postpartum period. This risk is particularly true in individuals with unique personality traits, emphasizing the need for increased focus on mental health within prenatal care during these crises."

Results:                     The findings indicated that the most important risk factors for the severity of COVID-19 were heart diseases (OR=1.67,95%CI:1.20-2.30), increasing age (OR=2.23 for age&gt;54, 95%CI:1.70- 2.90), male gender (OR=1.47,95%CI:1.10-1.96), respiratory diseases other than asthma, and frequency of admission (OR=1.60,95%CI:1.20-2.15). All patients who underwent readmission experienced a shorter duration of hospitalization during their subsequent admission (OR=0.94,95%CI:0.91,0.96) and had a higher mortality rate (30% within 14 days, 26.6% between 14-90 days). Patients readmitted at intervals of 14-90 days and greater than 90 days exhibited lower disease severity compared to those readmitted within the 0-14 day period.                                                           Conclusion:                     Examining readmissions, the severity of COVID-19, and the length of hospital stay in affected patients are important factors for planning and allocating resources for COVID-19 management and treatment. These factors can help policymakers develop effective clinical guidelines for hospitalization or outpatient treatment of COVID-19 patients and contribute to reducing the burden of disease in the community."

Kinovea, as an accessible motion-analysis software, provides both visual and quantitative feedback. However, its application in supporting technique development among beginner athletes remains insufficiently explored. Aim: This study aims to describe the use of Kinovea in biomechanics training and examine its contribution to the awareness of kinematic characteristics and movement techniques among beginner athletes. Methods: A descriptive qualitative design involved 72 beginner athletes aged 18–25 years selected through purposive sampling. Data were collected over 16 weeks through interviews, field observations, and motion video recordings analyzed using Kinovea. Kinematic data focused on joint angles, stride behavior, and movement phases during walking, running, and the flight phase. Qualitative data were analyzed using content analysis with NVivo 12, while kinematic results were interpreted descriptively to identify performance patterns and areas for technical refinement. Result: Kinematic analysis showed coordinated joint-angle patterns across all phases. Walking analysis identified arm swing angles of 50.9°–58.8° and leg separation angles of 64.3°–67.2°, indicating a stable gait rhythm. The running analysis revealed knee angles of 68.8°–69.8° and elbow angles of 87.6°–89.1°, indicating efficient propulsive mechanics. The flight phase demonstrated knee angles of 81.2°–87.8° and elbow angles of 80.4°–88.3°, suggesting effective momentum use and postural stability. These measurements supported stride-efficiency assessment and technique evaluation. Qualitative findings revealed that Kinovea enabled athletes to interpret movement phases and identify technical inefficiencies through slow-motion and frame-by-frame visualization. Conclusion: Kinovea supports basic motion analysis by providing clear kinematic information and helping beginner athletes observe and refine their movement techniques. The findings also offer practical value for coaches by enabling more precise identification of inefficient patterns and guiding targeted corrections during early-stage training."

OpenAlex,aortic stenosis,[Analysis of optimizing indications for fetal pulmonary valvuloplasty based on a multi-parameter scoring system].,Y Wang; Y Sun; G Luo; S L Pan,,2026-02-02,PubMed,"<b>Objective:</b> To establish a multi-parametric scoring system for predicting postnatal circulatory outcomes in fetuses with critical pulmonary stenosis (CPS) and pulmonary atresia (PA) with intact ventricular septum (IVS), in order to optimize the indications for fetal pulmonary valvuloplasty (FPV). <b>Methods:</b> This was a retrospective cohort study. A total of 96 fetuses diagnosed with CPS-IVS or PA-IVS at Women and Children's Hospital, Qingdao University between July 2018 and June 2021 were included. Fetuses who did not undergo FPV constituted the modeling cohort, while those who underwent FPV constituted the validation cohort. Fetuses were classified into biventricular and non-biventricular circulation groups based on postnatal circulatory outcomes. Prenatal fetal echocardiographic parameters were compared between groups using independent-samples <i>t</i> test, Mann-Whitney <i>U</i> test, <i>χ</i><sup>2</sup> test or Fisher exact test. Based on inter-group differences, parameters associated with postnatal circulatory outcomes were screened in the modeling cohort. For continuous variables, optimal cut-off values were determined using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve and the Youden index and then dichotomized. Right ventricular endocardial fibroelastosis (EFE) was graded as 0, 1 or 2 according to severity. <i>OR</i> of each parameter were calculated, and a multiparametric scoring system was constructed. ROC curve was used to evaluate its predictive performance. Post-FPV outcome improvement was assessed in the validation cohort. <b>Results:</b> Among the 96 fetuses, 78 were assigned to the modeling cohort and 18 to the validation cohort. Postnatally, biventricular circulation was achieved in 56 cases (72%) in the modeling cohort and 13 cases in the validation cohort. In the modeling cohort, the right ventricular long-axis/left ventricular long-axis (RV/LV), tricuspid annulus diameter/mitral annulus diameter (TV/MV) and pulmonary valve annulus/aortic valve annulus (PV/AV) in the non-biventricular group were lower than that in the biventricular group (all <i>P</i><0.05). The optimal cut-off values for predicting postnatal circulatory outcomes were 0.65, 0.82 and 0.78, respectively. There was statistically significant difference in the distribution of circulatory outcomes between fetuses with grade 2 EFE and those with no or grade 1 EFE (<i>χ</i><sup>2</sup>=21.28, <i>P</i><0.001). Therefore, right ventricular EFE was dichotomized in the model as ""none or grade 1"" versus ""grade 2"". Each parameter was assigned a corresponding weight based on its <i>OR</i> value, and an integer score was obtained to construct the scoring system: grade 2 right ventricular EFE was assigned 5 points, RV/LV≤0.65 was assigned 2 points, TV/MV≤0.82 was assigned 2 points, and PV/AV≤0.78 was assigned 1 point, with a maximum total score of 10 points. At cut-off scores of 3, 4, and 5 points, the areas under the curve were 0.88, 0.91, and 0.88, respectively, with the highest specificity (0.95, 95% <i>CI</i> 0.84-0.99) observed at a score threshold of 5 points. In the validation cohort, 15 fetuses had scores ≥5 points, among whom 10 fetuses achieved biventricular circulation after birth, whereas in the modeling cohort, only 1 of 18 fetuses achieved biventricular circulation after birth. <b>Conclusions:</b> A multiparametric scoring system based on prenatal fetal echocardiographic parameters can effectively predict non-biventricular postnatal outcomes in fetuses with CPS-IVS and PA-IVS. By identifying high-risk patients, the indications for FPV can be optimized."
OpenAlex,aortic stenosis,Can Acute Kidney Injury After Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement Alone Predict Poor Prognosis in Diabetic Patients?,Nur Ozer Sensoy; Fatih Levent; Ece Çelebi Coşkun; Günseli Demir; Mustafa Yılmaz,10.37990/medr.1654048,2026-01-31,Medical Records,"Aim: Transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) has become a well-recognized treatment option for patients with symptomatic severe aortic stenosis (AS) who are deemed to have a higher risk for surgical intervention. Due to underlying comorbidities, acute kidney injury (AKI) continues to be a common complication, especially in patients with diabetes mellitus after TAVR. The aim of this study is to evaluate the effect of postoperative AKI development in diabetic patients undergoing TAVR on the development of mortality and major adverse cardiac events (MACE) in these patients. Material and Method: A total of 141 patients who underwent TAVR between January 2015 and January 2020 were grouped according to whether they developed AKI and whether they had MACE. MACE and 5-year mortality status were compared according to whether the patients developed AKI. Results: A total of 35 patients were observed to develop AKI (24.8%). Additionally, MACE was observed in 36 patients (25.5%). Five-year mortality rates (42.9% vs. 15.1%; p = 0.002) and MACE rates (54.3% vs. 16%; p &lt; 0.001) were significantly higher in the AKI group. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses identified AKI as a significant independent predictor of MACE development, regardless of other associated parameters (OR = 3.92, 95% CI: 1.28–12.02; p = 0.017). Conclusion: The most important result obtained in this study is that AKI development in diabetic patients who underwent TAVR with the diagnosis of advanced aortic stenosis has an effect on the development of MACE and long-term mortality independently of other parameters."
OpenAlex,aortic stenosis,Delayed complete atrioventricular block 11 months after transcatheter aortic valve replacement in a patient with a short membranous septum: a case report,Jian Xiong; Djandan Tadum Arthur Vithran; Zhixiao Wang; Zheng Cao; Xiaoyong Hu,10.3389/fcvm.2026.1703981,2026-01-30,Frontiers in Cardiovascular Medicine,"Conduction disturbances are among the most frequent complications of transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR), typically occurring within the first 72 h after implantation. However, delayed complete atrioventricular (AV) block is rare and may present late with serious clinical consequences. We describe the case of a 72-year-old man with hypertension who developed complete AV block nearly 1 year after TAVR, underscoring the importance of long-term surveillance in patients with high-risk anatomy. The patient initially presented with progressive exertional dyspnea and was diagnosed with severe low-flow, low-gradient aortic stenosis, with a left ventricular ejection fraction of 33%. Preprocedural computed tomography demonstrated a short membranous septum (4.0 mm) and an annulus–membranous septum distance of 1.2 mm, both of which are recognized predictors of conduction disturbances. He underwent transfemoral TAVR with a self-expanding Qiming L26 valve implanted at a depth of approximately 5 mm. Early recovery was uneventful, aside from a small paravalvular leak, which resolved by the 8-month follow-up, at which time echocardiography showed recovery of systolic function to 60%, and sinus rhythm was observed on electrocardiography. At 11 months following TAVR, a community screening ECG revealed 2:1 AV block, and 3 weeks later, he presented with symptomatic complete AV block and a ventricular escape rhythm at 30 bpm. Repeat CT showed increased frame depth (7.6 and 9.8 mm), suggesting possible valve–septum interaction; however, causal attribution is limited by the absence of immediate/serial CT and electrophysiological mapping, and age-related conduction system disease may have contributed to this finding. A dual-chamber permanent pacemaker was implanted, resulting in complete symptomatic recovery and a stable prosthetic valve function. This case report highlights a rare but clinically important phenomenon of very late conduction block after TAVR and supports a risk-stratified approach to anatomical assessment and long-term rhythm monitoring. However, this inference remains hypothesis-generating, given its single-patient nature."
OpenAlex,aortic stenosis,Acute Cardiac Dysfunction and Rapid Descending Aortic Expansion Following Surgery for Acute Stanford Type A Aortic Dissection: a case report,Koki Yokawa; Taku Nakagawa; Yosuke Tanaka; Kazunori Yoshida; Hidetaka Wakiyama,10.1093/ehjcr/ytag082,2026-01-30,European Heart Journal - Case Reports,"Abstract Background Severe true lumen stenosis of the aorta can increase left ventricular afterload and impair cardiac function. We report a rare case of significant true lumen stenosis and cardiac dysfunction after undergoing total arch replacement for acute type A aortic dissection. Case Summary A 39-year-old man with acute Stanford type A aortic dissection and intimal tear in the ascending aorta underwent the Bentall procedure and total arch replacement with a frozen elephant trunk. He was readmitted one month after discharge with progressive cardiac dysfunction. Myocardial scintigraphy excluded ischemia, and computed tomography revealed severe true lumen stenosis at the distal frozen elephant trunk, resulting in an elevated left ventricular afterload. Thoracic endovascular aortic repair to expand the true lumen resulted in gradual improvement in cardiac function. However, there was progressive dilation of the descending and thoracoabdominal aorta: 26 mm at onset, and 32 mm and 46 mm at two and six months postoperatively, respectively. To close distal re-entries, endovascular aortic repair was performed after two months. His brain natriuretic peptide level decreased from 2901 pg/mL to 142 pg/mL over eight months; open abdominal aortic replacement was performed nine months after the onset, after sufficient cardiac function recovery (ejection fraction = 40%). Discussion True lumen stenosis is a substantial reversible cause of cardiac dysfunction after type A dissection surgery. Thoracic endovascular aortic repair effectively reduces the afterload and restores cardiac function; long-term imaging and staged intervention are essential to address distal aortic remodeling."

To assess the contribution of aortic valve (AV) calcification severity to permanent pacemaker (PP) insertion after transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) during the hospitalization. Material and methods . The study included 94 patients with severe aortic stenosis who underwent TAVI. All patients underwent multislice computed tomography (CT) before the procedure to assess AV calcification. Results . During the hospital period, eight patients (8,5%) required PP implantation. CT made it possible to reveal that patients who underwent pacemaker implantation after TAVI compared with patients without pacemaker had higher calcium volume in the left coronary cusp (LCC) (424,6 mm 3 [223,1-524,7] vs 151,6 mm 3 [91,9-276,2], respectively, p=0,005) and non-coronary cusp (608,2 mm 3 [254,5-805,2] vs 283,7 mm 3 [173,6-398,9], respectively, p=0,035). As a result of multivariate regression analysis, the independent predictors of pacemaker implantation after TAVI were the initial right bundle branch block (RBBB) (odds ratio (OR): 15,77; 95% confidence interval (CI): 2,06-120,5; p=0,008) and LCC calcium volume &gt;300 mm 3 (OR: 7,98; 95% CI: 1,38-46,11; p=0,020). Conclusion . According to the study results, initial RBBB and LCC calcification are independent predictors of permanent pacemaker implantation after TAVI during the hospital period. Further studies are needed to predict and prevent post-operative complications."
OpenAlex,aortic stenosis,Comparing TAVR + PCI vs. SAVR + CABG across short- and mid- to long-term horizons in patients with severe aortic stenosis and concomitant CAD: a systematic review and meta-analysis,Xiang Fang; Xuge Zhang; Fei Wei; Shenghong Feng; Xiaomei Chen,10.3389/fcvm.2026.1640906,2026-01-30,Frontiers in Cardiovascular Medicine,"Background The optimal revascularization approach for intermediate- and high-risk individuals with severe aortic stenosis (AS) and concomitant coronary artery disease (CAD) remains uncertain, particularly regarding the comparative short- and mid- to long-term outcomes of transcatheter aortic valve replacement with percutaneous coronary intervention (TAVR + PCI) vs. surgical aortic valve replacement with coronary artery bypass grafting (SAVR + CABG). Methods A systematic search of major databases was conducted up to March 2025 to identify studies comparing TAVR + PCI vs. SAVR + CABG in this population. Meta-analyses were performed using a random-effects model to estimate pooled odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Evidence quality was assessed using the GRADE framework. Results Thirteen studies comprising 53,869 patients were analyzed. Compared with SAVR + CABG, TAVR + PCI was associated with lower 30-day risks of stroke, myocardial infarction, and acute kidney injury, but higher permanent pacemaker implantation. No differences were found in all-cause mortality, major vascular complications, or major bleeding. In mid- to long-term follow-up (≥2 years), the TAVR + PCI group exhibited increased risks of all-cause mortality, myocardial infarction, and repeat revascularization, with similar stroke rates between strategies. Certainty of evidence ranged from very low to moderate. Conclusions In intermediate- and high-risk patients with severe AS and concomitant CAD, TAVR + PCI appears to confer short-term safety advantages but may be associated with less favorable mid- to long-term outcomes compared with SAVR + CABG. These findings support individualized revascularization strategies that balance early procedural safety against longer-term risks and highlight the need for further randomized trials with extended follow-up.

Methods: This descriptive case series included three patients who underwent TAVI at the Cardiovascular Center, E Hospital. The cohort comprised one valve-in-valve procedure for a degenerated surgical bioprosthesis and two cases of native severe calcific aortic stenosis. All patients underwent comprehensive pre-procedural assessment, including clinical evaluation, electrocardiography, transthoracic echocardiography, and multidetector computed tomography according to a standard TAVI protocol. Hydra THV sizing was based on annular perimeter and the perimeter-derived diameter. Early outcomes were assessed using contemporary standardized TAVI endpoint definitions. Results: All three TAVI procedures were successfully performed via the transfemoral approach. There were no cases of in-hospital mortality, major vascular complications, stroke, or acute coronary obstruction. Following the intervention, transaortic valve gradients were markedly reduced, valve hemodynamics were favorable, and paravalvular regurgitation was no more than mild. The valve-in-valve case involving a small annulus was managed successfully without coronary-related complications. All patients experienced early clinical improvement. Conclusions: In this small case series, TAVI using the Hydra THV self-expanding valve demonstrated favorable early feasibility and safety, even in complex anatomical settings such as valve-in-valve procedures and patients with peripheral arterial disease. Larger studies with extended follow-up are needed to further evaluate long-term valve performance and durability."
OpenAlex,aortic stenosis,Assessment of left ventricular global longitudinal strain in patients with severe aortic valve stenosis before and after surgery using 2d speckle-tracking echocardiography,Dinh Hoan Nguyen; Trần Thúy Nguyên,10.47972/vjcts.v54i.1644,2026-01-29,Tạp chí Phẫu thuật và Tim mạch và Lồng ngực Việt Nam,"Objective: To evaluate changes in left ventricular global longitudinal strain (GLS) in patients with severe aortic valve stenosis before and after surgical aortic valve replacement using two-dimensional speckle-tracking echocardiography. Methods: A prospective, cross-sectional study conducted in patients with severe aortic valve stenosis undergoing surgery, with longitudinal follow-up at 1 month and 3 months postoperatively. The study was carried out at the Cardiovascular Center, E Hospital, from October 2024 to November 2025. Results: A total of 30 patients were included, with a mean age of 64.5 ± 6.0 years, and 56.7% were male. Preoperatively, the mean left ventricular ejection fraction (EF) was 55%, the mean GLS was −15.7 ± 4.8, and the mean transaortic pressure gradient was 54.7 ± 16.5 mmHg. Postoperatively, global longitudinal strain showed a trend toward improvement over the follow-up period at 1 week and 3 months, respectively. Postoperative GLS demonstrated a strong correlation with preoperative EF and left ventricular end-diastolic diameter. Conclusions: Left ventricular global longitudinal strain assessed by 2D speckle-tracking echocardiography is a useful parameter for evaluating left ventricular function in patients with severe aortic valve stenosis before and after surgical valve replacement and shows a strong correlation with conventional echocardiographic parameters."
OpenAlex,aortic stenosis,High Risk Repeated Cardiac Surgery for Recurrent Subaortic Stenosis With a Favorable Outcome: A Case Report,Feras Zoreka; Abeer H Alkudsi; Abdulsater Allababidi; Lubana Shadoud,10.1097/cd9.0000000000000185,2026-01-29,Cardiology Discovery,"Abstract Subaortic stenosis is a form of left ventricular outflow tract obstruction, accounting for approximately 14% of cases. It occurs as an acquired lesion after repair of congenital heart disease and rarely following mitral valve repair or replacement. A 40-year-old female presented with dyspnea on minimal exertion, palpitations, and chronic hemolytic anemia. Her medical history included cardiac surgery at the age of 10 for closure of an atrial septal defect and mitral valve repair. Then, at the age of 28, she underwent another cardiac surgery to resect a subaortic stenosis, which recurred within one year. This recurrence led to a redo surgery involving mitral valve replacement with a 25-mm St. Jude prosthesis. Subsequent investigations demonstrated membranous subaortic stenosis with severe aortic valve insufficiency and partial de-insertion of the mitral valve with a small atrial septal defect. Management aimed to eliminate all systemic and structural factors contributing to increased flow in the left ventricular outflow tract, which are known to play an important role in the recurrence of subaortic stenosis. For this purpose, the patient underwent the fourth cardiac surgery involving aortic valve replacement, membrane resection, repair of the leak around the mitral valve, and atrial septal defect closure. She recovered within 2 months after surgery and resumed her job. During a 6-year follow-up period, she remained in good health with no evidence of cardiac dysfunction. Despite the considerable risks associated with repeated surgical interventions for recurrent subaortic stenosis, favorable long-term outcomes may outweigh these risks."
OpenAlex,aortic stenosis,Abstract WP125: Lipoprotein(a) and Echocardiographic Findings in Ischemic Stroke: Aortic Plaque as a Potential Signal,Solomon Oak; Gauri Patil; Connor Davy; Laura Stein; Steven Rudolph,10.1161/str.57.suppl_1.wp125,2026-01-29,Stroke,"Background: Lipoprotein(a) [Lp(a)] is a genetically determined, pro-atherogenic lipoprotein associated with ischemic stroke risk. While both Lp(a) and aortic arch plaque are established stroke risk factors, no studies have directly examined the relationship between Lp(a) levels and aortic arch plaque presence or characteristics in ischemic stroke patients. Aortic arch plaque is an established embolic source, but its relationship with Lp(a) levels in stroke patients has not been examined. Methods: We analyzed 188 consecutive ischemic stroke patients (2024–2025) from the Mount Sinai Health System Get With The Guidelines–Stroke registry with documented Lp(a) levels and echocardiographic evaluations. We abstracted patient demographics, including sex, age, race, and past medical history. Echocardiogram findings included ejection fraction (EF), aortic plaque, aortic stenosis, and left atrial enlargement. We additionally abstracted stroke subtype, as defined by TOAST classification. Based on previously established methods in Lp(a) research, patients were stratified by cohort-based Lp(a) tertiles (≤65, &gt;65–165, &gt;165 nmol/L). We compared echocardiographic findings and TOAST stroke subtypes across Lp(a) groups. Kruskal-Wallis and chi-square/Fisher’s tests were used for group comparisons. Results: Median age was 68.5 years (IQR 61–78), 45.7% were female, and median Lp(a) was 100 nmol/L (IQR 56–188). Race distribution significantly differed across Lp(a) tertiles ( p =0.008). Black patients comprised 39.7% of the lowest tertile, 70.5% of the middle tertile, and 66.1% of the highest tertile, despite representing 58.0% of the overall cohort. Eighteen (9.6%) patients had aortic arch plaque, which was more common in the highest Lp(a) tertile (17.5%) than in the middle (8.1%) or lowest (3.2%) ( p =0.02). Other echocardiographic findings and stroke subtype did not differ by Lp(a) tertile. Conclusions: In this cohort of ischemic stroke patients, higher Lp(a) was associated with the presence of aortic arch plaque on echocardiography. Although there was no difference in stroke subtype, aortic arch plaque may be an underrecognized source of stroke in patients with elevated Lp(a) and may provide further support for efforts to aggressively modify the atherosclerotic risk factor profile in these patients."

Schreyer,10.1093/ehjcr/ytag075,2026-01-29,European Heart Journal - Case Reports,"Abstract Background Caseous calcification of the mitral annulus (CCMA), also referred to as “toothpaste tumour”, is a rare variant of calcification of the mitral annulus (MAC). The prognosis and pathogenesis of CCMA remain obscure. Overall CCMA is benign and usually asymptomatic, but can manifest with abscess formation, embolic events such as stroke or significant mitral valve dysfunction. Case Summary We report two cases of CCMA in elderly female patients. Patient 1 presented with dyspnoea and was diagnosed with CCMA and aortic valve stenosis. When her symptoms worsened over time, severe coronary artery disease was diagnosed in addition. Multimodality imaging, using transoesophageal echocardiography (TEE), cardiac computed tomography (CT) and cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (CMRI) confirmed CCMA that remained stable over the lifetime of the patient. Due to high surgical risks, a conservative management was chosen. Six years later, the patient died from decompensated aortic stenosis with cardiogenic shock. Patient 2 initially presented with chest pain. Three-vessel coronary artery disease was diagnosed and treated with stent implantation by staged percutaneous coronary intervention. Subsequent imaging (TEE, cardio-CT) revealed CCMA. Annual echocardiographic examination showed stable dimensions of the CCMA lesion over six years of follow-up. Discussion Early recognition of CCMA is crucial because it may lead to serious complications. Although spontaneous resolution has been reported, CCMA remained stable over several years in both of our cases. Both patients were elderly women with arterial hypertension and chronic renal failure, supporting the hypothesis of an atheroma-like pathogenesis."
OpenAlex,aortic stenosis,Case Report: Newly discovered ELN gene mutation in congenital heart disease: case analysis and review,peiwen Cheng; Guozhen Wang; Jialin Qiu; Xia Xie; Y F An,10.3389/fped.2026.1671066,2026-01-29,Frontiers in Pediatrics,"Introduction Supravalvular aortic stenosis (SVAS) is a rare left ventricular outflow tract obstruction, most commonly caused by pathogenic variants in ELN. Truncating variants in exons 1–29 typically produce non-syndromic SVAS through elastin haploinsufficiency, whereas C-terminal variants are linked to autosomal dominant cutis laxa. However, clinically and mechanistically well-characterized variants in the distal part of this “stenotic zone,” such as exon 28, remain uncommon. Methods We conducted a retrospective family-based case report with standardized clinical evaluation, serial echocardiography, and trio whole-exome sequencing with Sanger confirmation and conservation analysis. Results A female infant presented at 1 month with severe sinotubular junction narrowing (Z-score −4.8, peak gradient 24 mmHg), severe peripheral pulmonary artery stenosis, a small atrial septal defect, and moderate mitral regurgitation. Her father had severe SVAS with mild PPAS and prior aortic root enlargement, without syndromic features. Trio sequencing identified a novel heterozygous ELN exon 28 frameshift variant, c.1879_1883dup (p.Ala629LeufsTer15), inherited from the father. Ala629 is fully conserved, and the duplication introduces a premature stop codon, consistent with nonsense-mediated decay and elastin haploinsufficiency. At 9 months, SVAS progressed (peak gradient 35 mmHg), while PPAS gradients regressed by &amp;gt;40%. Conclusion This novel exon 28 ELN frameshift expands the non-syndromic SVAS spectrum and illustrates a characteristic pattern of progressive aortic stenosis with improving PPAS, supporting ELN testing and targeted longitudinal surveillance in similar patients and families."
OpenAlex,aortic stenosis,Successful valve-in-valve transcatheter aortic valve implantation using a hydra transcatheter aortic valve in a patient with severe degeneration of a surgical bioprosthesis: a case report,Thao Nguyen Phan; The Huy Nguyen; Le Anh Do; Cong Tien Nguyen,10.47972/vjcts.v54i.1634,2026-01-29,Tạp chí Phẫu thuật và Tim mạch và Lồng ngực Việt Nam,"Bioprosthetic aortic valve degeneration is increasingly encountered and poses significant management challenges, particularly in elderly patients at high surgical risk [1]. Valve-in-valve transcatheter aortic valve implantation (ViV-TAVI) has emerged as an effective alternative to redo surgery in this complex population [1–3]. At the Cardiovascular centre, E Hospital, we report a case of 71-year-old man presenting with severe stenosis of a 21mm surgical bioprosthesis implanted 11 years earlier. Given the prohibitive risk of redo surgery [3], the Heart Team performed ViV-TAVI using a Hydra THV 22mm self-expanding transcatheter heart valve. The procedure was uneventful. At 15 days follow-up, transthoracic echocardiography demonstrated excellent hemodynamics performance with a peak transvalvular gradient of 9 mmHg and a mean gradient of 4 mmHg and the patient had returned to New York Heart Association (NYHA) functional class I. This case highlights the feasibility and favorable early outcomes of Hydra THV in ViV-TAVI for small surgical bioprostheses, a subgroup frequently associated with high residual gradients and patient–prosthesis mismatch [5–7]. This report aims to describe a Valve-in-Valve TAVI procedure in a small bioprosthetic valve, emphasize the role of multimodality imaging, evaluate post-procedural hemodynamic outcomes, and discuss potential complications and preventive strategies, with particular focus on coronary obstruction and patient–prosthesis mismatch."
OpenAlex,aortic stenosis,Abstract DP311: One-Stop Head-Neck-Aortic Vessel Wall MRI: A New Imaging Approach for Assessing Supracardiac Atherosclerosis in Stroke,Qianmei Jiang; Jing Jing; Zhe Zhang; Yongjun Wang,10.1161/str.57.suppl_1.dp311,2026-01-29,Stroke,"Background: Supracardiac atherosclerosis—including carotid, vertebrobasilar, intracranial, and aortic arch arteries—is a major cause of stroke. While vessel wall MRI (vwMRI) can assess plaques, current techniques lack full head-neck-aortic coverage and efficiency. Purpose: To develop and validate a rapid, comprehensive head-neck-aortic vwMRI approach for assessing supracardiac atherosclerosis, comparing it with supra-aortic CTA and evaluating its value in identifying causes of embolic stroke of undetermined source (ESUS). Materials and Methods: A new non-contrast 3D head-neck-aortic vwMRI approach was developed for assessing supracardiac vasculature in ischemic stroke patients. It integrates a multi-coil hardware system with 3D black- and gray-blood vwMRI, accelerated by a novel neural network-based technique, achieving about 15-minute total scan time(Figure 1). Plaque vulnerabilities, stenosis, and stroke etiologies were compared between vwMRI and supra-aortic CTA. Results: From October 2024 to March 2025, 108 patients (mean age, 56 ± 14 years; 89 male) with ischemic stroke or transient ischemic attack underwent both vwMRI and supra-aortic CTA. vwMRI detected 301 plaques in 88 patients, versus 246 plaques in 75 patients by CTA (κ=0.583, p&lt;0.001). For plaque vulnerabilities, black- and gray-blood vwMRI achieved 91% accuracy for calcification using CTA as reference (Figure 2). vwMRI identified intraplaque hemorrhage and ulceration in 27.8% and 25.9% of cases, respectively, while CTA identified ulceration in 23.1% and had limited sensitivity for hemorrhage. For ≥50% vascular stenosis, CTA found 49 patients (25 occlusions), and vwMRI found 47 (24 occlusions), with identified causes including atherosclerosis (n=41), thrombus (n=3), and dissection (n=3). For stroke etiologies, of the 38 initially classified as ESUS by conventional evaluation including CTA, vwMRI reclassified 16 (14 with culprit plaques, 2 dissections), reducing the ESUS proportion from 35.2% (38/108) to 20.4% (22/108) (Figure 3). Conclusion: This one-stop, 15-minute head-neck-aortic vwMRI approach offers comprehensive and detailed evaluation of supracardiac atherosclerosis, improving stroke etiological classification—especially in ESUS patients—compared to CTA."
