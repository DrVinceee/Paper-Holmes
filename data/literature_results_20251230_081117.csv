PubMed,aortic stenosis,Multisystem comorbidities and shared genetic pathways in calcific aortic stenosis: a phenome-wide and Mendelian randomisation analysis.,Zihao Zhou; Yidan Zheng; Shiyan Hu; Jingyu Xu; Lifei Luo; Xingyu Qian; Chen Jiang; Yuqi Liu; Fuqiang Tong; Ming Chen; Pengning Fan; Zhe Chen; Da Zhu; Xiangbin Pan; Li Xu; Fei Li,10.1136/heartjnl-2025-326058,2025-12-29,Heart (British Cardiac Society),"Calcific aortic stenosis (CAS) is frequently accompanied by systemic comorbidities, but their causal relationships and shared genetic architecture remain poorly defined. We aimed to map the multisystem comorbidity network of CAS and clarify underlying genetic mechanisms.
In 467 484 participants from the UK Biobank, observational and polygenic phenome-wide association studies evaluated associations between CAS and 1571 phenotypes, integrating disease-trajectory analyses to visualise temporal patterns. Associations replicated across observational and polygenic analyses were tested using two-sample Mendelian randomisation (MR) based on 22 CAS-related variants from FinnGen. Polygenic risk score (PRS) analyses excluding specific genes assessed their contributions, particularly LPA and plasma lipoprotein(a) (Lp(a)) levels.
CAS was associated with higher risks of 42 cardiovascular and non-cardiovascular conditions, most prominently metabolic, endocrine, haematological and respiratory disorders. Temporal analyses showed that circulatory and metabolic diseases typically precede other comorbidities in CAS trajectories. MR findings were consistent with causal effects of CAS on multiple cardiovascular diseases, iron-deficiency anaemia, mental disorders and pleural effusion. When LPA variants were removed from the CAS PRS or plasma Lp(a) concentration was adjusted for, most associations lost significance, indicating a shared LPA/Lp(a)-mediated genetic pathway.
CAS is embedded within a broad multisystem comorbidity network, driven largely by genetic variation at LPA and elevated Lp(a). These findings highlight pleiotropic mechanisms linking valvular calcification with systemic disease and support LPA-targeted therapies as a promising avenue for reducing the multisystem burden of CAS."

Propensity score matching was used to compare patients undergoing SAVR or transfemoral (TF) TAVR with similar baseline characteristics. The primary end-points were all-cause mortality and major adverse cardiac and cerebrovascular events (MACCE) at 10 years. Prespecified secondary end-points included cerebrovascular accidents, repeat aortic intervention, repeat hospitalization due to cardiac reasons and heart failure. All outcomes were adjudicated through a linkage with administrative databases.
From the entire cohort (n = 5707 SAVR and n = 1911 TAVR treated between December 2010 and June 2012), 650 matched pairs of patients were considered. At 10 years, TF-TAVR was associated with a higher risk of all-cause mortality [Hazard ratio (HR) 1.39, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.22-1.59; p < 0.001] and MACCE (HR 1.33, 95% CI 1.18-1.51; p < 0.001) compared to SAVR.Secondary end-points did not differ for rehospitalization for heart failure (p = 0.443) or cardiac reasons (p = 0.552), and for cerebrovascular events (p = 0.573), but TAVR had a significantly lower risk of repeat aortic intervention [Sub-distributional HR (SHR), 0.33; 95% CI, 0.12-0.91; p = 0.024] at 10 years.
At 10 years, early generation TAVR had significantly higher risk of all-cause mortality and MACCE, but lower risk of repeat aortic intervention in clinical practice."
PubMed,aortic stenosis,Pressure Recovery in Aortic Stenosis.,Arthur E Fass; William H Frishman,10.1097/CRD.0000000000001146,2025-12-29,Cardiology in review,"While the diagnosis of aortic stenosis (AS) is relatively straightforward on physical examination and echocardiographic imaging, the determination of severity is often challenging. Assessment of severity assumes the greatest importance when aortic valve replacement is under consideration. In addition to a number of well-known technical frustrations in the Doppler diagnosis, a puzzling and persistent discrepancy between aortic valve gradients obtained by Doppler and those measured at catheterization emerged, further clouding the issue. This discordance led several investigators to the discovery of pressure recovery (PR) of varying degrees in the ascending aorta in AS patients distal to the stenotic valve. PR is often a significant factor in assessing the physiologic burden of AS. The impact of PR must be considered in the comprehensive assessment of AS severity."
PubMed,aortic stenosis,Measurement of myocardial extracellular volume fraction and cardiomyocyte diameter before and 6 months after aortic valve replacement in patients with severe aortic stenosis.,Noor Sharrack; Alex Makins; John D Biglands; Peter Kellman; Sven Plein; David L Buckley,10.1016/j.jocmr.2025.102679,2025-12-25,Journal of cardiovascular magnetic resonance : official journal of the Society for Cardiovascular Magnetic Resonance,"Extra cellular volume fraction (ECV) is an independent predictor of mortality in aortic stenosis (AS). ECV can be measured using myocardial T1 maps acquired before and after contrast administration. Standard ECV measurements do not consider the limited rate of water exchange (WX) between cardiomyocytes and the extracellular matrix which can result in underestimated ECV at higher contrast agent concentrations.
The objective was to estimate ECV in patients with severe AS before and after surgical aortic valve replacement (AVR) using a 2-site exchange model (2SXM) that also enables estimates of the intracellular lifetime of water (τic; an indicator of the minor diameter of the cardiomyocytes).
20 patients (67 ± 6 years) with severe AS, referred for AVR, underwent MRI on a 3T MR system before and 6 months after AVR. T1 measurements were made using a multiparametric saturation-recovery single-shot acquisition before and at multiple time points post-injection of contrast agent. A 2SXM and standard linear model (LM) were used to estimate ECV and, when combined with indexed left ventricular mass (LVMI), to calculate cell and matrix volumes, (LVMI x (1-ECV)/1.05) and (LVMI x ECV/1.05), respectively. The 2SXM model was also used to estimate τic.
Data were acquired before and 174 (157 to 267) days after AVR. LVMI reduced following AVR, from 78 ± 15g/m2 to 63 ± 11g/m2 (p<0.001). ECV estimates increased from 22 ± 3% to 28 ± 5% (p<0.001) using the LM compared to 28 ± 5% to 32 ± 4% (p=0.005) using the 2SXM. Indexed cell volume decreased from 58 ± 12 cm3/m2 to 43 ± 9 cm3/m2 (p < 0.001; LM) and from 54 ± 12 cm3/m2 to 41 ± 8 cm3/m2 (p<0.001; 2SXM). Indexed matrix volume did not change significantly by either method (LM, 16 ± 4 cm3/m2 to 17 ± 3 cm3/m2; 2SXM, 20 ± 5 cm3/m2 to 19 ± 3 cm3/m2). τic decreased from 0.21 ± 0.12s to 0.12 ± 0.09s (p=0.007).
Cellular hypertrophy regressed 6 months following AVR; the extracellular matrix volume did not change significantly. τic decreased post-AVR indicating that the reduction in cell volume can be largely attributed to a reduction in cardiomyocyte diameter."

PubMed, Scopus, Embase, Web of Science, and the Cochrane Library were systematically searched for studies comparing SU-AVR with TAVR. Risk ratios (RR) with 95 % confidence intervals (CIs) were computed for binary outcomes. Trial sequential analysis (TSA) was performed to assess whether the results in our meta-analysis were conclusive.
This systematic review and meta-analysis included 22 observational studies of symptomatic patients. When comparing SU-AVR to TAVR, similar risk of in-hospital mortality (RR 0.67, 95 % CI 0.37-1.24, p = 0.20, I2 = 15.1 %) and two-year mortality (RR 0.73, 95 % CI 0.39-1.37, p = 0.32, I2 = 61.5 %) were noted. However, SU-AVR was associated with significantly lower 30-day mortality (RR 0.46, 95 % CI 0.28-0.75, p = 0.002, I2 = 0.9 %), total number of valvular leakages (RR 0.13, 95 % CI 0.05-0.32, p < 0.00, I2 = 59.5 %), and one-year mortality (RR 0.51, 95 % CI 0.32-0.80, p = 0.003, I2 = 0.0 %). In the TSA analysis, 30-day mortality, one-year mortality, and total leakage rate showed true-positive results in the method. The two-year mortality rate yielded false-negative results due to the too low required information size.
In patients with aortic stenosis, SU-AVR was associated with similar in-hospital mortality and two-year mortality rates compared with TAVR; however, it was associated with significantly lower 30-day mortality, total number of valvular leakages, and one-year mortality rates."

ODYSSEY-HCM was a phase 3, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial that enrolled adults with symptomatic nHCM and left ventricular ejection fraction ≥ 60% to receive mavacamten, a selective cardiac myosin inhibitor, or placebo for 48 weeks with dose titration guided by serial echocardiography. The co-primary endpoints were the change in peak oxygen uptake and the 23-item Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire clinical summary score. Mavacamten produced clear pharmacodynamic effects manifested by reductions in circulating markers of myocardial stress and imaging indices consistent with modest reverse remodelling, but it did not produce statistically significant improvement in the prespecified co-primary clinical endpoints at 48 weeks. Treatment was associated with an increased incidence of reversible reductions in ejection fraction necessitating protocol-mandated dose interruption, indicating a constrained therapeutic window in this cohort. Collectively, the data demonstrate target engagement without definitive patient-centered benefit over the study interval. Further evaluation is required, including randomized trials of agents with alternative pharmacokinetic and titration properties, studies with extended exposure, and phenotype-enriched enrollment, to determine whether biomarker and imaging responses can be translated into sustained improvements in functional capacity and health-related quality of life in patients with nHCM."

We retrospectively analyzed 123 patients with suspected AIS who underwent both brain CTP and whole-body CT between April 2022 and May 2025. Image quality, vascular and parenchymal CT values, diagnostic findings, and incidence of post-contrast acute kidney injury (PC-AKI) were assessed. A control group of 115 patients who underwent dynamic contrast-enhanced CT of the chest and abdomen was used for comparison.
The proposed protocol achieved high CT values (≥ 350 HU) in major vessels and comparable CT enhancement in organs compared to the control group. Visual assessment yielded very high scores (vessels, 4.975; organs, 3.725) and complete inter-reader agreement (vessels, k = 0.98; organs, k = 0.877). Only one patient (0.8%) who underwent mechanical thrombectomy developed PC-AKI. Whole-body CT revealed clinically significant vascular disease (including aortic dissection, pulmonary embolism, and severe carotid stenosis) in 14.6% of cases and incidental suspected malignancy in 5.7% of cases.
Following brain CTP, whole-body CT enables the detection of significant vascular and incidental findings in patients with suspected AIS and provides valuable diagnostic information. This protocol, which utilizes low-tube voltage and SPBI, is a simple, time-efficient, and safe method that enhances vascular and organ contrast, supporting its clinical utility in AIS diagnosis."

In addition, whether high volume surgeons are more able to rescue intra-operative complications has not been well studied.
This study analysed all complex abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) repairs in the Vascular Quality Initiative from 2014 to 2023. Multilevel logistic regression with inverse probability weighting was used to identify factors associated with lack of technical success (defined as successful introduction of the main graft, incorporation of all target vessels without occlusion or stenosis > 50%, and no type I/III endoleaks). Secondary analyses assessed the differential impact of type I/III endoleaks compared with graft/target vessel complications.
There were 6 556 repairs (3 246 para/juxtarenal AAAs and 3 310 thoraco-abdominal aortic aneurysms) with an overall technical success rate of 82.7%; technical failures were due to type I/III endoleak in 9.6%, target vessel complications in 5.6%, and complications with the main body in 4.0%. Technical success increased in concert with volume in crude and adjusted analyses. Technical failure was associated with a markedly higher adjusted odds of peri-operative death, thoraco-abdominal life altering events, acute kidney injury, dialysis, spinal cord ischaemia, and re-operation. Repairs with technical failure at the hands of higher volume surgeons were less likely to experience death than cases of technical failure in the hands of lower volume surgeons (p < .01 for interaction). Technical success was similarly associated with higher 5 year survival (86% vs. 65%; p < .001). Both type I/III endoleaks and branch/main body complications were associated with worse peri-operative outcomes and lower 5 year survival. Although type I/III endoleaks had less impact than branch/main body complications in elective settings, in symptomatic/ruptured settings.
Technical success had a strong association with outcomes of endovascular complex AAA repair, especially in non-elective settings. Higher volume surgeons had higher rates of technical success, and their outcomes were less negatively impacted by technical failures, suggesting a potential benefit to centralising more urgent and complex cases."

Advances,"Women with significant aortic stenosis (AS) are under-represented among patients undergoing aortic valve replacement in the United States as compared with men despite similar disease prevalence.
This study evaluated the impact of sex on the clinical recognition of significant AS following diagnostic transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE).
Using data from a large administrative multicenter database, we assessed rates of clinical diagnosis of AS defined by assignment of an Internal Classification Diagnosis (ICD) code for AS following a diagnostic TTE. Fine-Gray models were used to evaluate the 1-year cumulative rate of AS diagnosis by sex, AS severity, and AS phenotype accounting for competing risk of death.
Among 2,036 included patients (48.9% female, 51.1% male), the 1-year rate of clinical recognition following a diagnostic TTE with at least moderate AS was low (52.4%), and women were less likely as compared with men to receive a clinical diagnosis of AS (55.7% male vs 48.9% female; P = 0.003). Specifically, among patients with severe AS, women were less likely to receive an ICD diagnosis as compared with males (64.1% vs 74.3%), driven primarily by lower rates of clinical recognition of severe low gradient AS (66.9% male vs 54.3% female; P = 0.004).
Rates of clinical recognition of AS following a diagnostic TTE are low, and vary significantly by sex, AS disease severity, and severe AS phenotype. Further studies are needed to maximize the clinical recognition of TTE-confirmed AS and to mitigate sex disparities in diagnosis and treatment."

The disease's progression is driven by a combination of mechanical stress, lipid infiltration, and immune responses, which involve both innate and adaptive immune systems. To explore the role of immune-related proteins in CAVD, we applied a targeted proteomic approach based on the proximity extension assay technique. Ten proteins were downregulated in patients with CAVD with respect to control subjects, indicating disrupted biological processes such as redox homeostasis, immune response, and cell motility. A protein-protein interaction network revealed connections between these proteins, with notable clusters associated with immune regulation and redox homeostasis. Further analysis identified two distinct patient subgroups, suggesting heterogeneity among patients with CAVD, which could help with patient stratification. The study identified proteins that may serve as candidate biomarkers for early detection of CAVD and emphasizes the role of immune-driven mechanisms in CAVD."

With treatment for severe AS limited to valve replacement and no effective pharmacotherapies, new interventions are urgently needed for patients. This study evaluated pemafibrate, a selective peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha (PPARα) activator as a novel therapeutic for CAVD and AS.
In an aortic valve wire injury (AVWI) model of AS in Ldlr ⁻/⁻ mice, pemafibrate administration (0.2 mg/kg/day) for 15 weeks improved aortic valve function and reduced valvular calcification by 39% (p<0.001), accompanied by reduced leaflet inflammation and CD68⁺ macrophage infiltration. These effects were independent of changes in plasma triglyceride levels. In vitro , pemafibrate suppressed inflammation-mediated calcification of primary human valvular interstitial cells (VICs) by modulating macrophage-derived secreted factors, identifying macrophage-VIC crosstalk as a key disease mechanism. Direct treatment of macrophages with pemafibrate, or exposure to serum from pemafibrate-treated participants in the PROMINENT randomized controlled trial, shifted macrophages toward a less inflammatory and less chemotactic phenotype. Proteomic analyses of patient serum substantiated these findings by reflecting a systemic reduction in inflammatory parameters and monocyte activation. Network integration of the in vitro derived pemafibrate-responsive proteome with human calcified AV tissue proteomes identified aberrant protein translation (GNB2L1, GSPT1) and disrupted bioenergetics (MYDGF, PDIA4) as potential clinically relevant pemafibrate-responsive pathways and effector proteins relevant to AS progression.
Pemafibrate slows experimental AS progression and valve calcification through modulation of macrophage-VIC crosstalk, independent of lipid lowering. These findings support further evaluation of pemafibrate as a potential pharmacological approach for CAVD and support further testing in randomized clinical trials."

Imaging methods and practice,"Bicuspid aortic valve (BAV) stenosis complicates transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) planning, with no validated automated measurement algorithm available. We developed Cardioverse, the first fully automated deep learning algorithm for BAV anatomical assessment in TAVR planning.
We conducted a large-scale, multicenter retrospective study encompassing 1,147 consecutive patients with BAV undergoing TAVR across 16 high-volume Chinese centers (March 2019-February 2023). Cardioverse was trained on this cohort and evaluated in an internal (n = 437) and external (n = 110) validation cohorts. Our novel Cardioverse algorithm demonstrated exceptional segmentation performance across all anatomical targets with Dice similarity coefficients >0.97 for coronary cusps and ostia. Critically, the algorithm achieved unprecedented workflow efficiency gains: 80% reduction in assessment time [241.0 IQR (181.0, 297.0) vs. 1251.0 IQR (872.0, 1408.0) seconds], 85% reduction in user interactions [57.0 IQR (45.0, 78.0) vs. 382.5 IQR (285.5, 475.0) clicks], and 87% reduction in manual effort [7.5 IQR (4.8, 9.3) vs. 57.2 IQR (43.5, 68.4) meters mouse movement] compared to expert observers (P < 0.001). Importantly, accuracy was maintained across all BAV phenotypes with correlation coefficients >0.91 for all critical measurements, including annular dimensions, calcification quantification, and aortic root morphology assessment.
Cardioverse transforms pre-TAVR assessment for BAV patients, offering a validated solution combining accuracy and efficiency. It reduces assessment time from over 20 min to < 5 min, addressing the need for standardized, rapid, and reliable BAV evaluation. Its robust performance across diverse BAV phenotypes makes it a crucial tool for enhancing TAVR planning consistency.

In parallel, the number and types of TAV prosthesis have also increased. Although all devices have generally demonstrated favourable procedural and longer-term clinical outcomes, variations in frame design, material properties and leaflet configurations render specific devices more favourable in certain settings. In this review, we describe key differences in TAV design and how this may affect the choice of TAV prosthesis in the challenging clinical scenarios of patients with small annuli, coronary disease, long life expectancy, risk of permanent pacing and aortic regurgitation, which are expected to be encountered more frequently as indications for TAV implantation expand."

He was admitted with a complaint of exertional and persistent chest pain, accompanied by electrocardiographic changes suggestive of anterior ST-elevation myocardial infarction. Initial investigations, including coronary angiography and optical coherence tomography, revealed unobstructed coronary arteries and no evidence of plaque disruption. Transthoracic echocardiography demonstrated marked asymmetric septal hypertrophy with mild systolic anterior motion of the mitral valve and eccentric mitral regurgitation, in the absence of a resting or provoked left ventricular outflow tract gradient. Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging further confirmed a diagnosis of non-obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM), with late gadolinium enhancement indicating patchy mid-septal and basal fibrosis. In view of these findings, dual antiplatelet therapy was discontinued, and the patient was managed with beta-blockers. He was discharged with plans for outpatient cardiology follow-up, risk stratification for sudden cardiac death, and genetic evaluation. This case highlights the potential for HCM to mimic acute coronary syndromes, particularly in a patient with cardiovascular risk factors, ischaemic ECG changes and ongoing chest pain. It underscores the diagnostic value of advanced imaging modalities in differentiating true myocardial infarction from phenocopies, thereby guiding appropriate and timely management."

Awareness of this phenomenon and careful post-procedure monitoring are essential, especially in high-risk individuals. We report the case of a 76-year-old male with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (18%), severe mitral and tricuspid regurgitation, a dual-chamber implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD), prior percutaneous coronary intervention, left ventricular thrombus, hypertension, and a renal transplant, who presented with worsening dyspnoea. On admission, he was found to be in monomorphic ventricular tachycardia (VT) at 150 bpm with hypotension (80/46 mmHg). Synchronised cardioversion with 50 J successfully restored sinus rhythm. Fourteen hours later, he developed acute respiratory distress, and chest imaging demonstrated new bilateral perihilar opacities consistent with pulmonary oedema. He was treated with intravenous furosemide, a glyceryl trinitrate infusion, and non-invasive ventilation, resulting in rapid clinical improvement. ICD interrogation confirmed a prolonged VT episode with a therapy threshold set too high for detection, prompting reprogramming of the VT zone to 130 bpm. The patient was discharged in stable condition after six days. This case underscores that APO after cardioversion may present in a delayed fashion and may be overlooked without prolonged observation. It also highlights the relevance of cardioversion performed for VT, prolonged pre-existing arrhythmic burden, and multiple comorbidities in predisposing patients to post-cardioversion haemodynamic decompensation. Vigilant monitoring and early intervention are crucial to improving outcomes in high-risk patients."

We report a Japanese family with cardiac valvular dysplasia. The proband was diagnosed with multiple valve dysplasia at a primary school health checkup. He also exhibited skin hyperextensibility and joint hypermobility. His younger monozygotic twin brothers were diagnosed with multiple valve dysplasia during their 1-month pediatric checkups. One of them exhibited severe valvular disease and required aortic and mitral valve replacement at age 16 due to progressive regurgitation. All three patients showed no developmental delay or evidence of periventricular nodular heterotopia on brain MRI. We identified a novel hemizygous FLNA variant, NM_001456.4(FLNA):c.2023-6_2026delinsACGCT, in all three patients. Splicing analysis revealed an in-frame deletion of two amino acids, p.Val675_Lys676del. No significant difference was observed in overall expression levels of FLNA transcript between the patient and a healthy individual. In silico structural modeling revealed that this deletion disrupts an α-helix positioned between β-strands of domains 4 and 5, which would impair the structural stability of FLNA. This variant was not found in public genomic databases. In conclusion, we identified a novel likely pathogenic variant in FLNA, p.Val675_Lys676del, the smallest in-frame deletion reported to date in XCVD. Patients with this variant showed variable severity, and some presented with extracardiac features. Our findings expand both the genetic and phenotypic spectrum of XCVD."

It may present with systemic anomalies (Axenfeld-Rieger syndrome) or without (Axenfeld anomaly) and may sometimes be associated with multiple congenital malformations. The estimated prevalence ranges from 1 in 50,000 to 1 in 200,000 live births, with an approximate rate of 1 in 100,000, but no epidemiological studies have been conducted to date. A clinical diagnosis of Axenfeld-Rieger syndrome requires the presence of both Axenfeld and Rieger ocular anomalies, accompanied by extraocular systemic features. Ocular manifestations include iris abnormalities, posterior embryotoxon, juvenile-onset glaucoma (a common complication), and dysgenesis of the iridocorneal angle with iridocorneal adhesions. The most commonly observed systemic anomalies include: umbilical defects; craniofacial dysmorphism; dentofacial abnormalities, such as Class III malocclusion due to maxillary hypoplasia, oligodontia, dental malformations (taurodontism, root dysplasia), microdontia, hypodontia, and anodontia; hearing impairment (partial or complete sensorineural hearing loss); and cardiac anomalies, including non-congenital heart disease and mitral valve insufficiency. Additional anomalies may include hypospadias in males, anal stenosis, endocrine disorders (notably growth retardation) secondary to pituitary dysfunction, psychomotor delay, and various neurological malformations such as Dandy-Walker malformation, mega cisterna magna, posterior fossa cysts, cerebellar vermis hypoplasia, ventriculomegaly, aprosencephaly, cerebral atrophy, microcephaly, arteriovenous malformations (AVM), and digital anomalies such as camptodactyly. Diagnosis is typically made in infancy, based on iris anomalies such as corectopia (displacement of the pupil), polycoria (multiple pupils), and iris hypoplasia. Posterior embryotoxon is frequently observed upon slit-lamp examination. Given the clinical variability, a comprehensive pediatric assessment is essential to identify systemic anomalies and distinguish Axenfeld-Rieger syndrome from the isolated Axenfeld anomaly."
PubMed,mitral regurgitation,Is there still a role for isolated mitral valve surgery in functional mitral regurgitation? A contemporary review.,Ovidio A García-Villarreal,10.24875/GMM.25000018,2025,Gaceta medica de Mexico,"Functional mitral regurgitation (FMR) is the consequence of a series of geometric and functional alterations in the left ventricle, which precipitate structural changes in the mitral valve (MV). Left ventricular remodeling, whether global or localized, generates abnormal tension or tethering of the papillary muscles and chordae tendineae, thereby compromising proper MV closure. Given that FMR is often associated with coronary artery disease, the surgical indication for concomitant MV surgery with coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) is unequivocal. However, the surgical indication for isolated MV surgery in patients with FMR without the need for CABG or other concomitant surgical procedures is more contentious. Excluding the indications for non-surgical procedures, this article examines the context and current status of isolated MV surgery in FMR. Furthermore, a potential decision-making algorithm for surgical interventions in patients with FMR is presented, based on the current accumulated evidence."

Case reports,"Libman-Sacks endocarditis is a form of non-bacterial thrombotic endocarditis, associated with autoimmune conditions such as systemic lupus erythematosus and antiphospholipid syndrome (APLS). Vegetations are usually small and are managed with immunosuppression and anticoagulation.
A 50-year-old female presented to her hospital with left leg weakness, with imaging showing a right parietal stroke and an old occipital lobe stroke. Inpatient transthoracic echocardiography showed a large mitral valve (MV) vegetation with moderate-to-severe mitral regurgitation (MR). She self-discharged against medical advice before further workup could be completed and was lost to follow-up until persuaded to have an outpatient transoesophageal echocardiogram, which showed severe MR with a large (2 cm × 3 cm) mass attached to the posterior MV leaflet. Blood cultures were negative. Review of previous blood tests showed a triple-positive APLS panel, which was positive on repeat testing. She underwent successful mechanical MV replacement. Valve histology was consistent with Libman-Sacks endocarditis. Warfarin therapy was continued, complicated by subdural haematoma (successfully treated), but with no further thrombo-embolic events. Subsequent anti-nuclear antigen testing was positive, and hydroxychloroquine was commenced. Transoesophageal echocardiography 1 year later showed a well-functioning MV prosthesis.
The management of young individuals with ischaemic stroke should include attention to atypical causes. Libman-Sacks endocarditis is usually associated with small vegetations and high thrombotic risk, usually managed medically with anticoagulation and treatment of underlying conditions. Our case was atypical, with the presence of a large vegetation causing significant valvular dysfunction, but it demonstrates that replacement with mechanical prostheses can be a feasible management strategy."

We sought to: validate right ventricular (RV) stroke volumes (SV3DE) and tricuspid regurgitant volumes (RegVol3DE) measured by three-dimensional echocardiography (3DE). Then, we compared the quantitative metrics used to assess TR severity obtained by 3DE and both the conventional and the corrected PISA methods.
3DE RV and left ventricular (LV) SV were collected simultaneously with direct Fick measurements at right heart catheterization (RVSVRHC) in 45 patients (66±14 years, 76% women) with no or trivial TR, and in 57 consecutive patients (73±13 years, 61% women) with mild to torrential (14% mild, 37% moderate, 26% severe, 16% massive, and 7% torrential) TR, and mild or no mitral or aortic regurgitation. In the latter group, RHC and 3DE were combined to derive TR regurgitant volume (RegVol3DE-RHC=RVSV3DE-RVSVRHC) and compared to the 3DE volumetric RegVol (RegVol3DE =RVSV3DE-LVSV3DE). Effective regurgitant orifice area (EROA) and regurgitant fraction (RegFr) were calculated from RegVol3DE, as well as through conventional and corrected PISA methods.
The feasibility of RVSV3DE was 74%. Among patients with no or trivial TR, RVSV3DE and RVSVRHC showed a strong correlation (R2= 0.916, p<0.0001), with a minimal bias (3.7 mL) and reasonable precision (limits of agreement, LOA: -10 mL;18 mL). In those with mild to torrential TR, RegVol3DE correlated with RegVol3DE-RHC (R2=0.918, p<0.0001) and was accurate (bias= -1.3 mL, LOA:-17.9 mL;15.2 mL). EROA, RegVol and RegFr derived from conventional PISA (0.48±0.4 cm2, 38±20 mL, and 36±18%, respectively) were significantly smaller (p<0.05) than those obtained from corrected PISA (0.61±0.5 cm2, 48±24 mL, and 46±24 %, respectively), and volumetric 3DE (0.62±0.5 cm2, 46±25 mL, and 42±18%, respectively).
RVSV measured by 3DE is accurate (minimal bias, acceptable imprecision) when compared to direct Fick RVSVRHC."

Although left ventricular systolic function is usually preserved, subclinical myocardial dysfunction may be present. Global longitudinal strain (GLS) is a sensitive parameter for detecting early myocardial impairment.
This study aimed to evaluate subclinical myocardial dysfunction in children with ARF-related carditis using GLS and other strain parameters and to assess its progression over a one-year follow-up period according to the severity of mitral regurgitation (MR).
A total of 30 children with ARF-related carditis and preserved systolic function were prospectively enrolled. Patients were divided into two subgroups based on MR severity: moderate MR (Group 1, n = 12) and mild MR (Group 2, n = 18). Conventional echocardiographic parameters and speckle-tracking-derived strain measures were assessed at diagnosis, six months, and 12 months. GLS values were compared with those of age- and sex-matched healthy controls (n = 52).
At diagnosis, GLS was significantly lower in ARF patients than controls (-19.9 ± 2.86 vs. -22.6 ± 4.65; p = 0.02) and at six months (-20.4 ± 3.42 vs. -22.6 ± 4.65, p = 0.04). Although GLS improved in the mild MR subgroup (-21.9 ± 3.82 vs. -22.6 ± 4.65, p = 0.41), it remained significantly impaired in the moderate MR subgroup (-19.25 ± 3.32 vs. -22.6 ± 4.65, p < 0.01) at 12 months. In multivariable linear regression analysis, GLS was negatively correlated with the severity of valve regurgitation (r = -0.53, p = 0.02) and NT-proBNP (r = -0.62, p = 0.012).
GLS and NT-proBNP are sensitive indicators of subclinical myocardial dysfunction in children with ARF-related carditis, especially in those with moderate MR. Longitudinal strain imaging may enhance early detection and guide long-term monitoring."

Two investigators independently screened the literature, extracted data, and evaluated the quality of the included studies. Meta-analysis was performed using Stata18.0 software.
Finally, 23 studies were included, all of which scored ≥7 on the Newcastle-Ottawa scale. Meta-analysis results showed that, the left ventricular end-systolic volume index (P < 0.01), left ventricular end-diastolic volume index (P < 0.01), and left ventricular mass index (P < 0.01) of patients with MR were higher than those of healthy individuals. In contrast, the left ventricular ejection fraction (P < 0.01) and global radial strain (GRS) (P < 0.01) of patients with MR was lower than that of healthy individuals; the difference was significant. The E/A of both groups (P = 0.22), global circumferential strain (P = 0.43), global longitudinal strain (P = 0.10), left ventricular relative wall thickness (P = 0.20), and some indexes with significant heterogeneity were analyzed by subgroup according to the degree of MR. The combined results of most subgroup analysis were consistent with the overall results and the heterogeneity was reduced.
There is significant difference in the GRS between patients with MR and healthy individuals, which can provide reference for evaluating left ventricular function in patients with MR."

Case reports,"Infective endocarditis caused by Lactobacillus rhamnosus is extremely rare, particularly in immunocompetent patients without structural heart disease or recent invasive procedures.
A 42-year-old immunocompetent man with no structural heart disease or recent interventions presented with fever and dyspnoea. Blood cultures grew L. rhamnosus. Transoesophageal echocardiography revealed a large vegetation on the aortic valve causing severe regurgitation, along with severe mitral regurgitation due to anterior leaflet perforation. The only identifiable risk factor was regular probiotic consumption. The patient underwent successful double valve replacement and completed 6 weeks of antibiotic therapy with favourable outcome.
A literature review identified 22 published cases of L. rhamnosus endocarditis. Most were associated with underlying valvular disease, invasive procedures, or probiotic use. This case highlights the need to consider Lactobacillus spp. as a potential pathogen, not merely a contaminant, in the appropriate clinical context, and calls for careful patient selection and monitoring when prescribing probiotics."

Medical therapy alone is insufficient, and either TEER (transcatheter edge to edge) or surgery is recommended. Short- and long-term comparative outcomes remain unclear. We aim to address this gap using available data.
We performed a meta-analysis of studies examining the outcomes of surgery and/or transcatheter edge to edge. MEDLINE, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Library were assessed. The incidence rate of late severe MR was the primary outcome. A random model was performed. Leave-one-out, subgroup, and meta-regression analyses were conducted.
Thirty-two studies (1923 patients); 20 in surgery [1166] vs 12 in TEER [757]) were selected. TEER patients were, on average, 10 years older, with twice the rate of NYHA III/IV symptoms and more than double the STS score. At a weighted mean follow-up of 3.2 years, compared to isolated transcatheter, surgery was associated with decreased incidence of late severe mitral regurgitation (2.53 vs 6.66 events per 100 person-years, P-interaction = 0.03), late all-cause mortality (3.00 vs 8.84, P-interaction = 0.024), late heart failure hospitalization (4.44 vs 17.03, P-interaction < 0.01), and late NYHA III/IV (2.98 vs 22.47, P-interaction < 0.01). However, significantly better long-term outcomes associated with surgery showed high heterogeneity. There were no differences in early all-cause mortality, early cardiac-specific mortality, late cardiac-specific mortality, postprocedural morbidities nor atrial diameter. On meta-regression, preprocedural heart failure (Beta = 0.0224, P < 0.01) and coronary artery disease (Beta = 0.0294, P < 0.00001) were linked to increased late severe mitral regurgitation. Older age, hypertension, mitral valve replacement, and associated aortic valve surgery were linked to increased late all-cause mortality.
Surgery and isolated transcatheter edge-to-edge repair showed comparable short-term outcomes, with surgery appearing more effective long-term; however, due to study limitations and heterogeneity, these findings are hypothesis-generating and require validation through prospective studies."

Understanding the mechanism of MR, whether primary, due to intrinsic valve abnormalities, or secondary, resulting from atrial or ventricular remodeling, is essential for optimal management. Echocardiography, particularly advanced modalities such as three-dimensional imaging and strain analysis, plays a central role in this process. It allows accurate quantification of MR severity, detailed characterization of valve and ventricular anatomy, and assessment of remodeling, all of which are critical for determining the optimal timing for intervention. Beyond diagnosis, echocardiography is indispensable in guiding therapy selection: it informs surgical planning by defining leaflet pathology for repair versus replacement strategies, and directs transcatheter interventions by guiding interatrial septal puncture, catheter orientation, and device deployment in real time. While surgery remains the gold standard for primary MR, transcatheter approaches including edge-to-edge repair and emerging mitral valve replacement are increasingly relevant, particularly in patients at high surgical risk or with complex anatomy. This review emphasizes the pivotal role of echocardiography in the pre-procedural assessment of MR, highlighting its ability to integrate anatomical, functional, and hemodynamic information to guide patient-tailored therapeutic strategies and optimize outcomes within a Heart Team framework."

A substantial portion of patients with cardiogenic shock have concomitant severe mitral regurgitation (MR), which exacerbates hemodynamic instability by reducing forward cardiac output and contributes to pulmonary edema and respiratory failure through regurgitant backflow. In this high-risk setting, mitral transcatheter edge-to-edge repair (M-TEER) offers a minimally invasive treatment that can lead to hemodynamic and symptomatic improvement and potential mortality benefit. Initially indicated for patients with severe MR at prohibitive surgical risk, M-TEER is now guideline-supported for both primary and secondary MR in select populations. Emerging data suggest that M-TEER can reduce heart failure hospitalizations and improve patient quality of life. As clinical indications for M-TEER continue to expand, there is growing interest in the role of M-TEER as a stabilizing intervention in patients with cardiogenic shock and severe MR. This review aims to synthesize the current evidence surrounding the use of M-TEER in cardiogenic shock with a focus on patient selection, procedural and clinical considerations, and short- and long-term outcomes."

Several different transcatheter approaches were developed as therapeutic options in high-risk patients. Among them, the Carillon® Mitral Contour System, which offers a minimally invasive, trans- coronary-venous approach to indirect annuloplasty that reduces annular dimensions and improves leaflet coaptation without the need for transseptal access or manipulation of the mitral valve apparatus. A key advantage of Carillon lies in its extracardiac, leaflet-sparing mechanism. By acting from the lumen of coronary sinus and great cardiac vein, the device preserves the possibility of future interventions such as transcatheter edge-to-edge repair, direct annuloplasty, or even valve replacement, while still allowing successful placement of left ventricular pacing leads for cardiac resynchronization therapy. The current article provides the Carillon device characteristics and technical aspects of implantation procedure. The paper is an overview of the clinical studies and real-world registries conducted on the Carillon device, and the effectiveness of this treatment for functional mitral regurgitation. We also discuss possible future perspectives of the Carillon device applications like treating patients with mild FMR, in combination with other treatment modalities, approaches or atrial form of FMR."

There was a wide regional variation in the nomograms used for prenatal assessment of the tricuspid valve. More than half did not consider prenatal valvuloplasty (54.3%), and those who did diverged in selection criteria. Postnatally, in mild-moderately hypoplastic right ventricle, most opted to first assess the tricuspid valve z-score (60%) whereas others would always attempt a biventricular pathway (30.8%). The majority opted to perform cardiac catheterization in all cases to assess ventriculo-coronary connections (60.6%). If right ventricle-dependent coronary circulation was confirmed, 66.7% would opt for single ventricle palliation, whereas 15.9% would directly list for transplant.

Echocardiography was performed in 22 patients (15%), with only 2 (1%) diagnosed with definite IE: one had a prosthetic valve, and both persistent bacteraemia. The 30-day mortality rate was 29% and the 6-month cumulative mortality was 55%. Six patients (7%) experienced relapse, with no new IE diagnoses.
Systematic IE screening may not be warranted in this population and should instead be individualised on the basis of clinical risk factors."

The authors theorized that dogs with conditions associated with RVRP, including pulmonic stenosis (PS) and precapillary pulmonary hypertension (PH), would have an increased EDFF magnitude compared to normal dogs and that EDFF velocity in dogs with PS or PH would be correlated with disease severity and RV remodeling.
Echocardiographic studies of client-owned dogs, including 50 each with PS or PH and 12 without heart disease, were retrospectively reviewed to obtain maximum EDFF velocity and right heart structural measurements. Differences between EDFF velocities in dogs with PS or PH and dogs in their respective age- and weight-matched control groups were assessed using Mann-Whitney U non-parametric tests. Spearman's rho non-parametric correlations were evaluated between EDFF velocity, right heart structural measurements, and PS and PH severity indices.
Maximum EDFF velocity was significantly higher in dogs with PS (P < 0.001) or PH (P=0.018) than in controls. In PS dogs, EDFF velocity was positively correlated with RV free wall thickness (P=0.047) and pulmonic valve peak pressure gradient (P=0.007).
Retrospective study design impacted case selection and echocardiographic measurement accuracy.
The results of this study support the presence of RVRP in dogs with PS and PH. The contrasting associations of EDFF and RV dimensions with PS severity versus PH highlight differences in RV remodeling between these diseases."

This study aimed to develop a deep learning-based artificial intelligence (AI) model to detect MS using CXR.
In this retrospective study, 515 posteroanterior CXR images were analysed, including 285 from patients with MS and 230 from healthy controls. The dataset was randomly divided into training, validation and test datasets at a 7:2:1 ratio. An AI model was formulated by using the training dataset, and model performance was evaluated on the validation and test datasets using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), precision, recall, F1-score and accuracy. Saliency maps were generated to visualise the regions prioritised by the model.
The model achieved an AUC of 0.99 on the validation dataset, with a precision of 0.96, recall of 0.96, F1-score of 0.96 and accuracy of 0.96. On the test dataset, the model achieved an AUC of 0.99, with a precision of 0.95, recall of 0.94, F1-score of 0.94 and accuracy of 0.94. Saliency maps highlighted regions consistent with known radiographic features of MS.
The developed deep learning-based AI model demonstrated high performance in detecting MS from CXR. This approach may provide a convenient and accessible screening tool for MS, particularly in resource-limited areas."

Cardiovascular interventions,"Patients with severe aortic regurgitation (AR) frequently face high surgical risks, rendering them ineligible for surgery. Transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) is now a primary therapy for aortic valve stenosis. However, its application in pure native AR has been relatively limited.
The aim of this study was to evaluate the mid-term efficacy and safety of a novel self-expanding transfemoral TAVR device designed for treating pure native AR.
A prospective, single-arm clinical trial (ChiCTR2300075152) enrolled 110 consecutive patients with severe pure AR from 15 centers. The Pioneer Valve system with a rotatable feature and 3 independently angle-adjustable locators was used. Outcomes up to 1-year follow-up were reported per Valve Academic Research Consortium 3 criteria. The median clinical follow-up duration was 348 days (Q1-Q3: 342-357 days).
The mean age was 73.37 ± 4.21 years, with a median Society of Thoracic Surgeons score of 5.97% (Q1-Q3: 4.04%-8.63%). Technical success was achieved in 109 of 110 cases (99.1%), and valve migration occurred in 1 case. Mean aortic valve gradient and mean effective orifice area at 30 days were 7.88 ± 2.7 mm Hg and 2.2 ± 0.64 cm2, respectively. New permanent pacemaker implantation occurred in 23 of 105 cases (21.9%; 95% CI: 14.3%-29.8%). All-cause mortality was 3 of 110 (2.7%; 95% CI: 0.9%-8.3%) at 1 year. Significant improvements in NYHA functional class, Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire score, and positive left ventricular remodeling were observed up to 1 year.
This study demonstrates that the Pioneer Valve provides a safe and effective alternative for high-risk or inoperable patients with severe pure AR, achieving favorable mid-term outcomes with stable hemodynamic performance."

We assessed the clinical profile, treatment, and outcomes of older HF patients managed in accredited units in Spain.
The SEC-Excelente-HF registry prospectively included 2,245 consecutive patients from 68 accredited HF units (2019-2023). Patients were stratified by age (< 75 years, n = 1267; ≥ 75 years, n = 973). Both hospitalized and outpatient patients were followed for 1 year. Data on demographics, comorbidities, therapies, and devices were collected. Primary outcomes were all-cause mortality, HF hospitalization, and their composite. Multivariable Cox models identified independent predictors of outcomes by age group.
Median age was 73 years, and 43.4% were ≥ 75 years. Older patients had higher prevalences of atrial fibrillation, valvular heart disease, chronic kidney disease, and anemia (all p < 0.001). Use of guideline-directed medical therapy was consistently lower in older patients, including RAAS inhibitors (69.2% vs 81.1%), beta-blockers (73.8% vs 87.1%), MRAs (46.2% vs 70.5%), and SGLT2 inhibitors (42.0% vs 62.4%; all p < 0.001). At 1 year, event-free survival was 66.3% in older vs 77.0% in younger patients (p < 0.001). In older patients, independent predictors of the composite outcome included prior HF, anemia, malnutrition, functional disability, advanced chronic kidney disease, and CRT/ICD implantation.
Despite specialized care, older HF patients in accredited units exhibit a higher comorbidity burden, lower use of evidence-based therapies, and worse outcomes than younger patients. Enhanced multidisciplinary strategies are needed to improve prognosis in this growing population."

This study evaluates the reproducibility of virtual non-contrast (VNC) reconstructions at different slice intervals using photon-counting detector CT (PCD-CT). Methods: In this retrospective study, we included 279 consecutive patients, who underwent PCD-CT for evaluation of native aortic valve between February 2023 and December 2023 with both TNC and VNC images at 3.0 and 1.5 mm slice intervals. Aortic valve calcium score (AVCS) and aortic valve calcium volume (AVCV) were compared between the two methods using paired t-tests. Agreement for continuous variables was assessed using inter-class coefficients (ICCs). Cohen's Kappa (κ) was calculated to evaluate the agreement between different modalities in diagnosing severe AV calcification. Results: Compared to the standard, TNC images at 1.5 mm intervals showed higher AVCS (mean difference: -290 ± 418, p < 0.001), with high reproducibility between techniques (CS: ICC 0.969, [IQR 0.962, 0.975]). Compared with reference, VNC showed no significant differences in AVCS at either slice intervals, with excellent reproducibility (3.0 mm, ICC 0.970 [0.963, 0.976]; 1.5 mm, ICC 0.971 [0.964, 0.977]). Compared to TNC 3.0 mm, strong concordance was observed using other reconstruction techniques in assessing severe AV calcification (κ = 0.81 [95% CI: 0.74-0.88], 0.83 [95% CI: 0.76-0.90], and 0.83 [95% CI: 0.76-0.90] for TNC at 1.5 mm, VNC at 3.0 mm, and 1.5 mm, respectively), with low misclassification rates. Conclusions: Our study highlights high reproducibility in the evaluation of AVCS by VNC reconstruction at 3.0 and 1.5 mm intervals compared with reference offering a reliable alternative with an excellent diagnostic accuracy."

Currently, there is no established, evidence-based medical therapy specifically designed for SRV failure, and treatment approaches are largely extrapolated from left ventricular heart failure (HF) guidelines. This therapeutic gap highlights the need for tailored pharmacologic strategies and optimized perioperative management in this unique population. The optimal timing of surgical intervention and the role of modern HF therapy are still under active investigation. (2) Methods: We present a case series of four patients (three adults and one child) with SRV dysfunction and severe TR, who underwent staged treatment consisting of optimized medical therapy followed by surgical tricuspid valve (TV) replacement. Medical therapy included positive inotropes, sacubitril/valsartan, sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 inhibitors (iSGLT2), beta-blockers, mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists (MRAs), and loop diuretics. (3) Results: All patients demonstrated clinical and hemodynamic improvement prior to surgery, with an increase in systemic ventricular ejection fraction (SVEF > 40%) and cardiac index. TV replacement was performed with favorable early postoperative outcomes and preserved ventricular function at mid-term follow-up. No mortality or major adverse events occurred during follow-up. One case of acute cystitis was associated with dapagliflozin. In all patients, postoperative SVEF remained >40%, and no recurrence of significant TR was observed. (4) Conclusions: A stepwise approach combining modern heart failure therapy and elective TV replacement in patients with SRV dysfunction and TR is safe and effective. Preoperative optimization leads to improved ventricular function and may enhance surgical outcomes. These findings support the integration of contemporary pharmacotherapy in the management strategy for SRV failure."

Transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) has emerged as a minimally invasive and effective alternative to surgical replacement, especially in elderly or high-risk patients. Objectives: The present study aims to assess the influence of the tricuspid annular plane systolic excursion (TAPSE)/pulmonary systolic arterial pressure (PASP) ratio on clinical outcomes in patients with aortic stenosis undergoing TAVR and offer valuable insights into patient selection and tailored management strategies for individuals undergoing TAVR. Methods: A retrospective analysis was conducted on 100 patients with AS who underwent TAVR, included in two distinct groups based on their median TAPSE/PASP ratio. Results: Patients were divided according to their median TAPSE/PASP ratio into two groups. Those with lower TAPSE/PASP ratios had a higher incidence of post-procedural atrial fibrillation (AF) (48% vs. 28%, p = 0.0404), lower left-ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) (41.06% vs. 49.50%, p < 0.0001), a more pronounced inflammatory and hematologic response, and longer hospitalization. Receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) analysis demonstrated modest but significant discrimination rather than high sensitivity or specificity for postprocedural arrhythmias, particularly atrial fibrillation. Conclusions: TAPSE/PASP should be regarded as a clinically useful risk-stratification marker in patients with AS undergoing TAVR, enabling the identification of high-risk patients and optimizing peri-procedural management."

We aim to determine whether G2 valves reduce these specific complications and thereby improve patient outcomes compared with G1. Methods: From February 2015 to September 2022, 1468 patients underwent TAVR at the university clinic in Kiel. After applying exclusion criteria, a final cohort of 1182 patients were analysed. Among these, 782 patients underwent TAVR with G1, whereas 400 underwent TAVR with G2. The primary study endpoints were the occurrence of new CD and PPMI within 30 days post-procedure. The secondary endpoints included diverse post-TAVR events as defined by the safety criteria of Valve Academic Research Consortium 3 (VARC III). A statistical analysis compared outcomes between the G1 and G2 groups. Results: Out of 1182 patients, 12.1% required PPMI within 30 days. Rates showed no statistical difference between G2 and G1 for PPMI (10.3% vs. 13.0%, IPTW-weighted p = 0.31) or CD (15.3% vs. 21.48%, IPTW-weighted p = 0.08). Among G2, the Sapien 3 Ultra valve had the lowest PPMI rate (4.8%). Overall, G2 and G1 had similar post-procedural and 30-day mortality rates. Conclusion: G2 valves may reduce post-procedure CD, but the difference is not statistically significant. Differences between specific valve types-such as the Sapien 3 Ultra's lower rates-are notable, but overall, PPMI and safety profiles remain similar between G1 and G2. Patient and procedural factors still play a significant role. Careful valve and patient selection is essential, and ongoing research will guide further improvements."

Many genetic mutations that cause HCM seem to enhance ventricular systolic function, suggesting that these HCM mutations are hypercontractile. Among the most common causes of HCM are mutations in the gene MYH7, which encodes for β-cardiac myosin, the principal human ventricular myosin. Previous work has demonstrated that, for purified myosins, some MYH7 mutations are gain-of-function while others cause reduced function, so how they lead to enhanced contractility is not clear. Here, we have characterized the mechanics and kinetics of the severe HCM-causing mutation M493I. Motility assays demonstrate a 70% reduction of actin filament gliding velocities on M493I-coated surfaces relative to wild type (WT). This mutation slows ADP release from actomyosin•ADP fivefold without affecting phosphate release or ATP binding. Yet it enhances steady-state ATPase Vmax twofold. Through single-molecule mechanical studies, we find that M493I myosin has a normal working stroke of 5 nm but a significantly prolonged actin attachment duration. Under isometric feedback, M493I myosins produce high, sustained force, with an actin detachment rate that is less sensitive to force than that of WT myosin. We also report direct measurement of the equilibrium state of the super-relaxed to disordered relaxed regulatory transition and show its disruption in M493I, with a concomitant enhancement to actin attachment kinetics. Together, these data demonstrate that enhanced myosin binding from inhibition of myosin's off state, combined with slow ADP release and enhanced force production, underlie the enhanced function and etiology of this HCM mutation."

This research proposes a multimodal deep learning model with a cryptographic framework for securing facial biometric authentication. The multimodal system utilizes a convolutional neural network (CNN), the Residual Network (ResNet-50), and ElGamal cryptography to extract features from the face and secure the user's facial information against spoofing attacks. The face biometric mappings are obtained from the first layer using a CNN with several convolutional layers, which retain spatial features like local texture, essential for the facial mapping function. After the first layer, the results are passed to a ResNet-50, which effectively identifies high-level semantic patterns using skip connections to predict accurate faces under varying pose and lighting conditions. Finally, the predicted face marking is secured using a cryptosystem, specifically the ElGamal cryptography technique, to ensure security and privacy when transmitting facial data within smart city networks. The proposed work utilized the CelebA Faces dataset to evaluate the model's efficiency in secure data transmission within smart cities and to enhance security features that minimize authorization attacks. The facial mapping prediction result for the proposed model is 97.1%, with a low mean score loss of 0.04, indicating that the combined multimodal system performs well in a smart city environment. This performance shows that the proposed fused multimodal approach, which combines CNN low-level feature preservation, ResNet-50 high-level feature extraction, and ElGamal encryption, significantly outperforms the traditional model, such as CNN, with a higher accuracy percentage by 1.2%. ResNet-50 by 2.2%, Brakerski-Gentry-Vaikuntanathan algorithm by 1.1%, showing that the proposed deep learning model effectively handles spoofing and secure data transmission, making it a suitable solution for preventing unauthorized access in futuristic smart cities environments."

The aim of this study is to evaluate the differences in FAI as displayed on CCTA using three different reconstruction algorithms: high-level Deep Learning Image Reconstruction (DLIR-H), adaptive statistical iterative reconstruction-Veo at a level of 50% (ASiR-V50%), and Filtered Back Projection (FBP). Based on the presence or absence of plaque, the population was divided into the following groups: normal, no plaque, non-calcified plaque, mixed plaque, and calcified plaque. Each group was then further analysed according to the reconstruction algorithm, with three subgroups for each: DLIR-H, ASiR-V50%, and FBP. Attenuation values for pericardial adipose tissue, image noise, and the Fat Attenuation Index (FAI) of the three proximal coronary arteries were measured and evaluated for each of the three reconstruction algorithms. The attenuation values of pericardial adipose tissue measured by the three algorithms were not statistically different. However, the FAI measured by DLIR-H was the highest, followed by ASiR-V50%, with FBP yielding the lowest value; all differences were statistically significant. Meanwhile, DLIR-H demonstrated the strongest ability to reduce image noise, whereas FBP showed the weakest ability to do so. FAI varies significantly depending on the algorithm used. Therefore, standardised reconstruction protocols are essential in multicentre and longitudinal studies to ensure accurate, reproducible, and comparable FAI results."

These patterns are critical indicators of the tumor's response to therapy. This study aims to apply deep learning (DL) models for predicting post-brachytherapy tumor response patterns. A cohort of 192 patients participated in this study. B-Mode images taken at the time of diagnosis were collected, and the ophthalmologists labeled the images into four response patterns based on the results of the treatment. DenseNet121 and ResNet34 models were trained and evaluated using performance metrics. DenseNet121 achieved a macro-average AUC of 0.933 (0.95% CI [0.905-0.957]), compared to 0.916 (95%CI [0.884-0.945]) for the ResNet34. The per-class evaluation showed that DenseNet121 excelled in predicting all categories, providing superior predictive accuracy. This difference in classification performance was statistically significant based on the DeLong test (p < 0.05). The ablation study revealed that the best performance was achieved without pretrained weights, using dropout layers and a batch size of 32. Both models demonstrated strong classification capabilities, with DenseNet121 providing the highest overall accuracy. This study highlights the potential of DL models in predicting response patterns in UM patients undergoing brachytherapy. Further validation and exploration of their integration into clinical practice are warranted."

However, a direct causal link from aerosols to DCCs is found to be uncommon, occurring in less than 35% of analyzed scenarios, and is characterized by strong conditionality and nonlinearity. When aerosol impacts on DCCs do occur, they can be substantial, enhancing DCC core heights by approximately 1.7 km, with 92% of this effect concentrated in warmer-phase cloud regions. Notably, the presence of sea breezes and the inclusion of all measured aerosol particles each enhance DCCs in over 95% of aerosol-sensitive cases."

Structural parameters were optimized using a deep neural network (DNN), achieving high absorption rates and displacement values under various operating conditions. The detector exhibits a sensitivity of 3.33 THz/RIU and a figure of merit (FOM) of 66 RIU⁻¹. CST simulations reveal that the absorption peak shifts toward the infrared end as droplet volume increases, toward the blue light end as ethanol concentration rises, and the peak spacing narrows under elevated temperatures. Analysis of magnetic field strength and surface current reveals the operating mechanism: At room temperature, VO₂ plays a negligible role in absorption wave regulation, but its enhanced conductivity at elevated temperatures provides dual assurance for ethanol detection accuracy. This study not only offers an efficient and precise new method for ethanol liquid detection but also provides a reference for future applications in food safety, environmental monitoring, and biomedicine."

The performance of these models was evaluated using three-fold cross-validation, receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves, decision curve analysis (DCA), and calibration curves. The combined deep learning model demonstrated the highest area under the curve (AUC) of 0.879. DCA revealed that the multimodal model provided superior net benefits across most threshold probability ranges for predicting and diagnosing fibrotic NASH. The combined deep learning model based on the ResNet-18 architecture exhibits promising performance in predicting and diagnosing fibrotic NASH."

However, the lightweight Message Queuing Telemetry Transport (MQTT) protocol exposes these systems to severe cyber threats, including DoS, Bruteforce, Malformed, Flood, and Slowite attacks. While machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) models trained on simulated benchmarks, such as MQTTset, have shown promise, evaluation results indicate that these models achieved high accuracy in controlled environments but failed to generalize to real-world traffic. To address this limitation, MQTTEEB-D was introduced as a novel real-world intrusion dataset collected from an operational IoT testbed. Building on MQTTEEB-D, a layered and AI-driven security framework is introduced for real-time intrusion detection and automated mitigation. For instance, Decision Tree (DT) and Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) accuracies, using MQTTset, dropped to 8% and 21% when tested on real data. However, after retraining both models on MQTTEEB-D, the results showed a noticeable improvement; DT reached 87% and GRU 86.5% accuracy. The framework was deployed and tested in real-sitting scenarios and experimental results demonstrated efficient attacks' detection and mitigation with near-real-time responsiveness. Overall, the findings confirm that the proposed framework and its related services provide a scalable, deployable, and cross-domain security solution for real-world IoT applications."

For such engineering problems, this article combines deeply separable convolution to establish three lightweight neural network fault diagnosis models-MobileNet-DLCNN, ShuffleNet-DLCNN and SqueezeNet-DLCNN. At the same time, the failure mechanism of rolling bearings is studied. This article incorporates colored noise into the standard bearing failure datasets from Case Western Reserve University (CWRU) and the American Society for Machinery Failure Prevention Technology (MFPT), and conducts noise resistance training under variable adaptive characteristics, compares the diagnostic ability with the datasets before adding colored noise. Then, the identification and classification abilities of the three lightweight convolution models proposed under each dataset, as well as the transfer learning adaptive ability of the three models between different datasets and working conditions, are verified through comparative experiments. The experimental results show that SqueezeNet-DLCNN has the best diagnostic performance among the three models, and it can complete the recognition and classification of all data in about one minute with an accuracy of 97%. The lightweight convolution designed in this article has the advantages of strong noise resistance, high efficiency, and fast speed."

However, the diversity of polyp morphology and the uneven contrast caused by illumination changes in colonoscopy images make accurate segmentation and edge extraction of polyps a challenging task. To this end, this paper proposes a frequency domain decoupled multi-scale feature aggregation network (FDANet). The network employs wavelet transform to decompose spatial domain features into frequency domain sub-bands, extracting both low-frequency and high-frequency components. By leveraging their distinct frequency characteristics, the model is guided to suppress redundant information, emphasize target-relevant features, and achieve more robust and accurate segmentation results. In FDANet, the low-frequency attention enhancement module (LAEM) suppresses high-frequency background noise by performing Gaussian difference operations on low-frequency components and incorporates a hybrid attention mechanism to strengthen the feature representation of foreground regions. The high-frequency multi-scale aggregation module (HMAM) employs directional convolution kernels to model high-frequency components, extract fine-grained edge information, and construct a multi-scale feature pyramid to accommodate the morphological and scale diversity of polyps, while enhancing spatial detail awareness during the decoding stage. Additionally, an edge loss function is introduced to supervise the modeling of edge contours within this module, effectively suppressing background noise interference and further improving boundary localization accuracy. Experimental results show that this method achieves good segmentation results on CVC-ClinicDB and Kvasir-SEG datasets, outperforming other advanced segmentation methods."

The major function of IDS is to prevent the WSNs from suspected attacks. Conventional IDS face numerous challenges which include limited capability, inadequate identification of attacks and detection of high false alarm rates, leading to complex data processing and pattern identification. To overcome these issues, a novel method which integrates Osprey Optimization Algorithm (OOA) and Graph Neural Networks (GNN) referred as OOA-GNN is proposed for enhancing the WSN security by efficiently detecting various categories of attacks. The proposed model integrates a deep learning framework built on graphical structures to obtain complex relationships and the hyperparameters of GNN is fine-tuned by OOA for improving the detection performance. In order to evaluate the proposed model, Wireless Sensor Networks-Dataset (WSN-DS) is chosen which is imbalanced in nature. To solve the imbalance characteristics, Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique (SMOTE) is used on the training set. The OOA-GNN framework, through graphical representation of WSN data, successfully gathers the network patterns. The accuracy of 99.68% obtained through OOA-GNN outperforms traditional classifiers such as AdaBoost, Gradient Boosting Model (GBM), Xtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), K-Nearest Neighbour-Arithmetic Optimization Algorithm (KNN-AOA), and K-Nearest Neighbour-Particle Swarm Optimization (KNN-PSO). Evaluating standard performance metrics demonstrate that the projected OOA-GNN model beats conventional approaches in terms of low false positive rate while adaption to network fluctuations. The proposed model enhances network reliability, improves the model's exactness of attack detection and decreases false alarm occurrences by integrating parameter-tuning capabilities of the OOA with graph-based neural framework in real-time WSN operations."

We propose a unified framework that couples self-supervised temporal-spectral pretraining with adversarial domain alignment. First, a masked time-frequency modeling objective learns subject-invariant features by reconstructing occluded spectrogram patches. Then, during fine-tuning, a gradient-reversal domain branch aligns latent distributions across subjects/datasets while a label head preserves class separability. Evaluations on NinaPro DB2 and CapgMyo DBa under leave-one-subject-out (LOSO) and cross-dataset protocols demonstrate consistent gains over traditional and deep baselines. In LOSO, the proposed method achieved 89.4% and 86.9% accuracy on DB2 and DBa, respectively; in cross-dataset transfer, it reached 82.1% (DB2 → DBa) and 83.5% (DBa → DB2). Ablations confirm that self-supervision and adversarial alignment are complementary, and robustness analyses show graceful degradation under noise and channel perturbations. These results indicate a scalable, portable, and plug-and-play sEMG interface suitable for clinical and home-based upper-limb rehabilitation."

However, understanding and monitoring the dynamics of suspended sediments remain challenging due to complex natural and anthropogenic interactions. Existing approaches, such as using suit data or satellite data to construct numerical models, face limitations in sampling irregular spaces or lacking generalization capabilities. Besides, unlike natural language processing (NLP) and computer vision (CV), the amount of suit data or satellite data is small, which make it difficult for some data-driven deep models to achieve excellent performance. To address these challenges, we propose a pre-trained transformer model that leverages an NLP pre-trained model trained on billions of tokens for SSSC reconstruction. Specifically, we design input embedding layers to project remote sensing image data into dimensions required by a specific pre-trained model. During the fine-tuning phase, we freeze the self-attention and feed-forward layers of the residual block in the pre-trained model, allowing knowledge transfer to the SSSC task. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed pre-trained transformer models achieve state-of-the-art performance on the SSSC task. This result may indicate that parameters trained on massive data in large models have the potential to enhance performance on other tasks."

However, the inherent stochastic nature of wind resources significantly complicates short-to-medium-term forecasting, introducing operational uncertainties within power systems. Despite substantial improvements in existing forecasting techniques, conventional models often fail to achieve consistently high accuracy, necessitating methodological advancements. To address this limitation, we introduce a novel multi-scale forecasting framework integrating fuzzy information granulation and a multi-objective optimization strategy. The fuzzy information granulation technique effectively captures intrinsic features from highly volatile wind speed data, significantly reducing the data complexity and mitigating noise interference for deep learning models. Moreover, our combined model leverages multiple neural networks employing diverse predictive principles, adaptively integrating their outputs via heuristic optimization algorithms. This approach simultaneously enhances prediction accuracy and robustness. Experimental validation using the Penglai wind farm dataset highlights the outstanding performance of our proposed framework. Importantly, the fuzzy information granulation-based collaborative optimization algorithm effectively resolves the critical trade-off between prediction accuracy and computational efficiency in wind speed forecasting systems."

However, its full integration into real-world diagnostic and treatment processes still faces significant challenges. This article analyzed the application progress of AI in key areas such as big data analysis, translational research, and imaging and pathological interpretation. Physicians need to integrate massive amounts of multimodal data (medical history, physical signs, laboratory data, imaging, and pathology) to make informed decisions in clinical practice. Although AI has gradually shown a preliminary auxiliary application role in certain liver disease diagnosis and treatment scenarios, current machine learning and deep learning technologies are far from being able to effectively support clinical decision-making in real-world settings. The core pain points are as follows: firstly, AI tools are not yet mature enough to truly independently and reliably assist in complex clinical evaluation; secondly, even if assistance is provided, the ultimate responsibility for medical decisions still clearly belongs to the physician, failing to reduce their workload effectively; finally, due to the different specialties and data characteristics of various medical centers, individually trained AI models are often relatively independent and personalized, fragmented, and difficult to integrate into a widely applicable and scalable multi-center general model, limiting their universal value. In the future, enhancing clinicians' understanding of AI and building multidisciplinary collaborative networks will be crucial to accelerating the development of AI-driven decision support tools for specific liver diseases. At the same time, ethical, legal, and talent development challenges, and others must be carefully addressed to bridge the gap and safely and eppectively apply AI in clinical practice."

Feature extraction can extract useful information from complex process data for wastewater treatment process monitoring. However, non-uniform distribution poses a challenge for effective feature extraction. To tackle this issue, a sparse autoencoder feature extraction method (SAFEM) is designed to improve monitoring accuracy. Firstly, the influence of the thrust rate on sample distribution is analyzed in conjunction with MWWTPs inflow fluctuations, and residence time between the two monitoring points is analyzed by hydrodynamic mechanism. Secondly, by constructing a sparse matrix, the distribution of non-zero element is used to reflect the inhomogeneity of the sample distribution, which can effectively capture the high-dimensional sparsity. Thirdly, based on the sparse autoencoder, the loss function is designed for feature extraction, which could better adapt to the change of sample distribution and improve the accuracy of feature extraction in the wastewater treatment process. Finally, the effectiveness of SAFEM is illustrated with experimental studies from a real MWWTP in China. The abnormal condition diagnosis performance of SAFEM shows that SAFEM can extract MWWTPs features accurately."

This study aimed to develop and compare multiple machine learning (ML) models to predict LVEF recovery and identify key contributing features.
We retrospectively analyzed 520 patients with CCS from the Clinical Deep Data Accumulation System database. Patients were categorized into 4 binary classification tasks based on baseline LVEF (≥50% or <50%) and degree of recovery: (1) good recovery, defined as an LVEF increase of >10% compared with ≤0%; and (2) normal recovery, defined as an LVEF increase of 0% to 10% compared with ≤0%. For each task, 3 feature selection strategies (all features, least absolute shrinkage and selection operator [LASSO] regression, and recursive feature elimination [RFE]) were combined with 4 ML algorithms (extreme gradient boosting [XGBoost], categorical boosting, light gradient boosting machine, and random forest), resulting in 48 models. Models were evaluated using 10-fold cross-validation and assessed by the area under the curve (AUC), decision curve analysis, and calibration plots.
The highest AUCs were achieved by RFE combined with XGBoost (AUC=0.93) for preserved LVEF with good recovery, LASSO combined with XGBoost (AUC=0.79) for preserved LVEF with normal recovery, LASSO combined with XGBoost (AUC=0.88) for reduced LVEF with good recovery, and RFE combined with XGBoost (AUC=0.84) for reduced LVEF with normal recovery. Shapley Additive Explanation analysis identified uric acid, platelets, hematocrit, brain natriuretic peptide, glycated hemoglobin, glucose, creatinine, baseline LVEF, left ventricular end-diastolic internal diameter, heart rate, R wave amplitude in V5, and R wave amplitude in V6 as important predictive factors of LVEF recovery.
ML models incorporating feature selection strategies demonstrated strong predictive performance for LVEF recovery after PCI. These interpretable models may support clinical decision-making and can improve the management of patients with CCS after PCI."

This study proposes a multimodal DL framework to address these issues.
We collected 12,690 MRI slices and clinical data from 765 participants (1,410 temporomandibular joints), with each joint annotated for degenerative joint disease (DJD), anterior disc displacement (ADD), and effusion. We developed M44TMD, utilizing multimodal data including multi-sequence and multi-slice MRI with clinical data, for concurrent assessment of DJD, ADD, and effusion. Performance was benchmarked against three recent DL methods and four clinicians with varying expertise across internal, temporal, and external test sets; assessments included generalization and visual interpretability experiments.
Built upon ResNet50, M44TMD exhibited superior internal test performance (ROC-AUC: 0.831, 0.913, and 0.961), surpassing prior methods. The accuracy of M44TMD for three abnormalities was superior to that of junior dentists and comparable to that of two senior dentists (10 and 20 years experience): DJD (74.9% vs. 74.9%/72.5%; P > 0.05), ADD (78.2% vs. 71.1%/75.8%; P > 0.05), and effusion (90.5% vs. 88.6%/79.6%; P < 0.05). Strong robustness and interpretability were validated through generalization and visual interpretability experiments.
The M44TMD framework enables concurrent assessment of TMD-related abnormalities by integrating multimodal MRI and clinical data, exhibiting assessment performance comparable to senior dentists and demonstrating excellent robustness.
The M44TMD framework represents a critical step toward advancing DL-based TMD diagnosis in clinical practice."

The proposed auto-planning algorithm consists of a novel MMDP model and a function-guided dose mimicking algorithm. The MMDP model features extracting complementary features from multi-modality images for predicting dose distributions close to FLART plans. An instance-weighting anatomy-to-function training strategy is tailored to enhance prediction accuracy. A function-guided voxelwise dose mimicking algorithm is developed to convert predicted dose into FLART (MMDP-FLART) plans. We retrospectively collected data from 163 lung cancer patients across three institutions, comprising 114/28 cases for training/validation and 21 cases with SPECT ventilation (V) images for testing. Furthermore, we prospectively collected 33 cases with SPECT perfusion (Q) images for evaluation. MMDP-FLART plans were compared against conventional radiotherapy (ConvRT) and FLART plans manually created by senior clinicians.
MMDP achieved accurate dose predictions, with median prediction errors for all assessed dose-volume histogram (DVH) metrics within ±1Gy/±1%. The MMDP model reduced prediction absolute errors for functionally weighted mean lung dose (fMLD) by 12.77% compared to an anatomy-guided dose prediction model and the instance-weighting anatomy-to-function training strategy reduced prediction absolute errors for fMLD by 22.64%. Compared to manual ConvRT plans, MMDP-FLART plans effectively reduced fMLD by 0.80 Gy (11.9%, p<0.01) and 0.46 Gy (6.0%, p<0.01) on SPECT V and Q datasets respectively. Compared to manual FLART plans, MMDP-FLART plans exhibited lower and comparable fMLD on SPECT V and Q datasets respectively with lower dose to heart and esophagus.
The MMDP model with instance-weighting anatomy-to-function training can achieve accurate dose prediction for FLART. The MMDP-based autoplanning algorithm can produce FLART plans leveraging voxel-wise lung function information from V/Q images. It shows promise in promoting FLART planning efficiency, consistency, and quality."

With a focus on the prevalent psychological complications following the onset of this condition, this study aimed to explore the correlation between antenatal depression and Corona disease anxiety, personality traits, and postpartum depression during the COVID-19 pandemic.                                                           Materials and Methods:                     This cross-sectional descriptive-analytical study investigated women receiving care at health centers affiliated with Kerman University of Medical Sciences during the last month of their pregnancy and the postpartum period in 2022. Following the acquisition of informed consent, participants were assessed using various measures, including demographic and obstetric information, the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale, the Corona Disease Anxiety Scale (CDAS), and the NEO Personality Inventory-Revised during their third trimester of pregnancy. The same group of participants completed the Edinburgh Depression Scale and the Corona Disease Anxiety Scale (CDAS) 4-6 weeks after childbirth.                                                           Results and Discussion:                     There was a significant correlation between family income, unwanted pregnancy as perceived by both the mother and father, and antenatal depression. Additionally, marital satisfaction played a significant role in postpartum depression. Furthermore, antenatal depression was significantly associated with neuroticism, agreeableness, and physical symptoms related to Corona disease anxiety. Personality traits, with the exception of extroversion and conscientiousness, and various domains of Corona disease anxiety, excluding psychological symptoms, were also significantly associated with postpartum depression.                                                           Conclusion:                     During pandemics or epidemics, such as the COVID-19 outbreak, experiencing mental distress during pregnancy can contribute to mental health issues during the postpartum period. This risk is particularly true in individuals with unique personality traits, emphasizing the need for increased focus on mental health within prenatal care during these crises."

Method:                     This cross-sectional study was conducted in Kerman, Iran. Data were collected from patients who visited Afzalipour Hospital in Kerman more than twice during the COVID-19 epidemic from the end of February 2020 to March 21, 2021. We conducted two key analyses: 1. Mixed effect logistic regression was used to check the relationship between the variables and COVID-19 severity. 2. Mixed effect linear regression was used to check the relationship between the variables and the length of stay in the hospital.                                                           Results:                     The findings indicated that the most important risk factors for the severity of COVID-19 were heart diseases (OR=1.67,95%CI:1.20-2.30), increasing age (OR=2.23 for age&gt;54, 95%CI:1.70- 2.90), male gender (OR=1.47,95%CI:1.10-1.96), respiratory diseases other than asthma, and frequency of admission (OR=1.60,95%CI:1.20-2.15). All patients who underwent readmission experienced a shorter duration of hospitalization during their subsequent admission (OR=0.94,95%CI:0.91,0.96) and had a higher mortality rate (30% within 14 days, 26.6% between 14-90 days). Patients readmitted at intervals of 14-90 days and greater than 90 days exhibited lower disease severity compared to those readmitted within the 0-14 day period.                                                           Conclusion:                     Examining readmissions, the severity of COVID-19, and the length of hospital stay in affected patients are important factors for planning and allocating resources for COVID-19 management and treatment. These factors can help policymakers develop effective clinical guidelines for hospitalization or outpatient treatment of COVID-19 patients and contribute to reducing the burden of disease in the community."

Kinovea, as an accessible motion-analysis software, provides both visual and quantitative feedback. However, its application in supporting technique development among beginner athletes remains insufficiently explored. Aim: This study aims to describe the use of Kinovea in biomechanics training and examine its contribution to the awareness of kinematic characteristics and movement techniques among beginner athletes. Methods: A descriptive qualitative design involved 72 beginner athletes aged 18–25 years selected through purposive sampling. Data were collected over 16 weeks through interviews, field observations, and motion video recordings analyzed using Kinovea. Kinematic data focused on joint angles, stride behavior, and movement phases during walking, running, and the flight phase. Qualitative data were analyzed using content analysis with NVivo 12, while kinematic results were interpreted descriptively to identify performance patterns and areas for technical refinement. Result: Kinematic analysis showed coordinated joint-angle patterns across all phases. Walking analysis identified arm swing angles of 50.9°–58.8° and leg separation angles of 64.3°–67.2°, indicating a stable gait rhythm. The running analysis revealed knee angles of 68.8°–69.8° and elbow angles of 87.6°–89.1°, indicating efficient propulsive mechanics. The flight phase demonstrated knee angles of 81.2°–87.8° and elbow angles of 80.4°–88.3°, suggesting effective momentum use and postural stability. These measurements supported stride-efficiency assessment and technique evaluation. Qualitative findings revealed that Kinovea enabled athletes to interpret movement phases and identify technical inefficiencies through slow-motion and frame-by-frame visualization. Conclusion: Kinovea supports basic motion analysis by providing clear kinematic information and helping beginner athletes observe and refine their movement techniques. The findings also offer practical value for coaches by enabling more precise identification of inefficient patterns and guiding targeted corrections during early-stage training."

OpenAlex,aortic stenosis,Outcomes of Surgical versus Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement: A Clinical Review,"Stang, Grace",,2026-01-01,Digital Commons - Gardner-Webb University (Gardner–Webb University),"Introduction: Surgical aortic valve replacement (SAVR) has been the predominant treatment for aortic stenosis (AS) for decades. However, transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) is becoming increasingly popular. Originally, TAVRs were only performed on patients who were deemed high-risk for surgery and would have died without the valve replacement. The purpose of this paper is to determine if TAVR or SAVR has better health outcomes for all patients no matter their surgical risk. Methods: A search via PubMed database was done using the key words “aortic stenosis”, “surgical aortic valve replacement”, “transcatheter aortic valve replacement”, and “mortality.” Additional search filters were applied for randomized control trials, systematic reviews, and meta- analyses. Dates were restricted to the last 5 years, and restrictions were added for English language and free full text only. This yielded 67 results and 5 were selected. Results: Of the five reviewed articles, all were meta-analyses and one systematic review. There was a total of 52122 patients. Primary endpoints across all articles were that there is no significant difference between TAVR and SAVR in the outcomes studied. Discussion: This review of studies provided supportive evidence that both TAVR and SAVR are valid treatment options or AS. TAVR had better short-term outcomes while SAVR had better long-term outcomes."

OpenAlex,aortic stenosis,Nationwide trends and in-hospital outcomes of surgical versus transcatheter aortic valve replacement in Japan: a real-world analysis using administrative data,Yoon Kyoung Kim; Eiki Nagaoka; Kiyotoshi Oishi; Mikayo Toba; Kiyohide Fushimi; Tomoyuki Fujita,10.1007/s00380-025-02640-5,2025-12-29,Heart and Vessels,"Abstract Aortic stenosis (AS) is the most prevalent valvular disease in developed nations. Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement (TAVR) offers a minimally invasive alternative to Surgical Aortic Valve Replacement (SAVR), particularly for high-risk patients. However, TAVR adoption and outcomes in Japan remain understudied due to limited national database analyses and differences in patient demographics compared to major international trials. We conducted a retrospective cohort study of aortic valve replacement (AVR) procedures from 2014 to 2021 using the National Healthcare Reimbursement database. In total, 103,076 cases were analyzed, with 33,881 undergoing TAVR and 31,337 undergoing SAVR for aortic stenosis. TAVR patients were older (median age 85 vs. 76 years, p &lt; 0.0001) and more often female (66.7% vs. 51.4%, p &lt; 0.0001). TAVR was associated with lower in-hospital mortality (0.88% vs. 2.4%, p &lt; 0.0001), shorter hospital stays (14 vs. 24 days, p &lt; 0.0001), but significantly higher medical costs (¥5,303,722 vs. ¥3,945,622, p &lt; 0.0001). Among patients younger than 75 years, no significant difference in mortality was observed. In this nationwide administrative database, TAVR was associated with lower in-hospital mortality and shorter hospital stays compared to SAVR, though at a higher cost. While patient backgrounds and clinical risks could not be fully adjusted due to data limitations, the observed differences in in-hospital outcomes between TAVR and SAVR reflect real-world practice patterns. These findings should be interpreted as descriptive, not causal. The absence of a mortality difference in patients under 75 years highlights the need for further evaluation of TAVR’s long-term effectiveness and cost-efficiency in younger populations."

OpenAlex,aortic stenosis,Endovascular treatment of acute symptomatic infrarenal aortic aneurysm in a patient with bilateral atherosclerotic renal artery disease and chronic kidney disease: a case report,Igor I. Zatevakhin; A V Matyushkin; A. T. Mustafin; Aleksey M. Frantsevich; Mubinjon N. Zoidov,10.17816/pavlovj630485,2025-12-28,I P Pavlov Russian Medical Biological Herald,"INTRODUCTION: Currently, X-ray endovascular technologies in the amount of endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR) are widely used not only in the treatment of scheduled patients with abdominal aortic aneurysm, but also in emergency situations, such as acute symptomatic aneurysm or its rupture, as an alternative to an open surgery. Endovascular treatment is characterized by minimal trauma, low mortality and a short hospital stay. However, for some patients, EVAR poses significant challenges and risks. One such group is patients with chronic kidney disease due to atherosclerotic lesions of the renal arteries. The article discusses a clinical case of a 67-year-old patient with an acute symptomatic abdominal aortic aneurysm, 5 cm in diameter, with a prominent concomitant cardiac pathology and stage IV chronic kidney disease (glomerular filtration rate 25 ml/min/1.73 m2) with the underlying critical stenosis of both renal arteries (subocclusion on the left and 85% stenosis on the right). The patient underwent emergency surgery in the amount of infrarenal aortic grafting and stenting of both renal arteries using gadodiamide. A reduction in the volume of contrast agent administered was achieved by stenting the renal arteries before EVAR. As a result, the stents, due to their radiopaque properties, were used as a guide for localizing the renal arteries during endograft placement. The postoperative period was uneventful, except for an early postoperative increase in blood creatinine up to 344 µmol/l and stabilization at this level. The patient was transferred to the vascular surgery department for symptomatic treatment. With infusion therapy, the blood creatinine level decreased to 270 µmol/l. On day 5, the patient was discharged for outpatient follow-up at the place of residence. CONCLUSION: This clinical case demonstrates a possibility of performing endovascular intervention in patients with stage IIIb–IV chronic kidney disease, due to, on the one hand, improvement of endovascular technologies, and, on the other, reduction of the volume of contrast agent used during surgery."

The study aim is to unravel the genetic basis of BAV and its complications through a high-throughput sequencing (HTS) approach and segregation analysis if family members were available. Methods: Fifty-two Italian BAV patients were analyzed by HTS using the Illumina MiSeq platform. Targeted sequencing of 97 genes known to be or plausibly associated with connective tissue disorders or aorthopathy was performed. Thirty-five first-degree relatives of N = 10 probands underwent mutational screening for variants identified in the index cases. Results: HTS identified 194 rare (MAF &lt; 0.01) variants in 63 genes. Regarding previously reported genes, five NOTCH1 variants in four BAV patients, four FBN1 variants in two patients and one GATA5 variant in one patient were identified. Interestingly, among further loci, the possible contribution of PDIA2, LRP1 and CAPN2 was suggested by (a) the increased prevalence of rare genetic variants, independently from their ACMG classification in the whole BAV cohort, and (b) segregation analyses of variants identified in family members. Moreover, the present data also suggest the possible contribution of rare variants to BAV complications, specifically MYLK in aortic dilatation, CAPN2 in BAV calcification and VHL and AGGF1 in valve stenosis. Conclusions: Our results underline clinical and genetic diagnosis complexity in traits considered monogenic, such as BAV, but characterized by variability in disease phenotypic expression (incomplete penetrance), as well as the contribution of different major and modifier genes to the development of complications."

However, a substantial proportion of cardiovascular events occur in individuals with LDL-C levels within the normal range, highlighting the need for additional risk markers. Lipoprotein(a) [Lp(a)] has emerged as an independent and genetically determined cardiovascular risk factor that is not adequately captured by conventional lipid profiling. Elevated Lp(a) levels are associated with an increased risk of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, including coronary artery disease, ischemic stroke, and calcific aortic valve stenosis, and appear to be particularly relevant in the context of premature cardiovascular events. The pathogenicity of Lp(a) is driven by distinct mechanisms that extend beyond cholesterol transport. These include pro-atherogenic, pro-inflammatory, and pro-thrombotic effects mediated largely by oxidized phospholipids carried by the particle and by the structural properties of apolipoprotein(a), which interfere with fibrinolysis. Despite its strong and stable genetic determination, Lp(a) remains underrecognized and inconsistently measured in clinical practice, partly due to historical limitations in assay standardization and reporting. This minireview summarizes current knowledge on the pathophysiological mechanisms underlying elevated Lp(a), discusses its clinical implications for cardiovascular risk assessment, and highlights the importance of standardized Lp(a) measurement in routine practice, particularly in light of emerging Lp(a)-targeted therapies."

Estright; Samantha Pope; Daniel Schiller; Luis Tollinche; Maninder Singh,10.61797/ijetit.v6i2.545,2025-12-26,International Journal of Endovascular Treatment and Innovative Techniques,"Objectives: TAVR is a minimally invasive alternative to SAVR, offering a key treatment for high-risk patients with severe aortic stenosis, including those with advanced age or comorbidities. Its popularity has led to its use in lower volume institutions, where outcomes are comparable to higher volume centers. This study analyzes procedural volume and outcomes at our institution, compares them with the PARTNER III trial and evaluates complications and patient selection criteria. Design: This was a retrospective descriptive study. Setting: This study was performed at a public, multi-institutional healthcare system featuring an acute care hospital with a level I adult trauma and burn center. Participants: We obtained retrospective data on 37 patients who underwent TAVR in our hospital system in 2022. Data was collected on their outcomes, including mortality, readmission rates and cardiovascular and cerebrovascular complications at 30 days and 1 year. Interventions: No interventions were performed on patients as this was a retrospective study. Measurements and main results: Patient outcomes were compared with PARTNER III trial results. There was no 30-day mortality (versus 1% in the PARTNER III trial) and a 1-year mortality rate of 2.7% (versus 8.5% in the PARTNER III trial). During the procedures, no patients were converted to general anesthesia nor actively bleeding. At 30 days, no patients were readmitted for valve-related issues. Conclusion: This study demonstrates that lower volume healthcare institutions can achieve outcomes comparable/similar to higher volume institutions in specialized procedures like TAVR, challenging the assumption that superior outcomes are tied to institutional size. Our findings highlight the importance of quality, teamwork and individualized care in achieving excellent clinical outcomes, regardless of size."

Chilian; Feng Dong,10.3390/ijms27010256,2025-12-25,International Journal of Molecular Sciences,"The aim of this study was to determine whether exosomes from Nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase (NAMPT)-overexpressing mesenchymal stem cells (MSC NAMPT-Exo) can attenuate aortic stenosis (AS) and explored the underlying mechanism. NAMPT expression was examined in EC CXCR4 KO (AS) mouse hearts. Six-week-old AS mice received weekly injections of NAMPT-Exo, MSC-Exo, or PBS for three weeks, followed by echocardiography and histological examination of the valves (H&amp;E, Alizarin Red, immunofluorescence). Cardiac ECs from control, AS, and NAMPT-Exo-treated mice were analyzed for miRNA expression (miR-146a-3p/5p, miR-125b-5p, miR-142a-5p). NAMPT expression was decreased in AS hearts. Treatment with NAMPT-Exo reduced aortic valve peak velocity, valvular thickening, and microcalcifications, while improving ejection fraction, fractional shortening, and ventricular dimensions. AS endothelial cells showed elevated levels of miR-146a-3p, miR-146a-5p, and miR-142a-5p, NAMPT-Exo specifically normalized miR-146a-3p. Histology revealed EndMT in AS valves, which was diminished by NAMPT-Exo. In vitro, inhibiting miR-146a-3p suppressed TGF-β-induced EndMT. Our results demonstrate that NAMPT-enriched MSC-derived exosomes effectively slow the progression of AS. Additionally, our findings highlight miR-146a-3p as a key regulator of EndMT, suggesting it as a potential molecular target for future therapies."
OpenAlex,aortic stenosis,Surgery of the Aortic Valve Using a Minimally Invasive Approach,Oleksandr Babliak; Dmytro Babliak; Serhii Yatsuk,10.63181/ujcvs.2025.33(4).30-36,2025-12-25,Ukrainian journal of cardiovascular surgery,"Aim. The aim of this study is to present and analyze the technique of isolated aortic valve replacement (AVR) or repair via a minimally invasive approach – right anterior thoracotomy in the second intercostal space. Materials and Methods. From February 2020 to November 2025, 180 patients at our institution underwent isolated aortic valve interventions. Since July 2020, we have implemented the technique of minimally invasive aortic valve surgery via right anterior thoracotomy. Between 2020 and 2025, 177 patients were operated on using this approach: 165 underwent aortic valve replacement (AVR), and 12 underwent aortic valve repair. In 2 (1.1 %) patients with isolated aortic valve stenosis, AVR was performed through axillary access for a better cosmetic effect. Since the introduction of this technique, median sternotomy was used in only one case due to difficulties with peripheral cannulation or severe aortic calcification. Results. Based on etiology and anatomical pathology, AVR was performed in 165 (91.6 %) patients – 90 (54.5 %) received biological prostheses, and 75 (45.5 %) received mechanical valves. Aortic valve repair was performed in 12 (8.4 %) patients. Aortic cross-clamp time ranged from 39 to 145 minutes (mean 89.4±19.5 min). Total cardiopulmonary bypass time ranged from 83 to 275 minutes (mean 150.9±29.4 min). Total operative time ranged from 165 to 435 minutes (mean 237.7±43.4 min). Intensive care unit (ICU) stay was 1.4±0.6 (1-3) days, and total hospital stay was 6.1±1.6 (3-16) days. There were no significant postoperative cardiac complications, mortality, or conversions to median sternotomy. Three cases (1.4 %) required surgical re-exploration due to bleeding. Conclusions. Right anterior mini-thoracotomy is a safe approach for aortic valve surgery. The use of exposure maneuvers during aortic valve replacement via mini-thoracotomy allows the operation to be performed without patient selection and yields good perioperative results."

To determine vECG and orthogonal ECG3 parameters and ranges of their changes for which diagnostic significance of estimates will be the same between MacPhee-Parungao leads calculated using Trunov-Aidu transformation and most common Frank leads calculated using Kors matrix and inverse Dauer matrix. Material and methods. An observational single-center non-controlled study included 1250 digital 12-lead ECGs recorded from 1250 adults with common cardiovascular diseases: hypertension, coronary artery disease, previous myocardial infarction, aortic stenosis, etc. We calculated orthogonal ECG3 in McFee-Parungao (Trunov-Aidu matrix) and Frank (Kors matrix and Dawer inverse matrix) leads. Statistical processing included correlation analysis and Bland-Altman plots to assess measurement agreement. Results. The study found significant diversity in ECG patterns among all ECGs. Amplitudes of ECG3 waves showed good agreement across all transformations. Integral vectors, fractional integrals, and ventricular gradient demonstrated high correlation. While spatial area of QRS loop showed consistency, its projections on orthogonal planes were less aligned. Spatial angle QRS-T exhibited high degree of linear correlation. Planar indexes of QRS loop and length parameters showed close results between McFee-Parungao and Frank systems. Conclusion. Measurements of integral vECG characteristics in computational orthogonal lead systems McFee-Parungao and Frank yield comparable results. Extreme values of spatial angle QRS-T (&gt;130°) associated with high cardiovascular risk show high agreement. However, intermediate and borderline values should be interpreted considering calculation method. Planar indexes&gt;0.91 may also be interpreted with high consistency."

Traditional surgical repair remains the gold standard, but high-risk patients often require less invasive alternatives. Aim: To review catheter-based interventions for MR, focusing on nursing care, anatomical considerations, procedural techniques, and clinical outcomes. Methods: This narrative review synthesizes evidence from pivotal trials (EVEREST I &amp; II, COAPT) and current guidelines (ACC/AHA, ESC/EACTS), emphasizing anatomical prerequisites, device selection, procedural workflow, and complication management. Results: Transcatheter edge-to-edge repair (TEER), modeled on the Alfieri stitch, has emerged as the most validated percutaneous approach. Favorable anatomy includes adequate leaflet length, central jet location, and mitral valve area &gt;4 cm². Technological advances (MitraClip G4, PASCAL Precision) enable treatment of complex anatomies such as flail segments and commissural jets. TEER demonstrates significant symptomatic improvement and reduced hospitalization in high-risk cohorts, with low rates of major complications (SLDA 1.5–5%, leaflet injury ≤2%, device embolization ≤0.7%). Nursing roles encompass preprocedural preparation, intraoperative monitoring, anticoagulation management, and postprocedural surveillance for complications such as tamponade, vascular injury, and residual MR. Conclusion: TEER represents a transformative option for patients unsuitable for surgery, offering durable MR reduction and improved quality of life when applied with rigorous anatomical assessment and multidisciplinary collaboration."
OpenAlex,mitral regurgitation,Iatrogenic atrial septal defect following transcatheter edge-to-edge mitral valve repair: A systematic review and meta-analysis,Deng Lei; Chunlan Zhou; Junqing Zhou; Chen Luo; Baoshi Zheng,10.1097/md.0000000000046486,2025-12-26,Medicine,"Background: Transcatheter edge-to-edge mitral valve repair (TEER) requires transseptal access of the left atrium, which usually causes an iatrogenic atrial septal defect (iASD). It is controversial that whether these patients with iASD persistence will progress to a bad prognostic state. So it’s worthwhile to evaluate whether the procedure of TEER induced iASD leads to development of a relevant interatrial shunt. This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to identify predictors of iASD persistence in patients with mitral regurgitation (MR) undergoing TEER and assess its effect on in-hospital outcomes and mortality. Methods: In this systematic review and meta-analysis, we conducted a literature search in various databases. Our investigation summarized data from contemporary studies on the incidence of iASD following TEER for MR and its association with clinical outcomes. Results: 10 studies were analyzed, possible predictors of risk factors for the persistence of iASD after TEER seemed to be atrial fibrillation before surgery (OR 1.40; P = .04), residual MR &gt; 2 + (OR 2.36; P = .001), residual tricuspid regurgitation &gt; mild(OR 1.52; P = .01), and prolonged fluoroscopic time(MD [in minutes] 5.36; P = .007). Patients with iASD persistence after TEER seemed to have a greater risk to suffer from right heart overload reflecting from the enlarged right ventricle end-diastolic dimension (RVEDD) (MD 3.27; P &lt; .00001) and the enlarged diameter of the right atrium (MD 4.41; P &lt; .00001). Patients with iASD persistence after TEER had a greater risk of heart failure rehospitalization (OR 2.71; P = .003). Conclusion: This systematic review and meta-analysis identified several related predictors of iASD persistence, possibly leading to right heart volume overload and a higher risk of heart failure rehospitalization. In order to generalize our findings, larger clinical studies in independent patient cohorts are necessary. What’s more, there is a need to perform a careful decision for interventional closure of an iASD after TEER."

No study investigated the temporal trend of patient characteristics and outcomes in comparison with the published randomized trials. AIM To investigate the temporal trend in baseline characteristics and outcomes of patients with secondary MR who underwent transcatheter edge-to-edge repair of the mitral valve in the real world compared with those from the published landmark trials. METHODS A comprehensive systematic literature search was conducted using MEDLINE, EMBASE, and CENTRAL databases, and the identified observational studies were divided into two five-year recruitment periods. The first period included 36 studies that enrolled patients between 2008 and 2012, and the second period included 25 studies that recruited patients between 2013 and 2017-2018. Pooled variables of each five-year recruitment period were compared with those of the landmark trials. A random-effects model was used for statistical comparisons. RStudio and RevMan software were used for the analysis. RESULTS Overall, there were no major variations in the findings between the first and the second five-year recruitment periods. EVEREST program vs observational studies: Patients in the EVEREST program were more likely to have non-ischemic MR etiology [odds ratio (OR) = 3.59, 95% confidence interval (CI): 2.92-4.42] and atrial fibrillation (OR = 1.71, 95%CI: 1.42-2.06). They were less likely to receive angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors/angiotensin II receptor blockers (OR = 0.72, 95%CI: 0.58-0.90) and implantable cardiac device (OR = 0.41, 95%CI: 0.33-0.49) as well as less likely to be symptomatic at hospital presentation without a difference in MR grade ≤ 2+ or mortality at 12-month follow-up. COAPT trial vs observational studies: COAPT patients were more likely to have prior myocardial infarction (OR = 1.62, 95%CI: 1.27-2.06) and renal insufficiency (OR = 2.66, 95%CI: 2.05-3.45). They were more likely to receive beta-blockers (OR = 2.54, 95%CI: 1.68-3.85) and an implanted cardiac device (OR = 2.20, 95%CI: 1.71-2.84). There was no difference in procedure success or mortality. MITRA-FR trial vs observational studies: MITRA-FR patients were less likely to have atrial fibrillation (OR = 0.49, 95%CI: 0.34-0.69) and renal insufficiency (OR = 0.18, 95%CI: 0.11-0.28) but more likely to have a history of myocardial infarction (OR = 1.48, 95%CI: 1.06-2.05) and to receive diuretics (OR = 19.81, 95%CI: 2.75-142.48) and implantable cardiac devices (OR = 1.69, 95%CI: 1.21-2.37). At hospital presentation, they were less likely to be symptomatic (OR = 0.25, 95%CI: 0.18-0.35) without a difference in MR grades 3+ and 4+. There was no difference in terms of MR grade or mortality at 12-month follow-up. CONCLUSION Patients in the landmark studies may have favourable or unfavourable characteristics when compared to those in the observational studies, but this did not translate into different outcomes over time."
OpenAlex,mitral regurgitation,Mitral Annular Disjunction: Where Is the Cut-Off Value? Case Series and Literature Review,Giovanni Balestrucci; Vitaliano Buffa; Maria Teresa Del Canto; Maria Chiara Brunese; Salvatore Cappabianca; Alfonso Reginelli,10.3390/hearts7010002,2025-12-22,Hearts,"Mitral annular disjunction (MAD) is a structural abnormality of the mitral valve increasingly detected with advanced cardiac imaging, particularly cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR). However, the clinical impact of different degrees of disjunction and the lack of standardized measurement criteria remain controversial. This study aimed to describe a series of patients with MAD assessed by CMR and to discuss, in the context of current literature, potential cut-off values that may distinguish physiological from pathological MAD. We retrospectively identified all CMR examinations performed at our institution over a 6-month period in which MAD was visible in at least two cine steady-state free precession (SSFP) projections. For each patient, we recorded MAD extent, presence of mitral valve prolapse/regurgitation, late gadolinium enhancement (LGE) pattern, and main clinical presentation. Nine patients (mean age 57 years; 5 men) were included. Larger MAD distances (&gt;4 mm) were frequently associated with non-ischemic LGE in the basal lateral wall and with valvular abnormalities, whereas smaller disjunctions (≤3 mm) were often observed in patients without significant structural disease. Non-ischemic LGE was present in 6/9 patients, all with MAD &gt; 5 mm. These observations, together with published data, support the hypothesis that small degrees of MAD may represent a frequent anatomical variant, while more extensive disjunction, especially when associated with fibrosis, may indicate a pathological substrate for arrhythmias. Standardized CMR-based criteria and validated MAD cut-off values are needed to improve risk stratification and to incorporate MAD assessment into routine clinical practice."

This retrospective study included 67 individuals who underwent isolated, elective mitral valve repair with neochordae between 2019 and 2024. Participants were divided into the RAFF ( n = 36) and non-RAFF ( n = 31) groups. In the RAFF technique, chordal length is determined by referencing the anterior leaflet chordae from the ipsilateral papillary muscle, with loop sets anchored to the frontal head of the papillary muscle. Leaflet resection was not performed in any case. Baseline demographics and lesion characteristics were similar between groups. The RAFF group demonstrated significantly less residual mitral regurgitation at the conclusion of surgery ( p = 0.014). Use of the RAFF method was significantly associated with suppression of postoperative leaflet billowing and a lower recurrence rate of moderate or greater mitral regurgitation during follow-up. Frontal fixation of posterior leaflet neochordae, a defining feature of the technique, resulted in a significant increase in coaptation length without inducing systolic anterior motion or elevating transvalvular gradients. The method also significantly reduced aortic cross-clamp time without compromising hemodynamic performance. The RAFF technique offers a standardized and anatomically guided approach to neochordae reconstruction. It minimizes inter-surgeon variability and anatomical inconsistencies, and promotes durable mitral competence by optimizing leaflet coaptation without incurring adverse events."

Shaposhnikova,10.14412/2074-2711-2025-6-26-30,2025-12-20,Neurology neuropsychiatry Psychosomatics,"Aortic stenosis (AS), the prevalence of which increases with age, raises the risk of developing ischaemic stroke (IS), but the risk factors for cerebral ischemic events have not been fully established. Objective: to evaluate IS predictors in patients with moderate or severe AS, which will help identify high-risk groups and optimise stroke prevention. Material and methods . A retrospective review of data from the hospital information system for case-control analysis was conducted at one of the Federal Centers for Cardiovascular Surgery. Inclusion criteria: moderate or severe AS, patient age ≥18 years. Exclusion criteria: moderate or severe mitral stenosis, moderate or severe mitral regurgitation. Logistic regression was used to determine IS predictors. Odds ratio (OR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated for each of the significant risk factors. Results . The study included 208 patients with AS (the main group consisted of 51 patients with a history of IS or transient ischemic attack). The median age of patients was 68 [62.0; 72.0] years, the proportion of men was 53.8%. According to the multivariate analysis, the following predictors of cerebral ischemic events were identified: male gender (OR 2.739; 95% CI 1.048–7.156, p=0.040), extra-, intracranial stenosis &gt;50% (OR 2.488; 95% CI 1.089–5.686, p=0.031), aortic arch atheromas (OR 5.947; 95% CI 1.179–29.994, p=0.031), the result of the CHA2DS2VASc scale with an increase of 1 point (OR 4.030; 95% CI 1.912–8.499, p&lt;0.001). Conclusion. Supra-cardiac atherosclerosis (extraand intracranial atherosclerosis, aortic atheromas) is the main predictor of IS in patients with AS, which determines the need for its assessment in order to optimise patient treatment."
OpenAlex,mitral regurgitation,Retained fragmented Raytec gauze eluding an alleged correct postoperative count following cardiothoracic surgery: case report of a rare “never event”,Marco Lizwan; Philip Y. K. Pang,10.1186/s13037-025-00472-w,2025-12-20,Patient Safety in Surgery,"Abstract Introduction Retained surgical items are rare yet serious complications that may occur despite correct instrument and sponge counts. Surgical sponges remain the most frequently retained items, with gauze marker strand retention being an uncommon mechanism. Case presentation A 69-year-old male with severe mitral regurgitation and triple-vessel coronary artery disease underwent mitral valve replacement with coronary artery bypass grafting. All surgical counts were verified as correct at the conclusion of surgery. Postoperative chest radiography, however, revealed two linear radio-opaque foreign bodies near the left lower sternum. Mediastinal re-exploration identified two radio-opaque strands, measuring 3.0 cm and 2.0 cm, attached to the left lower chest wall near the internal mammary artery stump. These were confirmed to be detached marker strands from Raytec gauzes. The patient’s recovery was uneventful and he was discharged well. Conclusion This case illustrates that retained gauze fragments can occur despite correct counts due to fragmentation of radiopaque markers. Surgeons and operating room nurses should inspect gauzes for integrity, maintain vigilance when manipulating sponges in confined operative fields, and consider adjunct technologies such as radiofrequency or barcode tracking. In high-risk surgeries, postoperative imaging may be warranted even with accurate counts to ensure patient safety."
OpenAlex,mitral regurgitation,Suicide left ventricle triggered by accelerated junctional rhythm after TAVI: A case report of rhythm-dependent dynamic LVOT obstruction,Naoki Hoshino; Chihiro Nakashima;  Takashi Muramatsu; Akira Yamada; Hideo Izawa,10.1093/ehjcr/ytaf665,2025-12-19,European Heart Journal - Case Reports,"Abstract Background Suicide left ventricle (LV) is a rare, potentially fatal complication after transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI). It is typically caused by dynamic left ventricular outflow tract obstruction (LVOTO) following abrupt afterload reduction. Accelerated junctional rhythm (AJR) is an uncommon peri-procedural arrhythmia, and its role in precipitating suicide LV has not been reported. Case Summary An 87-year-old woman with extremely severe aortic stenosis was admitted for transfemoral TAVI. Concentric LV hypertrophy with a sigmoid septum and preserved systolic function was observed on baseline transthoracic echocardiography. She developed profound hypotension immediately after valve deployment. Transoesophageal echocardiography (TOE) revealed severe LVOTO and marked mitral regurgitation (MR) due to systolic anterior motion (SAM) of the mitral valve. The simultaneous appearance of AJR abolished atrial contraction, further reducing LV preload. LVOTO and SAM resolved during sinus rhythm, but recurred during AJR. Haemodynamics improved with rapid volume loading, vasoconstrictor administration and continuous right ventricular pacing, thereby reducing obstruction via induced ventricular dyssynchrony. AJR resolved spontaneously following emergence from anaesthesia, and a stable sinus rhythm was maintained. The patient was discharged on postoperative day 12 without recurrence. Discussion This case reports AJR as a novel trigger for suicide LV after TAVI, leading to preload reduction and promoting SAM, LVOTO and MR. Intraoperative TOE provided clear rhythm-dependent imaging of LVOT dynamics. Vigilant rhythm monitoring and prompt, targeted haemodynamic management, including pacing to induce ventricular dyssynchrony, are crucial for prevention and treatment in predisposed patients with small, hypertrophied ventricles with a sigmoid septum."

As such, this study aimed to further evaluate the diagnostic utility of ePLAR in a large cohort of patients with PHTN. Methods and Results All RHCs between 2018-2023 across three tertiary centers were retrospectively reviewed. Patients with PHTN were characterized as pre-capillary or post-capillary (isolated or combined). Concurrent ePLAR was calculated. ROC analysis evaluated the accuracy of ePLAR in detecting pre-capillary PHTN. Overall, 2235 patients had PHTN by RHC, mean age 63.5 ± 14.7 years, 53.5% male. Of these, 43.3% had pre-capillary PHTN. ROC analysis demonstrated ePLAR to have good accuracy in detection of pre-capillary PHTN (AUC 0.760), with a cutoff of 0.20m/s demonstrating a sensitivity and specificity of 77% and 60% respectively. This persisted on sensitivity analysis for contemporaneous investigations and for right ventricular function. Conclusions In this large cohort, ePLAR was validated as an accurate tool for identifying patients with pre-capillary PHTN. This widely available, non-invasive, and reproducible parameter can have an important role in the work up of PHTN and may guide the need for invasive testing."

Speckle-tracking echocardiography enables early detection of myocardial dysfunction before abnormalities appear in conventional echocardiographic parameters. This study evaluated left ventricular (LV) global longitudinal strain (GLS) in pediatric SCD patients, and its relationship with traditional LV function indices, disease complications, hemolysis markers, and diseasemodifying therapy. We retrospectively analyzed 278 echocardiograms from 185 participants (118 SCD patients, mean age 12.2 years; 67 age- and sex-matched controls, mean age 11.8 years) obtained between 2015 and 2023. Among the SCD cohort, 66.1% had the HbSS genotype, 9.3% had HbSβ°-thalassemia, and 17.8% had HbSβ⁺-thalassemia; the majority (83.9%) were on hydroxyurea. Compared to controls, SCD patients had significantly lower, but still normal, GLS (–21.5% vs. –22.3%; p &lt; 0.001), along with significantly larger chamber diameters, elevated mitral valve E velocity, E/A ratio, and tricuspid regurgitation maximal velocity. Prior stroke (β = 0.9) and avascular necrosis (β = 1.51) were independently associated with worse GLS. The different genotypes did not exhibit significant difference in GLS. The strain values did not correlate with hemolysis markers, suggesting that other mechanisms may underlie myocardial impairment. A significant age-related decline in GLS was detected, with an inflection point at approximately 9.9 years. Longitudinal analysis of LV strain in the SCD cohort demonstrated a small decline from –21.6% to –21.2% over a 3.7-year follow-up period. Finally, pediatric SCD patients exhibit significant cardiac remodeling and diastolic dysfunction with preserved, yet lower, LV GLS, underscoring the need for further research in this population."
OpenAlex,mitral regurgitation,A massive left atrium in the context of severe mitral regurgitation: a case report,Ryaan EL‐Andari; Zachary Davidson; Jeevan Nagendran,10.1080/14796678.2025.2605920,2025-12-18,Future Cardiology,"Mitral regurgitation (MR) is among the most common heart conditions. Untreated, severe MR may result in adverse cardiac remodeling, atrial fibrillation (AF), and heart failure. A 45-year-old male with a history of AF presented with heart failure symptoms. Transesophageal echocardiogram revealed a myxomatous mitral valve with anterior leaflet prolapse, severe MR, and massively dilated left atrium (LA). A computerized tomography scan found severe LA dilation up to 17.8 cm. The patient underwent mitral valve replacement, tricuspid valve repair, and LA reduction. MR is known to result in LA dilation due to increased LA volume and pressure. While large LA sizes have been reported, they are often related to congenital conditions and rarely grow to the size identified in this case. AF and LA dilation both predict adverse outcomes, increasing the risk of thrombus formation in such a large chamber."

Methods: This prospective single-center cohort study included 101 patients with chronic heart failure (mean age 62 ± 15.5 years; 70.3% male) with paroxysmal or persistent drug-refractory atrial fibrillation who underwent atrioventricular node ablation and CRT-D implantation. All patients received optimal medical therapy before and after undergoing the procedure. Predictors of 5-year mortality were assessed using exploratory machine-learning methods, including random forest and Shapley additive explanations. Results: During 5-year follow-up, 13 cardiovascular deaths were recorded. Five key predictors of mortality were identified: left ventricular ejection fraction, 6 min walk distance, mean pulmonary artery pressure, systolic relaxation coefficient, and degree of mitral regurgitation. The exploratory predictive model showed high accuracy (92%) in terms of classifying the outcomes. Conclusions: Atrioventricular node ablation (AVNA) combined with CRT-D was associated with the observed long-term clinical outcomes observed in patients with drug-refractory tachysystolic atrial fibrillation. The exploratory machine learning analysis identified key mortality-associated factors, which may support future efforts in personalized risk stratification and hypothesis generation. The combination of AVNA and CRT-D was associated with the observed long-term outcomes in this real-world cohort."

Hoopes; Vakhtang Tchantchaleishvili,10.1111/aor.70056,2025-12-18,Artificial Organs,"ABSTRACT Background Microaxial devices provide effective short‐term hemodynamic support in patients with cardiogenic shock or during high‐risk procedures. However, there is a paucity of data regarding device‐associated valvular complications. We sought to pool existing data to understand its incidence, management, and outcomes. Methods An electronic search was conducted in October 2024 to identify studies reporting microaxial device–associated valvular complications that did not resolve with device explantation. A total of 26 case reports and case series, representing 27 patients, were included. Patient‐level data were extracted for analysis. Results The median age was 50 years [IQR 34–65], and 78% (21/27) were male. The indications for microaxial support were cardiogenic shock (85.2%, 23/27), coronary bypass grafting (7.4%, 2/27), and high‐risk percutaneous coronary intervention (7.4%, 2/27). The most commonly used devices were the Impella 5.0 (41%, 11/27) and Impella CP (22%, 6/27). Aortic regurgitation (AR) developed in 67% of patients (18/27). Mitral regurgitation (MR) developed in 33% (9/27) of patients, all of which were severe. The median duration of microaxial support was 10 [3–15] days. Overall, 74% (20/27) of patients underwent surgical management, 11% (3/27) underwent transcatheter treatment, and 15% (4/27) were managed nonoperatively. In‐hospital/30‐day mortality was 11% (3/27), including two deaths among patients with MR (22%) and one in a patient with AR (5.6%) with a pre‐existing bioprosthetic aortic valve ( p = 0.19). When considering the patients with only native valves and excluding the bioprosthetic aortic valve, mortality was significantly higher among MR patients compared to those with AR (MR: 22%; AR: 0%, p = 0.04). At a median follow‐up of 183 [30–365] days, overall survival was 89% (24/27). Conclusion AR was more common than MR; however, all MR cases were severe. MR may be associated with worse outcomes. Surgical management appears to be the most frequently employed strategy for valvular injury."

Rigolin,10.1001/jamacardio.2025.4561,2025-12-17,JAMA Cardiology,"Importance Primary mitral regurgitation (MR) is a prevalent valvular lesion. Current American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association guidelines include class I recommendations for intervention for severe primary MR at the onset of symptoms, significant left ventricular (LV) enlargement (end-systolic dimension ≥40 mm), or dysfunction (ejection fraction ≤60%), with a class IIA recommendation for mitral valve repair when performed at an experienced surgical center. Recent data suggest a survival penalty when waiting for class I surgical guideline indications, and novel markers of decompensation are under investigation. Observations Comprehensive assessment of MR severity using echocardiography is critical, and when warranted, cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) is complementary. Assessment of LV size and function, as well as serial changes in both, is crucial for determining timing of surgery. New-onset atrial fibrillation, left atrial enlargement, pulmonary hypertension, and exercise-induced changes in LV function should also be considered in borderline scenarios. The roles of LV volumes, global longitudinal strain, CMR-derived measures of myocardial dysfunction, and cardiac biomarkers are worthy of further investigation regarding consideration for early surgical intervention. Conclusions and Relevance A more refined approach incorporating assessment of extravalvular cardiac injury, novel imaging markers, and biomarkers is needed to optimize surgical timing in primary MR. Further research is warranted to validate these emerging parameters and refine guidelines to improve patient outcomes."

The reported incidence is 6–10 per 1 000 live births. Comorbid connective tissue dysplasia (CTD) significantly influences the clinical course of CHD, contributing to structural weakness of cardiac and vascular tissues, elevated risk of postoperative complications, and poorer long-term outcomes. Objective. To synthesise current evidence regarding the clinical features, complications, and management of congenital heart disease in children with concomitant connective tissue dysplasia; to identify key pathophysiological mechanisms and highlight promising diagnostic and therapeutic strategies. Materials and methods. This review analyses global trends in the association between CHD and CTD in the paediatric population. Scientific literature indexed in PubMed, ScienceDirect, and Google Scholar from 2017 to 2024 was systematically evaluated. Results. Current research indicates that molecular alterations in connective tissue components—particularly fibrillin, collagen, and transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) receptors—impair myocardial and vascular remodelling, thereby increasing susceptibility of valves and arterial walls to haemodynamic stress. Children with CTD frequently exhibit valve prolapse with regurgitation, aortic dilatation, aneurysm formation, vascular dissection, and heightened risk of perioperative haemorrhage and infection. These patients are more likely to require repeat surgical procedures and demonstrate delayed wound healing. Well-characterised syndromes—including Marfan, Loeys–Dietz, and Ehlers–Danlos—demonstrate unequivocal cardiovascular involvement. Optimal management mandates a multidisciplinary strategy encompassing early recognition of phenotypic features, comprehensive imaging (echocardiography, cardiac magnetic resonance imaging, angiography), and targeted genetic testing. Regular surveillance of aortic dimensions and valvular function, judicious timing of interventions, and appropriate pharmacological prophylaxis are critical to mitigating severe complications. Conclusions. Connective tissue dysplasia constitutes a significant comorbidity that exacerbates the natural history of congenital heart disease, increases surgical risk, and necessitates individualised therapeutic planning. Phenotypic signs of CTD must be actively sought and integrated into preoperative assessment and surgical decision-making. A coordinated, multidisciplinary approach—supported by advanced imaging, genetic counselling, and longitudinal follow-up—is essential for risk reduction and improved long-term prognosis. Further research into the molecular genetics and pathogenesis of CTD holds promise for early risk stratification and personalised management in children with CHD."

However, long-term durability remains limited by structural valve degeneration (SVD). Case report A 70-year-old male presented with severe heart failure 4 years after bioprosthetic mitral and aortic valve replacement. Imaging confirmed SVD affecting both valves, necessitating high-risk redo surgery. Postoperatively, the patient developed profound systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) to cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB), refractory to vasopressors and steroids, and died within 24 hours. Discussion Further investigations revealed elevated isolated anti-cardiolipin IgM antibodies, raising suspicion of autoimmune-mediated valve thrombosis as a contributor to this case of early SVD. Conclusion This case highlights the importance of thorough diagnostic evaluation in cases of early SVD, the need to individualise anticoagulation strategies in at-risk patients, and serves as a critical reminder of the serious inflammatory complications that can occur post-surgery."

Лазоришинець; К. В. Руденко,,2025-12-23,Scientific periodicals of Ukraine,"Aim of the study. To identify the clinical, laboratory, hemodynamic, and anamnestic factors associated with in-hospital mortality in patients with a history of COVID-19 undergoing surgical correction of valvular heart disease, considering infection severity, timing of infection (pre- or postoperative), renal dysfunction, protein status, tissue injury biomarkers, and respiratory failure. Materials and methods. This retrospective, single-center study included 100 patients who experienced COVID-19 either before or after surgical correction of valvular heart disease at the National M. Amosov Institute of Cardiovascular Surgery affiliated to National Academy of Medical Sciences of Ukraine (Kyiv, Ukraine), between 2021 and 2024. Patients were stratified by in-hospital outcome (survival vs. death). Comparative analyses was performed across clinical, laboratory, hemodynamic, and operative parameters, with particular attention to the timing (pre- or postoperative) and severity of COVID-19 infection. Statistical analysis was carried out Student’s t-test and chi-square tests; significance was set at p &lt; 0.05. Results. Seventeen clinical and biochemical indicators demonstrated significant differences between survivors and non-survivors. The key predictors included older age (65.05 ± 2.11 vs 54.71 ± 1.62 years; p = 0.001), longer hospitalization (29.7 ± 4.46 vs 18.73 ± 1.31 days; p &lt; 0.001), reduced glomerular filtration rate (pre- and postoperatively; p &lt; 0.05), hypoproteinemia (p &lt; 0.01), elevated tissue injury markers (LDH, CK-MB, AST; p &lt; 0.05), and markers of respiratory and metabolic failure. In addition, the severity of COVID-19 significantly influenced mortality: 85 % in the severe group, 6.38 % in the mild group, and 0 % in the moderate group (χ2 = 66.51; p &lt; 0.01). The timing of infection was also critical: mortality was highest (59.3 %) among patients who contracted COVID-19 postoperatively, compared to only 4.35 % among those infected preoperatively (χ2 = 36.64; p &lt; 0.01). Conclusions. The primary determinants of in-hospital mortality after valve surgery in post-COVID-19 patients include advanced age, renal dysfunction, reduced protein reserves, tissue damage biomarkers, respiratory failure, as well as the timing and severity of COVID-19 infection. These factors should guide perioperative risk stratification and support the rationale for delaying surgery in high-risk post-COVID-19 cases."

Wright; Fátima Coronado,10.1177/15409996251403974,2025-12-23,Journal of Women s Health,"Background: Cardiovascular diseases are among the leading causes of maternal morbidity and mortality in the United States. During 2010–2020, 1 in 10 severe maternal morbidities (SMMs) during delivery hospitalization was heart disease (HD)-related. This report synthesizes science, including methodologies, challenges, and opportunities, and summarizes national estimates on HD during pregnancy, focusing on congenital heart disease (CHD), cardiomyopathies (CM), valvular heart disease (VHD), arrhythmias (ARR), and heart failure (HF). Methods and Results: We analyzed large nationwide databases, including the National Inpatient Sample and the Nationwide Readmissions Database. The prevalence of HD complicating deliveries ranges from approximately 20–40 cases per 10,000 deliveries. Increasing trends were observed in CHD, ARR, and HF. HF, particularly peripartum CM, is a leading cause of adverse maternal outcomes, including in-hospital mortality and SMM. VHD prevalence has declined, whereas ARR has become the most prevalent HD during pregnancy hospitalizations. Significant gaps exist due to inconsistent definitions and methodologies, limiting comparability and clinical utility. Proposed solutions include adopting standardized definitions, developing a core outcome set, improving data quality through structured documentation and standardized data models, and using validated algorithms and indices. Collaboration among multidisciplinary teams is essential to enhance research quality. Conclusion: The efforts aligning definitions of HD, outcomes, and indices with public health measures and initiatives present an opportunity to create a unifying framework that connects patient-level data to system-wide improvements. This integration helps ensure that advances in methodology translate into better care delivery, billing accuracy, research quality, and public health surveillance, and ultimately enhance outcomes for pregnant women with HD."
OpenAlex,valvular heart disease,Key risk factors for in-hospital mortality following valve surgery in patients with prior COVID-19 infection,D. M. Kosovan; O. A. Krykunov; V. V. Lazoryshynets; K. V. Rudenko,10.14739/2310-1237.2025.3.334213,2025-12-23,Pathologia,"Aim of the study. To identify the clinical, laboratory, hemodynamic, and anamnestic factors associated with in-hospital mortality in patients with a history of COVID-19 undergoing surgical correction of valvular heart disease, considering infection severity, timing of infection (pre- or postoperative), renal dysfunction, protein status, tissue injury biomarkers, and respiratory failure. Materials and methods. This retrospective, single-center study included 100 patients who experienced COVID-19 either before or after surgical correction of valvular heart disease at the National M. Amosov Institute of Cardiovascular Surgery affiliated to National Academy of Medical Sciences of Ukraine (Kyiv, Ukraine), between 2021 and 2024. Patients were stratified by in-hospital outcome (survival vs. death). Comparative analyses was performed across clinical, laboratory, hemodynamic, and operative parameters, with particular attention to the timing (pre- or postoperative) and severity of COVID-19 infection. Statistical analysis was carried out Student’s t-test and chi-square tests; significance was set at p &lt; 0.05. Results. Seventeen clinical and biochemical indicators demonstrated significant differences between survivors and non-survivors. The key predictors included older age (65.05 ± 2.11 vs 54.71 ± 1.62 years; p = 0.001), longer hospitalization (29.7 ± 4.46 vs 18.73 ± 1.31 days; p &lt; 0.001), reduced glomerular filtration rate (pre- and postoperatively; p &lt; 0.05), hypoproteinemia (p &lt; 0.01), elevated tissue injury markers (LDH, CK-MB, AST; p &lt; 0.05), and markers of respiratory and metabolic failure. In addition, the severity of COVID-19 significantly influenced mortality: 85 % in the severe group, 6.38 % in the mild group, and 0 % in the moderate group (χ2 = 66.51; p &lt; 0.01). The timing of infection was also critical: mortality was highest (59.3 %) among patients who contracted COVID-19 postoperatively, compared to only 4.35 % among those infected preoperatively (χ2 = 36.64; p &lt; 0.01). Conclusions. The primary determinants of in-hospital mortality after valve surgery in post-COVID-19 patients include advanced age, renal dysfunction, reduced protein reserves, tissue damage biomarkers, respiratory failure, as well as the timing and severity of COVID-19 infection. These factors should guide perioperative risk stratification and support the rationale for delaying surgery in high-risk post-COVID-19 cases."
OpenAlex,valvular heart disease,Right ventricular function as a predictor of morbidity and mortality in post-heart valve surgery,Mohammad Risandi Priatama; Sony Hilal Wicaksono; Arinto Bono Adji Hardjosworo; Ario Soeryo Kuncoro; Dian Yaniarti Hasanah; Damba Dwisepto Aulia Sakti; Amiliana M Soesanto,10.4081/monaldi.2025.3447,2025-12-22,Monaldi Archives for Chest Disease,"Valvular heart disease (VHD) remains a significant global health concern, with mortality rates ranging from 1% to 15%. In Indonesia, the most prevalent form of VHD is rheumatic heart disease, which is associated with a hospital mortality rate of 6.5% following valve surgery. Previous studies have shown that, post-surgery, morbidity rates remain high: 30.8% of patients experience prolonged intensive care unit stays (&gt;96 hours), 30.67% require extended mechanical ventilation (&gt;24 hours), and 52% need prolonged use of inotropic agents (≥14 days). Right ventricular (RV) dysfunction is closely associated with these three morbidity parameters, as well as with 30-day postoperative mortality. However, limited research in Indonesia has explored the most effective parameters for evaluating RV function as a predictor of postoperative morbidity and mortality following heart valve surgery. This prospective cohort study was conducted at the Department of Cardiology and Vascular Medicine, Universitas Indonesia, and the National Cardiovascular Center Harapan Kita (NCCHK) from October 2023 to July 2024. During this period, 174 patients with VHD who underwent surgical valve replacement were enrolled. After applying exclusion criteria, 26 patients were excluded, resulting in a final study population of 148 patients. All participants underwent preoperative echocardiographic assessment of RV function, performed by two operators within 1 week prior to surgery. Among the 148 subjects, females comprised the majority (60.1%). Atrial fibrillation (AF) was the most common comorbidity, affecting 62.8% of the cohort. The most frequent morbidity outcome was prolonged mechanical ventilation, observed in 27.7% of cases. Of the total mortality events, 70% were cardiac-related, while the remaining 30% were due to non-cardiac causes. Multivariate analysis revealed that a preoperative S′&lt;10 cm/s was significantly associated with cardiac-related mortality [odds ratio (OR) 3.46; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.01-11.87; p=0.049]. Additionally, a preoperative S′&lt;11 cm/s was significantly associated with overall clinical outcomes, including both morbidity and all-cause mortality (OR 3.08; 95% CI 1.43-6.65; p=0.004). In conclusion, S′, an echocardiographic parameter reflecting RV function, demonstrates potential as a predictive marker for postoperative morbidity and mortality in patients undergoing heart valve surgery."
OpenAlex,valvular heart disease,Progressive and concordant alterations in transcriptional and gut microbiota across aortic valve calcification severity,Jue Wang; Ruihang Qu; Weicheng Huang; Yue Chen; Yun Li; Qi Lin; Ziji Wu; Hangfei Yan; Tingting Yu; Chiyin Wang; Xinlei Ren; Xi Wang; Jinyu Wu,10.1128/spectrum.02137-25,2025-12-22,Microbiology Spectrum,"ABSTRACT Calcific aortic valve disease (CAVD) is a common disorder associated with substantial morbidity and mortality. Although the gut microbiome has complex associations with cardiovascular disease, its variation across the calcification spectrum in CAVD remains poorly defined. We profiled aortic-valve transcriptomes from 31 patients spanning graded calcification and paired these with matched stool microbiome profiles. We identified subtle yet widespread transcriptional changes in mild CAVD (m-CAVD), consistent with a progressive relationship between calcification burden and gene-expression remodeling. At the community level, the gut microbiome in m-CAVD exhibited an intermediate configuration between non- and higher-calcification profiles, suggesting an early shift in the gut ecosystem along the disease continuum. At the genus level, we identified 11 taxa associated with stage; notably, Anaerococcus increased with calcification burden, whereas Rheinheimera declined across stages. These results refine the pathophysiology landscape of CAVD by connecting stage-dependent valvular transcriptional changes with coordinated shifts in the gut microbiome and indicate that early, microbiome-targeted interventions may be promising. IMPORTANCE Calcific aortic valve disease is a common valvular heart disease. Due to the difficulty in sampling arterial calcified tissues, research on the interaction between their gene expression and the gut has been limited. In this study, by analyzing the transcriptional profiles of calcified aortic valve tissues from patients with different levels of calcification and the characteristics of their corresponding gut microbiota, we identified consistent features between lesion gene expression and gut microbiota variation. This provides important evidence for the association between the gut microbiota and disease development stages, offering a new perspective for understanding disease progression and early intervention."

However, information regarding the factors influencing cardiovascular events in neonates and mothers within 6 months postpartum is limited. This study aimed to identify predictors of adverse maternal and neonatal outcomes in pregnancies of women with pre-existing heart disease. Methods: The study conducted a retrospective cross-sectional analysis of all pregnancies with a history of heart disease from January 2017 to January 2024, using secondary data from medical records at Dr M. Djamil Padang Hospital, Indonesia. We analysed the data using the χ2/Fisher’s exact test and logistic regression. Results: A total of 110 pregnant women with heart diseases were hospitalised during the study period, with an average age of 30.52 ± 6.00 years. The most common types of heart disease were valvular heart disease (28%), chronic hypertension (24%) and congenital heart disease (23%). In 27.2% of cases, adverse maternal outcomes included mortality (10%), heart failure (8.2%), arrhythmia (4.5%), rehospitalisation (3.6%) and thromboembolic event (0.9%). Meanwhile, 57.3% of cases had neonatal adverse outcomes, including mortality (5.4%), low Apgar score (16.4%), prematurity (28.2%), low birthweight (6.4%) and congenital heart disease (0.9%). The multivariate analysis discovered that moderate-to-severe left heart obstruction (OR 14.184; 95% CI [2.725–73.836]; p=0.002) and reduced ejection fraction &lt;40% (OR 16.211; 95% CI [1.712–153.507]; p=0.015) were the main factors that led to adverse maternal outcomes. Meanwhile, cyanotic congenital heart disease (OR 8.449; 95% CI [1.030-69.328]; p=0.047) was the most important determinant of adverse neonatal outcomes. Conclusion: This study revealed that moderate-severe left heart obstruction and reduced ejection fraction &lt;40% were the most significant factors influencing adverse maternal outcomes. Meanwhile, cyanotic congenital heart disease was the most important determinant of adverse neonatal outcomes."
OpenAlex,valvular heart disease,Features of immune response to xenogeneic tissues of cardiac valves and patches: Review of literature,A. V. Shabaldin; A. V. Blinova; A. V. Evtushenko,10.15789/1563-0625-foi-3159,2025-12-20,Medical Immunology (Russia),"Global studies show that valvular heart disease still takes one of the leading places in the structure of mortality from cardiovascular diseases, being among the major causes of heart failure, including those among the employed population. Xenogeneic tissues are widely used in cardiac surgery, both in biological prosthetic heart valves, and as vascular and intracardiac patches. Modern chemical methods of xenogenic tissue treatment aimed at elimination of its immunogenicity but they do not, however, completely remove xenoantigens from the tissues. The residual carbohydrate antigens are thought to be a trigger of immune response against the animal xenotissues. At the same time, the role of immune response to xenogeneic antigens for induction of inflammation, valve dysfunction, and calcification are under discussion. The aim of this review was to summarize the research data on immune response to xenogeneic tissue implanted into the heart, and to find tools of preventing this immune conflict. Modification of pericardium of large animals by various methods does not entirely remove carbohydrate epitopes from extracellular matrix and cell membranes, which are recognized by pre-existing antibodies of M and G classes. The highly dynamic functioning of xenogeneic biological prostheses increases their antigenicity by reducing the primary cross-linking of extracellular matrix and activating the alternative complement pathway associated with adsorption iC3b complement component on xenogeneic tissue, serving as an opsonin for micro- and macrophages. The inflammatory endotypes of individual patients may be genetically determined by increased synthesis of certain cytokines. In particular, rheumatic heart disease, as a basis for the disorders of mitral heart valves, is characterized by an increase in TNFα, IFNγ and IL-6. Any of these cytokines may be targets for biological therapies aimed at limiting the constitutional inflammatory endotype. The OMICs technologies applied to various studies of biological degradation of xenogeneic heart valve prostheses, their implantation, and wide clinical examination of patients, may help us to find novel variants of immune-inflammatory endotypes leading to dysfunction of bioprostheses, and to identify target molecules for potential inhibition of antixenogeneic immune response."
OpenAlex,valvular heart disease,ACEF score as a predictor of new-onset atrial fibrillation in patients with ST-elevation myocardial infarction: A retrospective cohort study,Evliya Akdeniz; Burak Hünük; Cennet Yıldız; Süleyman Deniz Abdullahoğlu; Merve Ortakaya; Dilay Karabulut; Fatma Nihan Turhan Çağlar; Ömer Kozan,10.1371/journal.pone.0339483,2025-12-19,PLoS ONE,"Background New-onset atrial fibrillation (NOAF) during acute ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) is common and linked to adverse outcomes. This study aimed to assess the predictive value of the age–creatinine–ejection fraction (ACEF) score for NOAF in STEMI patients. Methods We retrospectively analyzed 951 STEMI patients who underwent primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) at out tertiary center between 2020 and 2023. Patients with prior atrial fibrillation (AF), AF on admission, cardiogenic shock, heart failure, significant valvular disease, or failed PCI were excluded. Clinical, laboratory, and echocardiographic data were collected, and ACEF scores were calculated. NOAF was defined as any AF episode during hospitalization in patients without prior AF. The optimal ACEF cutoff was determined using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis (Youden’s index), and multivariate logistic regression identified independent predictors of NOAF. Results NOAF occurred in 63 patients (6.6%). These patients were older, more often female, and had lower systolic blood pressure, lower left ventricular ejection fraction, and higher C-reactive protein and creatinine levels (all p &lt; 0.05). In-hospital major adverse cardiac events (MACE) and mortality were significantly higher in the NOAF group than patients in without NOAF group (22.2% vs. 6.2%, and 15.9% vs. 4.3%, respectively; p &lt; 0.001). The ACEF score was significantly higher in patients with NOAF (1.73 ± 0.74 vs. 1.42 ± 0.64, p &lt; 0.001). ROC analysis showed an area under curve (AUC) of 0.643 (95% CI: 0.571–0.715; p &lt; 0.001). An ACEF score ≥1.32 predicted NOAF with 73% sensitivity and 55.6% specificity. In multivariate analysis, ACEF remained an independent predictor of NOAF (OR ~1.5, p = 0.02), but among its components, only age was independently associated with NOAF (OR ~1.03 per year, p = 0.01). Conclusions The ACEF score modestly predicts NOAF in STEMI patients, but its predictive power only incremental to age alone. Further studies are warranted for this field."

We performed a multi-ancestry genome-wide association meta-analysis of 86,864 AS cases among 2,853,408 individuals, discovering 241 autosomal independent risk loci and 3 X chromosome risk loci. We additionally performed sex-stratified and ancestry-stratified genome-wide association studies (GWASs), identifying an additional 5 sex-specific risk loci, 11 risk loci in European ancestry individuals and 1 risk locus in African ancestry individuals. We also performed a transcriptome-wide association study using expression quantitative trait loci from human aortic valves, discovering 54 new genes for which genetically predicted expression influences the risk of AS. We then generated a new polygenic risk score for AS. Finally, we performed gene silencing experiments targeting biologically relevant genes identified by our GWAS. Silencing of CMKLR1 and LTBP4 in human valvular interstitial cells substantially decreased mineralization, implicating a role for polyunsaturated fatty acids and transforming growth factor β signaling in AS."
OpenAlex,valvular heart disease,"Radiation-Induced Valvular Heart Disease: A Narrative Review of Epidemiology, Diagnosis and Management",Andreea-Mădălina Varvara; Catalina A. Parasca; Vlad Anton Iliescu; Ruxandra Jurcuţ,10.3390/jcdd13010001,2025-12-19,Journal of Cardiovascular Development and Disease,"Mediastinal radiotherapy plays a central role in the treatment of several malignancies, particularly Hodgkin lymphoma and breast cancer. However, exposure to thoracic radiation is associated with long-term cardiovascular complications, among which valvular heart disease (VHD) is increasingly recognized. Radiation-induced VHD typically presents after a latency period of 10–20 years and is characterized by progressive valve fibrosis, thickening, and calcification, most commonly affecting the left-sided valves. Management of radiation-induced VHD generally follows standard guidelines but remains challenging due to extensive calcification and coexisting radiation-related cardiac or pulmonary injury. A history of thoracic radiotherapy is associated with increased perioperative risk and may negatively impact surgical outcomes, which often alters the risk–benefit balance and favors less invasive therapeutic approaches. Advances in the transcatheter approach have expanded treatment options for this high-risk population; however, data on long-term outcomes remain limited. Evolving dose-reduction techniques, such as deep-inspiration breath-hold, intensity-modulated radiotherapy, and proton therapy, together with predictive dosimetric models, aim to minimize future cardiac toxicity. Given the delayed onset and progressive nature of radiation-associated VHD, structured long-term surveillance is essential to enable early detection and timely intervention in cancer survivors at risk."
OpenAlex,valvular heart disease,Diagnosis and treatment of right-sided valve disease in cardiac carcinoid syndrome: a systematic review,Bernardo Nascimento Lourenço; Bruno Vilhena; Gélcio Luiz Quintella Mendes; G. Amorim; Aurora Felice Castro Issa; Wolney de Andrade Martins,10.1159/000549211,2025-12-18,Cardiology,"Background: Carcinoid heart disease (CaHD) is a severe complication of neuroendocrine tumors, characterized by progressive fibrotic involvement of right-sided heart valves due to serotonin and other vasoactive substances. This condition significantly worsens prognosis and quality of life, yet therapeutic strategies remain heterogeneous and based on low-level evidence. Objective: To systematically review diagnostic approaches and therapeutic options for right-sided valvular disease in CaHD, assessing indications, advantages, limitations, and outcomes. Methods: A systematic review was conducted according to PRISMA guidelines and registered in PROSPERO (CRD42023392363). Searches were performed in PUBMED/MEDLINE, LILACS, and EMBASE for studies published between 2002 and 2024. Eligible studies included clinical trials, observational studies, case series, and case reports evaluating pharmacologic, surgical, or percutaneous interventions for CaHD with reported cardiovascular outcomes. Risk of bias was assessed using ROBINS-I V2 and JBI tools. Results: Of 183 total records, 45 studies met inclusion criteria (30 case reports, 8 case series, 7 observational studies). Tricuspid regurgitation was the most prevalent lesion (90%), followed by pulmonary regurgitation (73%). Somatostatin analogues were frequently used but did not prevent progression of valve disease. Surgical valve replacement, predominantly with bioprostheses, remains the cornerstone for severe symptomatic cases, providing symptomatic and echocardiographic improvement, but with a perioperative mortality of up to 10%. Percutaneous valve therapies, though limited to small series and case reports, demonstrated promising short-term outcomes without major complications. Additional strategies such as patent foramen ovale closure and hepatic resection showed potential prognostic benefit. No significant difference in outcomes was observed between biological and mechanical prostheses. Conclusions: Surgical valve replacement remains the most effective evidence-based therapy for CaHD, while percutaneous techniques emerge as feasible alternatives in high-risk patients. Adjunctive measures such as PFO closure and hepatic metastasis resection may improve prognosis. Drug therapies control carcinoid syndrome but are insufficient to halt cardiac disease progression. Further prospective studies are needed to define optimal timing, patient selection, and long-term outcomes of interventional strategies."
