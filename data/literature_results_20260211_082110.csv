PubMed,aortic stenosis,Supravalvular aortic stenosis with aneurysmal dilation and infective vegetations of the aortic arch in a pediatric patient with Williams syndrome: a case report and review of the literature.,Ahmad Bishr Nasra; Alwaleed Al-Dairy; Aram Almohamad; Ahmad Jabr; Younes Al-Dairy,10.1186/s13256-026-05868-5,2026-02-11,Journal of medical case reports,"Williams syndrome is a rare genetic condition frequently associated with cardiovascular anomalies, particularly supravalvular aortic stenosis. The coexistence of supravalvular aortic stenosis, aneurysmal dilation, and infective endocarditis with vegetations in the aortic arch is exceedingly rare.
We describe an 8-year-old Arab boy from Syria with Williams syndrome who presented with fatigue, tachycardia, dyspnea, fever, chills, and night sweats. Transthoracic echocardiography revealed a dilated aortic arch with large vegetation at the origin of the brachiocephalic trunk and supravalvular aortic stenosis. Despite 10 days of intravenous antibiotic therapy, vegetations persisted, necessitating urgent surgery. The ascending aorta was replaced using the McGoon technique with complete excision of infected tissue. Postoperative recovery was uneventful, and follow-up imaging showed good left ventricular function without aortic gradient.
This case underscores the importance of early recognition and timely surgical intervention in preventing catastrophic outcomes in patients with Williams syndrome and complex cardiovascular involvement."

With a specific blood flow-reversal device, TCAR redirects blood flow thereby minimizing the embolic risk during the whole treatment process of carotid stenosis. The risk of periprocedural stroke and death of patients who received TCAR is similar to those received carotid endarterectomy (CEA). However, the risk of myocardial infarction and cranial nerve injury is lower in TCAR population. In comparison with transfemoral carotid artery stenting, the risk of periprocedural stroke or death was significantly reduced in TCAR. The comprehensive therapeutic effect is similar between TCAR and CEA, but TCAR requires shorter procedural time. Despite these advantages, TCAR's clinical adoption requires more robust validation with large-scale prospective and multicenter randomized controlled trials to establish long-term efficacy and safety benchmarks. With ongoing technical refinements, TCAR may represent a key option for the transformation of carotid artery stenosis and therapeutic paradigm."

Different initial strategies, AoV repair/surgical valvuloplasty (SAV), AoV replacement (AVR), and Ross procedure were compared to elucidate the current best strategy.
All paediatric patients undergoing different initial AoV surgeries from 1976 to 2024 were included. Factors including prior balloon dilation (balloon valvuloplasty [BAV]), valve morphology, and initial disease (stenosis/regurgitation/mixed) were analysed. Survival and incidence of AoV reoperation/≥moderate AoV insufficiency/stenosis were evaluated.
A total of 323 patients underwent 142 SAV/33 AVR/137 Ross at median age/weight of 5.7 years [interquartile range, 0.5-12.6]/19.9 kg [6.9-48.8]. Surgical valvuloplasty group was the youngest (P < .01). Thirty-day mortality was 2.5% (8/323) without group differences (P = .15). Median follow-up was 9.6 years [2.7-17.8] with 10-/20-year survival rates of 90.4% [86.1-93.4]/87.1% [81.4-91.1] without group differences. Twenty-year cumulative incidences of AoV reoperations were higher after SAV: 78.4% [70.8-86.9] vs 24.6% [11.7-51.7] after AVR and 15% [6.8-33.1] after Ross, P < .01. Survivors with their native AoV at 20 years (n = 48, 14.8%) were younger at initial surgery (P < .01), had predominantly AoV stenosis (91.7%), and had fewer BAVs (P < .01). Cox regression demonstrated 7.8-fold higher mortality hazard after AVR (P < .01) and a lower reoperation hazard after AVR and Ross (HR 0.1 [95% CI, 0.1-0.5], P < .01 and HR 0.1 [95% CI, 0.1-0.3], P < .01) compared to SAV.
All initial AoV surgeries brought excellent early/long-term survival. Aortic valve reoperations occur most frequently after SAV. In case of favourable AoV anatomy, early SAV can preserve the native valve. Ross procedure identified as safe and durable."

Genomic and precision medicine,"Genetic variation affects clinical outcomes, prognosis, and family planning decisions in individuals with congenital heart disease (CHD). While genetic testing recommendations for infants and children with CHD have expanded, similar broad guidelines are lacking for patients with adult CHD (ACHD). Here, we investigated the current state of genetic testing in patients with ACHD and their perceptions toward testing, which has not been previously reported.
A single-center prospective cohort survey of patients with ACHD aged ≥18 years was evaluated in a large ACHD clinic over a 12-month period.
Among 336 survey respondents (median age, 29 years; 52% male), CHD lesions were wide ranging, albeit largely represented by conotruncal (35%) or left ventricular outflow tract (35%) lesions. Most patients did not have children (64%) or a family history of CHD (79%). Thirteen percent had evidence of prior genetic testing despite 41% to 98% meeting criteria by current pediatric recommendations. Most desired genetic testing (68%) though interest varied by sex, education level, and family status. Individual and family health factors were reported as the most influential considerations for genetic testing.
Few patients with ACHD have had genetic testing despite most being eligible based on current pediatric guidelines, likely related to birth era. Patients were interested in genetic testing though demographic factors and family status affected interest. The lack of broad recommendations for genetic testing in the ACHD population likely represents a significant barrier to increased utilization of genetic tests."

However, aortic stenosis secondary to Takayasu arteritis can rarely cause intestinal ischemia through hemodynamic steal from the mesenteric to lower limb circulation.
A 67-year-old woman with a history of Takayasu arteritis presented with postprandial and exertional abdominal pain and a 3-kg weight loss over 2 weeks. CTA revealed isolated severe stenosis of the infrarenal aorta with development of the arc of Riolan, and Doppler ultrasonography demonstrated retrograde flow in the inferior mesenteric artery. Based on these findings, a diagnosis of mesenteric steal syndrome secondary to Takayasu arteritis was made. Endovascular stenting of the infrarenal aorta was performed, resulting in improved antegrade aortic flow and reduced collateral circulation. After treatment, the patient's abdominal pain resolved and her weight recovered.
This rare case demonstrates that Takayasu arteritis can cause mesenteric steal syndrome without mesenteric arterial lesions and highlights that endovascular stenting can effectively restore physiological blood flow and relieve ischemic symptoms."

Earlier studies described a ""sex paradox,"" with women experiencing more procedural complications but similar or superior survival compared with men. However, most data derive from earlier device generations, and contemporary evidence is limited.
We retrospectively analyzed all patients with severe aortic stenosis who underwent TAVI at the University Hospital of Angers between January 2012 and December 2023. Clinical and procedural characteristics were collected from a dedicated database. Propensity-score matching (1:1) was performed to account for baseline differences. The primary end-point was 30-day mortality.
A total of 2,718 patients underwent TAVI, of whom 49.1% were women. Women were older but had fewer comorbidities than men. After matching (1,320 pairs), procedural duration was similar, but women more often required alternative access and received self-expandable valves. Thirty-day mortality did not differ between sexes, but all-cause mortality was significantly higher in men (p < 0.01). Women had a greater incidence of postoperative stroke, particularly in low-risk patients, whereas men had higher rates of acute renal failure and pacemaker implantation. The survival probability was higher for women in overall population and in low- and intermediate-risk patients.
In this large, contemporary cohort, women experienced more strokes, whereas men had higher all-cause mortality and conduction-related complications. These findings underscore persistent sex-specific differences in TAVI outcomes and highlight the need for tailored procedural strategies."

This study aimed to assess whether EAT volume and density are associated with cardiac remodelling and clinical outcomes in a well-phenotyped cohort of patients with initially asymptomatic AS.
In this post hoc exploratory analysis of a multicentre, prospective longitudinal study, asymptomatic patients with moderate-to-severe AS (n=136; age 68.6 (60.1, 75.3) years, 27% female) and control participants (n=39; age 59.0 (54.0, 67.0) years, 38% female) underwent echocardiography, cardiac CT and MRI. EAT volume and mean CT attenuation were measured from non-contrast cardiac CT using an automated deep learning software. The primary outcome was symptoms necessitating valve replacement, cardiovascular death or major adverse cardiac event.
Participants with AS had significantly higher indexed EAT volumes (56.5 vs 38.8 cm3/m2, p<0.001) and lower EAT attenuation (-76.3 vs -69.9 Hounsfield units, p<0.001). Both measures were correlated with markers of AS severity. Indexed EAT volume was not associated with cardiac remodelling in AS after correcting for confounding variables; however, a higher mean EAT CT attenuation was associated with higher indexed left ventricular mass. There were 42 (31%) primary outcome events over a median of 370 days. Lower indexed EAT volume and higher mean CT attenuation were associated with the outcome, independent of age and sex. Indexed EAT volume remained negatively associated after further adjustment for AS severity.
Indexed EAT volume was higher in patients with AS, but not associated with MRI markers of cardiac remodelling. A higher indexed EAT volume was independently associated with a lower occurrence of symptoms and cardiovascular events. Further studies are needed to corroborate these findings and whether EAT has a potentially protective role in symptom progression in AS.

Despite its minimally invasive nature, transfemoral TAVI requires both a primary and a secondary arterial access site. While the femoral artery is most commonly used for secondary access, vascular and bleeding complications remain frequent and are associated with adverse outcomes. Observational evidence from TAVI cohorts suggests that radial secondary access may reduce such complications compared to femoral access.
The RADIAL-TAVI trial is a prospective, randomized, controlled, multicenter, open-label study designed to compare radial versus femoral secondary access in patients undergoing transfemoral TAVI. A total of 434 patients will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio. The primary endpoint is the incidence of vascular and bleeding complications at the secondary access site within 30 days, adjudicated according to VARC-3 criteria. Secondary endpoints include early safety, cardiovascular mortality, major adverse cardiovascular and cerebrovascular events (MACCE), quality of life, and health economic aspects up to 30 days, as well as long-term mortality up to 12 months. The study is powered to detect a reduction in the primary endpoint from 8% with femoral to 2% with radial access.
The RADIAL-TAVI trial will provide the first randomized evidence on the optimal secondary access strategy in transfemoral TAVI. If radial access proves superior, it has the potential to redefine standard practice, reduce complication rates, and improve patient safety and outcomes."

Cardiovascular Imaging,"Mixed aortic valve disease poses unique haemodynamic challenges. This study compared the clinical outcomes of concomitant moderate aortic stenosis (AS) and moderate aortic regurgitation to isolated AS.
We analysed a multicentre cohort of valvular heart disease between 2008 and 2022 at three tertiary centres. The entire cohort was divided into three groups: moderate AS accompanied by moderate aortic regurgitation (moderate ASR), isolated severe AS, and isolated moderate AS. The primary outcome was a composite of cardiac death and hospitalization for heart failure. The final analysis included 4395 patients (median age: 76 years, 50.8% male), comprising 224 patients with moderate ASR, 1996 with severe AS, and 2175 with moderate AS. Over a median follow-up of 3.4 years, aortic valve replacement (AVR) rates were 11.1, 57.2, and 7.8 per 100 person-years in the moderate ASR, severe AS, and moderate AS groups, respectively (P < 0.001). Patients with moderate ASR had a significantly higher risk of the primary outcome compared with moderate AS [adjusted hazard ratio (aHR) 1.49; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.15-1.92; P = 0.002] and a risk comparable to severe AS (aHR 1.28; 95% CI 1.00-1.64; P = 0.052). These results remained consistent even when AVR was included as a time-varying covariate. Older age, male sex, renal dysfunction, and lower left ventricular ejection fraction were independent predictors of the primary outcome in patients with moderate ASR.
Moderate ASR should not be considered a benign condition, as it is associated with poor clinical outcomes comparable to those of severe AS."

Heart and circulatory physiology,"Background In patients with aortic valve stenosis (AS), the pathophysiological abnormalities involved in the transition to heart failure are unclear. As chronic heart failure progresses, the ratio between myocardial stroke work and oxygen consumption, i.e. myocardial external efficiency (MEE), steadily deteriorates. However, in patients with AS, it is unknown whether changes in MEE are involved in disease progression. Purpose We investigated changes in MEE and if MEE was associated with long-term prognosis in patients with AS. Methods Ten healthy controls and 38 patients with moderate-severe AS and preserved left ventricular ejection fraction ≥50% were included in the study. To evaluate MEE, we used serial 11C-acetate positron emission tomography, cardiovascular magnetic resonance imaging and echocardiography, with a median follow-up period of 2.8 years. Furthermore, we conducted a long-term follow-up for a median of 5.2 years to detect cardiac events and related them to MEE. Results In patients with AS, MEE increased during follow-up from 25.2% (95% CI: 24.0 to 26.5%) to 29.5% (95% CI: 27.3 to 31.8%; p=0.001) and was higher than in healthy volunteers, 19.9% (18.1 to 21.8; p<0.001). Patients who experienced a cardiac event during long-term follow-up (n=24, 63%) had higher baseline MEE, 26.5% (95% CI: 24.6 to 28.4%), than event-free patients, 23.3% (95% CI: 22.2 to 24.3%; p=0.004). Conclusion In asymptomatic patients with AS, MEE increased over time and high baseline MEE predicted a poor prognosis. Thus, the myocardium displayed an inherent capacity to improve the coupling between oxidative metabolism and contractile function in response to pressure overload."

Although international guidelines increasingly recognize Lp(a) as a risk-enhancing factor, in many Asian populations thresholds for high Lp(a) and treatment strategies remain undefined. This Korean position paper, developed by the Lp(a) Task Force of the Korean Society of Lipid and Atherosclerosis, presents an evidence-based summary of the pathophysiology, clinical relevance, and therapeutic landscape surrounding Lp(a), with a focus on Korean-specific data. It reviews the genetic architecture of Lp(a), ethnic variability in concentrations, and its mechanistic roles in inflammation, thrombosis, and calcification. Based on large Korean cohorts, a 3-tiered classification is proposed of normal (<30 mg/dL), borderline high (30-49 mg/dL), and high (≥50 mg/dL), harmonizing global thresholds with local data. The document also highlights the limitations of current Lp(a) assays in Korea, and calls for standardized, isoform-insensitive testing. Novel therapeutics, including antisense oligonucleotides, small interfering RNAs, and small molecular inhibitors, have shown promising Lp(a)-lowering effects, with multiple phase 3 trials currently ongoing, or in planning. Given the unmet clinical need, the paper recommends incorporating Lp(a) into cardiovascular risk assessment, and calls for Korean-specific longitudinal studies, national screening strategies, and participation in clinical trials. These efforts will help clarify Lp(a)-associated risk in Korean patients and guide the adoption of future targeted therapies."

As indications for TAVR expand, particularly into younger patient populations, the incidence of TAVR-associated infective endocarditis (TAVR-IE) has concurrently increased. Although the reported incidence of TAVR-IE remains relatively low (0.3%-2.0% per 100 patient-years), its clinical outcomes are notably poor, with mortality rates considerably higher than those observed in general infective endocarditis (IE). Moreover, the microbiological profile of TAVR-IE differs distinctly from surgical aortic valve replacement-associated IE (SAVR-IE), predominantly involving Enterococcus spp., Staphylococcus aureus, and coagulase-negative staphylococci. This review systematically summarizes the epidemiology, diagnosis, microbial etiology, prevention strategies, clinical prognosis, and management approaches for TAVR-IE, providing clinical insights and identifying key areas for future research."
PubMed,aortic stenosis,From Last Resort to Standard of Care: The Evolution and Future of Transcatheter Aortic Valve Implantation.,Oliver Lee; Ahmed Osman; Dominique Shum-Tim,10.31083/RCM46697,2026-01,Reviews in cardiovascular medicine,"Transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) has evolved from an experimental, last-resort procedure in 2002 to a first-line therapy for aortic stenosis; moreover, the 2025 ESC/EACTS (European Society of Cardiology/European Association for Cardiothoracic Surgeons) guidelines marked a paradigm shift beyond traditional risk stratification toward earlier intervention and broader patient selection. Current evidence demonstrates the non-inferiority or superiority of TAVI to surgical aortic valve replacement across all risk categories, with the guidelines now recommending TAVI for patients aged ≥70 years and formally endorsing early intervention in asymptomatic severe stenosis when procedural risk is low. Meanwhile, critical challenges persist despite large-scale systematic reviews demonstrating significant mortality reduction following TAVI, including paravalvular leak rates of 10-25% compared to near-zero rates with surgery, and subclinical leaflet thrombosis affecting up to 30% of patients with unclear optimal management strategies. Moreover, the expansion toward younger populations exposes critical knowledge gaps, including unknown long-term durability beyond 10 years, structural valve degeneration rates of 4.8-13.3% at 5-7 years, and complex reintervention scenarios with reported mortality rates of 17.1% for surgical TAVI explantation. Thus, this review synthesizes contemporary evidence within the framework of the 2025 guidelines while examining unique aspects, including the pathophysiology of subclinical leaflet thrombosis, polymeric heart valve technologies as next-generation solutions, and the critical durability questions that will determine the role of TAVI in younger patients. Next-generation polymeric valves utilizing materials such as polyhedral oligomeric silsesquioxanes-polycarbonate urethane (POSS-PCU), poly(styrene-b-isobutylene-b-styrene) (SIBS), and siloxane polyurethane-urea have shown promising preclinical results in terms of enhanced durability and reduced thrombogenicity, although comprehensive clinical validation remains necessary. As TAVI practice evolves under new guideline recommendations emphasizing early intervention and simplified antithrombotic management, this thorough analysis can provide essential context for understanding both current capabilities and future directions in transcatheter valve therapy."

POAF results from an interplay between pre-existing arrhythmogenic substrates, acute surgical triggers, unresolved inflammation, and autonomic nervous system (ANS) imbalance. Specialized pro-resolving mediators (SPMs) orchestrate inflammation resolution and tissue homeostasis; their deficiency may sustain valvular inflammation and promote arrhythmogenesis. Transcutaneous vagus nerve stimulation (tVNS) is a non-invasive approach that enhances parasympathetic tone, restores sympathovagal balance, and modulates inflammatory pathways. While tVNS has been applied postoperatively, its preoperative, preventive use in POAF has not been explored, representing a novel therapeutic strategy. In patients with CAVS, preoperative tVNS could reduce POAF by regulating ANS activity and limiting perioperative inflammation. Mechanistic insights may be gained through perioperative sampling, analysis of excised valvular and atrial tissue, and biomechanical assessments comparing stimulated and control groups. Preoperative tVNS thus offers a promising strategy to prevent POAF while addressing valvular inflammation, bridging translational physiology with clinical cardiology and potentially opening new avenues for the management of CAVS."

A more comprehensive characterization of cardiac function and energetics can be achieved through pressure-volume analysis, but its clinical application is limited by the requirement for invasive measurements. We aimed to develop a clinically accessible, non-invasive method for pressure-volume loop analysis.
We obtained simultaneous 3-dimensional echocardiograms and invasive LV pressures with micromanometer-tipped catheters during transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) for severe aortic stenosis. Volume-time traces from the echocardiograms were combined with invasive LV pressures and non-invasive pressure estimates to construct pressure-volume loops. We used echocardiograms before and after TAVR to evaluate changes in myocardial function via non-invasive pressure-volume studies.
In same-beat comparisons, stroke work calculated using non-invasive LV pressure estimations correlated well with stroke work calculated using invasive LV pressures (r = 0.95, ICC = 0.95, p < 0.0001, y = 0.90X + 1,836, mean bias -549 mmHg*mL, standard deviation 774 mmHg*mL; 95% limits of agreement: -2,006 to +967 mmHg*mL). After TAVR, stroke work fell substantially, ventricular efficiency increased, ventriculo-arterial coupling improved, and both total and resting energy consumption decreased. On the other hand, LV biplane EF and GLS remained unchanged.
This study confirms the validity and clinical accessibility of non-invasive pressure-volume loop analysis in patients with aortic stenosis. The method identified and characterized changes in myocardial energetics, function, and ventriculo-arterial interaction, that are not typically detected by conventional echocardiography. These findings highlight the potential of non-invasive pressure-volume analysis in clinical and research practice."

Conventional surgical strategies, including valve replacement or central coaptation stitches, have limitations. We report the case of a 59 year old man with nonischemic cardiomyopathy who was admitted with worsening heart failure and echocardiographic evidence of severe AR due to central malcoaptation of a structurally normal trileaflet aortic valve, along with severe tricuspid regurgitation. The patient underwent concomitant internal aortic ring annuloplasty, tricuspid valve repair with De Vega annuloplasty, and HeartMate 3 LVAD implantation. Postoperative transesophageal echocardiography showed only trace AR and mild tricuspid regurgitation. Recovery was uneventful, and valve function remained stable at 2 month follow-up. This case highlights the feasibility of internal geometric ring annuloplasty as an effective surgical adjunct for managing AR during LVAD implantation. This technique provides annular stabilization, preserves native leaflet function, and minimizes prosthetic burden, making it a physiologic and potentially durable alternative. In the context of mechanical circulatory support, it may fill an important therapeutic gap and deserves further evaluation in future studies."

Their concomitant occurrence carries a much poorer prognosis than isolated valve disease. Transcatheter edge-to-edge repair (TEER) of MR and TR is safe and effective, but there is limited data on combined MR/TR TEER.

Methods                     This retrospective safety and efficacy analysis included the first 40 patients treated with combined MR/TR TEER between 2019 and 2021 at our single tertiary care referral centre.                                                           Results                     Combined procedural success (MR reduction ≥2° and TR reduction ≥1°) was achieved in 80% of the cases. Simultaneous TEER was safe, with no intraprocedural death, myocardial infarction (MI), stroke, or major bleeding. At 1-year follow-up, the median New York Heart Association functional (NYHA) class improved by one grade; twelve patients (30%) died, and fourteen patients (35%) were hospitalized for HF. Procedural success and postprocedural residual MR ≤ 1° were associated with reduced 1-year mortality rates but not HF hospitalizations.                                                           Conclusion                     Combined MR/TR TEER is safe and reduces MR and TR in most patients, conferring a potential benefit regarding symptoms and prognosis.

This single-center prospective observational study aimed to assess the correlation of net atrioventricular compliance (Cn) with pulmonary artery pressure in 26 adult patients with severe mitral stenosis (MS) undergoing surgical mitral valve replacement (MVR). Cn was estimated by doppler echocardiography, and pulmonary artery pressures measured by pulmonary artery catheter. Early outcomes including duration of intensive care unit (ICU) stay, mechanical ventilation duration, and vasoactive inotropic scores (VIS) were recorded. Cn showed moderate to strong negative correlation with systolic, diastolic, and mean pulmonary artery pressures at all time points. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis determined a cut-off of 2.31 to predict postoperative pulmonary artery systolic pressure. Cn with a cut-off value of 2.3 ml/mmHg serves as an indicator of persistent pulmonary hypertension following MVR surgery."

Despite its growing adoption, the procedure remains technically challenging due to complex mitral anatomy, difficulties in achieving coaxial alignment, and risks such as left ventricular outflow tract (LVOT) obstruction. The transfemoral-transseptal route, while less invasive, often provides suboptimal control and stability. Conversely, transapical access offers enhanced alignment but at the cost of increased surgical trauma. There is an unmet need for techniques that balance precision with minimal invasiveness.                                                           Objectives                     The aim of this work was to describe the technical rationale, procedural methodology, and early clinical outcomes of a novel hybrid cable-assisted TMVI approach using the Myval transcatheter heart valve (THV). This technique is designed to optimize device coaxiality and control while minimizing apical trauma.                                                           Methods                     We retrospectively reviewed three high-risk patients treated with a cable-assisted TMVI approach between October 2024 and May 2025. The technique involved the creation of a through-and-through rail between the right femoral vein and the left ventricular apex. The apical site was used exclusively for guidewire externalization, while the prosthesis was delivered entirely via the transfemoral route. Real-time transesophageal echocardiography and fluoroscopy guided the procedure. Patients were selected based on unfavorable anatomy for standard transseptal access and deemed high risk by a multidisciplinary heart team.                                                           Results                                            All procedures were technically successful without surgical conversion or cardiopulmonary bypass. Patients included one woman and two men (mean age 71.7 years; range 65–78), with indications of bioprosthetic degeneration (                       n                        = 2) and MAC (                       n                        = 1). All were New York Heart Association (NYHA) class III–IV preoperatively. Procedural outcomes showed acceptable post-deployment gradients (4.5–5.8 mmHg), no paravalvular leak, and no LVOT obstruction. One patient required repositioning of a misaligned valve using the stabilized rail, avoiding hemodynamic compromise. No embolization or peri-procedural stroke occurred. All patients were discharged in NYHA class I–II.                                                                                Conclusions                     This report presents the first dedicated case series of TMVI using a cable-assisted hybrid rail strategy with the Myval THV. The technique enabled precise and stable valve deployment in anatomically complex settings while minimizing myocardial trauma. Early outcomes suggest that it is a feasible, safe, and reproducible option for patients at high surgical risk or with contraindications to conventional TMVI routes. These preliminary findings support further investigation in broader clinical cohorts."
Crossref,mitral regurgitation,Relationship Between Mitral Annular Calcification and Inflammatory Indices in Patients with Cardiometabolic Risk Factors,Paula Cristina Morariu; Alexandru Florinel Oancea; Maria Mihaela Godun; Diana Elena Floria; Oana Sîrbu; Anca Ouatu; Daniela Maria Tanase; Ionela Daniela Morariu; Cristina Gena Dascălu; Mariana Floria,10.3390/biomedicines14020398,2026-02-09,Biomedicines,"Background: Mitral annular calcification (MAC) is associated with systemic atherosclerosis and cardiometabolic risk factors. Although hematologic inflammatory indices have been reported to be correlated with MAC, whether these associations persist after accounting for the cardiometabolic context in which MAC occurs remains unclear. Methods: In a prospective, cross-sectional study of consecutive adults, patients with mild MAC were compared to those without MAC. Individuals with major inflammatory conditions, advanced chronic kidney disease, cirrhosis, malignancy, autoimmune/acute inflammatory disorders, significant valvular disease, prosthetic valves/pacing devices, psychiatric disorders, or moderate-severe MAC were excluded. C-reactive protein (CRP) and hematological inflammatory indices, including neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR), Systemic Inflammatory Response Index (SIRI), and lymphocyte-to-leukocyte ratio (LLR), were analyzed in relation to MAC status. Results: Among 205 patients, 134 had mild MAC and 71 had no MAC. Patients with MAC were older and displayed higher cardiometabolic burden, including more frequent dysglycemia, higher blood pressure, and greater adiposity. In unadjusted comparisons, inflammatory markers differed according to MAC status: CRP (0.31 mg/dL vs. 0.18 mg/dL, p = 0.002), NLR (2.52 vs. 1.99, p = 0.032), SIRI (1.27 vs. 1.04, p = 0.039), and LLR (0.26 vs. 0.29, p = 0.032). In multivariable logistic regression models, none of the inflammatory markers remained independently associated with MAC. In contrast, age (ORs 1.056–1.063 per year increase, p ≤ 0.001), prediabetes (ORs 2.43–3.63, p ≤ 0.001), and type 2 diabetes (OR 5.91 and 6.19, p ≤ 0.001) demonstrated consistent independent associations with MAC across all models. Conclusions: In this cardiometabolic population with mild MAC, inflammatory indices showed unadjusted differences but no independent associations with MAC after comprehensive cardiometabolic adjustment. These findings are most compatible with inflammatory markers primarily reflecting the cardiometabolic milieu in which MAC occurs rather than representing MAC-specific processes. Age and glucose metabolism abnormalities emerged as the dominant independent factors associated with mild MAC, reinforcing the central role of metabolic dysfunction in MAC pathogenesis."

With a focus on the prevalent psychological complications following the onset of this condition, this study aimed to explore the correlation between antenatal depression and Corona disease anxiety, personality traits, and postpartum depression during the COVID-19 pandemic.                                                           Materials and Methods:                     This cross-sectional descriptive-analytical study investigated women receiving care at health centers affiliated with Kerman University of Medical Sciences during the last month of their pregnancy and the postpartum period in 2022. Following the acquisition of informed consent, participants were assessed using various measures, including demographic and obstetric information, the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale, the Corona Disease Anxiety Scale (CDAS), and the NEO Personality Inventory-Revised during their third trimester of pregnancy. The same group of participants completed the Edinburgh Depression Scale and the Corona Disease Anxiety Scale (CDAS) 4-6 weeks after childbirth.                                                           Results and Discussion:                     There was a significant correlation between family income, unwanted pregnancy as perceived by both the mother and father, and antenatal depression. Additionally, marital satisfaction played a significant role in postpartum depression. Furthermore, antenatal depression was significantly associated with neuroticism, agreeableness, and physical symptoms related to Corona disease anxiety. Personality traits, with the exception of extroversion and conscientiousness, and various domains of Corona disease anxiety, excluding psychological symptoms, were also significantly associated with postpartum depression.                                                           Conclusion:                     During pandemics or epidemics, such as the COVID-19 outbreak, experiencing mental distress during pregnancy can contribute to mental health issues during the postpartum period. This risk is particularly true in individuals with unique personality traits, emphasizing the need for increased focus on mental health within prenatal care during these crises."

Method:                     This cross-sectional study was conducted in Kerman, Iran. Data were collected from patients who visited Afzalipour Hospital in Kerman more than twice during the COVID-19 epidemic from the end of February 2020 to March 21, 2021. We conducted two key analyses: 1. Mixed effect logistic regression was used to check the relationship between the variables and COVID-19 severity. 2. Mixed effect linear regression was used to check the relationship between the variables and the length of stay in the hospital.                                                           Results:                     The findings indicated that the most important risk factors for the severity of COVID-19 were heart diseases (OR=1.67,95%CI:1.20-2.30), increasing age (OR=2.23 for age&gt;54, 95%CI:1.70- 2.90), male gender (OR=1.47,95%CI:1.10-1.96), respiratory diseases other than asthma, and frequency of admission (OR=1.60,95%CI:1.20-2.15). All patients who underwent readmission experienced a shorter duration of hospitalization during their subsequent admission (OR=0.94,95%CI:0.91,0.96) and had a higher mortality rate (30% within 14 days, 26.6% between 14-90 days). Patients readmitted at intervals of 14-90 days and greater than 90 days exhibited lower disease severity compared to those readmitted within the 0-14 day period.                                                           Conclusion:                     Examining readmissions, the severity of COVID-19, and the length of hospital stay in affected patients are important factors for planning and allocating resources for COVID-19 management and treatment. These factors can help policymakers develop effective clinical guidelines for hospitalization or outpatient treatment of COVID-19 patients and contribute to reducing the burden of disease in the community."

Kinovea, as an accessible motion-analysis software, provides both visual and quantitative feedback. However, its application in supporting technique development among beginner athletes remains insufficiently explored. Aim: This study aims to describe the use of Kinovea in biomechanics training and examine its contribution to the awareness of kinematic characteristics and movement techniques among beginner athletes. Methods: A descriptive qualitative design involved 72 beginner athletes aged 18–25 years selected through purposive sampling. Data were collected over 16 weeks through interviews, field observations, and motion video recordings analyzed using Kinovea. Kinematic data focused on joint angles, stride behavior, and movement phases during walking, running, and the flight phase. Qualitative data were analyzed using content analysis with NVivo 12, while kinematic results were interpreted descriptively to identify performance patterns and areas for technical refinement. Result: Kinematic analysis showed coordinated joint-angle patterns across all phases. Walking analysis identified arm swing angles of 50.9°–58.8° and leg separation angles of 64.3°–67.2°, indicating a stable gait rhythm. The running analysis revealed knee angles of 68.8°–69.8° and elbow angles of 87.6°–89.1°, indicating efficient propulsive mechanics. The flight phase demonstrated knee angles of 81.2°–87.8° and elbow angles of 80.4°–88.3°, suggesting effective momentum use and postural stability. These measurements supported stride-efficiency assessment and technique evaluation. Qualitative findings revealed that Kinovea enabled athletes to interpret movement phases and identify technical inefficiencies through slow-motion and frame-by-frame visualization. Conclusion: Kinovea supports basic motion analysis by providing clear kinematic information and helping beginner athletes observe and refine their movement techniques. The findings also offer practical value for coaches by enabling more precise identification of inefficient patterns and guiding targeted corrections during early-stage training."

Both early mitral valve repair surgery and active surveillance with facilitated surgery are possible strategies. The DutchAMR registry compares clinical outcomes between these two strategies. Methods Patients were included between 2013–2019. Primary endpoints were cerebrovascular accidents (CVA), reoperations, and mortality. Facilitated surgery was defined as mitral valve repair surgery performed after developing a surgical indication during active surveillance. Results Ninety-nine patients were enrolled; 71 in active surveillance and 28 in early surgery. Over a median follow-up time of 5.1 years, 51% of active surveillance patients underwent facilitated surgery due to ESC guideline triggers. Both the early and facilitated surgery groups had one perioperative CVA. During follow-up, in the active surveillance group, 5 (7%) patients died (3 without surgery and 2 after facilitated surgery), and 3 (4%) underwent reoperations. In the early surgery group, 4 (14%) patients reached a primary endpoint, including 2 (7%) CVAs (without residual symptoms) and 2 (7%) deaths. No reoperations occurred in the early surgery group. Baseline additional testing parameters based on CPET, Holter monitoring, and CMR showed no differences between the groups. Conclusions After 5.1 years, half of the active surveillance patients required facilitated surgery, with comparable postoperative outcomes to early surgery. Clinical endpoints were comparable between the early and facilitated surgery strategies. There were no differences in baseline additional testing parameters, suggesting no clear targets for upfront stratificatio. Thus, shared decision making weighing the different risks can be used to determine the strategy per patient."
OpenAlex,mitral regurgitation,Prognostic Value of the C-Reactive Protein–Albumin–Lymphocyte (CALLY) Index for 1-Year Mortality After Transcatheter Aortic Valve Implantation,Hakan Süygün; Zeynep Şeyma Turinay Ertop; Melike Polat; Murat Can Güney; Hüseyin Ayhan; Telat Keleş; Dilek Dolek,10.3390/jcdd13020083,2026-02-09,Journal of Cardiovascular Development and Disease,"Objectives: Systemic inflammation, malnutrition, and immune dysregulation have emerged as important determinants of long-term outcomes after transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI). The C-reactive protein–albumin–lymphocyte (CALLY) index is a novel immunonutritional biomarker that integrates these pathophysiological domains; however, its prognostic value in TAVI patients has not yet been investigated. This study aimed to evaluate the association between the CALLY index and 1-year mortality after TAVI. Methods: This retrospective observational study included 532 consecutive patients who underwent TAVI at a tertiary-care center between 2014 and 2023. Baseline laboratory parameters were obtained before the procedure, and the CALLY index was calculated as (albumin × lymphocyte count)/(C-reactive protein × 10). The primary endpoint was 1-year mortality. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis was performed to assess the discriminative ability of the CALLY index and conventional surgical risk scores. Multivariable regression analyses were used to identify independent predictors of mortality. Results: During the 1-year follow-up period, 85 patients (15.9%) died. Patients who died had significantly lower baseline CALLY index values compared to survivors (p &lt; 0.001). The CALLY index demonstrated good discriminative performance for 1-year mortality (AUC: 0.797), outperforming EuroSCORE II (AUC: 0.705) and the Society of Thoracic Surgeons (STS) score (AUC: 0.619). A CALLY cut-off value of 0.45, derived using Youden’s index, was associated with a more than threefold increased risk of mortality. In multivariable analysis, the CALLY index remained independently associated with 1-year mortality, along with EuroSCORE II and more than mild mitral regurgitation. Conclusions: The CALLY index is a strong and independent predictor of 1-year mortality after TAVI and provides incremental prognostic value beyond conventional surgical risk scores. Given its simplicity and reliance on routinely available laboratory parameters, the CALLY index may serve as a practical tool for long-term risk stratification in patients undergoing TAVI."
OpenAlex,mitral regurgitation,A real-world comparison of transcatheter edge-to-edge repair versus surgical mitral valve intervention in patients with mitral regurgitation: a TriNetX study,Kuan-Chieh Tu; Jheng-Yan Wu,10.3389/fmed.2026.1729871,2026-02-09,Frontiers in Medicine,"Objective We aimed to compare the clinical outcomes of transcatheter edge-to-edge repair (TEER) and surgical repair in patients with non-rheumatic mitral regurgitation (MR) using real-world data. Methods We conducted a retrospective cohort study using TriNetX to identify adults with mitral regurgitation who underwent surgical repair or TEER (2013–2025). Propensity score matching (PSM) balanced demographics, comorbidities, and medications. The primary outcome was all-cause mortality; the secondary outcomes included cardiovascular events. Results After exclusions, 35,753 patients with mitral regurgitation were identified, including 2,165 TEER and 33,588 surgical cases; 2,029 matched pairs were analyzed. At 1 year, surgery showed lower mortality (hazard ratio [HR]: 0.78; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.64–0.96), primarily between 2 months and 1 year. Surgery was associated with higher rates of early dyspnea, atrial fibrillation, and heart failure, though heart failure could be reversed later. No significant differences were found in major adverse cardiovascular events (MACEs), stroke, acute myocardial infarction (AMI), cardiac arrest, or emergency department (ED) visits. A subgroup analysis of patients with mitral valve prolapse showed consistent results, with atrial fibrillation and heart failure occurring more frequently after surgery. Conclusion In this large cohort, surgery and TEER produced different outcomes. Early mortality was similar, but surgery improved survival after 2 months. TEER had fewer early dyspnea, atrial fibrillation, and heart failure events. No differences were observed in MACE, stroke, AMI, or ED visits, supporting individualized MR treatment."

Sievert; Jacob Zeitani,10.36922/bh025510076,2026-02-05,Brain & Heart,"Cardioembolic stroke remains one of the most severe manifestations of cardiovascular disease, with atrial fibrillation (AF) responsible for a large proportion of ischemic cerebrovascular events. Stroke prevention strategies are currently dominated by oral anticoagulation guided by CHA2DS2-VASc scores, which emphasize age and comorbidities and therefore have limited applicability in younger patients with low conventional risk profiles. Although bleeding risk is routinely assessed using tools such as HAS-BLED, lifelong anticoagulation may still confer a substantial cumulative hemorrhagic burden over decades of treatment. The left atrial appendage (LAA) represents the primary anatomical source of thromboembolism in AF, yet current guidelines largely restrict surgical or percutaneous LAA exclusion to patients with AF who have contraindications to anticoagulation, reflecting a predominantly reactive approach. This Perspective advocates reconsideration of prophylactic surgical LAA exclusion at the time of open mitral valve repair in younger patients. Although early mitral repair limits atrial remodeling, it does not abolish lifetime AF risk, and post-operative or late-onset AF remains frequent. Moreover, residual or recurrent mitral regurgitation promotes progressive atrial dilation and fibrosis, increasing long-term thromboembolic risk even in patients initially in sinus rhythm. By integrating atrial remodeling, LAA morphology and function, residual mitral pathology, and the limitations of lifelong anticoagulation, a selective preventive framework emerges. An anatomical brain-heart prevention strategy may reduce lifetime cerebrovascular risk and improve long-term outcomes. While prospective data are needed, existing evidence supports individualized discussion of prophylactic LAA exclusion during mitral valve repair in selected young patients with structural atrial disease."

Frequently associated with long-standing atrial fibrillation and heart failure with preserved ejection fraction, A-SMR challenges the traditional ventricular-centered classification of functional mitral regurgitation and is increasingly recognized as a clinically relevant condition [2,3]. Materials and Methods This narrative review provides an updated and critical overview of cur-rent evidence on atrial secondary mitral regurgitation. We summarize available data on pathophysiology, diagnostic imaging, natural history, and therapeutic strategies, with particular emphasis on implications for cardiac surgery and clinical decision-making. Evidence was derived from observational studies, registry analyses, interventional reports, and contemporary guideline documents [4,5]. Results A-SMR is primarily driven by atrial remodeling and annular dilatation, with minimal contribution from ventricular distortion or leaflet tethering [1,3]. Echocardiography and Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) play a central role in diagnosis and phenotypic characterization, allowing differentiation from ventricular functional mitral regurgitation and identification of distinct A-SMR subtypes with potential therapeutic implications [4]. A-SMR is a progressive condition associated with worsening symptoms and adverse clinical outcomes [2,3]. Rhythm control strategies may reduce mitral regurgitation severity in selected patients by promo-ting atrial reverse remodeling [6]. Transcatheter edge-to-edge repair (TEER) represents a treatment option for selected high-risk patients, al-though concerns regarding long-term durability remain in this predominantly annular disease [7]. From a pathophysiological standpoint, surgical mitral valve repair based on annuloplasty directly targets the dominant mechanism of A-SMR and has been associated with favorable outcomes in appropriately selected patients [8]. Conclusions Atrial secondary mitral regurgitation is a distinct and increasingly re-cognized form of functional mitral regurgitation requiring a mechanism-oriented diagnostic and therapeutic approach. 2025 ESC/EACTS Guidelines for the management of valvular heart disease have acknowledged A-SMR as a specific clinical phenotype, although dedicated phenotype-specific management recommendations remain limited [5]. Surgical mitral valve repair, particularly when combined with atrial fibrillation ablation, represents a rational treatment strategy in selected patients and may improve long-term outcomes [6,8]."

However, data on the long-term prognostic impact of MR and its progression or regression over time remain limited, particularly across individual HCM subtypes. METHODS: Patients with HCM were retrospectively included from a Japanese multicenter registry and compared by MR severity (moderate or greater versus mild or less) within each subtype: hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy (HOCM), end-stage HCM (ES-HCM), and other HCM (including nonobstructive, midventricular obstruction, and apical HCM). RESULTS: Among 3602 patients (HOCM: n=837; ES-HCM: n=275; other HCM: n=2490), the prevalence of moderate or greater MR was highest in HOCM (36.3%), followed by ES-HCM (21.5%) and other HCM (8.5%). During a median follow-up of 5.3 (interquartile range, 2.1–9.3) years, the cumulative 5-year incidence of all-cause death or heart failure hospitalization was not significantly different between the moderate or greater MR and mild or less MR groups in HOCM (14.6% versus 12.4%; P =0.35) or ES-HCM (60.7% versus 54.7%; P =0.84). After adjustment for clinical covariates, no significant association was observed in either subtype (HOCM: hazard ratio, 1.13 [95% CI, 0.79–1.60], P =0.51; ES-HCM: hazard ratio, 0.84 [95% CI, 0.55–1.28], P =0.42). In contrast, in other HCM, moderate or greater MR was significantly associated with the higher 5-year cumulative incidence of all-cause death or heart failure hospitalization (34.2% versus 13.9%, P &lt;0.001), which remained significant after adjustment, with a significant interaction (hazard ratio, 1.45 [95% CI, 1.09–1.91], P =0.01; P interaction =0.02). MR severity improved over time in HOCM, showed no clear change in ES-HCM, and worsened in other HCM ( P &lt;0.001, 0.46, and &lt;0.001, respectively; P interaction &lt;0.001). CONCLUSIONS: In patients with HCM, moderate or greater MR was not associated with worse outcomes in HOCM or ES-HCM, but had significant prognostic implications in other HCM subtypes, suggesting the need for HCM subtype-specific MR management."

However, primary (degenerative) and secondary (functional) MR represent distinct disease entities, characterized by different pathophysiological mechanisms, clinical trajectories, and determinants of benefit. This review aims to provide an interventional cardiology-oriented synthesis of TEER, emphasizing the fundamental differences between primary and secondary MR and their i for patient selection, procedural strategy, and outcome interpretation. Methods: A targeted literature search was performed in PubMed and Embase to identify pivotal randomized trials, registries, guideline documents, and high-quality reviews addressing TEER in MR. The available evidence was synthesized narratively, with a focus on mechanistic insights, TEER-specific imaging and procedural endpoints, and clinically relevant outcomes.Results: In primary MR, TEER functions as a valve-centered therapy, with procedural success primarily determined by anatomical suitability and the balance between durable MR reduction and avoidance of elevated transmitral gradients. In secondary MR, TEER should be considered an adjunctive intervention within a comprehensive heart failure strategy, with benefit dependent on patient phenotype, myocardial substrate, optimization of background therapy, and appropriate timing. Emerging phenotypes, such as atrial functional MR, further challenge traditional classification and highlight the need for mechanism-based selection. Across MR subtypes, residual MR and transmitral gradients emerge as key post-procedural endpoints with differential prognostic implications. Conclusions: TEER represents a phenotype-specific intervention rather than a uniform solution for MR. Recognizing the distinct interventional paradigms of primary and secondary MR is essential to optimize patient selection, procedural decision-making, and clinical outcomes."
OpenAlex,mitral regurgitation,Mechanisms of mitral valve development and disease,E. Wang; Bin Zhou,10.3389/fcvm.2026.1773671,2026-02-04,Frontiers in Cardiovascular Medicine,"The mitral valve apparatus comprises the annulus, valve leaflets, chordae tendineae, and papillary muscles, forming an integrated biomechanical unit essential for unidirectional blood flow. The leaflets and chordae are primarily derived from endocardial cells, and damage to these structures results in either mitral stenosis or mitral regurgitation, depending on the underlying pathology. This review compares three major mitral valve diseases, rheumatic mitral stenosis, congenital mitral stenosis, and myxomatous mitral valve prolapse, to highlight their distinct etiologies, molecular mechanisms, and structural endpoints. Rheumatic mitral stenosis is an acquired immune-mediated disease triggered by Group A streptococcal infection, in which molecular mimicry leads to autoantibody formation and chronic inflammation. Immune-cell infiltration and cytokine release drive the progression of leaflet fibrosis, commissural fusion, calcification, and pronounced chordal shortening, ultimately culminating in fixed obstruction. Large-scale genetic studies have not identified strong causal genes, instead revealing associations with immune-related risk loci, while valve-specific epigenetic mechanisms are poorly explored. Congenital mitral stenosis arises from developmental abnormalities of the mitral valve complex during embryogenesis and is classified into four anatomical subtypes. Due to its low incidence, the condition remains the least studied at the molecular and genetic levels. In contrast, myxomatous mitral valve prolapse is a degenerative, polygenic disorder driven by aberrant TGF β -dependent endothelial-to-mesenchymal transformation, valve interstitial cell activation, and extracellular matrix remodeling. Genetic studies have identified multiple causal genes, including FLNA , DCHS1 , DZIP1 , and TNS1 , underscoring its mechano-genetic origin. Despite their distinct causes, immune-mediated, developmental, and degenerative/genetic, all three diseases converge on progressive structural failure of the MV apparatus. Notably, pathological remodeling of the chordae plays a decisive role in disease progression and the need for surgical intervention. A deeper understanding of both shared and disease-specific mechanisms, particularly valve- and chordae-specific molecular regulation, is essential to advance translational research in mitral valve disease."
OpenAlex,mitral regurgitation,Effect of a decellularised tendon-based mitral annuloplasty ring on regurgitation suppression in degenerative mitral regurgitation model: An in vitro pulsatile circulation study,Ikuo Katayama; Shinya Imai; Yusei Okamoto; Kiyotaka Iwasaki,10.1093/icvts/ivag040,2026-02-03,Interdisciplinary CardioVascular and Thoracic Surgery,"Abstract OBJECTIVES Conventional annuloplasty rings used in mitral valve repair (MVr) are made of metal or synthetic polymers, which may increase infection risk. This study aimed to develop a mitral annuloplasty ring using decellularised tissue and evaluate its ability to suppress regurgitation in a degenerative mitral regurgitation (DMR) model. METHODS A 4 mm diameter annuloplasty ring was created using decellularized bovine tendon. Porcine mitral valve complexes (including the annulus, leaflets, chordae tendineae, and papillary muscles) were obtained from a slaughterhouse. The annulus was enlarged by 4 mm, and the two chordae tendineae of the posterior leaflet (P2) were severed. The DMR model, integrated into a pulsatile flow simulator, was repaired using a commercial—Physio II, Colvin-Galloway (CG) Future, Tailor band, and a decellularised tendon-based ring. Regurgitation control and effective mitral valve area (MVA) were compared (n = 6 for each group). RESULTS The regurgitation rate of the DMR model was 52.3 ± 3.4%, consistent with severe MR. Post-MVr with each ring, the regurgitation rates were 14.9 ± 3.1% (Physio II), 14.5 ± 1.1% (CG Future), 16.4 ± 1.7% (Tailor band), and 15.5 ± 3.0% (decellularised tendon-based biological ring). All of these rates were significantly reduced, with no significant differences among them. Effective MVA was comparable across groups: 2.46 ± 0.28 cm2 (Physio II), 2.33 ± 0.54 cm2 (CG Future), 2.28 ± 0.12 cm2 (Tailor band), and 2.27 ± 0.53 cm2 (decellularised tendon-based biological ring). CONCLUSIONS The decellularised tendon-based annuloplasty ring demonstrated functional performance comparable to that of current mitral annuloplasty devices."

Lam,10.1093/ehjcr/ytag097,2026-02-03,European Heart Journal - Case Reports,"Abstract Background Culture-negative infective endocarditis (IE) presents significant diagnostic and therapeutic challenges, especially in patients with systemic embolic complications. Case Summary A middle-aged man with a history of intravenous drug use (IVDU) presented with fever, new apical systolic murmur, and widespread embolic phenomena affecting brain, spleen, kidneys, and lower limb. Transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) revealed a large posterior mitral leaflet vegetation with moderate-severe mitral regurgitation (MR). Blood and tissue cultures were negative. Next-generation sequencing (NGS) of an aspirated calf muscle abscess identified Rothia dentocariosa. Despite prolonged antimicrobial therapy and multidisciplinary care, persistent vegetations and high embolic risk prompted mitral valve replacement after interval stabilization of intracranial hemorrhages. He recovered without recurrent emboli and with stable prosthetic valve function. Conclusion Advanced molecular diagnostics like NGS can be crucial for identifying pathogens in culture-negative endocarditis. Multidisciplinary collaboration and individualized surgical timing are important for achieving optimal outcomes in complex cases with neurological complications."

This study compared clinical outcomes in patients undergoing non-surgical treatment (NT) of aortic valve (AV), aortic valvuloplasty (AVP), and aortic valve replacement (AVR). This multicenter, retrospective observational cohort study included 338 moderate AR patients undergoing rheumatic MV surgery from January 2015 to January 2024. We followed up with patients for a median of 43.4 months. Furthermore, more-than-mild aortic valve dysfunction (AVD) in the follow-up period was our primary outcome. Our secondary outcomes were all-cause mortality and cardiac valve reoperation before discharge and during follow-up. We classified patients into three groups, namely, NT (n = 128), AVP (n = 91), and AVR (n = 119) groups, respectively. Moreover, 33.0%, 30.1%, and 3.9% of patients achieved our primary outcome, while 4.2%, 5.6%, and 9.6% of them attained our secondary outcomes in the three groups, respectively. We observed that fewer patients from the AVR group had achieved the primary outcome than those in the NT [adjusted relative risk (RR), 0.41; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.21-0.68; p = 0.002] and AVP groups (adjusted RR, 0.14; 95% CI, 0.04-0.43; p = 0.002), respectively. The secondary outcomes did not significantly differ among the three groups. Without increasing surgical risks, the concurrent AVR significantly improves AV status in moderate AR patients undergoing rheumatic MV surgery throughout follow-up. None or mild AVD was observed in many patients from the NT group during the follow-up, thereby warranting the delay of surgery for AV."

Although both del Nido and St. Thomas cardioplegia solutions are widely used, comparative evidence in adult rheumatic mitral valve replacement remains limited. This study aimed to compare their myocardial protective efficacy and clinical outcomes. Methods A prospective comparative study was conducted between May 2022 and October 2024. Total 50 adult patients undergoing mitral valve replacement—20 with severe mitral regurgitation (MR) and 30 with severe mitral stenosis (MS) were included. Patients were divided into two groups based on cardioplegia type (del Nido or St. Thomas). Intraoperative parameters, postoperative left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF), troponin I levels, inotropic and ventilatory support, and ICU/hospital stay were analysed. Results Baseline characteristics were comparable across groups. The mean number of cardioplegia doses was significantly lower in the del Nido group (1.6 ± 0.5 vs 3.2 ± 0.8; p &lt; 0.001). Postoperative LVEF was better preserved with del Nido cardioplegia (MS: 53.3 ± 7.2% vs 45.3 ± 10.6%; p = 0.023). Troponin I levels at 6, 24, and 48 h were lower in the del Nido group, though not statistically significant. Patients receiving del Nido required less inotropic and ventilatory support, with shorter ICU and hospital stays. One in-hospital death occurred in the del Nido group due to sepsis. Conclusion Del Nido cardioplegia offers comparable or superior myocardial protection to St. Thomas solution in adult mitral valve replacement, with fewer interruptions, reduced dosing, and faster postoperative recovery."

Catheter looping and knot formation are rare but potentially hazardous complications. Case summary An 82-year-old woman with permanent atrial fibrillation and severe mitral and tricuspid valve regurgitation presented with complete atrioventricular block and a ventricular escape rhythm at 28 bpm. A temporary transvenous pacing catheter inserted via the right internal jugular vein failed to achieve consistent ventricular capture and became entrapped at 45 cm, forming a knot near the venous introducer. Given the patient's frailty and high surgical risk, a multidisciplinary team opted for a fully percutaneous strategy for removal. After definitive pacemaker implantation, the knotted catheter was successfully retrieved using a stepwise approach: engagement of the loop with a deflectable ablation catheter, externalization through a femoral sheath, and extraction using a 13-F dilator sheath to minimize venous trauma. Discussion This case highlights procedural pitfalls during emergency temporary pacing without fluoroscopy and illustrates a safe, creative percutaneous solution for knot retrieval using tools familiar to electrophysiology and lead extraction operators."

Unlike conventional indices such as left ventricular ejection fraction and global longitudinal strain, MW integrates myocardial deformation with left ventricular pressure, providing a load-adjusted and physiologically meaningful assessment of myocardial performance. Growing evidence demonstrates that impaired MW is consistently associated with adverse outcomes, including heart failure hospitalization, mortality, and functional deterioration, across a wide spectrum of cardiovascular conditions such as ischemic heart disease, valvular heart disease, and cardiomyopathies. The noninvasive estimation of MW using commercially available echocardiographic software has enhanced its feasibility in routine clinical practice, enabling improved risk stratification and early identification of high-risk patients. This review summarizes current evidence supporting the prognostic value of MW, highlights its incremental role beyond conventional echocardiographic parameters, and discusses future perspectives for its integration into everyday clinical decision-making."

It is the leading cause of hospitalization and accounts for significant health care utilization. Heart failure is a clinical syndrome resulting from structural or functional impairment of ventricular filling or contractility. The diagnosis is supported by echocardiographic and biomarker evidence. The leading etiologies for heart failure include hypertension, ischemic heart disease, diabetes, and valvular disease. The incidence of heart failure rises sharply with age. Women often have a higher incidence of heart failure with preserved ejection fraction when compared with men. The overall incidence of higher in males, especially at younger ages. Common causes for decompensation include nonadherence to guideline-directed medical therapy, infections, dietary noncompliance, and arrythmias. Significant disparities persist across age, sex, race, and socioeconomic status. Higher incidences and worse outcomes are observed among those populations with lower socioeconomic status and limited access to health care.

This study sought to investigate the role of SPP1+ macrophages in the development and progression of AF and further elucidate the underlying mechanisms. Single-nucleus RNA sequencing was performed on right atrial tissues from 3 patients with persistent AF and 3 with sinus rhythm (all with rheumatic valvular heart disease). The results revealed significant immune cell infiltration in AF atrial tissues, with a marked increase in the proportion of SPP1+ macrophages, which exhibited the strongest intercellular communication with cardiomyocytes. Phenotypic scoring indicated that apoptosis was the dominant mode of cardiomyocyte death in AF. Immunohistochemical and Western blot analyses confirmed elevated levels of pro-apoptotic proteins (Bax, Cleaved-Caspase3) and reduced levels of the anti-apoptotic protein Bcl2 in AF tissues. In a mouse model with macrophage-specific SPP1 overexpression, increased AF inducibility and duration were observed, accompanied by enhanced cardiomyocyte apoptosis. In vitro co-culture experiments using SPP1-overexpressing RAW264.7 macrophages and HL-1 cardiomyocytes confirmed that SPP1+ macrophages could induce cardiomyocyte apoptosis. Mechanistically, KEGG and GSEA analyses identified downregulation of the PI3K/AKT pathway in AF. Treatment with the PI3K/AKT activator Recilisib reversed apoptosis and restored p-PI3K/p-AKT levels in HL-1 cells co-cultured with SPP1-overexpressing RAW264.7 macrophages. These findings demonstrate that SPP1+ macrophages accumulate in atrial tissues of AF patients and induce cardiomyocyte apoptosis by downregulating the PI3K/AKT pathway, thereby increasing AF susceptibility."

Cardiovascular computed tomography (CT) has become essential for diagnosing BAV, planning procedures, and evaluating patients after treatment. This is largely due to CT’s high spatial resolution and its ability to perform volume imaging effectively. This review provides an up-to-date overview of the increasing role of cardiovascular CT in the management of bicuspid aortic valve (BAV). It covers various aspects, including BAV morphology, optimal sizing for transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR), and post-procedural monitoring. We highlight significant innovations, such as supra-annular sizing techniques and artificial intelligence (AI)-guided analysis, that position CT at the nexus of anatomy, function, and targeted treatment. Additionally, we address controversies concerning inconsistencies in sizing algorithms, recent classification challenges, and radiation exposure. Future development areas include AI predictive tools, radiomic phenotyping, and CT-guided precision medicine. This synthesis aims to provide clinicians and researchers with a high-level guide to the clinical integration of cardiovascular CT and its future in the BAV population.

This systematic review evaluates whether chronic or repeated use of psychedelics and 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine may contribute to valvular heart disease through sustained 5-hydroxytryptamine 2B receptor activation. A systematic search of Google Scholar, OVID and PubMed was conducted from inception to June 1, 2025. We sought to include studies that reported an association between psychedelics or 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine at 5-hydroxytryptamine 2B binding and molecular, cellular, structural, and/or functional evidence of cardiac valvulopathy. Seventeen studies were included in this review. No studies were found on psilocybin, dimethyltryptamine or mescaline. Both lysergic acid diethylamide and 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine have high affinity for 5-hydroxytryptamine 2B receptors and promote downstream signaling linked to mitogenic and fibrotic changes in valvular tissue. In vitro and structural studies show that lysergic acid diethylamide exhibits high affinity and induces β-arrestin-biased signaling in valvular interstitial cells, while 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine displays moderate affinity and similar functional responses. In vivo studies confirm serotonin-induced valvulopathy, and chronic 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine use has been associated with valvular abnormalities in humans. No clinical cases of lysergic acid diethylamide-induced valvulopathy have been reported, but preclinical data support its potential to engage fibrotic signaling pathways under sustained exposure. Preliminary converging mechanistic and preclinical evidence suggests that lysergic acid diethylamide and 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine may promote cardiac valvulopathy via 5-hydroxytryptamine 2B receptor signalling. This is consistent with existing Food and Drug Administration concerns and supports the need for ongoing cardiac and valvular safety monitoring in psychedelic research."

However, growing evidence supports a paradigm shift toward recognizing AS as an active metabolic and inflammatory disorder. This narrative review synthesizes experimental, translational, and clinical evidence published between 2015 and 2025 examining metabolic mechanisms linking valvular calcification and atrial remodeling in AS and discusses their clinical relevance in the context of transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR). We discussed classical pathways involving mineral metabolism and vitamin signaling, alongside emerging roles of lipid oxidation, mitochondrial dysfunction, epigenetic regulation, and gut microbiome-derived metabolites. Further, metabolomic signatures associated with disease severity and post-TAVR outcomes were reviewed, highlighting the predominantly associative nature and current limitations of these data. Although valve replacement remains the only effective therapy for advanced AS, metabolic and multi-omics insights may improve future risk stratification and mechanistic understanding. Metabolomic profiling could be integrated at multiple points in the clinical pathway for aortic stenosis and TAVR—most promisingly for pre-procedural risk stratification. The present paper focuses on an integrative framework in which valvular calcification and atrial remodeling are viewed within a broader context of metabolic dysregulation. Future research should aim to translate molecular biomarkers into real-world diagnostics and targeted interventions."

OpenAlex,valvular heart disease,Association between ALDH2 rs671 polymorphism and susceptibility to non-valvular atrial fibrillation in a Chinese population: a large-scale case–control study,Fangming Zhong; Qifeng Zhang; Zhuolian Ye; Xuebo He; Junping Huang; Leiming Miao,10.3389/fphys.2025.1669815,2026-02-03,Frontiers in Physiology,"Non-valvular atrial fibrillation (NVAF) is the most common arrhythmia worldwide, with a steadily rising incidence and prevalence, posing a significant public health burden. Oxidative stress is recognized as a key driver of atrial remodeling and arrhythmogenesis. Mitochondrial aldehyde dehydrogenase 2 (ALDH2) plays a critical role in detoxifying reactive aldehydes, and the rs671 single-nucleotide polymorphism (G→A, Glu504Lys) markedly reduces enzymatic activity, with a high prevalence in East Asian populations. In this retrospective study, we analyzed 403 NVAF patients and 14,326 hospitalized controls from Meizhou People’s Hospital (2016–2020), aged ≥30 years (1:35.5 ratio), and constructed multiple propensity score-matched cohorts (1:15 to 1:2) to examine the association between ALDH2 rs671 and NVAF. The A allele frequency was significantly higher in NVAF patients than in the controls (32.0% vs. 24.2%, P &amp;lt; 0.001), causing an increased NVAF risk (OR = 1.472, 95% CI: 1.266–1.711). Multivariate logistic regression identified the GA genotype (OR = 1.681, 95% CI: 1.360–2.078, P &amp;lt; 0.001) and the AA genotype (OR = 1.558, 95% CI: 1.058–2.296, P = 0.025) as independent risk factors. Sensitivity analyses across various matching ratios confirmed the robustness of the association. Other independent risk factors included male sex, advanced age, hypertension, diabetes, coronary heart disease, and COPD."

Although global registries offer extensive data on survival outcomes, there is a relative paucity of information regarding HT outcomes in Latin America (LATAM), particularly in Colombia. Methods: This study analyzed adult patients who underwent HT between 1995 and 2024, using data obtained from an institutional HT registry (RETRAC) in Cali, Colombia. Survival outcomes were evaluated using Kaplan–Meier curves and Cox proportional hazards models. Results: We included 260 patients who underwent HT in this 29-year cohort from a LATAM country. The median age at transplantation was 51 years, and 77.7% were male. The primary etiologies were idiopathic/dilated cardiomyopathy (IDC) (41.3%), ischemic cardiomyopathy (IC) (27.0%), and valvular heart disease (VHC) (9.7%). The most prevalent comorbidities were hypertension (HTN) (48.3%), diabetes mellitus (DM) (18.9%), and chronic kidney disease (CKD) (13.1%). The overall median survival following HT was 7.4 years. One-year survival was 74.6% (n = 194), five-year survival was 56.9% (n = 147), and ten-year survival was 46.9% (n = 122). Survival differed significantly by age and sex, with patients aged &lt;40 years demonstrating the highest median survival (8.4 years) and those aged ≥60 years the lowest (2.2 years) (p = 0.038). The 40- to 49-year age group exhibited the most pronounced reduction in survival; however, this effect was attenuated after adjustment. Among patients under 40 years, females had significantly higher mortality compared to males (p = 0.0078), with younger males exhibiting better survival. Additionally, patients transplanted between 2016 and 2020 had higher survival rates. CKD was identified as a significant independent risk factor for increased mortality (hazard ratio (HR) = 1.79; 95% CI: 1.15–2.79; p = 0.01). Conclusions: HT patients in Colombia exhibit demographic and clinical profiles comparable to global cohorts; however, they demonstrate lower survival rates and poorer clinical outcomes compared to international registries, such as the International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation registry. Nonetheless, clinical outcomes are more favorable than those reported in other studies from the LATAM region. CKD emerged as a significant independent predictor of mortality. These findings highlight the need for region-specific strategies aimed at improving HT outcomes in LATAM."

Despite optimized medical therapy (OMT), a significant portion of patients will progress to advanced stages of HF to which OMT is no longer sufficient. Myocardial revascularization remains a cornerstone for patients with ischemic cardiomyopathy, with evidence showing significant survival benefits over OMT alone. Valvular interventions address secondary mitral and aortic disease that contribute to declining cardiac function. For patients with end-stage failure or cardiogenic shock, mechanical circulatory support devices and ventricular-assist devices serve as bridge or destination therapy."

OpenAlex,valvular heart disease,"A retrospective cohort and machine learning study on the efficacy, safety, and recurrence prediction of combined EI-VOM and linear ablation in persistent Non-valvular atrial fibrillation",Ting Zhang; Yuling Dai; Wenzhai Cao,10.3389/fcvm.2026.1689942,2026-02-02,Frontiers in Cardiovascular Medicine,"Purpose Although circumferential pulmonary vein isolation (CPVI) is the standard treatment for persistent nonvalvular atrial fibrillation (PeNVAF), its efficacy remains limited. Combining CPVI with linear ablation and ethanol infusion into the vein of Marshall (EI-VOM) (CPVI + PLUS) may improve patient outcomes. Method This single-center retrospective study included hospitalized patients with PeNVAF who underwent their first radiofrequency ablation at Zigong First People's Hospital from August 2022 to August 2024. After propensity score matching (PSM), 132 patients were assigned to each group: the CPVI + PLUS group (combined EI-VOM and linear ablation) and the CPVI-only group. Outcomes were assessed at 3 and 6 months, including AF recurrence, complications, and cardiac function. Quality of life was evaluated at 6 months using the Atrial Fibrillation Effect on Quality-of-Life Questionnaire (AFEQT). The primary endpoints were AF recurrence rate and arrhythmia-free survival at 6 months after ablation; secondary endpoints included changes in cardiac function parameters, quality-of-life scores, and complication rates. Kaplan–Meier analysis was used to compare arrhythmia-free survival between the two groups, and univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were performed to identify risk factors for AF recurrence. In addition, a stacking ensemble model was developed to enhance prediction of AF recurrence after ablation. Results There were no significant differences in baseline demographics, comorbidities, laboratory, or echocardiographic parameters between the two groups. The CPVI + PLUS group had a longer procedure time than the CPVI group, but intraoperative complication rates were similar. At 6-month follow-up, the CPVI + PLUS group showed significantly better AFEQT, left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF), left atrial diameter(LAD), and left ventricular end-diastolic diameter (LVEDD) compared to the CPVI group. Recurrence rates of AF were lower in the CPVI + PLUS group, and arrhythmia-free survival time was longer. Multivariate analysis identified coronary artery disease, heart failure, severe preoperative valvular regurgitation, intraoperative myocardial injury, longer AF course, and larger LAD as independent risk factors for recurrence. Additional ablation strategies and left atrial appendage occlusion were protective factors. The stacking ensemble model achieved high accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and ROC-AUC in both training and validation cohorts. Feature importance analysis consistently identified AF course, age, body mass index, B-type natriuretic peptide, LVEF, platelet count, and uric acid as core predictors of recurrence risk. Conclusion CPVI + PLUS significantly improved arrhythmia-free survival, cardiac function, and quality of life in patients with PeNVAF without increasing procedural risk. Multivariate and machine learning analyses confirmed that additional ablation and left atrial appendage occlusion were protective against recurrence, while heart failure, valvular regurgitation, and longer AF course increased risk. The stacking model showed excellent predictive performance, and key features identified may support precise risk stratification and individualized therapy."

The impact of SARS-CoV-2 on the heart during the Omicron pandemic is not yet fully elucidated. Methodology: We conducted a retrospective cohort study of 1,026 hospitalized patients with the Omicron variant at Southwest Hospital (December 2022 to March 2023). Adverse events were defined as a composite of all-cause mortality, intensive care unit admission, mechanical ventilation use, and discharge against medical advice. The risk factors were analyzed by Logistic regression and the Cox regression model. Results: Median age was 69 years (IQR 56–79), myocardial injury occurred in 54.7% (n = 561); adverse events occurred in 25.5% (n = 262). The risk factors of myocardial injury included older age (OR 1.04 [1.03, 1.05], p &lt; 0.001), body temperature at admission (OR 1.64 [1.19, 2.29], p = 0.003), critical COVID-19 (OR 4.96 [2.34, 11.54], p &lt; 0.001), severe valvular heart disease (OR 2.46 [1.06, 6.12], p = 0.042), renal insufficiency (OR 4.04 [2.75, 6.01], p &lt; 0.001), anemia (OR 3.10 [2.12, 4.58], p &lt; 0.001), type II respiratory failure (OR 5.54 [1.79, 24.39], p = 0.008) and higher white blood cell (OR 1.09 [1.05, 1.14], p &lt; 0.001). After adjustment, myocardial injury (HR 1.79 [1.28, 2.48], p = 0.001) was significantly associated with adverse events in patients with Omicron variant infection. Conclusions: Myocardial injury, the most common extrapulmonary complication of COVID-19 caused by the SARS-CoV-2 Omicron variant, requires timely attention to prevent adverse events in hospitalized patients."
