PubMed,aortic stenosis,Time-robust myocardial [68Ga]Ga-FAPI PET biomarker reflects aortic stenosis severity and predicts post-TAVI outcomes.,Song Xue; Qianling Ye; Aleksa Lazarević; Kevin Hamzaraj; Patrick Binder; Christian Nitsche; Attila Kiss; Bruno K Podesser; Marcus Hacker; Xiang Li; Raffaella Calabretta,10.1007/s00259-026-07815-4,2026-02-16,European journal of nuclear medicine and molecular imaging,"Aortic stenosis (AS) induces myocardial remodeling and fibroblast activation, yet modifiable biomarkers capable of capturing active fibrogenesis and predicting post-transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) recovery are currently scarce. Fibroblast activation protein (FAP)-targeted PET serves as a noninvasive tool to visualize activated fibroblasts in vivo. We evaluated a time-robust, blood-pool-normalized myocardial [68Ga]Ga-FAPI PET imaging biomarker that reflects AS burden and predicts outcomes after TAVI.
Nineteen patients with severe symptomatic AS underwent [68Ga]Ga-FAPI-04 PET/CT at 60, 70, and 120 min. Using an in-house semi-automatic pipeline, the left ventricular (LV) myocardium was segmented, and regions of elevated fibroblast activity (EFM) were delineated using a blood-pool-anchored, time-point-specific threshold. We quantified myocardial SUVmean, blood-pool SUVmean, and a normalized myocardium-to-blood index, TBR(EFM), and assessed associations with N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) and left-ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF). One-year outcomes (n = 11) were assessed using a predefined composite clinical response.
Blood-pool SUVmean declined from 60 to 120 min, whereas myocardial SUVmean decreased less, yielding stable TBR(EFM) across time points (60/70/120 min: 2.2 ± 0.8, 2.1 ± 0.9, 2.3 ± 0.9; ANOVA p = 0.596). By contrast, myocardial SUVmean fell from 3.8 ± 0.7 (60 min) to 2.1 ± 0.9 (120 min; p < 0.001). TBR(EFM) correlated with NT-proBNP at all time-points (60 min r = 0.65, p = 0.007; 120 min r = 0.72, p = 0.003), whereas SUVmean did not (60 min p = 0.576; 120 min p = 0.109). Baseline TBR(EFM) was significantly lower in one-year responders than non-responders (1.7 ± 0.2 vs. 2.9 ± 0.9; p = 0.013), with separation present at each time point (p < 0.05). Higher baseline TBR(EFM) associated with lower reductions in NT-proBNP at one year (p < 0.05).
Myocardial [68Ga]Ga-FAPI TBR may provide a time-robust index of active fibroblast signaling that relates to myocardial hemodynamic stress and stratifies one-year clinical response after TAVI. A single 60-minute acquisition with TBR quantification may be sufficient for myocardial [68Ga]Ga-FAPI assessment. These hypothesis-generating findings require validation in larger, multicenter cohorts."

However, guidelines for imaging surveillance frequency are not well established among young children, particularly those diagnosed during infancy without hemodynamically significant associated congenital lesions.
The Mayo Clinic echocardiography database was retrospectively searched for infants (age <1 year) diagnosed with BAV from 2001-2019. We initially identified 307 patients and of these, 204 (66%) patients with BAV and concomitant significant CHD were excluded. Therefore, 103 (34%) patients with isolated BAV without critical valvulopathy and/or BAV with simple CHD (atrial septal defects, muscular ventricular septal defects, and/or patent ductus arteriosus) were included for further analysis.
Overall, 103 infants (68% male) with isolated BAV or BAV with simple CHD underwent their first echocardiogram at a median age of 8 days (IQR 2 - 84 days, range 0 - 349 days). A total of 92 (89%) subjects had at least one follow-up visit and most recent echocardiogram at a median age of 8.6 years (IQR 3.7 - 13.6 years) with a total clinical follow-up of 791 patient-years. BAV was present as an isolated lesion in 43% (44/103), while concomitant simple CHD was present in 57% (59/103) of infants. The most common indication for an echocardiogram was presence of a murmur (68%, 70/103). The first echocardiogram demonstrated aortic regurgitation (AR) in 4% (4/92) and aortic stenosis (AS) in 30% (28/92). A total of 10 aortic valve procedures were performed in 8 patients (9%); with AS (p<0.001) and ascending aortic Z-score ≥2 (p=0.006) on the index echocardiogram significantly associated with risk of aortic valve intervention. Among 61 infants without AS or AR on their first echocardiogram (61/92) none required any valvular intervention at a median follow-up age of 6.0 years (IQR 2.1 - 10.8 years). Among 28 infants who had AS (any degree) on their first echocardiogram, 8 (29%) required valvular intervention by a median age of 12.4 years (IQR 7.2 - 17.7 years) and all had at least moderate AS at the baseline echocardiogram. AS on the baseline echocardiogram was not only predictive of aortic valve intervention (p<0.001) but also progression of AR (p = 0.007), and ascending aorta dilation (p=0.0002) at last follow-up. Among 35 infants with aortopathy at their first echocardiogram, none required intervention on the aorta at a median age of 8.8 years (IQR 4.0-14.2 years). Overall, 4 patients died with no deaths related to cardiac disease.
Infants with normally functioning BAV without severe CHD did not develop significant valvulopathy or aortopathy over the first few years of life and required no interventions on the aortic valve or aorta. Conversely, those with more than mild AS or ascending aortic dilation at first echocardiogram incurred higher risk of valvular intervention, valvulopathy and aortopathy progression. Therefore, initial valve and aortic pathology should guide frequency of follow-up surveillance imaging."
PubMed,aortic stenosis,Impact of Iron Deficiency Anemia on Outcomes After Transcatheter Aortic Valve Implantation: Insights From the Nationwide Readmission Database From 2016 to 2021.,Siddharth P Agrawal; Shubhadarshini Pawar; Debankur Dey; Dhruvi K Joshi; Maharshi Raval; Hritvik Jain; Sajid Siddiq,10.1002/ccd.70504,2026-02-15,Catheterization and cardiovascular interventions : official journal of the Society for Cardiac Angiography & Interventions,"Transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) has become an established intervention for severe symptomatic aortic stenosis, particularly in high-risk and elderly patients. Although anemia is frequently encountered in this population, the specific role of iron deficiency anemia (IDA) in influencing outcomes following TAVI remains underexplored.
This study aims to evaluate the impact of iron deficiency anemia on clinical outcomes, resource utilization and readmission rates following TAVI using a large national database.
We conducted a retrospective, observational study using the Nationwide Readmission Database (NRD) from 2016 to 2021. Patients undergoing TAVI were identified by relevant ICD-10-Procedure Coding System (PCS) codes, and IDA was defined using ICD-10-Clinical Modification (CM) codes. Outcomes included in-hospital mortality, 30-day readmission, length of stay (LOS), transfusion requirements, and a range of complications. A 1:1 propensity score-matched analysis was performed to account for potential confounders (e.g., demographics, comorbidities, hospital characteristics).
Among 213,453 patients who underwent TAVI, 8993 (4.2%) had a documented diagnosis of IDA. Compared with non-IDA patients, those with IDA experienced significantly higher rates of blood transfusion (14.75% vs. 5.33%; adjusted OR: 3.12, 95% CI: 2.78, 3.51; p < 0.001) and a greater incidence of post-procedure bleeding (14.38% vs. 11.62%; adjusted OR: 1.29, 95% CI: 1.17, 1.41; p < 0.001). Although in-hospital mortality did not differ significantly between the two groups (1.31% vs. 1.47%; p = 0.42), IDA was associated with a longer median LOS and higher 30-day readmission rates (11.95% vs. 9.84%; adjusted OR: 1.27, 95% CI: 1.15, 1.41; p < 0.001). Advancing age, the presence of heart failure, and greater comorbidity burden (Elixhauser comorbidity index ≥ 7) emerged as key predictors of in-hospital death.
Baseline IDA in patients undergoing TAVI is associated with increased transfusion requirements, prolonged hospitalization, and higher rates of 30-day readmission, underscoring the clinical and economic burden of this modifiable risk factor. Its association with greater resource utilization and complications supports the need for more proactive identification and management of iron deficiency in TAVI candidates. Future randomized trials are needed to clarify whether preprocedural correction of IDA can reduce adverse events and improve long-term outcomes in this population."

We performed a single-centre retrospective analysis of all patients who underwent surgery for SVAS between August 1974 and January 2025. The outcomes were analysed using survival and competing risk analysis, and risk factors were identified using Cox regression models.
A total of 75 patients were identified, 26 (35%) profited from the McGoon technique, 33 (44%) patients received a Doty repair, and 16 (21%) underwent Brom repair. Williams-Beuren syndrome was associated with 45 (60%) patients. Associated anomalies included pulmonary stenosis in 40 (53%) patients, aortic coarctation in 24 (32%), and abnormal coronary arteries in 14 (19%). Transplant-free survival at 15 years was 92%, and no difference was found between surgical techniques (P = .339). Abnormal coronary arteries were a risk factor for major adverse cardiac events (odds ratio 8.666, P = .011) and mortality (hazard ratio [HR] 4.285, P = .030). Cumulative incidence of reoperation at 15 years was 18%, with no difference between surgical techniques (P = .299). However, patients with pulmonary stenosis (HR 3.450, P = .020) had a higher risk of reoperation.
Survival after surgical repair of SVAS is over 90% at 15 years regardless of the surgical technique. Abnormal coronary arteries are responsible for higher operative mortality. Concomitant pulmonary artery stenosis is at a higher risk of reoperation, suggesting more severe arterial disease."

Methods: A total of 70 patients who underwent CMR examinations were enrolled from the UK Biobank database as the training set. A four-dimensional mesh model of the cardiac left and right ventricles was constructed using CMR images that passed quality control. Additionally, a validation set consisting of 30 patients who underwent CMR examinations at the First Medical Center of the Chinese People's Liberation Army General Hospital from March 2021 to October 2024 were included. These patients were classified into three groups based on clinical diagnosis: dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) group, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) group, and control group (no cardiomyopathy). The trained model was applied to analyze the CMR images of the validation set patients, calculating various cardiac structure and function parameters, including left ventricular volume index, left ventricular ejection fraction, left myocardial mass index, and strain. Differences in these parameters between the DCM or HCM groups and the control group were compared, and linear mixed models were used for statistical analysis of inter-group differences. Results: The age of patients in the training set was (62.2±10.3) years, with 58 (83%) males. The age of patients in the validation set was (56.5±13.9) years, with 21 (70%) males, including 8 patients in the HCM group, 9 in the DCM group, and 13 in the control group. The left ventricular ejection fraction in the DCM group was lower than that in the control group ((39.34±3.73) % vs. (53.56±2.98) %, P=0.006 3). The linear mixed model analysis showed that the left ventricular volume index and various strain parameters in the DCM group were significantly higher than those in the control group (all P<0.001). The left myocardial mass index in the HCM group was higher than that in the control group ((94.21±9.10) g/m² vs. (56.36±11.33) g/m², P<0.001). The analysis results of the linear mixed model were consistent with it (P<0.001). Conclusions: The preliminary results confirm that the four-dimensional cardiac mesh model based on CMR imaging constructed in this study could integrate and evaluate multiple parameters of cardiac structure and function in patients with cardiomyopathy. It has the potential to become an intelligent imaging diagnostic tool for cardiac diseases."
PubMed,aortic stenosis,Impact of syncope history on long-term physical activity in patients ≥2 years after transcatheter aortic valve replacement: a single-centre cross-sectional study in China.,Zhiyun Shen; Ziyan Zhu; Chenxu Huang; Daxin Zhou; Jiaying Lv; Ying Lin; Yuxia Zhang,10.1136/bmjopen-2024-094395,2026-02-12,BMJ open,"To explore long-term physical activity (PA) among patients 2 years post-transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) and assess the impact of syncope history on post-TAVR activity.
This was a cross-sectional study conducted using an on-site questionnaire.
In this cross-sectional study, we used convenience sampling to recruit participants from the outpatient department at a tertiary hospital in Shanghai, China, between July 2023 and December 2023.
Patients who had undergone TAVR for 2 years or more were included in the study.
The self-reported PA levels were assessed using the validated Chinese version of the International Physical Activity Questionnaire-Short Form. Additionally, medical records of the patients were thoroughly reviewed to accurately document the history of syncope for everyone.
Via convenience sampling, we recruited 179 consecutive participants aged 60 years and older who underwent TAVR. Only 36.31% (65/179) of patients remained physically active ≥2 years post-TAVR, with 27.37% having a syncope history. After adjusting for potential confounders, a history of syncope was independently associated with significantly lower levels of long-term PA (adjusted OR 0.287, 95% CI 0.122 to 0.675). This negative association was particularly pronounced among men and individuals with a normal body mass index (BMI).
A history of syncope is a strong independent predictor of reduced PA in the long term after TAVR. These findings highlight that patients with a history of syncope, especially men and those with normal BMI, represent a high-risk subgroup warranting particular attention in post-TAVR care. Targeted assessment and rehabilitation strategies should be considered for this population, and further research is needed to elucidate the underlying mechanisms."

We performed a retrospective observational cohort study at a single center from 2019 to 2022, including 180 patients (TAVR: n=65; SAVR: n=115). TAVR patients were older and had higher surgical risk. The total cost of TAVR was significantly higher than SAVR (INT$ 40,776.9 vs. INT$ 12,393.7, p <0.001), primarily driven by the prosthetic valve cost. However, TAVR was associated with a shorter post-procedural length of stay (5 days vs. 7 days, p <0.001) and lower absolute 1-year mortality rates (3.1% vs. 6.1%), although this difference did not reach statistical significance (p=0.60). Most TAVR cases were accessed through litigation due to the lack of formal incorporation in the public system during the study period, which contributed to higher baseline frailty. In conclusion, while TAVR remains more expensive due to device costs, it offers clinical advantages in high-risk populations within a developing healthcare system."

This study aims to explore the hemodynamic factors associated with eventual iliac branch occlusion after EVAR for abdominal aortic aneurysm.MethodsSix patients with different causes of iliac branch occlusion were selected between January 2013 and December 2023, and computed tomography angiography (CTA) images were acquired at the time of preoperative and postoperative occlusion of EVAR. Specific CTA images were applied for modeling and computational fluid dynamics (CFD) analysis was implemented.ResultsPressure, velocity, wall shear stress (WSS), time-averaged wall shear stress (TAWSS), oscillatory Shear Index (OSI), and relative residence time (RRT) were calculated. Velocity, WSS, and TAWSS were elevated at the stenosis, and pressure, OSI, and RRT were decreased at the stenosis. Streamlines were reduced at stenotic sites. Iliac branch locations that eventually occluded had more disturbed flow compared to non-occluded sites. Both pressure and flow velocity gradient variations are greater on the occluded side than on the non-occluded side.ConclusionsComputational fluid hemodynamic analysis identified consistent flow disturbances associated with eventual iliac limb occlusion following EVAR. These findings suggest that CFD-based hemodynamic assessment may help stratify patients at risk of iliac branch occlusion before clinical manifestation."

The clinical course of conduction disturbances after PMI, based on the type of TAVI valve, remains unclear. Therefore, the present study aimed to evaluate the effects of different types of TAVI valves on the clinical course of conduction disturbances.
In total, 480 patients, including 230 with self-expandable (SE) valves and 250 with balloon-expandable (BE) valves, who underwent TAVI between January 2016 and December 2024, were enrolled in this study. The characteristics of patients who required PMI and the changes in the ventricular pacing ratio were compared.
There was no significant difference in PMI factors depending on the type of valve. Computed tomography (CT) images showed that the length of the membranous septum (MS) in the PMI group did not differ from the length of the MS in the non-PMI group. There was a significant difference in improvement in autologous AV conduction between the SE and BE groups at PMI time (SE group vs. BE group; 11/15 [66.7%] vs. 3/11 [27.3%], p = 0.047). At 1 month follow-up, the SE group improved significantly compared to the BE group (SE vs. BE; 14/15 [93.3%] vs. 4/11 [33.3%], p = 0.002).
Restoration of autologous AV conduction and subsequent decrease in ventricular pacing ratio were more likely in the SE group and less variable in the BE group. This result indicates that PM dependency can be reduced by using an extended AVD setting or AVH."

We conducted a single-center registry data analysis of AV patients who underwent only elective, isolated AVR compared to MS, and FS hospitalized between 2014 and 2024 in the Cardiac Surgery Department at the Medical University of Silesia. Redo, emergency, salvage and concomitant procedures were excluded. The 5-year survival data were verified in the National Health Fund. Propensity score matching (PSM) was conducted to determine FS controls for the MS group in a 1 : 1 ratio with a 0.1 SD caliper.
The study group included 1289 elective patients (73 MS, and 1216 FS). All operative and postoperative data before and after PSM are presented in tables. PSM resulted in 65 MS cases and 65 FS controls. The 5-year survival did not differ between groups, either before PSM (HR = 0.92, 95% CI [0.34-2.5]; p = 0.6) or after PSM (HR = 0.79, 95% CI [0.25-2.5]; p = 0.480). After matching, differences were found only in cardiopulmonary bypass time in MS vs. FS (73 [IQR: 61-88] vs. 63 [IQR: 53-77]; p = 0.034) and higher requirement for norepinephrine support (90.8% vs. 61.5%; p < 0.001).

Current AI-enabled tools rely on murmur detection as a proxy for VHD but lack sensitivity for common subtypes like mitral regurgitation and are limited by small datasets. This study presents a novel neural network that directly predicts clinically significant VHD from stethoscope recordings, trained using echocardiographic targets rather than heart murmur labels. A diverse dataset of 1767 patients across UK primary care and hospital settings was developed, combining stethoscope recordings with echocardiographic labels. The trained recurrent neural network achieved an AUROC of 0.83, outperforming general practitioners and demonstrating exceptional sensitivity for severe aortic stenosis (98%) and severe mitral regurgitation (94%).

Lipoprotein(a) possesses increased atherogenicity, contributing to residual cardiovascular risk. Elevated Lp(a) levels affect a substantial proportion of the population, rendering this a potentially high-impact therapeutic target, but currently available lipid-lowering agents and lifestyle interventions have minimal impact on lowering Lp(a), and lipoprotein apheresis is the sole effective-but impractical-method to significantly reduce Lp(a). Recent advances in Lp(a)-targeted therapies, notably nucleic acid-based approaches (e.g. antisense oligonucleotides and small interfering RNAs) and a small molecule inhibitor of Lp(a) synthesis, demonstrated substantial and often durable Lp(a)-lowering effects in Phase II trials. Phase III trials of these agents are now underway to examine the impact of lowering Lp(a) levels on atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease outcomes, and their results may transform the landscape of cardiovascular risk reduction and management for patients with elevated Lp(a).

Cardiovascular computed tomography (CT) has become essential for diagnosing BAV, planning procedures, and evaluating patients after treatment. This is largely due to CT's high spatial resolution and its ability to perform volume imaging effectively. This review provides an up-to-date overview of the increasing role of cardiovascular CT in the management of bicuspid aortic valve (BAV). It covers various aspects, including BAV morphology, optimal sizing for transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR), and post-procedural monitoring. We highlight significant innovations, such as supra-annular sizing techniques and artificial intelligence (AI)-guided analysis, that position CT at the nexus of anatomy, function, and targeted treatment. Additionally, we address controversies concerning inconsistencies in sizing algorithms, recent classification challenges, and radiation exposure. Future development areas include AI predictive tools, radiomic phenotyping, and CT-guided precision medicine. This synthesis aims to provide clinicians and researchers with a high-level guide to the clinical integration of cardiovascular CT and its future in the BAV population. This review provides the most current, comprehensive synthesis on the pivotal role of cardiovascular CT in BAV management, offering a roadmap for integrating advanced imaging into clinical practice and guiding future research priorities."

The primary outcome was the occurrence of stroke during the periprocedural period in the overall population and according to BMI (<30 vs. ≥30 kg/m2). Secondary endpoints included periprocedural parameters, clinical outcomes (in-hospital and 1-year mortality), and safety outcomes. Subgroup analysis was performed to assess stroke risk according to ACT values. Patients with atrial fibrillation or receiving chronic oral anticoagulation were excluded. Results: A total of 1045 patients underwent TAVR between 2022 and 2024, including 827 with BMI < 30 and 218 with BMI ≥ 30. The study population had a mean age of 82 ± 6 years, and 56% of patients were male. In the overall study population, the mean heparin dose was 47 U/kg and the mean ACT value was 218 s. Patients with lower BMI received higher heparin doses (50 vs. 40 U/kg, p < 0.01) and had higher ACT values (221 vs. 208 s, p < 0.01). Protamine use was low and similar between groups. Periprocedural stroke rates were low overall (1.1%) and comparable between study groups (1.2% vs. 0.9%, p = 0.71). One-year mortality was also similar (3% vs. 4%, p = 0.53), with no significant differences in other safety outcomes. Subgroup analysis by ACT (≤250 vs. >250 s) showed no difference in stroke rates (1% vs. 1.5%, p = 0.60). Conclusions: In this single-center cohort, differences in heparin dosing and ACT values were not associated with differences in peri-procedural stroke or overall procedural outcomes. However, given the low number of stroke events, these findings should be interpreted cautiously. Prospective randomized studies are needed to define optimal anticoagulation strategies during TAVR."

This has informed the recommendation for urgent intervention upon diagnosis, especially when symptoms develop. Asymptomatic severe aortic stenosis has a four-year mortality between 30 and 50% if left untreated, which is similar to some metastatic cancers. Conservative management for patients with severe asymptomatic aortic stenosis was previously advocated, likely owing to the relative invasiveness of surgical aortic valve replacement. The advent of low-risk transcatheter aortic valve implantation with good medium-term durability has prioritized the need for a paradigm shift in the treatment of asymptomatic severe aortic stenosis towards a more proactive strategy of early intervention to reduce significant adverse events. This article provides a state-of-the-art overview of the contemporary management of patients with asymptomatic severe aortic stenosis."

Endovascular stents typically consist of a metal framework and a flexible membrane graft designed to reopen obstructed aortic segments and maintain blood flow through the true lumen. Consequently, stents are widely used to treat aortic expansion diseases and aortic occlusive stenosis. However, traditional stents have limitations in terms of adaptability to complex anatomical structures, long-term durability, biomechanical stability, and reliance on radial support force for fixation, lacking active fixation mechanisms. These shortcomings remain the primary causes of postoperative complications, significantly impacting the quality of life for patients with aortic dissection.                                                           Methods:                     The research status of the endovascular stent was discussed in depth, and the main factors for the optimal design of the stent (geometry, pattern configuration, additional fixtures, and optimization methods) were analyzed and summarized according to the complications targeted by the repair device.                                                           Results:                     The composition structure, working principle, and development status of the stent grafts under review are elaborated in detail. Stent grafts attempt to alleviate postoperative complications through three approaches: enhancing the flexibility of the stent framework, improving the fit between the vessel wall and the stent, and reducing vascular injury. Blood flow guiding channels are established to alleviate the obstruction of branch blood flow. Additional self-anchoring devices are added to adapt to the dynamic remodeling of blood vessels.                                                           Discussion:                     The effects of various factors, including geometric parameters, structural design, and parameter optimization techniques, on the optimization of stent primary mechanical performance are discussed. The current research status of functional improvement methods for stents is also summarized.                                                           Conclusion:                     Refining the quantitative relationship between stent structural parameters and mechanical performance, as well as exploring the balance criteria between flexibility and radial support force, represent promising directions for future development. These objectives necessitate further in-depth analysis and research."

A debate persists regarding the optimal aortic clamp occlusion strategy, with limited comparative data. The two principal strategies, which are transthoracic cross-clamping (TTCC) and endo-aortic balloon occlusion (EABO), offer distinct advantages, but comparative clinical data remain limited. This study compares the two techniques in terms of procedural safety and early outcome. Materials and Methods: This single-center retrospective study included consecutive adult patients undergoing elective MIS via video-assisted right mini-thoracotomy between 2012 and 2018 for mitral valve surgery. Tricuspid repair, atrial fibrillation and redo surgery were included in the final cohort. Aortic occlusion was performed with transthoracic cross-clamping (TTCC) or endo-aortic balloon occlusion (EABO). Primary endpoints were intra-operative complications and the rate of conversion to full sternotomy; secondary outcomes were overall mortality and Society of Thoracic Surgeons (STS)-defined comorbidities. Results: A total of 163 patients were analyzed (TTCC: n = 99, 60%; EABO: n = 64, 40%). While both techniques demonstrated equivalent safety profiles (overall mortality: 0%), EABO was associated with higher conversion to full sternotomy [(n = 7, 10.9%) vs. TTCC (n = 1, 1.3%), p = 0.016]. In a generalized estimation equations (GEE) model, no patient-level covariate predicted conversion, suggesting technical or procedural factors as the primary contributors. In addition, EABO was associated with longer cross-clamp time [median: 87 min (IQR: 73, 100) vs. TTCC median: 77 min (IQR: 65.5, 87.5), p = 0.03]. Stroke, acute kidney injury, respiratory failure, reoperation and wound infection did not differ significantly; also, hospital stay was similar between groups. Conclusions: In this single-center series, EABO showed longer operative times and a higher conversion rate to sternotomy, but without excess mortality or major complications. This may be correlated with the initial learning phase and redo cases; further comparison is needed to assess the benefits of EABO."

Em idosos, essa condição apresentou particularidades clínicas relevantes, uma vez que esteve frequentemente associada a processos degenerativos, calcificação do anel mitral e comorbidades cardiovasculares pré-existentes. As manifestações cardiovasculares foram influenciadas tanto pela progressão lenta da doença quanto pelas alterações fisiológicas do envelhecimento, favorecendo aumento da pressão atrial esquerda, congestão pulmonar e sobrecarga do ventrículo direito. Objetivo: Analisar as principais manifestações cardiovasculares associadas à estenose mitral em idosos, com ênfase nos mecanismos fisiopatológicos, repercussões hemodinâmicas e implicações clínicas descritas na literatura científica recente. Metodologia: A metodologia baseou-se no checklist PRISMA e incluiu a busca de artigos científicos publicados nos últimos 10 anos nas bases de dados PubMed, Scielo e Web of Science. Foram utilizados cinco descritores combinados: “mitral valve stenosis”, “elderly”, “cardiovascular manifestations”, “heart failure” e “atrial fibrillation”. Os critérios de inclusão compreenderam estudos originais, revisões de literatura e livros científicos que abordaram idosos com estenose mitral e descreveram manifestações cardiovasculares, publicações em inglês, português ou espanhol e textos completos disponíveis. Os critérios de exclusão incluíram estudos com populações exclusivamente pediátricas ou adultas jovens, artigos que abordaram outras valvopatias sem análise específica da estenose mitral e publicações duplicadas ou com dados insuficientes. Resultados: Os resultados demonstraram que as manifestações cardiovasculares mais frequentes foram dispneia aos esforços, fibrilação atrial decorrente da dilatação atrial esquerda, hipertensão pulmonar secundária e insuficiência cardíaca direita. A literatura destacou aumento do risco de eventos tromboembólicos, piora da capacidade funcional e maior complexidade diagnóstica em idosos devido à sobreposição de sintomas com outras doenças cardiovasculares. Conclusão: Concluiu-se que a estenose mitral em idosos apresentou manifestações cardiovasculares complexas e multifatoriais, associadas à progressão da doença valvar e ao envelhecimento cardiovascular. A identificação precoce dessas repercussões foi descrita como fundamental para o manejo clínico adequado, contribuindo para redução de complicações, melhora prognóstica e maior qualidade de vida nessa população."

With a focus on the prevalent psychological complications following the onset of this condition, this study aimed to explore the correlation between antenatal depression and Corona disease anxiety, personality traits, and postpartum depression during the COVID-19 pandemic.                                                           Materials and Methods:                     This cross-sectional descriptive-analytical study investigated women receiving care at health centers affiliated with Kerman University of Medical Sciences during the last month of their pregnancy and the postpartum period in 2022. Following the acquisition of informed consent, participants were assessed using various measures, including demographic and obstetric information, the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale, the Corona Disease Anxiety Scale (CDAS), and the NEO Personality Inventory-Revised during their third trimester of pregnancy. The same group of participants completed the Edinburgh Depression Scale and the Corona Disease Anxiety Scale (CDAS) 4-6 weeks after childbirth.                                                           Results and Discussion:                     There was a significant correlation between family income, unwanted pregnancy as perceived by both the mother and father, and antenatal depression. Additionally, marital satisfaction played a significant role in postpartum depression. Furthermore, antenatal depression was significantly associated with neuroticism, agreeableness, and physical symptoms related to Corona disease anxiety. Personality traits, with the exception of extroversion and conscientiousness, and various domains of Corona disease anxiety, excluding psychological symptoms, were also significantly associated with postpartum depression.                                                           Conclusion:                     During pandemics or epidemics, such as the COVID-19 outbreak, experiencing mental distress during pregnancy can contribute to mental health issues during the postpartum period. This risk is particularly true in individuals with unique personality traits, emphasizing the need for increased focus on mental health within prenatal care during these crises."

Method:                     This cross-sectional study was conducted in Kerman, Iran. Data were collected from patients who visited Afzalipour Hospital in Kerman more than twice during the COVID-19 epidemic from the end of February 2020 to March 21, 2021. We conducted two key analyses: 1. Mixed effect logistic regression was used to check the relationship between the variables and COVID-19 severity. 2. Mixed effect linear regression was used to check the relationship between the variables and the length of stay in the hospital.                                                           Results:                     The findings indicated that the most important risk factors for the severity of COVID-19 were heart diseases (OR=1.67,95%CI:1.20-2.30), increasing age (OR=2.23 for age&gt;54, 95%CI:1.70- 2.90), male gender (OR=1.47,95%CI:1.10-1.96), respiratory diseases other than asthma, and frequency of admission (OR=1.60,95%CI:1.20-2.15). All patients who underwent readmission experienced a shorter duration of hospitalization during their subsequent admission (OR=0.94,95%CI:0.91,0.96) and had a higher mortality rate (30% within 14 days, 26.6% between 14-90 days). Patients readmitted at intervals of 14-90 days and greater than 90 days exhibited lower disease severity compared to those readmitted within the 0-14 day period.                                                           Conclusion:                     Examining readmissions, the severity of COVID-19, and the length of hospital stay in affected patients are important factors for planning and allocating resources for COVID-19 management and treatment. These factors can help policymakers develop effective clinical guidelines for hospitalization or outpatient treatment of COVID-19 patients and contribute to reducing the burden of disease in the community."

Kinovea, as an accessible motion-analysis software, provides both visual and quantitative feedback. However, its application in supporting technique development among beginner athletes remains insufficiently explored. Aim: This study aims to describe the use of Kinovea in biomechanics training and examine its contribution to the awareness of kinematic characteristics and movement techniques among beginner athletes. Methods: A descriptive qualitative design involved 72 beginner athletes aged 18–25 years selected through purposive sampling. Data were collected over 16 weeks through interviews, field observations, and motion video recordings analyzed using Kinovea. Kinematic data focused on joint angles, stride behavior, and movement phases during walking, running, and the flight phase. Qualitative data were analyzed using content analysis with NVivo 12, while kinematic results were interpreted descriptively to identify performance patterns and areas for technical refinement. Result: Kinematic analysis showed coordinated joint-angle patterns across all phases. Walking analysis identified arm swing angles of 50.9°–58.8° and leg separation angles of 64.3°–67.2°, indicating a stable gait rhythm. The running analysis revealed knee angles of 68.8°–69.8° and elbow angles of 87.6°–89.1°, indicating efficient propulsive mechanics. The flight phase demonstrated knee angles of 81.2°–87.8° and elbow angles of 80.4°–88.3°, suggesting effective momentum use and postural stability. These measurements supported stride-efficiency assessment and technique evaluation. Qualitative findings revealed that Kinovea enabled athletes to interpret movement phases and identify technical inefficiencies through slow-motion and frame-by-frame visualization. Conclusion: Kinovea supports basic motion analysis by providing clear kinematic information and helping beginner athletes observe and refine their movement techniques. The findings also offer practical value for coaches by enabling more precise identification of inefficient patterns and guiding targeted corrections during early-stage training."

OpenAlex,deep learning,Combating Data and Target Shifts in Visual Tasks,Zhaorui Tan,10.17638/03194353,2031-01-01,University of Liverpool,"The rapid advancement of deep learning models for visual tasks has led to significant progress in many domains. However, a key challenge remains: ensuring that models can generalize effectively to unseen samples or novel classes, especially in real-world scenarios where training data-target pairs are often limited or unavailable, and test data may exhibit shifts in both data and targets. This thesis addresses the problem of shifts across data and targets, proposing novel methods to improve model generalization and transferability in complex settings. The thesis identifies the different shift scenarios for visual tasks and presents their problem forms. The research first relaxes the static target distribution assumption in Multi-Domain Generalization (mDG) tasks, introducing the General Multi-Domain Generalization (GMDG) objective to improve generalization under varying data shifts. Specifically, Extensive experiments validate that GMDG is feasible for classification, segmentation, and regression tasks. Further considering extreme target distribution shifts where even unknown novel classes emerge, the study also explores logical regularization techniques for tasks such as Generalized Category Discovery (GCD), mDG+GCD, and Class Incremental Learning (CIL), proposing a sample-based logical regularization term (L-Reg) to enhance data-, target-, and all-shift generalization. Additionally, a partial logic framework is introduced to address challenges in CIL, enabling models to retain room for unknown classes during training. This is further extended by the Partial-Logic Regularization (PL-Reg), which improves generalization across GCD, mDG+GCD, and transferability for CIL tasks. Furthermore, the thesis proposes a novel Semantic-aware Data Augmentation (SADA) framework for cross-modality generalization in text-to-image synthesis (T2Isyn), text-image retrieval (TIR), and image-text retrieval (ITR) tasks. This framework ensures semantic preservation across text and image modalities, improving both semantic consistency and image quality in cross-modality tasks. The methods proposed in this thesis offer significant advancements in visual generalization and transfer scenarios, providing theoretical insights and practical solutions for handling data shifts, target shifts, and multi-modalities in complex scenarios. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of the proposed methods, demonstrating their superior performance across a range of tasks."
OpenAlex,deep learning,Antecedents and consequences of Green-tech FDI in emerging markets,Zhuoran Liu,10.17638/03195308,2031-01-01,University of Liverpool,"As environmental pressures intensify, attracting sustainable foreign direct investment (FDI), particularly green-tech FDI, has become a critical pathway for emerging markets to achieve environmental sustainability. However, existing research remains fragmented, offering limited insights into why green-tech FDI enters emerging markets and how it affects regional green innovation. This thesis addresses these gaps by systematically examining both the antecedents and consequences of green-tech FDI through three empirical studies using regional data from China. Study 1 and Study 2 focus on the antecedents of green-tech FDI. Study 1 examines how host-country conditions can attract green-tech FDI, highlighting the role of environmental management information disclosure (EMID) by domestic firms in reducing information gaps and strengthening green market–seeking motives. Study 2 shifts attention to the active decision-making of green-tech FDI, showing that under uncertainty, green-tech foreign investors engage in identity-based bandwagon learning by imitating peers with similar green identities, thereby mitigating investment risks. Study 3 turns to the consequences of green-tech FDI. It demonstrates that, due to the technological complexity of green innovation and limited absorptive capacity in emerging markets, green-tech FDI may generate crowding-out effects rather than purely positive spillovers. Adopting a network perspective, the study further finds that universities play a key moderating role: through broad linkages and deep collaborations, they help mitigate negative spillovers and facilitate the diffusion of green technologies. Together, the three studies advance the literature on sustainable FDI by differentiating green-tech FDI from general FDI and identifying the specific mechanisms that shape its entry decisions and local innovation outcomes. Practically, the findings provide guidance for emerging-market governments and firms on how to attract and manage sustainable investment, balance growth with environmental objectives, and strengthen local innovation ecosystems."
OpenAlex,deep learning,A UAV-Based Framework for Community-Scale Residential Building Energy Modelling in China,Mengfan Jin,10.17638/03195460,2029-01-01,University of Liverpool,"With increasing emphasis on energy efficiency and carbon emission reduction in the building sector, rapid and scalable energy modelling of existing buildings is critical for retrofit projects and policy development. Conventional surveys, data collection and energy modelling processes remain labour-intensive and impractical for large-scale applications, and energy modelling often dominates project time and cost. Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) equipped with high-resolution and infrared cameras now offer fast and safe exterior surveys, showing great potential in building energy assessments. Yet, a systematic framework for UAV integration, from image capture through processing to inputs for building energy simulation, has not been established. This research addresses these challenges by developing a structured framework for community-scale building energy modelling, which integrates UAV photogrammetry to accelerate data acquisition, reduce labour, and shorten energy modelling time for retrofit projects. The framework is designed to minimise prior data requirements while maximising automation and retaining sufficient accuracy and reliability. It also addressed systemic issues, such as the lack of data necessary to fully exploit the potential of available technologies in the context of this study. To achieve this research objective, a mixed-methodology approach, combining desk studies and fieldwork, was adopted. First, a comprehensive review of UAV-based building energy studies mapped the current applications and available tools, proposing a preliminary framework. Fieldwork then encompassed a pilot study and a detailed case study. In the pilot test, a single building was surveyed to identify an optimal toolchain for flight planning, image capture, photogrammetric reconstruction, model generation, and selection of a simulation platform. The resulting refined framework was applied to a case study of a 39-building community, and it was demonstrated that further automation was necessary. The potential for automation was then further explored. Geomatic algorithms, machine learning, and deep learning techniques were compared, and the combination that best balanced accuracy and processing time was selected for 3D model generation and window-to-wall ratio (WWR) extraction. In parallel, an archetype library of residential buildings in the Hot Summer Cold Winter (HSCW) zone in China was compiled to facilitate the assignment of thermal parameters. Finally, a reusable community-scale building energy modelling (CBEM) workflow was assembled in Grasshopper using Ladybug Tools components to process the aforementioned inputs. In conclusion, this study integrates UAV photogrammetry, GIS-based geomatic algorithms, machine learning, and graphical programming to develop an UAV-CBEM framework. The outcomes establish a foundation for scalable UAV-based building energy assessments, enhancing applicability in data-limited and large-scale settings worldwide."

OpenAlex,deep learning,Unsupervised Deep-learning Methods for Low-dose Computed Tomography Reconstruction,Ran An,10.17638/03194237,2027-01-01,University of Liverpool,"Computed tomography (CT) has become an indispensable imaging technique in medical diagnostics and industrial applications, owing to its non-invasive nature and high resolution in visualizing object internal structures. While X-ray CT (X-ray computed tomography) significantly enhances lesion detection capabilities, excessive exposure to X-ray radiation raises substantial health concerns, including elevated cancer risks and potential genetic damage. Although low-dose CT (LDCT) protocols reduce radiation safety concerns, they inevitably introduce severe noise and artifacts, which might compromise diagnostic accuracy. Recent advances in supervised deep learning approaches have demonstrated remarkable success in LDCT reconstruction. However, the reliance on paired training data severely limits their deployment in practical CT applications. This fundamental constraint highlights the critical importance of developing unsupervised reconstruction methods. Although existing unsupervised LDCT methods have made notable progress, they still face challenges requiring systematic solutions. This thesis makes three contributions to advance the field of unsupervised LDCT reconstruction: 1. Current dual-domain self-supervised LDCT denoising methods typically neglect the heterogeneity of the non-stationary Gaussian noise levels in low-dose sinograms and usually treat them as common images without appropriately controlling the denoising strength. The denoisers employed by them, which are based on classic convolutional neural networks (CNN), will lead to blurring artifacts in the reconstructed images if directly used for sinogram denoising. In addition, the denoising strength in the sinogram and image domains must be well-balanced to avoid introducing over-blurring or secondary artifacts in the reconstructed images, but existing approaches do not focus on this crucial point. To address these limitations, this thesis proposes a novel end-to-end dual-domain self-supervised framework for LDCT denoising. It employs Dropblock layers to adaptively localize the effect of convolution for sinogram denoising and sets a weighted average between the denoised sinograms and their noisy counterparts to better control the denoising strength, thus effectively reducing the blurring artifacts and leading to a well-balanced dual-domain denoising. Numerical experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and superior performance of the proposed method. 2. Existing normalizing flows (NFs)-based unsupervised LDCT reconstruction methods face challenges in both image quality and computational efficiency. On one hand, they typically utilize a two-way transformation strategy between noisy images and latent variables, which could easily lead to detail loss and secondary artifacts in the reconstructed images. On the other hand, training NFs on high-resolution CT images is computationally intensive. Although conditional normalizing flows (CNFs) can mitigate computational costs by learning conditional probabilities, existing approaches rely on labeled data for conditionalization, leaving unsupervised CNFs-based LDCT reconstruction a challenge. To tackle these issues, this thesis proposes a novel unsupervised LDCT iterative reconstruction algorithm based on CNFs. The proposed method employs a strict one-way transformation strategy during the alternating optimization in the dual spaces to prevent detail loss and secondary artifacts, and proposes a novel unsupervised conditionalization strategy for CNFs, thus achieving efficient training and inference on high-resolution images. The proposed method illustrates high-quality and relatively fast unsupervised reconstruction. Experiments across two datasets demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed method by rivaling several state-of-the-art methods. 3. Current diffusion model-based LDCT reconstruction methods solely employ the prior distributions learned from normal-dose CT data but neglect the valuable priors in low-dose data, which contain information about the characteristics of low-dose noise and artifacts. In addition, their reconstruction speed suffers from multiple sampling steps, presenting low efficiency. Breaking new ground in prior utilization, this thesis proposes a novel unsupervised LDCT iterative reconstruction algorithm based on dual denoising diffusion probabilistic models (DDPM), which leverages both normal-dose and low-dose priors. Specifically, the proposed method employs two DDPMs to learn the prior distributions from normal-dose and low-dose images, respectively, and incorporates them into a joint iterative reconstruction framework. To accelerate the reconstruction, partial diffusion sampling and single-pass deterministic reconstruction strategy are utilized in the proposed method, as well as the spaced OS-SART approaches.

OpenAlex,deep learning,From Sparse to Dense: Label-Efficient Weakly Supervised Segmentation for Images and Videos,Jian Wang,10.17638/03195330,2027-01-01,University of Liverpool,"Obtaining high-quality annotated data has become a primary bottleneck for training deep learning models, particularly for dense prediction tasks like semantic segmentation and video salient object segmentation. The demand for meticulous, pixel-level labeling makes fully-supervised approaches prohibitively expensive and limits their scalability. This thesis directly confronts this issue by proposing and systematically investigating a label-efficient ""sparse-to-dense'' paradigm. The core objective is to develop innovative frameworks that can learn from sparse, inexpensive weak supervision—such as image-level tags or scribbles—and intelligently propagate this minimal information to generate complete, pixel-accurate dense predictions. The major part of this thesis focuses on the ""sparse-to-dense'' challenge within Weakly Supervised Semantic Segmentation (WSSS) for images, where models learn from only image-level tags. Dominant approaches rely on Class Activation Maps (CAMs) as initial object seeds. However, CAMs inherently activate only the most discriminative object regions, leading to incomplete pseudo-labels. This gives rise to the central problem of activation densification: the critical process of expanding these sparse activations to cover the full extent of an object. Our research addresses this challenge through a progressive, multi-faceted strategy. Our exploration begins with a foundational framework (C3) designed to rectify the intrinsic flaws of initial CAMs. We propose a synergistic mutual calibration method. This method leverages the discrepancies between the two maps to generate local prototypes, which are simultaneously utilized to complete missing object parts and suppress background noise, yielding a significantly more accurate and complete initial seed. This foundational work immediately reveals the limitation of single-prototype instability and its inability to capture diverse features. Building on this foundation, we then develop architecture-specific strategies to address deeper limitations of the prototype-based approach. For Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) (C4), the use of a single prototype proves insufficient to capture significant intra-class variation. In response, we introduce an Optimal Transport (OT)-assisted framework that effectively mines multiple, diverse prototypes, thereby yielding more comprehensive activation maps. However, while C4 solves the intra-class diversity problem, the inherent local context constraint of the CNN architecture becomes the new bottleneck, fundamentally limiting the quality of globally-aware feature extraction needed for optimal multi-prototype assignment. This limitation necessitates a shift in architectural focus from CNNs to Vision Transformers. In the ViT architecture (C5), a new challenge arises where the token gap between the discriminative class token and varied patch tokens leads to incomplete activation. To bridge this gap, we leverage a tailored application of Optimal Transport, where the algorithm is tasked with learning a comprehensive proxy to ensure complete object activation. Despite these architectural advances (C3-C5), the overall WSSS performance hit a ceiling. This is fundamentally limited by the sparse supervision of class labels, which cannot provide precise boundary information. To break this ceiling, our WSSS exploration culminates in a universal enhancement strategy (C6) that transcends architecture-specific designs by leveraging Visual Foundation Models (VFMs). We resolve the conflict between the discriminative nature of initial CAMs and the VFM's need for holistic prompts. By modeling the CAM foreground as a graph and employing spectral analysis, our method intelligently selects a diverse set of prompt points that represent the overall structure of the foreground object. This guides the VFM to generate superior, boundary-aware supervision that can universally enhance any WSSS pipeline. Subsequently, the thesis extends the ""sparse-to-dense'' paradigm to the dynamic domain of video, addressing Weakly Supervised Video Salient Object Segmentation (WSVSOS) (C7) from sparse scribble annotations. In this specific context, the challenge evolves into spatio-temporal densification, which requires both full-object coverage within each frame and temporal consistency across the video sequences. To this end, we introduce the core CFMR framework, which utilizes Spatio-Temporal co-regulation. This framework is subsequently enhanced (CFMR+) by integrating the VFM guidance strategy from C6, which provides high-quality spatial priors essential for ensuring both high spatial detail and inter-frame consistency. By enforcing both intra-frame and cross-frame consistency between these two streams, our method effectively propagates the sparse initial signal to generate dense and temporally coherent saliency masks. In conclusion, this thesis presents a comprehensive and cohesive investigation into label-efficient segmentation tasks, offering a suite of innovative and effective strategies for the ""sparse-to-dense'' challenge. Our work establishes a progressive roadmap that systematically overcomes architectural and semantic limitations, culminating in highly robust and generalized densification pipelines. Our extensive experimental results on standard benchmarks validate the state-of-the-art performance of these methods, providing robust solutions to a long-standing problem in the computer vision field."

OpenAlex,deep learning,Diseño y construcción de un sistema predictivo de congestión de tráfico basado en aprendizaje automático,Zehan Li,,2026-07-17,UPM Digital Archive (Technical University of Madrid),"Resumen: Este proyecto desarrolla un sistema de predicción de la intensidad del tráfico urbano mediante técnicas de aprendizaje profundo, con el objetivo de mejorar la toma de decisiones de movilidad. A diferencia de otras plataformas centradas en la visualización del estado actual, la solución propuesta busca anticipar comportamientos futuros, y se plantea como una alternativa abierta, replicable y específicamente orientada a la predicción. Para lograrlo, se ha diseñado una arquitectura modular basada en el lenguaje Python, capaz de integrar múltiples fuentes de datos abiertos: registros históricos del tráfico, datos históricos de situación meteorológica, y coordenadas espaciales de los sensores de medición. El sistema aplica un proceso de limpieza, interpolación temporal y transformación de variables, incluyendo la codificación cíclica del tiempo y la conversión espacial a coordenadas UTM, lo que permite una fusión precisa entre datos geográficos y meteorológicos mediante técnicas como la ponderación por distancia inversa (IDW).

Abstract This Project develops an urban traffic intensity prediction system using deep learning techniques, with the aim of improving mobility decision-making. Unlike other platforms focused on visualizing the current state, the proposed solution seeks to anticipate future behaviors, and is positioned as an open, replicable alternative specifically oriented towards prediction. To achieve this, a modular architecture based on the Python language has been designed, capable of integrating multiple open data sources: historical traffic records, historical weather situation data, and spatial coordinates of measurement sensors. The system applies a process of cleaning, temporal interpolation, and variable transformation, including cyclic encoding of time and spatial conversion to UTM coordinates, allowing for precise fusion between geographical and meteorological data through techniques such as inverse distance weighting (IDW). The predictive model is based on an LSTM neural network, especially adapted for multivariate time sequences. It is trained using a sliding window strategy of 32 samples (7 hours and 45 minutes) to predict traffic intensity in the next interval. The system additionally incorporates an IterableDataset mechanism to handle large volumes of training data without compromising the stability of the environment. The obtained results show robust accuracy in validation scenarios, with acceptable prediction errors (MAE and RMSE). Furthermore, an interactive web interface has been developed, allowing for the local deployment of the system, with the capacity for real-time data ingestion and direct visualization of predictions. This work demonstrates the technical and operational feasibility of applying deep learning to urban traffic analysis and lays the groundwork for its future evolution towards more generalizable, robust, and useful systems in real smart city contexts."
OpenAlex,deep learning,Deep Learning-Based Data Hiding Technique for Medical Images,Hadjer SAIDI,,2026-06-26,University of Biskra Theses Repository (University of Biskra),"This thesis introduces novel deep learning-based frameworks for secure medical image steganography, addressing the critical challenge of protecting sensitive patient information while preserving diagnostic quality. Medical images present unique security requirements due to their dual nature: containing both critical visual data for diagnosis and sensitive patient metadata, which conventional steganographic techniques do not adequately address. Our work presents two complementary approaches to this challenge. First, we develop a Mask-RCNN based framework that intelligently identifies diagnostically insignificant regions within medical images for strategic data embedding. By combining this regionaware detection with Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) embedding in the frequency domain, our method achieves remarkable imperceptibility with Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR) values exceeding 115 dB while maintaining high payload capacity. Second, we propose a clinical quality-aware convolutional neural network architecture that leverages an encoder-decoder framework for end-to-end steganography. This approach employs parallel processing paths with scaled residual learning to embed secret medical images within cover images while preserving diagnostic features. Extensive experimentation across multiple medical imaging modalities (CT, MRI) from datasets including MIDRC-RICORD-1B, and IQ-OTH/NCCD, demonstrates that our method achieves a good trade-off between payload and imperceptibility. The frameworks developed in this thesis achieve an optimal balance between embedding capacity, imperceptibility, and robust secret recovery, providing healthcare institutions with effective tools for safeguarding patient privacy while maintaining the integrity of medical diagnostics. This work significantly advances the field of medical image security and establishes a foundation for future innovations in secure healthcare information systems."
OpenAlex,deep learning,A Novel Deep-Learning-Based Approach for Estimating High-Resolution InSAR Parameters,"Dell Amore, Luca; Carcereri, Daniel; Demir, Begüm; Rizzoli, Paola",,2026-06-01,elib (German Aerospace Center),"Nowadays, SAR Interferometry (InSAR) represents one of the most powerful tools to perform complex tasks, such as retrieving Earth’s surface topography and monitoring its deformations. However, denoising strategies are crucial for the generation of reliable and high-quality InSAR products. In this framework, we propose a complete and generalized theoretical and statistical model to physically describe and simulate a noise-free interferogram, together with its corresponding noisy version, starting from the knowledge of the InSAR acquisition geometry and of the underlying topography. A deep-learning-based model is then trained in a fully-supervised manner to estimate high-resolution InSAR parameters, i.e. coherence and interferometric phase, leveraging the proposed statistical model. In particular, an accurate assessment of the network’s estimation performance is conducted by comparing it to state-of-the-art denoising filters, such as Boxcar and Phi-Net and showing the added value of the proposed theoretical modifications to the state-of-the-art literature."
