Artificial intelligence has shown great potential in cardiovascular medicine because of its advanced data processing and analytical capabilities. However, a comprehensive bibliometric analysis summarizing global research trends and identifying emerging areas is lacking.
To delineate a comprehensive bibliometric panorama of artificial intelligence applications in cardiovascular medicine over the past decade, and to furnish evidence-based, actionable, decision-making references for researchers, policymakers and clinicians in this domain.
We conducted a bibliometric analysis of publications on artificial intelligence applications in cardiovascular medicine from 2015 to 2024, sourced from the Web of Science Core Collection database. Visualization and analysis were performed using VOSviewer, CiteSpace and the R package ""bibliometrix"".
A total of 914 articles from 76 countries were analysed, revealing significant growth in research output. The USA and China led in publication volume, Harvard University was the most prolific institution and Frontiers in Cardiovascular Medicine emerged as the leading journal. Johnson et al. (2018), published in the Journal of the American College of Cardiology, was the most cited article, and ""prediction"" and ""classification"" were identified as primary research hotspots. Emerging research directions included cardiomyopathy and aortic stenosis, with an emphasis on predictive analytics, disease classification, healthcare modelling and coronary artery disease.
This bibliometric analysis highlights robust growth and global collaboration in artificial intelligence applications within cardiovascular medicine. Current research emphasizes predictive analytics and disease classification, focusing increasingly on cardiomyopathy and aortic stenosis. This study provides insights into current trends, identifies research gaps and suggests potential avenues for future studies, facilitating further innovation and clinical translation in cardiovascular medicine."

Case reports,"Patients with cardiogenic shock secondary to severe aortic stenosis represent a population at exceedingly high surgical risk. In this setting, the use of a left atrial-to-femoral arterial bypass percutaneous ventricular assist device (LA-FA pVAD) as temporary mechanical circulatory support (tMCS), followed by transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR), may offer a viable, potentially lifesaving alternative.
A 73-year-old man with known aortic stenosis was admitted with cardiogenic shock. Given the hemodynamic compromise associated with low-flow, low-gradient severe aortic stenosis, tMCS was initiated to stabilize end-organ perfusion. Subsequent TAVR was successfully performed, resulting in rapid clinical recovery.
This case highlights the feasibility of performing TAVR in severe aortic stenosis-related cardiogenic shock under tMCS. LA-FA pVAD provides effective unloading and systemic perfusion, bridging unstable patients to definitive valve intervention.
An LA-FA pVAD can safely support TAVR in severe aortic stenosis-related cardiogenic shock."

Case reports,"Coarctation of the aorta is associated with long-term cardiovascular complications, including hypertension and early onset atherosclerosis.
A 36-year-old woman with persistent hypertension after preeclampsia presented with chest pain. Electrocardiogram showed left ventricular hypertrophy with signs of ischemia. Echocardiography revealed a bicuspid aortic valve; however, the aortic arch was poorly seen. Coronary computed tomography identified severe left anterior descending artery stenosis with thoracic collaterals. During angioplasty, guidewire misdirection uncovered nearly atretic aortic coarctation, successfully stented a few days later.
This case illustrates how aortic coarctation can remain undetected until adulthood. It causes long-term cardiovascular complications through chronic hypertension and vascular dysfunction, promoting early coronary artery disease. Besides classical risk factors, Turner syndrome, the shape of the aortic arch, as well as the timing and method of repair, also appear to be additional risk factors.
Aortic coarctation is an aortopathy that leads to early atherosclerosis and coronary artery disease. Comprehensive evaluation is essential for timely diagnosis and optimal management."
PubMed,aortic stenosis,Expanded Stent Migration and Renal Artery Embolization During Aorto-Ostial Left Main Percutaneous Coronary Intervention.,Hendrianus; Sang Yeub Lee; Jinhwan Jo; Sang-Wook Kim,10.1016/j.jaccas.2025.106327,2025-12-03,JACC. Case reports,"Stent dislodgement with systemic embolization is a rare but serious complication of percutaneous coronary intervention.
During intravascular ultrasound-guided percutaneous coronary intervention for aorto-ostial left main artery stenosis, a fully expanded 4.0-mm drug-eluting stent dislodged upon balloon withdrawal. Angiography showed the stent partially floating in the aortic root, with its distal struts still anchored at the ostium, before its complete embolization. After securing the left main artery with a second stent, the dislodged stent was identified following systemic embolization to the left renal artery. Given the high risk of retrieval, it was managed in situ with balloon expansion to achieve full apposition against the vessel wall.
This report describes the rare event of systemic embolization of a fully expanded stent. Our experience indicates that in situ expansion may represent a practical alternative when retrieval poses significant hazards, offering a potential pathway to stabilize the complication.
Fully expanded coronary stents can in rare cases dislodge and embolize systemically. When retrieval is high risk, intentional in situ deployment at the embolization site provides a safe and definitive management option."

In this study, we analyzed temporal trends in risk profiles and treatment results from 2013 to 2023.
We carried out a retrospective analysis of patient characteristics, periprocedural complications, and 30-day mortality after 33 079 TAVI procedures that were carried out in seven German cardiac care centers.
TAVI case numbers rose from 1605 in 2013 to 4459 in 2023. The mean age of the patients remained constant at 81 years, while the operative risk (STS score) fell from 5.9% to 4.1%. The percentage of low-risk patients (STS < 4%) rose from 47% to 66%. From 2013 to 2023, there was a steady decline in periprocedural complications including severe bleeding of VARC types 3 and 4 (8.5% to 2.9%), vascular complications (17.2% to 4.9%), stroke (4.2% to 2.1%), and pacemaker implantations (15.5% to 11.4%). Over the same period, the risk-adjusted 30-day mortality fell from 3.8% to 3.2%.
The improved short-term results of TAVI from 2013 to 2023 are attributable to a change in patients' risk profiles as well as the increasing experience of the interventionists and refinements of the procedure. The mortality rate, which has remained unchanged in recent years, indicates that TAVI for older patients has been largely optimized."

Heart & vasculature,"Although the association between global longitudinal strain (GLS), a marker of myocardial systolic function, and prognosis in patients undergoing transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) is well-documented, the prognostic association of regional longitudinal strain (LS), such as apical LS, on patients undergoing TAVI remains underexplored.
From 2015 to 2023, a total of 303 patients with aortic stenosis (AS) who underwent TAVI at Kumamoto University Hospital were screened, and excluding 4 patients with in-hospital deaths, 299 were analyzed. The median follow-up period after TAVI was 693 days (interquartile range, 435-1189 days), during which 63 deaths occurred. Pre-TAVI echocardiographic findings showed that apical LS was significantly higher in the survival group compared to the all-cause death group (15.1 ± 4.7％ vs. 13.7 ± 4.4 %, p = 0.02). Multivariable Cox proportional hazards analysis, adjusted for body mass index, aortic valve peak velocity, atrial fibrillation, high-sensitivity troponin T, tricuspid regurgitation, demonstrated that apical LS was independently associated with all-cause mortality (hazard ratio: 0.91, 95 % confidence interval: 0.88-0.99, p = 0.02). Time-dependent receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis identified apical LS to discriminate all-cause mortality (area under the curve, 0.69), with the predictive ability peaking within the first two years after TAVI. Kaplan-Meier analysis revealed significantly higher mortality rates in patients with low apical LS group (<15.4 %) (p = 0.01).
measurement of apical LS in patients with AS provides valuable associational prognostic information, even after adjusting for multiple clinical and echocardiographic factors, highlighting its value in enhancing risk stratification for patients undergoing TAVI."
PubMed,aortic stenosis,"A Case of Legionella Pneumonia Suspected as Typical Pneumonia After Lung Cancer Surgery, Diagnosed by a Repeat Urinary Legionella Antigen Test.",Yusuke Nabe; Hiroshi Mizuuchi; Masaaki Inoue; Junichi Yoshida,10.7759/cureus.98196,2025-11,Cureus,"Legionella pneumophila is a leading cause of severe atypical pneumonia and is associated with high mortality when initial treatment is inadequate. The urinary Legionella antigen test serves as a rapid, first-line diagnostic tool; however, early results may be negative, and antigen shedding can be intermittent. In these situations, timely retesting is essential, especially in postoperative or high-risk patients. We report the case of a 74-year-old man, a former smoker with diabetes and moderate aortic stenosis, who underwent thoracoscopic left lower lobectomy and was discharged on postoperative day (POD) six. He developed a fever on POD 27, accompanied by right upper lobe pneumonia. Outpatient urinary antigen tests for pneumococcus and Legionella were negative, and oral garenoxacin was initiated. However, hypoxemia and inflammation worsened, resulting in urgent admission on POD 30. Broad-spectrum β-lactams (sulbactam/ampicillin, followed by piperacillin/tazobactam) were ineffective. Chest CT revealed enlarging infiltrates and a parapneumonic effusion requiring drainage, despite negative pleural fluid cultures. Given the persistent deterioration of the patient's condition, levofloxacin was added, and the urinary Legionella antigen test (R70829, MIZUHO MEDY Co., Ltd., Tosu, Japan) was repeated on hospital day five (POD 35), which returned positive, confirming Legionella pneumonia. Subsequent targeted therapy with azithromycin (days 6-8 and 13-15), alongside levofloxacin, resulted in clinical improvement. Despite complications during the clinical course, including acute kidney injury necessitating two hemodialysis sessions and a creatine kinase peak of 1,563 U/L, the chest drain was removed on day 21, oxygen was discontinued by day 31, and the patient was transferred to long-term care on day 54. The sequence of renal failure preceding creatine kinase elevation suggests direct renal involvement by L. pneumophila rather than primary rhabdomyolysis. Vigilant retesting enabled timely pathogen-directed therapy and a favorable outcome. This case report highlights that a single negative urinary antigen test does not rule out Legionella infection. We accordingly recommend early repeat antigen testing, ideally within one week, for postoperative pneumonia unresponsive to β-lactams, together with prompt macrolide or fluoroquinolone therapy."

Part C, Seminars in medical genetics","Pathologic studies of Myhre syndrome (OMIM 139201) have provided modest insights into this ultra-rare multisystem disorder, with postmortem examinations being scarce. Morbidity is related to severe congenital heart defects, aortic hypoplasia, airway stenosis, constrictive pericarditis, and restrictive cardiomyopathy. We report two detailed autopsies: the first of an 8-year-old female who succumbed to congenital mitral valve disease and restrictive cardiopulmonary complications. Autopsy documented chronic pericarditis and fibrosing pleuritis, diffuse interstitial pulmonary fibrosis, extensive submucosal interstitial fibrosis of the bladder, and nodular medial hypertrophy of the aorta. The second patient was a 20-year-old female with progressive laryngo-tracheal stenosis, interstitial lung disease, pericardial and peritoneal adhesions, and dermal fibrosis. Both patients had ovarian fibrosis with reduced oocytes. Neuropathologic examination revealed brains below expected weight with hypoxic-ischemic injury. The first patient also had scattered intraparenchymal microcalcifications and a known Chiari I malformation, and the second had a thickened calvarium and dura mater and rounded cerebrum (shortened frontal and occipital lobes). These two patients demonstrate the value of postmortem examination to confirm suspected pathology and elucidate new features. The pleiotropy of Myhre syndrome was demonstrated by complex comorbidities and the devastating impact of indiscriminate fibrosis. Counseling regarding the role of postmortem examination should be considered in the palliative care of Myhre syndrome patients and their families."

This study aimed to elucidate the impact of preprocedural AF on clinical outcomes following TAVI in patients with aortic stenosis (AS). We conducted a single-center, retrospective cohort study comprising 297 consecutive AS patients who underwent TAVI (mean age 83 ± 4 years; 69% female). Pre-existing AF was identified in 89 (30%) patients. Patients were stratified into two groups based on the presence or absence of AF, and propensity score matching (PSM) was employed, resulting in 68 matched pairs. The study endpoint was the incidence of net adverse clinical events (NACE) and all-cause mortality. NACE was defined as a composite of all-cause mortality, non-fatal myocardial infarction, non-fatal ischemic stroke, systemic thromboembolism, valve thrombosis, and major bleeding events. These clinical outcomes were analyzed according to the presence and subtype of pre-existing AF and further stratified across body mass index (BMI) categories. To further assess the combined impact of AF and BMI, patients were additionally categorized into four groups according to the presence or absence of AF and low BMI (< 18.5 kg/m2), and multivariable Cox regression analysis was performed across these groups. The median duration of follow-up was 2.3 [1.0-3.7] years. While baseline characteristics, including age and gender, were comparable between groups, patients with pre-existing AF exhibited a higher prevalence of prior heart failure hospitalizations and reduced renal function. There were no statistically significant differences in the incidence of NACE and all-cause mortality between the AF and non-AF groups, both before and after PSM. However, among patients with AF, those with a low BMI < 18.5 kg/m2 experienced a significantly higher rate of adverse clinical events compared to those with normal or high BMI. This was supported by multivariable analysis. Although preprocedural AF was not independently associated with adverse clinical outcomes following TAVI, the coexistence of AF and low BMI was linked to significantly worse prognosis. These findings suggest a potential synergistic effect warranting further investigation and individualized risk stratification."

IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society. Annual International Conference,"Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) represents one of the leading causes of sudden cardiac death (SCD), particularly in the young population, with a risk of approximately 1% per year. So far, no reliable electrocardiogram (ECG) biomarkers have been presented for risk assessment, but ECG in HCM patients are often abnormal due to structural and electrical abnormalities. This study aimed to extract morphological ECG biomarkers to differentiate HCM patients based on their arrhythmic risk levels (15 HCM patients with arrhythmic events vs. 40 HCM control). We extracted ECG features including width, amplitudes, slopes between fiducial points, Hermite transform coefficients, and variational mode decomposition features. Following feature selection using combined metrics, the study population was divided into two groups for each ECG biomarker, with the median value serving as the cutoff point to distinguish between the groups. QRS and T waverelated features effectively separated patients into high and low arrhythmic risk categories. Notably, univariate Cox regression analysis showed that patients having more local QRS optima or highest percentage of negative QRS present the highest risk (p< 0.01 and p< 0.05 respectively). In conclusion, we proposed automatic ECG extracted features that can be used to stratify the risk for arrhythmic events in HCM patients.Clinical Relevance-This study provides novel insights into ECG-based risk stratification for HCM patients, offering potential tools for early identification of individuals at higher risk of cardiac events."

IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society. Annual International Conference,"Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is a complex disease that can be associated with ischemia with no sign of coronary disease. Ischemia seems to result from microcirculatory abnormalities that appear to be modulated by left ventricular outflow tract (LVOT) obstruction. This paper proposes a model-based approach for the analysis of physiological mechanisms that affects coronary circulation in HCM. A novel integrated cardiovascular model, including LVOT obstruction and coronary circulation, was proposed. A sensitivity analysis was applied to identify the most influential parameters on coronary flow both at the macro- and micro- circulatory level. Finally, the proposed model was adapted to two HCM patients (obstructive / non-obstructive) from previous works of the team. Results show that the level of obstruction had a strong influence on coronary flow and the adaptation of the model to HCM patients confirmed the important influence of LVOT obstruction at the microcirculatory level. Despite the difficulty of having direct measures of coronary microcirculation, this works shows that computational models can help in studying the effect of a pathophysiological feature on coronary circulation in the context of HCM."

Among pathogenetic mechanisms associated with DM, increased oxidative stress plays a key role in the valvular degeneration progression. This study aimed to evaluate whether DM coexistence with severe AS is associated with parallel enhancement of oxidative stress in both circulating blood and stenotic valves. We enrolled 70 severe AS patients scheduled for aortic valve replacement, including 40 (57%) with concomitant type 2 DM (AS-DM) and 30 AS patients without type 2 DM (AS-nonDM). We assessed circulating oxidized phospholipids (oxPL), myeloperoxidase (MPO), advanced glycation end products (AGEs), and their soluble receptors (sRAGE). Valvular expression of oxPL and AGEs was determined using immunostaining of aortic valve samples. In the whole group of AS patients (n=70) oxPL, MPO and AGEs levels correlated with HbA1c concentration (r=0.79, p<0.001; r=0.60, p<0.001 and r=0.85, p<0.001, respectively). Similarly, oxPL and MPO were associated with plasma AGEs (r=0.66, p<0.001 and r=0.53, p<0.001). Moreover, serum MPO and oxPL correlated with aortic valve area (AVA; r= -0.49, p<0.001 and r= -0.45, p<0.001). Among 40 AS-DM patients we observed 2.55-fold higher serum oxPL, 1.38-fold higher serum MPO, 2.07-fold higher plasma AGEs and 2.22-fold higher plasma sRAGE compared to AS-nonDM (all p<0.001). In AS-DM group, valvular oxPL and AGEs expression was 1.8-fold and 1.6-fold higher when compared to AS-nonDM patients (all p<0.001). Of major importance, valvular expression of oxPL correlated both with serum oxPL and MPO levels (r=0.72 and r=0.63, respectively; both p<0.001). This study is the first to show that in severe AS patients with concomitant DM, valvular expression of oxPL is markedly higher compared to non-DM patients and associates with their circulating levels. Moreover, enhanced valvular oxidative stress was linked with glycemic status and more severe AS."

This report presents 10 autopsy-confirmed cases of CCOS-related SCD, aiming to illustrate their characteristic manifestations, pathophysiological mechanisms, and key forensic identification criteria. A systematic literature review was conducted to contextualize our findings within existing evidence. Definitive diagnosis of CCOS requires a multidisciplinary approach, integrating death scene investigation, complete autopsy (including whole-heart dissection), histopathological validation (H&E staining), and rigorous exclusion of other causes of death. Quantitative analysis showed 7 cases (70%) had right coronary artery ostial (RCO) stenosis, 1 case (10%) had left coronary artery ostial (LCO) stenosis, and 2 cases (20%) had bilateral stenosis, with 4 cases (40%) presenting obstructive fibrous membranes. This study emphasizes the necessity of a standardized anatomical protocol for coronary ostial assessment, particularly transverse sectioning at 2 mm intervals starting from the aortic sinus. These findings aim to prompt forensic pathologists to incorporate specialized coronary ostial evaluation into routine autopsy procedures, thereby reducing diagnostic omissions in sudden unexpected death investigations."

The objective of this study is to analyze, in older patients with AS undergoing TAVI, the effect of a telematic intervention on the reversal of frailty vs standard of care.
We will be conducting a randomized multicenter study including patients aged ≥ 75 years with severe AS (mean aortic gradient > 40 mmHg, or aortic valve area < 0.8 8 cm2 on echocardiogram) with baseline frailty criteria (Short Physical Performance Battery [SPPB ] < 10 and FRAIL scale ≥ 3) undergoing TAVI. Prior to discharge, patients will be randomized to a) a telematic intervention within the first 3 months (nutritional support plus supervised physical exercise plus health education); or b) standard of care. The primary endpoint will be the percentage of patients with frailty reversal (SPPB ≥ 10) at 3 months. The estimated sample size is 206 patients (103 in each arm).
The hypothesis of this study is that telematic intervention will allow a higher percentage of frailty reversal at 3 months vs standard of care after TAVI.

These parameters need to be considered when cut-off values indicating the need for&#x0D; treatment or even surgery are established. The aim of present work is to study the relation of&#x0D; weight of the heart with age and weight of cadaver.&#x0D; Material and Methods: The study was performed in the Department of Anatomy, Shri Ram&#x0D; Murti Smarak Institute of Medical Sciences, Bareilly on 30 hearts from embalmed cadavers.&#x0D; The hearts were procured from the cadavers available in our department. The heart was&#x0D; thoroughly cleaned and measurements were taken.&#x0D; Results: The mean heart weight was 223.37 ± 57.78 g. Significant relationship between age of&#x0D; the cadaver and weight of the heart (p=0.0004), weight of cadaver and weight of heart&#x0D; (p=0.0001) was observed.&#x0D; Conclusion: The above study provides valuable data of the heart in our geographical location,&#x0D; which may be useful for cardiac surgeons and physicians."

Kinovea, as an accessible motion-analysis software, provides both visual and quantitative feedback. However, its application in supporting technique development among beginner athletes remains insufficiently explored. Aim: This study aims to describe the use of Kinovea in biomechanics training and examine its contribution to the awareness of kinematic characteristics and movement techniques among beginner athletes. Methods: A descriptive qualitative design involved 72 beginner athletes aged 18–25 years selected through purposive sampling. Data were collected over 16 weeks through interviews, field observations, and motion video recordings analyzed using Kinovea. Kinematic data focused on joint angles, stride behavior, and movement phases during walking, running, and the flight phase. Qualitative data were analyzed using content analysis with NVivo 12, while kinematic results were interpreted descriptively to identify performance patterns and areas for technical refinement. Result: Kinematic analysis showed coordinated joint-angle patterns across all phases. Walking analysis identified arm swing angles of 50.9°–58.8° and leg separation angles of 64.3°–67.2°, indicating a stable gait rhythm. The running analysis revealed knee angles of 68.8°–69.8° and elbow angles of 87.6°–89.1°, indicating efficient propulsive mechanics. The flight phase demonstrated knee angles of 81.2°–87.8° and elbow angles of 80.4°–88.3°, suggesting effective momentum use and postural stability. These measurements supported stride-efficiency assessment and technique evaluation. Qualitative findings revealed that Kinovea enabled athletes to interpret movement phases and identify technical inefficiencies through slow-motion and frame-by-frame visualization. Conclusion: Kinovea supports basic motion analysis by providing clear kinematic information and helping beginner athletes observe and refine their movement techniques. The findings also offer practical value for coaches by enabling more precise identification of inefficient patterns and guiding targeted corrections during early-stage training."

Ponych; Б.М. Тодуров,10.31928/3083-7111-2025.3.714,2025-12-03,Cardiac Surgery and Interventional Cardiology,"The aim – to evaluate the clinical outcomes of surgical treatment in patients with combined aortic and mitral valve disease in the setting of concomitant coronary artery disease (CAD), who underwent simultaneous valve replacement and coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG), with analysis of preoperative, intraoperative, and postoperative parameters. Materials and methods. A retrospective analysis of 35 cases of combined surgical interventions (AVR + MVR + CABG), performed at the Heart Institute of the Ministry of Health of Ukraine between 2019 and 2023, was conducted. The study assessed clinical characteristics, echocardiographic findings, intraoperative data, postoperative course, complications, and mortality rates. Risk stratification was performed using EuroSCORE II and the STS Risk Calculator.Results. In patients with severe multivalvular disease (n = 35), mitral regurgitation (100 %) and concomitant heart failure (94.3 %) were predominant. Postoperative improvement of NYHA class was observed in 74.3 % of cases. Mortality rate was 14.3 %, with infectious (51 %) and neurological (39 %) complications being common. Atrial fibrillation was associated with higher mortality. Postoperative echocardiography showed improved hemodynamics. These findings confirm the effectiveness of combined surgical intervention when careful patient selection is ensured.Conclusions. Simultaneous aortic and mitral valve replacement combined with coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) represents a clinically justified surgical strategy for patients with combined valvular pathology and coronary artery disease, including those at intermediate and high risk according to the EuroSCORE II and STS scales. Despite acceptable survival rates, the incidence of postoperative complications remains significant, due to acute kidney injury, stroke, infections, ventricular fibrillation, and the need for reinterventions)."

A 34-year-old woman, in her second pregnancy following a previous abortion, presented at 34 weeks and 5 days of gestation with progressive dyspnea and orthopnea. Echocardiography confirmed severe MS accompanied by pulmonary hypertension and preserved left ventricular systolic function. After multidisciplinary optimization, an elective cesarean delivery was performed under graded epidural anesthesia with incremental dosing of lidocaine and ropivacaine. Beat-to-beat cardiac output monitoring using the MostCare™ PRAM (Pressure Recording Analytical Method) system guided vasopressor titration with phenylephrine, maintaining hemodynamic stability. The patient remained hemodynamically stable throughout the intraoperative and postoperative periods, with no pulmonary edema or arrhythmias, and was discharged on postoperative day four. This case demonstrates that graded epidural anesthesia, when combined with advanced hemodynamic monitoring and collaborative care, represents a safe and effective alternative to general anesthesia in parturients with severe valvular heart disease."

It is a significant cause of sudden cardiac death, particularly in young individuals, often remaining undiagnosed until autopsy. Methods: A systematic review of the literature was conducted following PRISMA guidelines to revisit the main postmortem findings (gross, microscopic, and genetic) useful to perform the postmortem diagnosis of DCM. Scientific databases (PubMed and Scopus) were searched for articles published up to February 2025 describing postmortem findings in individuals diagnosed with DCM. Inclusion criteria were focused on studies reporting macroscopic cardiac findings, and microscopic and genetic variants identified postmortem or in related familial studies. Data were extracted and categorized to identify consistent diagnostic markers and to assess the frequency and relevance of genetic findings in autopsy-confirmed DCM cases. From 2081 initial records, 30 studies met inclusion criteria. Two reviewers independently performed study selection and data extraction, and methodological limitations of the included studies were considered qualitatively to inform the synthesis. Results: Common macroscopic features included increased heart weight (often &gt; 350 g), dilated left or biventricular chambers, and thinning of the ventricular walls. Histologically, the most consistent findings were diffuse interstitial fibrosis, myocyte hypertrophy, and nuclear atypia. Particular attention was given to morphological features essential to distinguish between genetic and nongenetic forms of DCM and, thus, useful to perform a differential diagnosis with disease having a DCM-like pattern. Notably, truncating variants in genes such as TTN, FLNC, DSP, PKP2, and MYH7 were frequently reported, particularly in young decedents with no significant history of cardiac disease. However, only about half of reviewed studies included any form of genetic analysis, reflecting a significant gap in current practice for forensic pathologists. Conclusions: DCM may cause sudden death without prior symptoms, making genetic testing essential to uncover the diagnosis, especially in cases with a negative phenotype. Therefore, molecular autopsy combined with careful macroscopic and microscopic analysis can strengthen the forensic assessment."

Over the past decades, open-heart mitral valve surgery has been the gold-standard intervention for this complex disorder, but in recent years, transcatheter edge-to-edge repair has emerged as a valuable option in selected clinical scenarios. However, a considerable proportion of patients develop recurrent mitral regurgitation during follow-up, leading to a significant increase in morbidity and mortality. In this context, data is limited regarding the optimal approach. This review provides an overview of the current evidence on transcatheter mitral valve intervention therapies for the management of recurrent mitral regurgitation following transcatheter edge-to-edge repair."

Aortic regurgitation (AR) is the predominant valvular lesion. When AR precedes characteristic mucocutaneous symptoms, misdiagnosis and treatment delays often occur. Case Presentation: We, herein, report the case of a 37-year-old male presenting with isolated aortic regurgitation (AR) as the initial manifestation of Behçet's disease (BD). Initial echocardiography revealed severe eccentric AR with left coronary cusp prolapse and a vegetation-like lesion, raising suspicion of infective endocarditis; however, relapsed oral ulcers developed postoperatively, ultimately confirming BD diagnosis. Despite successful aortic valve replacement, delayed diagnosis due to absent early mucocutaneous symptoms contributed to catastrophic prosthetic valve dehiscence with severe paravalvular leak. The patient underwent an emergency Bentall procedure with venoarterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (VAECMO) support but succumbed to cardiogenic shock and multiorgan failure. Pathological analysis demonstrated tissue necrosis with minimal inflammation. Conclusion: Isolated AR may be BD's initial manifestation, preceding classic symptoms by months. Echocardiographic features, including valve prolapse and perivalvular lesions, despite their non-specificity, should prompt screening for BD. Inherent tissue fragility in BD significantly elevates postoperative risks of paravalvular leak and prosthetic valve dehiscence. Early identification, optimal surgical procedure, and timely immunosuppressive therapy are essential to improve the prognosis of cardiac BD."

A systematic review of the guidelines was conducted to inform clinical judgment. The preferred approach for diagnosing and grading MS involves a multimodal strategy that encompasses transthoracic and transesophageal echocardiography, assessment of evolving symptoms, hemodynamic evaluation via cardiac catheterization, and exercise testing. Both guidelines converge on the use of anticoagulation therapy, which has demonstrated efficacy in reducing thromboembolic events associated with rheumatic MS. However, a nuanced difference exists between the guidelines in terms of the criteria for assessing MS severity."

Buriman; Daniel Lighezan,10.3390/jcdd12120468,2025-11-29,Journal of Cardiovascular Development and Disease,"Aortic stenosis (AS), a progressive valvular disease that results in increasing left ventricular (LV) afterload, leads to ventricular dysfunction and heart failure if left untreated. Transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) has emerged as a minimally invasive and effective alternative to surgical replacement, especially in elderly or high-risk patients. Objectives: The present study aims to assess the influence of the tricuspid annular plane systolic excursion (TAPSE)/pulmonary systolic arterial pressure (PASP) ratio on clinical outcomes in patients with aortic stenosis undergoing TAVR and offer valuable insights into patient selection and tailored management strategies for individuals undergoing TAVR. Methods: A retrospective analysis was conducted on 100 patients with AS who underwent TAVR, included in two distinct groups based on their median TAPSE/PASP ratio. Results: Patients were divided according to their median TAPSE/PASP ratio into two groups. Those with lower TAPSE/PASP ratios had a higher incidence of post-procedural atrial fibrillation (AF) (48% vs. 28%, p = 0.0404), lower left-ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) (41.06% vs. 49.50%, p &lt; 0.0001), a more pronounced inflammatory and hematologic response, and longer hospitalization. Receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) analysis demonstrated modest but significant discrimination rather than high sensitivity or specificity for postprocedural arrhythmias, particularly atrial fibrillation. Conclusions: TAPSE/PASP should be regarded as a clinically useful risk-stratification marker in patients with AS undergoing TAVR, enabling the identification of high-risk patients and optimizing peri-procedural management."

According to current ESC guidelines, cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) is a class I recommendation for the initial evaluation of patients with suspected cardiomyopathy, given its ability to provide comprehensive morphological and tissue characterization. CMR, however, may be precluded in patients owing to device incompatibility, claustrophobia, or arrhythmia- and motion-related image degradation. In this context, cardiac computed tomography (CCT), traditionally used for assessing coronary artery disease, has emerged as a valuable alternative. Technological advancements have enabled CCT to deliver not only detailed anatomical information but also functional and tissue-specific insights. The recent consensus document from the European Association of Cardiovascular Imaging underscore the expanding clinical applications of CCT, highlighting its potential role in the diagnostic work-up and phenotypic classification of cardiomyopathies. In this review, we summarize the current evidence supporting the use of CCT in patients with suspected cardiomyopathy, outline its clinical strengths and limitations, and discuss emerging developments such as artificial intelligence and radiomics, which could further enhance its diagnostic and prognostic value.

Kane; Léopold Codjo; C. Konin,10.1177/30494826251399637,2025-11-28,Journal of the Heart Valve Society,"Background Valvular heart diseases are a public health problem in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). However, their epidemiology is understudied as compared to Western countries. The aim of this study was to describe the epidemiological evolution of rheumatic and non-rheumatic heart valve disease (RV and NRVH) from 1990 to 2019 in LMICs. Methods Data on prevalence, incidence, mortality and DALY associated with RVHD and NRVHD were obtained from the Global Burden Disease study from 1990–2019. A comparison analysis of incidence, prevalence, mortality and DALYs was calculated to obtain percentage change for each country. Results A total of 135 LMICs were included, with most located in Africa (40%), followed by Asia, the Americas, and Oceania. The prevalence of RVHD decreased most in low-income countries (–37%), while NRVHD prevalence rose markedly in lower-middle-income countries (+251%). RVHD incidence declined in most LMICs (–7.6%), especially in Eastern Europe, Central Asia, and sub-Saharan Africa. Conversely, NRVHD incidence increased (+16%), particularly in South America, Africa, and South/Southeast Asia. RVHD prevalence showed heterogeneous trends, with declines in Eastern Europe and Latin America but increases in Africa and Asia. An inverse association was found between SDI and RVHD-related DALYs, while no consistent trend was observed for NRVHD. Conclusion The epidemiology of valvular heart disease has shifted markedly since the 1990s, with declining RVHD prevalence but persistently high incidence in many LMICs. NRVHD indicators have been rising, creating a dual burden in resource-limited settings. This underscores the need for intensified research and targeted public health strategies."
