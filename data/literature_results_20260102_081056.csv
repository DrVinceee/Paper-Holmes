PubMed,aortic stenosis,Dual-parameter risk stratification based on device landing zone calcification and aortic annular perimeter for paravalvular regurgitation after self-expanding TAVR.,Jun Shu; Didi Wen; Jingji Xu; Yu Mao; Hui Ma; Jing Zhang; Yao Zhao; Jian Yang; Minwen Zheng,10.1016/j.ejro.2025.100719,2026-06,European journal of radiology open,"The study aimed to identify independent predictors associated with paravalvular regurgitation (PVR) after self-expanding transcatheter aortic valve replacement (SE-TAVR) and to develop a dual-parameter risk stratification model.
This retrospective study enrolled 292 severe aortic stenosis patients underwent SE-TAVR. PVR severity was assessed pre-discharge. Multivariate logistic regression identified independent predictors of mild/moderate PVR, optimal cutoff values for significant anatomical parameters were determined using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis. Patients were subsequently stratified into three risk groups based on these thresholds.
Mild/moderate PVR occurred in 24.0 % of patients. Independent predictors included aortic annular perimeter (OR:1.067, P = 0.015), device landing zone calcific volume (OR:1.006 per 10 mm³, P = 0.025), and presence of sealing skirt (OR:0.412, P = 0.010). The combination of these predictors had a higher discriminative performance (AUC=0.779) than single predictors (P = 0.036, 0.007, and <0.001, respectively), with significant integrated discrimination improvement (integrated discrimination improvement=5.4-6.7 %, P < 0.001). ROC-derived thresholds (device landing zone calcific volume≥1240 mm³ and aortic annular perimeter≥77 mm) stratified patients into three risk groups with progressively increasing PVR incidence: Group A (neither elevate):8.4 %; Group B (either elevated):23.7 %; and Group C (both elevated):48.7 %. Pairwise comparisons confirming differences between Group A vs. B (P = 0.003) and Group B vs. C (P < 0.001). Sealing skirts significantly reduced PVR in Groups A (P = 0.042) but not in Group B and C (P = 0.082 and 0.342).
The dual-parameter model based on device landing zone calcification and aortic annular perimeter significantly enhances PVR risk stratification after SE-TAVR. The dual-threshold model provides a clinically actionable tool for pre-procedural risk stratification and personalized valve selection."

We aimed to evaluate the prognostic value of this RV-PA coupling in patients after TAVR.
RV-PA coupling was defined as the ratio of RV free wall longitudinal strain (RVFWLS) to pulmonary artery systolic pressure (PASP), measured by echocardiography in AS patients undergoing TAVR between April 2012 and November 2022. The endpoints were all cause death, cardiovascular rehospitalization, stroke, and a composite of these.
At a median follow-up time of 3.4 years, 352 (28.8%) patients in 1221 patients had composite clinical events. Patients with higher RVFWLS/PASP ratio were predominantly male, had lower body mass index, more comorbidities, higher Society of Thoracic Surgeons score, more New York Heart Association IV and worse laboratory data, alongside worse cardiac function compared to those with lower RVFWLS/PASP ratio. The fully adjusted multivariable hazard ratios of RVFWLS/PASP ratio and the tertile 3 of RVFWLS/PASP ratio were 2.228 (95% CI, 1.441-3.446) and 2.571 (95% CI, 1.633-4.047). In addition, Kaplan-Meier analyses revealed robust graded association between the RV-PA coupling and clinical outcomes (P <0.001).
The RV-PA coupling (RVFWLS/PASP ratio) is independently and robustly associated with adverse clinical events in patients undergoing TAVR. These data suggest that the RVFWLS/PASP ratio can serve as a risk stratification tool for patient selection and prognostication following TAVR."

This study aimed to evaluate periprocedural and clinical outcomes in patients with large and extra-large annuli undergoing TAVR and to compare results between balloon-expandable (BEVs) and self-expanding valves (SEVs).
This study included patients with severe aortic stenosis (AS) and extra-large annuli who underwent TAVR with either BEVs or SEVs. The primary endpoints were periprocedural and clinical outcomes, including device success, rates of moderate or greater paravalvular leak (PVL), permanent pacemaker (PPM) implantation, new Left bundle branch block (LBBB), stroke, and in-hospital and 1-year mortality. Secondary endpoints included safety outcomes and subgroup analyses comparing outcomes between patients with large (annular perimeter >90 mm and an area >660 mm²) and extra-large annuli (perimeter >96 mm and an area >730 mm²).
A total of 237 patients underwent TAVR, including 160 with BEVs and 77 with SEVs. The mean annular area and perimeter were 737 ± 76 mm² and 96.1 ± 4.1 mm, respectively, with no significant differences between groups. Overall device success was high, though slightly lower in the SEV group (84% vs. 93%, p=0.034), a difference that was no longer statistically significant after multivariate analysis (p=0.234). Moderate or greater PVL occurred more frequently with SEVs (13% vs. 4%, p = 0.016), particularly in patients with extra-large annuli (26% vs. 4%, p = 0.012). One-year mortality was similar between groups (SEV 13% vs. BEV 12%, p = 0.807), and no significant differences were observed in PPM implantation, new LBBB, stroke, or major vascular and bleeding complications.
TAVR is feasible and safe in patients with large and extra-large annuli, with higher rates of moderate or greater paravalvular leak observed in SEV patients with extra-large annuli."

Cases with additional indications or affected nonfirst-degree relative were excluded. Postnatal transthoracic echocardiography (t-Echo) data were reviewed when available. Significant CHD was defined as requiring catheter or surgical intervention in the first year of life.Sixty-five f-Echos were included (mean gestational age: 26.6 ± 3.7 weeks). No significant CHD was identified prenatally. Postnatal t-Echo was performed in 41 (63%) cases, with no significant CHD detected. Two (5%) infants were diagnosed postnatally with BAV, neither requiring intervention during the study interval. Minor findings included one case each of pulmonary valve stenosis and atrial septal defect.In pregnancies with a first-degree relative with BAV and a normal obstetric ultrasound, f-Echo showed no added diagnostic value for detecting significant CHD. Based on the state's birth rate (approximately 35,000/year), BAV prevalence (1-2%), and an average family size of 3.08, an estimated 733 to 1,466 pregnancies annually in Arkansas could qualify for f-Echo under current guidelines. At a cost of $1,000 to 5,000 per study, this translates to an annual healthcare expenditure ranging from $733,000 to 7.33 million. These findings support more targeted screening and the need for multicenter studies. · No significant CHD detected with f-Echo.. · Postnatal t-Echo remains definitive.. · Routine f-Echo may add limited value.. · Cost implications warrant reconsideration."

Performing left atrial appendage closure (LAAC) during TAVI can reduce the risk of thromboembolism while avoiding the need for prolonged anticoagulation.
This single-center study included 5 consecutive patients with severe aortic stenosis and AF who underwent same-session TAVI and LAAC between October 2024 and March 2025. All had contraindications to OAC or high bleeding risk. Procedural details and early outcomes were recorded. Technical success was defined according to Valve Academic Research Consortium-3 (VARC-3) (TAVI) and Munich/The Society for Cardiovascular Angiography & Interventions (SCAI) and the Heart Rhythm Society criteria (LAAC). Continuous variables are presented as mean ± SD or median interquartile range (IQR), and categorical variables as n (%).
Mean age was 75.6 ± 8.4 years; 40% were male. The median Society of Thoracic Surgeons score was 6.0% [IQR 5.5-7.0], median CHA₂DS₂-VA was 4 [4-5], and median hypertension, abnormal renal/liver function, stroke, bleeding history or predisposition, labile INR, elderly, drugs/alcohol concomitantly was 3 [3-4]. All patients received a Meril valve; LAAC devices included Amulet (n = 3) and LAmbre (n = 2). Technical success was achieved in all cases. There were no intra-periprocedural complications, major bleeding (Bleeding Academic Research Consortium ≥3), stroke/transient ischemic attack, or vascular complications. But Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes stage 1 acute kidney injury was observed only in 1 (20%) patient. The median hospital stay was 4 [IQR 3-6] days.
In this study, same-session TAVI and LAAC in AF patients with high bleeding risk were technically feasible and showed an acceptable shortterm safety profile. Larger, prospective studies with longer follow-up are needed to confirm these results."

Cardiovascular interventions,"Heart failure (HF) remains a significant burden following transcatheter aortic valve replacement, adversely impacting survival and quality of life. Identification of patients who may benefit from closer monitoring or adjunctive medical therapy to reduce the risk of HF is an unmet need. The objective of this study was to develop and internally validate a clinical prediction model to determine the 1-year risk of HF hospitalization or death after transcatheter aortic valve replacement.
Using the Society of Thoracic Surgeons/American College of Cardiology Transcatheter Valve Therapy Registry, we analyzed patients who underwent successful transcatheter aortic valve replacement for aortic stenosis and survived to discharge between 2016 and 2019. Covariates were selected based on expert opinion and prior literature. A hierarchical cumulative odds regression model was used to predict a composite outcome of (1) all-cause death, (2) ≥2 HF readmissions, or (3) 1 HF readmission at 1 year.
Among 78 384 patients (median age, 82 years; 45.6% female), 17.4% experienced the composite outcome, including death (10.9%), ≥2 HF readmissions (1.6%), and 1 HF readmission (4.9%). The model demonstrated good discrimination (C statistic, 0.753 derivation and 0.747 validation) and excellent calibration. Among 1-year survivors, performance in predicting HF readmission as an isolated outcome was similar (C statistic, 0.753). A simplified model, including the top 12 variables from the full model, maintained comparable performance (C statistics, 0.74-0.75).
This prediction model effectively stratifies post-transcatheter aortic valve replacement patients by risk of death or HF readmission, supporting its use to guide clinical surveillance and clinical trial enrollment for adjunctive medical therapies aimed at mitigating this risk."

Cardiovascular imaging,"Accurate aortic stenosis (AS) phenotyping requires multimodality imaging which has limited availability. The digital aortic stenosis severity index (DASSi), an AI biomarker of AS-related remodeling on single-view 2-dimensional echocardiography, predicts AS progression independent of Doppler measurements. We sought to evaluate the ability of DASSi to define personalized AS progression profiles and to validate its performance as a scalable alternative to multimodality imaging features of functional, structural, and biological AS severity.
In the SALTIRE-2 trial (Study Investigating the Effect of Drugs Used to Treat Osteoporosis on the Progression of Calcific Aortic Stenosis 2) of participants with mild or moderate AS, we performed blinded DASSi measurements (probability of severe AS, 0-1) on baseline transthoracic echocardiograms. We evaluated the association between baseline DASSi and (1) disease severity by hemodynamic (peak aortic valve velocity), structural (computed tomography-derived aortic valve calcium score), and biological features ([18F]sodium fluoride uptake on positron emission tomography-computed tomography); (2) longitudinal disease progression (change in peak aortic valve velocity and aortic valve calcium score); and (3) incident aortic valve replacement. We used generalized linear mixed or Cox models adjusted for risk factors and aortic valve area.
We analyzed 134 participants (72 [IQR, 69-78] years; 27 [20.1%] women) with a mean baseline DASSi of 0.51 (SD, 0.19). DASSi was independently associated with cross-sectional disease severity: each SD increase was associated with higher peak aortic valve velocity (+0.21 [95% CI, 0.12-0.30] m/s), aortic valve calcium score (+284 [95% CI, 101-467] Agatston units), and [18F]sodium fluoride target-to-background ratiomax (+0.17 [95% CI, 0.04-0.31]). Higher DASSi was also associated with disease progression by Doppler (peak aortic valve velocity) and computed tomography (aortic valve calcium score) at 24 months (P interaction for DASSi × time<0.001), and future aortic valve replacement (75 events over 5.5 [IQR, 2.4-7.2] years, adjusted HR, 1.42 [95% CI, 1.11-1.84] per SD).
DASSi is associated with functional, structural and biological features of AS severity and predicts disease progression and adverse outcomes. DASSi-enhanced echocardiography may provide an accessible alternative to multimodality AS imaging and serve as a predictive enrichment biomarker in clinical trials.

Increasingly, this repair is recognized as an effective and durable surgical approach. The consequences of postoperative leaflet geometry in this repair are relatively unstudied, especially compared with current understanding of optimal geometry for a trileaflet valve. In this work, a computational approach was systematically applied to study the effect of changes in leaflet geometric height in symmetric bicuspidization repair.
Eight model valves with 4 geometric heights spanning a range of typically observed values were constructed at 2 free-edge lengths. Heights varied when loaded in diastole from approximately one-half the annular diameter to just below the annular diameter. Fluid-structure interaction simulations were performed to study the coupled dynamics of the valve and blood. Models were evaluated for stenosis, regurgitation, hemodynamics, mechanics, and diastolic gross morphology.
Cases with loaded geometric height 0.64 to 0.79 times the annular diameter showed the overall best performance, with a coaptation reserve of 4 to 7 mm. Cases with geometric height approximately one-half the annular diameter showed severe regurgitation. Cases with geometric height 0.86 to 0.95 times the annular diameter showed less ""crisp"" coaptation alignment and the appearance of excessive leaflet material.
The intermediate range of geometric height appeared best, with insufficient height causing regurgitation. More geometric height was not always clearly better, as excessively tall leaflets showed less alignment in the coaptation regions."

We aimed to analyze how age, diagnosis, autograft support, and Konno-incision impact outcome.
Patients (0-18 years) undergoing primary/secondary Ross/Ross-Konno from August 1993 to November 2023 were included. Mortality, autograft replacement rate, and greater than mild autograft regurgitation were analyzed in the full cohort and subgroups (age, diagnosis, primary/secondary Ross, Ross/Ross-Konno, autograft support) using time-to-event methods. Propensity-score matching was performed to adjust for differences in baseline characteristics of patients undergoing supported/nonsupported Ross procedures.
In total, 196 patients underwent Ross/Ross-Konno procedures (N = 117/79; 60/40%) with median age/weight of 9.4 years [interquartile range, 3.4-14.1 years]/31.7 kg [12.9-57 kg] and median follow-up of 8.8 years [1.6-14.8 years]. Twenty-year freedom from death, autograft replacement rate, and rate of greater than mild autograft regurgitation was 88.7% (95% confidence interval, 79.8%-93.8%), 13.2% (7.1%-24.7%), and 17.7% (11.3%-27.8%), respectively. Lowest 20-year freedom from death was observed among neonates/infants 47.6% (7.5%-80.8%)/58.9% (34.5%-76.8%) compared with older patients (97.6%; 90.6%-99.4%, P < .001). In total, 83.3% of all deceased neonates/infants had associated mitral valve disease. Patients with isolated aortic valve stenosis and/or Konno-incision were at greater mortality risk (P = .02). 20-year autograft replacement rate was highest among adolescents (12-18 years): 30.7% (15.5-60.9), without statistical significance (P = .08), and greater in secondary Ross: 23.8% (11.4-49.7, P = .03). Matched pairs (supported vs nonsupported Ross, n = 30 each) did not show differences in primary outcomes.
The Ross procedure in pediatric patients demonstrated good long-term outcomes. Mortality risk is greater in neonates/infants and patients with isolated aortic stenosis. Adolescent patients/patients undergoing secondary Ross procedures were associated with greater autograft replacement rates."

The Osaka Prognostic Score (OPS), incorporating CRP, albumin, and lymphocyte count, may address this gap. We aimed to evaluate the prognostic value of OPS for predicting in-hospital and one-year all-cause mortality after TAVI. Materials and Methods: In this retrospective single-center cohort study, 244 patients who underwent transfemoral TAVI between December 2022 and January 2024 were analyzed. OPS was calculated at baseline (range: 0-3), and its prognostic value for in-hospital and one-year all-cause mortality was evaluated using multivariable Cox regression, ROC analysis, and restricted cubic spline (RCS) modeling. Results: In-hospital and one-year mortality rates were 11.5% and 21.7%, respectively. Higher OPS scores were significantly associated with mortality in both periods. OPS independently predicted in-hospital mortality (HR: 2.018; 95% CI: 1.632-2.521; p = 0.017) and one-year mortality (HR: 2.125; 95% CI: 1.300-3.473; p = 0.003). ROC analysis yielded AUC values of 0.776 and 0.859 for in-hospital and one-year mortality, respectively. Kaplan-Meier curves revealed significantly reduced survival in patients with higher OPS (log-rank p < 0.001), and RCS analysis demonstrated a significant nonlinear association between increasing OPS values and mortality risk (p < 0.001). Conclusions: OPS is a simple, cost-effective, and biologically relevant prognostic index that independently predicts both in-hospital and one-year mortality following TAVI. By integrating markers of inflammation, nutrition, and immune competence, OPS may offer additional value in risk stratification and support clinical decision-making in this high-risk population."

Conventional imaging modalities such as ultrasound and computed tomography angiography (CTA) have limited capacity to identify histopathological features of plaque instability, including fibrous cap rupture, lipid-rich necrotic core, and intraplaque hemorrhage. Artificial intelligence (AI) techniques-particularly deep learning (DL) and radiomics-have recently emerged as valuable adjuncts to standard imaging, achieving AUC values of 0.83-0.99 across modalities in identifying vulnerable plaques. This scoping review summarizes the available evidence on the application of AI in the detection and assessment of vulnerable carotid plaques. Methods: A systematic search of the English-language literature was conducted in MEDLINE, SCOPUS, and CENTRAL from 2000 to 30 June 2025, following the PRISMA-ScR framework. Eligible studies applied AI-based approaches (machine learning, deep learning, or radiomics) to evaluate carotid plaque vulnerability using ultrasound, CTA, or MRI. Extracted outcomes included diagnostic performance, correlation with histopathology or neurological events, and predictive modeling for stroke risk. Results: Of 201 records screened, 12 studies met inclusion criteria (ultrasound = 6; CTA = 4; high-resolution MRI = 2; publication years 2021-2025). All reported receiver operating characteristic area-under-the-curve (ROC-AUC) values for endpoints related to plaque vulnerability (symptomatic versus asymptomatic status, presence of intraplaque hemorrhage or lipid-rich necrotic core, fibrous-cap surrogates, and, less frequently, short-term cerebrovascular events). For ultrasound, contrast-enhanced videomics achieved an AUC of 0.87 (10 centers; n = 205), B-mode texture/radiomics reached 0.87 (n = 150), and segmentation-assisted models 0.827 (n = 202); other ultrasound models reported AUCs of 0.88-0.91. For CTA, a symptomatic-plaque machine-learning model yielded AUC 0.89 ( n = 106); a perivascular-adipose-tissue (PVAT) radiomics nomogram achieved AUC 0.836 on external validation; a histology-referenced pilot attained AUC 0.987; and one mild-stenosis TIA model reported ROC performance. For high-resolution MRI (HR-MRI), radiomics-based models showed AUC 0.835-0.864 in single-modality cohorts and up to 0.984 with multi-contrast inputs. Across modalities, AUC ranges were: ultrasound 0.827-0.91, CTA 0.836-0.987 (external 0.836), and HR-MRI 0.835-0.984. Only two out of twelve studies performed external validation; calibration and decision-curve analyses were rarely provided, and most cohorts were single-center, limiting generalizability. Conclusions: AI demonstrates strong potential as a complementary tool for evaluating carotid plaque vulnerability, with high diagnostic performance across imaging modalities. Reported AUCs ranged from 0.83 to 0.99 based primarily on internal or hold-out validation, representing the upper bound of theoretical rather than real-world performance. Nonetheless, large prospective multicenter studies with standardized protocols, histopathological correlation, and external validation are required before clinical integration into stroke prevention pathways."

This effect is exacerbated in the presence of coronary disease (CAD). Treatment with transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) may promote reversal of these pathophysiological conditions.
We performed multimodality assessment of cardiac physiology in patients with AS and concurrent CAD requiring percutaneous coronary intervention, prior to and 6 months after undergoing TAVI. Techniques include: coronary angiography and bolus thermodilution-derived indices of microvascular function (coronary flow reserve (CFR); index of microcirculatory resistance (IMR)); stress perfusion cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) imaging, which was used to measure changes in global myocardial blood flow (MBF) and left ventricular mass (LVM), and computed resting and hyperaemic vessel specific absolute coronary flow (aCBF) and microvascular resistance (MVR) using a computational model of coronary physiology.
Data were obtained for seven patients (10 vessels). CFR increased from 1.53 (1.2-1.7) to 2.35 (2.0-2.7) (p=0.037) 6 months post-TAVI. There was a 33% reduction in resting aCBF from 218 mL/min to 146 mL/min (p=0.004). On CMR, resting MBF fell 37% from 3.0±0.98 mL/min/g to 1.9±0.7 mL/min/g (p=0.033) and stress MBF fell 25% from 3.6±0.57 mL/min/g to 2.7±0.7 mL/min/g (p=0.004). Indexed LVM regressed from 79±14 g/m2 to 71±16 g/m2 (p=0.006). MVR remained unchanged.
CFR increased following TAVI. The mechanism for this was a significant reduction in resting coronary blood flow measured with CMR and modelled computationally. The unchanged MVR and IMR suggest that resting blood flow reduces due to reduced myocardial demand and myocardial remodelling, rather than changes in resistance."

Surgical aortic valve replacement remains the standard treatment but is often deferred due to perceived high surgical risk and frailty, leaving nearly one‑third of patients with severe AR untreated. Transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) offers a less invasive alternative, but off-label use of transcatheter valves designed for aortic stenosis has been limited by anchoring difficulties, valve embolization, and residual regurgitation. Dedicated devices have addressed these challenges with tailored anchoring mechanisms and demonstrated improved procedural success. This case-based review explores the evolving role of TAVR for AR through three patient vignettes that highlight practical considerations for device selection, anchoring strategies, and complication management. While outcomes with dedicated systems are encouraging, further research should establish TAVR in AR treatment. In parallel, device iterations are required to curtail procedure-induced conduction disturbances and broaden anatomical eligibility."

In fact, AVA_CT overestimates the AVA, requiring a higher threshold for defining severe aortic stenosis [AS] (<1.2 cm2). This phenomenon may be attributed to differences in fluid flow dynamics between circular (assumed by echocardiography) and elliptical conduits.
Demonstrate the differences between the calculated AVA before and after implementing a mathematical correction factor for flow in a non-circular conduit.
662 patients with severe AS who underwent aortic valve replacement between 06/2021 and 07/2023. AVA calculated using the continuity equation with both echocardiography and CT data. A correction factor (CF) for elliptical flow was applied per patient.
AVA_CT was significantly higher than AVA_Echo, showing a 23 % increase. After correcting for the elliptical shape of the LVOT, AVA_CT-corrected was lower and closer to AVA_Echo (mean absolute difference of 0.06 cm2) and had superior correlation with invasive measurement. Several patients were reclassified from severe to moderate AS when using AVA_CT; however, applying the correction factor significantly reduced the reclassification.
Incorporating a correction factor for the elliptical geometry of the LVOT improves the accuracy of AVA estimation. The corrected AVA demonstrates better agreement with echocardiographic measurements and reduces the overestimation inherent in CT-based calculations. This approach minimizes discrepancies in patientclassification across AS severity categories."

However, long-term data are limited. This study aimed to evaluate 5-year echocardiographic and clinical outcomes of SEVs versus BEVs in patients with small aortic annulus underwent transcatheter aortic valve replacement.
We analyzed RESOLVE registry patients who underwent transcatheter aortic valve replacement at Cedars-Sinai between 2015 and 2020. Patients with a small aortic annulus (<430 mm2 by computed tomography) were included and followed for up to 5 years. The primary outcome was a composite of all-cause mortality, stroke, or heart failure hospitalization. Secondary outcomes included myocardial infarction, pacemaker implantation, aortic valve reintervention, and structural bioprosthetic valve dysfunction.
Among 1392 transcatheter aortic valve replacement recipients, 423 (78 SEVs, 345 BEVs) met the small annulus criteria. SEVs were associated with lower transvalvular gradients and larger indexed effective orifice area at discharge and 1 year (P<0.001). Moderate-to-severe paravalvular leak was more frequent with SEVs at 30 days (7.7% versus 1.5%, P<0.001), as was permanent pacemaker implantation (17.9% versus 6.1%, P<0.001). At 5 years, the primary outcome did not differ significantly (hazard ratio, 1.21; 95% CI, 0.81-1.82; P<0.33). All-cause mortality, stroke, heart failure hospitalization, structural bioprosthetic valve dysfunction, and reintervention rates were similar between groups.
Although SEVs provide better hemodynamic performance in patients with severe aortic stenosis and small annuli, this advantage did not translate into improved survival or reduced cardiovascular events at 5 years."

The objective of this substudy was to compare echocardiographic findings in women with severe aortic stenosis following surgical aortic valve replacement or TAVI.
At 48 European centers, 443 women underwent randomization 1:1, and 420 were treated as randomized. Echocardiograms were available in 356 patients and were analyzed by a core laboratory.
Rates of or greater moderate paravalvular regurgitation was low (<1%) and similar between groups. At 30 days, TAVI was associated with higher mean transprosthetic gradient and smaller aortic valve area, but the rate of severe patient-prosthesis mismatch (3.0 versus 2.6%; P=1) was low and not different between groups. Valve hemodynamics were stable at 1 year. The rate of residual left ventricular hypertrophy (45.3 versus 28.6%; P=0.004) at 1 year was significantly higher with TAVI, whereas the rate of right ventricular systolic dysfunction (14.5 versus 40.7%; P<0.001) and evolution of cardiac damage stage (improved in 21.8 versus 18.1%; worsened in 16.8 versus 47.0%; P=0.001) were better with TAVI.
Among women with severe aortic stenosis, both TAVI and surgical aortic valve replacement achieve excellent valve hemodynamic results with low and similar rates of moderate or greater paravalvular regurgitation or severe patient-prosthesis mismatch. Surgical aortic valve replacement was associated with lower gradients and more pronounced regression of left ventricular hypertrophy, whereas TAVI was associated with better right ventricular systolic function and evolution of cardiac damage stage.

Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement (TAVR) offers a minimally invasive alternative to Surgical Aortic Valve Replacement (SAVR), particularly for high-risk patients. However, TAVR adoption and outcomes in Japan remain understudied due to limited national database analyses and differences in patient demographics compared to major international trials. We conducted a retrospective cohort study of aortic valve replacement (AVR) procedures from 2014 to 2021 using the National Healthcare Reimbursement database. In total, 103,076 cases were analyzed, with 33,881 undergoing TAVR and 31,337 undergoing SAVR for aortic stenosis. TAVR patients were older (median age 85 vs. 76 years, p < 0.0001) and more often female (66.7% vs. 51.4%, p < 0.0001). TAVR was associated with lower in-hospital mortality (0.88% vs. 2.4%, p < 0.0001), shorter hospital stays (14 vs. 24 days, p < 0.0001), but significantly higher medical costs (¥5,303,722 vs. ¥3,945,622, p < 0.0001). Among patients younger than 75 years, no significant difference in mortality was observed. In this nationwide administrative database, TAVR was associated with lower in-hospital mortality and shorter hospital stays compared to SAVR, though at a higher cost. While patient backgrounds and clinical risks could not be fully adjusted due to data limitations, the observed differences in in-hospital outcomes between TAVR and SAVR reflect real-world practice patterns. These findings should be interpreted as descriptive, not causal. The absence of a mortality difference in patients under 75 years highlights the need for further evaluation of TAVR's long-term effectiveness and cost-efficiency in younger populations."

The advent of transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) has revolutionized the treatment of patients previously considered ineligible for surgical aortic valve replacement (SAVR). TAVR provides a relatively safe intervention that leads to improvements in survival, symptoms, and functional status within months of implantation. A major complication following TAVR is the occurrence of paravalvular leaks (PVLs), which have been associated with increased mortality and higher rates of heart failure-related hospitalizations. PVLs refer to abnormal blood flow between the implanted valve and the aortic wall, which can compromise the functionality of the device. Careful pre-procedural planning enables the identification of patients at higher risk for PVL development. Although the incidence of PVLs has decreased with the introduction of newer-generation transcatheter valves, the condition remains clinically relevant. Due to the complex anatomy of the aortic valve apparatus and interference from the prosthetic frame, accurate evaluation of PVLs requires a multimodal diagnostic approach. Current evidence on PVL management is limited. In most cases, a conservative approach is adopted, while interventional strategies (such as pre- and post-dilatation, percutaneous PVL closure, and TAVR-in-TAVR) are reserved for selected patients. We performed a systematic literature review to summarize the incidence, predictors, diagnostic techniques, and management strategies of PVLs following TAVR."

With a focus on the prevalent psychological complications following the onset of this condition, this study aimed to explore the correlation between antenatal depression and Corona disease anxiety, personality traits, and postpartum depression during the COVID-19 pandemic.                                                           Materials and Methods:                     This cross-sectional descriptive-analytical study investigated women receiving care at health centers affiliated with Kerman University of Medical Sciences during the last month of their pregnancy and the postpartum period in 2022. Following the acquisition of informed consent, participants were assessed using various measures, including demographic and obstetric information, the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale, the Corona Disease Anxiety Scale (CDAS), and the NEO Personality Inventory-Revised during their third trimester of pregnancy. The same group of participants completed the Edinburgh Depression Scale and the Corona Disease Anxiety Scale (CDAS) 4-6 weeks after childbirth.                                                           Results and Discussion:                     There was a significant correlation between family income, unwanted pregnancy as perceived by both the mother and father, and antenatal depression. Additionally, marital satisfaction played a significant role in postpartum depression. Furthermore, antenatal depression was significantly associated with neuroticism, agreeableness, and physical symptoms related to Corona disease anxiety. Personality traits, with the exception of extroversion and conscientiousness, and various domains of Corona disease anxiety, excluding psychological symptoms, were also significantly associated with postpartum depression.                                                           Conclusion:                     During pandemics or epidemics, such as the COVID-19 outbreak, experiencing mental distress during pregnancy can contribute to mental health issues during the postpartum period. This risk is particularly true in individuals with unique personality traits, emphasizing the need for increased focus on mental health within prenatal care during these crises."

Method:                     This cross-sectional study was conducted in Kerman, Iran. Data were collected from patients who visited Afzalipour Hospital in Kerman more than twice during the COVID-19 epidemic from the end of February 2020 to March 21, 2021. We conducted two key analyses: 1. Mixed effect logistic regression was used to check the relationship between the variables and COVID-19 severity. 2. Mixed effect linear regression was used to check the relationship between the variables and the length of stay in the hospital.                                                           Results:                     The findings indicated that the most important risk factors for the severity of COVID-19 were heart diseases (OR=1.67,95%CI:1.20-2.30), increasing age (OR=2.23 for age&gt;54, 95%CI:1.70- 2.90), male gender (OR=1.47,95%CI:1.10-1.96), respiratory diseases other than asthma, and frequency of admission (OR=1.60,95%CI:1.20-2.15). All patients who underwent readmission experienced a shorter duration of hospitalization during their subsequent admission (OR=0.94,95%CI:0.91,0.96) and had a higher mortality rate (30% within 14 days, 26.6% between 14-90 days). Patients readmitted at intervals of 14-90 days and greater than 90 days exhibited lower disease severity compared to those readmitted within the 0-14 day period.                                                           Conclusion:                     Examining readmissions, the severity of COVID-19, and the length of hospital stay in affected patients are important factors for planning and allocating resources for COVID-19 management and treatment. These factors can help policymakers develop effective clinical guidelines for hospitalization or outpatient treatment of COVID-19 patients and contribute to reducing the burden of disease in the community."

Kinovea, as an accessible motion-analysis software, provides both visual and quantitative feedback. However, its application in supporting technique development among beginner athletes remains insufficiently explored. Aim: This study aims to describe the use of Kinovea in biomechanics training and examine its contribution to the awareness of kinematic characteristics and movement techniques among beginner athletes. Methods: A descriptive qualitative design involved 72 beginner athletes aged 18–25 years selected through purposive sampling. Data were collected over 16 weeks through interviews, field observations, and motion video recordings analyzed using Kinovea. Kinematic data focused on joint angles, stride behavior, and movement phases during walking, running, and the flight phase. Qualitative data were analyzed using content analysis with NVivo 12, while kinematic results were interpreted descriptively to identify performance patterns and areas for technical refinement. Result: Kinematic analysis showed coordinated joint-angle patterns across all phases. Walking analysis identified arm swing angles of 50.9°–58.8° and leg separation angles of 64.3°–67.2°, indicating a stable gait rhythm. The running analysis revealed knee angles of 68.8°–69.8° and elbow angles of 87.6°–89.1°, indicating efficient propulsive mechanics. The flight phase demonstrated knee angles of 81.2°–87.8° and elbow angles of 80.4°–88.3°, suggesting effective momentum use and postural stability. These measurements supported stride-efficiency assessment and technique evaluation. Qualitative findings revealed that Kinovea enabled athletes to interpret movement phases and identify technical inefficiencies through slow-motion and frame-by-frame visualization. Conclusion: Kinovea supports basic motion analysis by providing clear kinematic information and helping beginner athletes observe and refine their movement techniques. The findings also offer practical value for coaches by enabling more precise identification of inefficient patterns and guiding targeted corrections during early-stage training."

The patient underwent mitral valve posterior leaflet repair and annuloplasty. During the operation, a ""mirror inversion"" of the equipment and surgery team position was carried out. The special feature of the operation was due to the fact that the aorta and great vessels in the wound were mirror-image. The postoperative period proceeded without complications. Being aware of the patient's dextrocardia and hence organizing the surgical procedure appropriately, we could achieve good results in radical surgery for valvular heart disease."
OpenAlex,valvular heart disease,Surviving The Odds: A Rare Case of Untreated Transposition Of The Great Arteries In Adulthood With Neurological Manifestations,Sristi Chakraborty; Monika Jawanjal,10.5195/ijms.2025.4022,2025-12-31,International Journal of Medical Students,"Background: Dextro- transposition of the great arteries (dTGA) is a very rare congenital cardiac anomaly with an incidence of 0.02-0.05% that usually results in 90% infantile mortality, without surgical correction. Simultaneous interposition with other anomalies like atrial septal defect (ASD), ventricular septal defect (VSD), can enable survival beyond infancy, in some instances. However, long-term survival into adulthood remains exceptionally uncommon, especially when complicated with brain abscess- a known but serious complication of cyanotic CHD. The Case: We present a case of Cyanotic congenital heart disease with d-TGA, VSD, ASD, dextro-cardia, complicated by a cerebral abscess. A 28-year-old male presented with two episodes of focal seizures and one episode of loss of consciousness. The patient was previously diagnosed with cyanotic congenital heart disease at age 7 months, but chose not to opt for surgical intervention as there was no delay in developmental &amp; intellectual milestones. Since then, he had multiple episodes of deepening of cyanosis with palpitations &amp; giddiness, which were subsequently managed by blood letting &amp; incomplete staged surgery. Upon arrival at our hospital, he developed weakness over left-half of his body, which resolved spontaneously. On examination he was conscious and oriented. He also had, prominent bilateral EJV with central cyanosis and Grade 2 clubbing. CVS examination revealed Grade III mid-systolic murmur all over the precordium and apex beat at right sixth intercostal space along mid-clavicular line. CNS examination revealed no focal neurological deficit. All other systems were unremarkable. Echocardiography and cardiac catheterization confirmed: Situs solitus with dextrocardia Large ASD and VSD with common atrium Pulmonary artery &amp; aorta arising parallelly (dTGA) Severe valvular and infundibular pulmonary stenosis (PS) Hypoplastic right ventricle and normal left ventricular function MRI brain revealed a right parietal lobe cerebral abscess. Blood and urine cultures were sterile. The patient was deemed unfit for neurosurgical drainage due to high cardiac risk. He was treated with IV vancomycin, ceftriaxone, and metronidazole for 6 weeks. He showed significant clinical improvement and was discharged hemodynamically stable. Two years later, he successfully underwent Bidirectional Glenn → Fontan procedure with PA banding and atrial septectomy. The patient remains alive &amp; clinically stable till date and continues to come for periodic cardiology follow-up and has had no recurrence of cardiovascular or neurological complications. Conclusion: In the present case, the VSD and atrial septal defect served as effective admixture lesions, permitting intermixing of systemic and pulmonary circulation, thereby maintaining some degree of oxygen saturation. Severe pulmonary limited pulmonary overcirculation, protecting the pulmonary vasculature and enabled long-term survival. However, long-standing right-to-left shunting predisposes to cerebral abscess and stroke, due to paradoxical embolization and impaired immune function. This case underscores the interplay of admixture lesions (VSD, ASD), protective pulmonary stenosis, leading to survival into adulthood in unoperated d-TGA."

Renal infarction is rare but may be the first clue. A previously healthy 32-yearold woman had intermittent fever for six weeks and sudden right-sided flank pain for two days. Examination revealed a holosystolic murmur and right costovertebral angle tenderness. Investigations showed raised inflammatory markers and a positive rheumatoid factor, while repeated blood cultures were negative. Echocardiography showed severe mitral regurgitation without visiblevegetations, and computed tomography angiography confirmed right renal infarction. Using modified Duke criteria, the diagnosis was made and empiric intravenous vancomycin and ceftriaxone were started. Despite intensive care and aggressive therapy, she deteriorated and died from refractory heart failure due to severe valvular dysfunction. This case shows the disease can be insidious even in low-risk patients, stressing early suspicion, multidisciplinary care, and timely surgical evaluation when appropriate."
OpenAlex,valvular heart disease,Evaluation and Optimization of INR Goals in Patients With Mechanical Aortic Valves in a Pharmacist-Run Clinic: An Anticoagulation Stewardship Initiative,Barbara Wang; Madison Hubert; Malgorzata Symons; Stacey Cohen Kaplon,10.1177/10600280251399028,2025-12-30,Annals of Pharmacotherapy,"Background: Patients with a mechanical aortic valve replacement (AVR) require lifelong anticoagulation with warfarin. International normalized ratio (INR) goals for mechanical AVRs can change throughout treatment as risk factors change. Appropriate INR goal selection is crucial as goals that stray from evidence-based recommendations can lead to increased risk of bleeding, thrombosis or unnecessary monitoring. Objective: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the appropriateness of INR goals in patients with mechanical AVRs and identify opportunities for pharmacist-led intervention. Methods: A cross-sectional quality improvement study was conducted at a safety net academic medical center’s outpatient anticoagulation clinic. This quality improvement project was not formally supervised by the Institutional Review Board per their policies. Adult patients with isolated mechanical AVR actively managed on warfarin were included. Pharmacists determined whether INR goals were justified by clinical context and American and European valvular heart disease guidelines. When goals lacked clear justification, pharmacists contacted referring providers to recommend INR goal adjustment. Results: Of 100 identified patients, 81 met eligibility criteria including 24 (29.6%) with On-X valves and 57 (70.4%) with alternative mechanical AVRs. Nearly one-third of patients (23, 29.3%) had INR goals inconsistent with current guidelines. Pharmacist-led outreach resulted in 20 accepted recommendations (87.0%), representing 24.7% of the study population. On-X valve recommendations primarily involved reducing INR targets to 1.5 to 2.0 for patients at least 3 months postsurgery without other risk factors that would constitute a higher INR goal. The most common alternative mechanical valve interventions included increasing INR goals to 2.5 to 3.5 in those with thromboembolic risk factors and decreasing INR goals to 2.0 to 3.0 due to absence of thromboembolic risk factors. Conclusion and Relevance: This stewardship initiative highlights the need for periodic INR goal review, as risk factors in patients with mechanical AVRs can change over time."

The reported incidence is 6–10 per 1 000 live births. Comorbid connective tissue dysplasia (CTD) significantly influences the clinical course of CHD, contributing to structural weakness of cardiac and vascular tissues, elevated risk of postoperative complications, and poorer long-term outcomes. Objective. To synthesise current evidence regarding the clinical features, complications, and management of congenital heart disease in children with concomitant connective tissue dysplasia; to identify key pathophysiological mechanisms and highlight promising diagnostic and therapeutic strategies. Materials and methods. This review analyses global trends in the association between CHD and CTD in the paediatric population. Scientific literature indexed in PubMed, ScienceDirect, and Google Scholar from 2017 to 2024 was systematically evaluated. Results. Current research indicates that molecular alterations in connective tissue components—particularly fibrillin, collagen, and transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) receptors—impair myocardial and vascular remodelling, thereby increasing susceptibility of valves and arterial walls to haemodynamic stress. Children with CTD frequently exhibit valve prolapse with regurgitation, aortic dilatation, aneurysm formation, vascular dissection, and heightened risk of perioperative haemorrhage and infection. These patients are more likely to require repeat surgical procedures and demonstrate delayed wound healing. Well-characterised syndromes—including Marfan, Loeys–Dietz, and Ehlers–Danlos—demonstrate unequivocal cardiovascular involvement. Optimal management mandates a multidisciplinary strategy encompassing early recognition of phenotypic features, comprehensive imaging (echocardiography, cardiac magnetic resonance imaging, angiography), and targeted genetic testing. Regular surveillance of aortic dimensions and valvular function, judicious timing of interventions, and appropriate pharmacological prophylaxis are critical to mitigating severe complications. Conclusions. Connective tissue dysplasia constitutes a significant comorbidity that exacerbates the natural history of congenital heart disease, increases surgical risk, and necessitates individualised therapeutic planning. Phenotypic signs of CTD must be actively sought and integrated into preoperative assessment and surgical decision-making. A coordinated, multidisciplinary approach—supported by advanced imaging, genetic counselling, and longitudinal follow-up—is essential for risk reduction and improved long-term prognosis. Further research into the molecular genetics and pathogenesis of CTD holds promise for early risk stratification and personalised management in children with CHD."

Traditional surgical repair remains the gold standard, but high-risk patients often require less invasive alternatives. Aim: To review catheter-based interventions for MR, focusing on nursing care, anatomical considerations, procedural techniques, and clinical outcomes. Methods: This narrative review synthesizes evidence from pivotal trials (EVEREST I &amp; II, COAPT) and current guidelines (ACC/AHA, ESC/EACTS), emphasizing anatomical prerequisites, device selection, procedural workflow, and complication management. Results: Transcatheter edge-to-edge repair (TEER), modeled on the Alfieri stitch, has emerged as the most validated percutaneous approach. Favorable anatomy includes adequate leaflet length, central jet location, and mitral valve area &gt;4 cm². Technological advances (MitraClip G4, PASCAL Precision) enable treatment of complex anatomies such as flail segments and commissural jets. TEER demonstrates significant symptomatic improvement and reduced hospitalization in high-risk cohorts, with low rates of major complications (SLDA 1.5–5%, leaflet injury ≤2%, device embolization ≤0.7%). Nursing roles encompass preprocedural preparation, intraoperative monitoring, anticoagulation management, and postprocedural surveillance for complications such as tamponade, vascular injury, and residual MR. Conclusion: TEER represents a transformative option for patients unsuitable for surgery, offering durable MR reduction and improved quality of life when applied with rigorous anatomical assessment and multidisciplinary collaboration."
OpenAlex,valvular heart disease,Bilateral Carcinoid Heart Disease in Advanced Functional Small Bowel Neuroendocrine Tumor Without Intracardiac Shunt: A Clinical Conundrum Case Report,Stefano H Byer; Mashkurul Haque; Ola Abdelkarim; Christian Anderson; Udhayvir Singh Grewal,10.1093/ehjcr/ytaf679,2025-12-26,European Heart Journal - Case Reports,"Abstract Background Carcinoid heart disease (CHD) is a known complication of advanced functional neuroendocrine tumors (NETs), almost exclusively affecting right-sided cardiac valves. Left-sided involvement is rare and usually attributed to intracardiac shunting or pulmonary sources of serotonin. This case report highlights a rare presentation of CHD involving left- and right-sided valves in the absence of an anatomic shunt or bronchopulmonary NET. Case Presentation A 67-year-old woman with a longstanding, functional, small bowel Grade 1 NET and metastatic liver and peritoneal disease presented with worsening dyspnea and peripheral edema. She had a 10-year disease history, previously managed with debulking surgery, somatostatin analogs, peptide receptor radionuclide therapy (PRRT), and everolimus. Echocardiography and cardiac MRI demonstrated extensive left- and right-sided valvular involvement with severe mitral regurgitation, moderate aortic and pulmonic regurgitation, and mild tricuspid regurgitation, yet without intracardiac shunt. An elevated Qp/Qs ratio of 2.6 was attributed to severe left-sided valvular regurgitation. The patient improved on diuretic therapy and was referred for surgical evaluation of valve replacement prior to additional systemic treatment. Discussion This case illustrates an atypical presentation of bilateral carcinoid valvulopathy in the absence of intracardiac shunting, likely due to overwhelming systemic serotonin from tumor burden. Although serotonin is typically inactivated in the lungs, extensive exposure may surpass this protective mechanism. The potential role of SSRIs remains inconclusive. Multidisciplinary coordination is essential for optimizing cardiac and oncologic outcomes, especially when systemic therapy such as PRRT is considered. Conclusion Left- and right-sided CHD may develop in patients with small bowel NETs even without anatomic shunting. High tumor burden and systemic serotonin exposure may override pulmonary inactivation, leading to left-sided involvement. Early recognition and multidisciplinary care are critical for effective management."
OpenAlex,valvular heart disease,Left Atrial Reservoir Strain in Cardiovascular and Systemic Disease: Advances and Clinical Applications From Physiology to Practice,Andrea null Sonaglioni; Gian Luigi null Nicolosi,10.31083/rcm46198,2025-12-25,Reviews in Cardiovascular Medicine,"Traditional parameters, such as left atrial size or volume, typically reflect chronic pressure and volume overload; however, these abnormalities only become evident at advanced stages, often missing early signs of dysfunction. In contrast, left atrial reservoir strain (LASr), measured by speckle-tracking echocardiography, offers a sensitive and dynamic assessment of atrial mechanics, integrating atrial compliance with left ventricular diastolic interaction. Moreover, impaired LASr reflects atrial stiffness and fibrosis, and correlates with elevated filling pressures, making the LASr parameter a comprehensive biomarker of left-sided cardiac function. Indeed, LASr has demonstrated diagnostic and prognostic value across a wide spectrum of conditions. In heart failure with preserved ejection fraction, LASr refines the assessment of diastolic dysfunction and predicts hospitalization and mortality. In atrial fibrillation, reduced strain correlates with atrial fibrosis and left atrial appendage dysfunction, identifying patients at increased risk of arrhythmia recurrence and thromboembolism. In valvular disease, LASr uncovers subclinical remodeling and stratifies risk even in patients with apparently moderate aortic stenosis. Meanwhile, in addition to cardiovascular disease, LASr can detect early atrial impairment in systemic disorders such as hypertension, diabetes, obesity, and amyloidosis, often before structural enlargement becomes evident. Our group has shown that LASr predicts persistent hypertension after gestational hypertensive disorders, reveals subclinical diastolic dysfunction in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, non-invasively predicts left atrial appendage thrombus in atrial fibrillation, stratifies outcomes in moderate aortic stenosis, and provides prognostic information in acute ischemic stroke. This narrative review outlines the physiological basis, technical considerations, and clinical applications of LASr, discusses its limitations and future perspectives—including multimodality imaging and artificial intelligence—and underscores its transition from a research metric to a dynamic biomarker ready for clinical practice."

Early detection of abnormal cardiac structure may facilitate timely intervention and improve clinical outcomes. Methods: This cross-sectional descriptive study analyzed echocardiographic data from 66 ESRD patients in a hemodialysis unit between March 15th, 2020, and December 31th, 2021. A total of 66 patients were included. Two-dimensional echocardiographic parameters were assessed to evaluate cardiac structure and function. Results: The mean age of the patients was 63.5 years (57.3–72). Among the 66 patients, 36 (54.5%) were male, and 30 (45.5%) were female. Hypertension was present in 83.3% of patients, while 43.9% had diabetes. Left ventricular (LV) dilation was diagnosed in 7.6% of patients, LV systolic dysfunction in 16.7%, and LV hypertrophy (LVH) in 54.5%. Diastolic dysfunction was detected in 44 patients (66.7%) and valvular heart disease was observed in 20 patients (30.3%). Conclusions: Echocardiography plays a crucial role in identifying cardiac abnormalities in patients with ESRD. The high prevalence of LVH and diastolic dysfunction underscores the need for routine cardiac evaluation in this population. Future research should focus on long-term follow-up to better understand the progression of cardiac dysfunction and its impact on patient outcomes."

However, long-term durability remains limited by structural valve degeneration (SVD). Case report A 70-year-old male presented with severe heart failure 4 years after bioprosthetic mitral and aortic valve replacement. Imaging confirmed SVD affecting both valves, necessitating high-risk redo surgery. Postoperatively, the patient developed profound systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) to cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB), refractory to vasopressors and steroids, and died within 24 hours. Discussion Further investigations revealed elevated isolated anti-cardiolipin IgM antibodies, raising suspicion of autoimmune-mediated valve thrombosis as a contributor to this case of early SVD. Conclusion This case highlights the importance of thorough diagnostic evaluation in cases of early SVD, the need to individualise anticoagulation strategies in at-risk patients, and serves as a critical reminder of the serious inflammatory complications that can occur post-surgery."

Wright; Fátima Coronado,10.1177/15409996251403974,2025-12-23,Journal of Women s Health,"Background: Cardiovascular diseases are among the leading causes of maternal morbidity and mortality in the United States. During 2010–2020, 1 in 10 severe maternal morbidities (SMMs) during delivery hospitalization was heart disease (HD)-related. This report synthesizes science, including methodologies, challenges, and opportunities, and summarizes national estimates on HD during pregnancy, focusing on congenital heart disease (CHD), cardiomyopathies (CM), valvular heart disease (VHD), arrhythmias (ARR), and heart failure (HF). Methods and Results: We analyzed large nationwide databases, including the National Inpatient Sample and the Nationwide Readmissions Database. The prevalence of HD complicating deliveries ranges from approximately 20–40 cases per 10,000 deliveries. Increasing trends were observed in CHD, ARR, and HF. HF, particularly peripartum CM, is a leading cause of adverse maternal outcomes, including in-hospital mortality and SMM. VHD prevalence has declined, whereas ARR has become the most prevalent HD during pregnancy hospitalizations. Significant gaps exist due to inconsistent definitions and methodologies, limiting comparability and clinical utility. Proposed solutions include adopting standardized definitions, developing a core outcome set, improving data quality through structured documentation and standardized data models, and using validated algorithms and indices. Collaboration among multidisciplinary teams is essential to enhance research quality. Conclusion: The efforts aligning definitions of HD, outcomes, and indices with public health measures and initiatives present an opportunity to create a unifying framework that connects patient-level data to system-wide improvements. This integration helps ensure that advances in methodology translate into better care delivery, billing accuracy, research quality, and public health surveillance, and ultimately enhance outcomes for pregnant women with HD."

OpenAlex,valvular heart disease,Right ventricular function as a predictor of morbidity and mortality in post-heart valve surgery,Mohammad Risandi Priatama; Sony Hilal Wicaksono; Arinto Bono Adji Hardjosworo; Ario Soeryo Kuncoro; Dian Yaniarti Hasanah; Damba Dwisepto Aulia Sakti; Amiliana M Soesanto,10.4081/monaldi.2025.3447,2025-12-22,Monaldi Archives for Chest Disease,"Valvular heart disease (VHD) remains a significant global health concern, with mortality rates ranging from 1% to 15%. In Indonesia, the most prevalent form of VHD is rheumatic heart disease, which is associated with a hospital mortality rate of 6.5% following valve surgery. Previous studies have shown that, post-surgery, morbidity rates remain high: 30.8% of patients experience prolonged intensive care unit stays (&gt;96 hours), 30.67% require extended mechanical ventilation (&gt;24 hours), and 52% need prolonged use of inotropic agents (≥14 days). Right ventricular (RV) dysfunction is closely associated with these three morbidity parameters, as well as with 30-day postoperative mortality. However, limited research in Indonesia has explored the most effective parameters for evaluating RV function as a predictor of postoperative morbidity and mortality following heart valve surgery. This prospective cohort study was conducted at the Department of Cardiology and Vascular Medicine, Universitas Indonesia, and the National Cardiovascular Center Harapan Kita (NCCHK) from October 2023 to July 2024. During this period, 174 patients with VHD who underwent surgical valve replacement were enrolled. After applying exclusion criteria, 26 patients were excluded, resulting in a final study population of 148 patients. All participants underwent preoperative echocardiographic assessment of RV function, performed by two operators within 1 week prior to surgery. Among the 148 subjects, females comprised the majority (60.1%). Atrial fibrillation (AF) was the most common comorbidity, affecting 62.8% of the cohort. The most frequent morbidity outcome was prolonged mechanical ventilation, observed in 27.7% of cases. Of the total mortality events, 70% were cardiac-related, while the remaining 30% were due to non-cardiac causes. Multivariate analysis revealed that a preoperative S′&lt;10 cm/s was significantly associated with cardiac-related mortality [odds ratio (OR) 3.46; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.01-11.87; p=0.049]. Additionally, a preoperative S′&lt;11 cm/s was significantly associated with overall clinical outcomes, including both morbidity and all-cause mortality (OR 3.08; 95% CI 1.43-6.65; p=0.004). In conclusion, S′, an echocardiographic parameter reflecting RV function, demonstrates potential as a predictive marker for postoperative morbidity and mortality in patients undergoing heart valve surgery."
OpenAlex,valvular heart disease,Progressive and concordant alterations in transcriptional and gut microbiota across aortic valve calcification severity,Jue Wang; Ruihang Qu; Weicheng Huang; Yue Chen; Yun Li; Qi Lin; Ziji Wu; Hangfei Yan; Tingting Yu; Chiyin Wang; Xinlei Ren; Xi Wang; Jinyu Wu,10.1128/spectrum.02137-25,2025-12-22,Microbiology Spectrum,"ABSTRACT Calcific aortic valve disease (CAVD) is a common disorder associated with substantial morbidity and mortality. Although the gut microbiome has complex associations with cardiovascular disease, its variation across the calcification spectrum in CAVD remains poorly defined. We profiled aortic-valve transcriptomes from 31 patients spanning graded calcification and paired these with matched stool microbiome profiles. We identified subtle yet widespread transcriptional changes in mild CAVD (m-CAVD), consistent with a progressive relationship between calcification burden and gene-expression remodeling. At the community level, the gut microbiome in m-CAVD exhibited an intermediate configuration between non- and higher-calcification profiles, suggesting an early shift in the gut ecosystem along the disease continuum. At the genus level, we identified 11 taxa associated with stage; notably, Anaerococcus increased with calcification burden, whereas Rheinheimera declined across stages. These results refine the pathophysiology landscape of CAVD by connecting stage-dependent valvular transcriptional changes with coordinated shifts in the gut microbiome and indicate that early, microbiome-targeted interventions may be promising. IMPORTANCE Calcific aortic valve disease is a common valvular heart disease. Due to the difficulty in sampling arterial calcified tissues, research on the interaction between their gene expression and the gut has been limited. In this study, by analyzing the transcriptional profiles of calcified aortic valve tissues from patients with different levels of calcification and the characteristics of their corresponding gut microbiota, we identified consistent features between lesion gene expression and gut microbiota variation. This provides important evidence for the association between the gut microbiota and disease development stages, offering a new perspective for understanding disease progression and early intervention."

However, information regarding the factors influencing cardiovascular events in neonates and mothers within 6 months postpartum is limited. This study aimed to identify predictors of adverse maternal and neonatal outcomes in pregnancies of women with pre-existing heart disease. Methods: The study conducted a retrospective cross-sectional analysis of all pregnancies with a history of heart disease from January 2017 to January 2024, using secondary data from medical records at Dr M. Djamil Padang Hospital, Indonesia. We analysed the data using the χ2/Fisher’s exact test and logistic regression. Results: A total of 110 pregnant women with heart diseases were hospitalised during the study period, with an average age of 30.52 ± 6.00 years. The most common types of heart disease were valvular heart disease (28%), chronic hypertension (24%) and congenital heart disease (23%). In 27.2% of cases, adverse maternal outcomes included mortality (10%), heart failure (8.2%), arrhythmia (4.5%), rehospitalisation (3.6%) and thromboembolic event (0.9%). Meanwhile, 57.3% of cases had neonatal adverse outcomes, including mortality (5.4%), low Apgar score (16.4%), prematurity (28.2%), low birthweight (6.4%) and congenital heart disease (0.9%). The multivariate analysis discovered that moderate-to-severe left heart obstruction (OR 14.184; 95% CI [2.725–73.836]; p=0.002) and reduced ejection fraction &lt;40% (OR 16.211; 95% CI [1.712–153.507]; p=0.015) were the main factors that led to adverse maternal outcomes.

OpenAlex,valvular heart disease,Features of immune response to xenogeneic tissues of cardiac valves and patches: Review of literature,A. V. Shabaldin; A. V. Blinova; A. V. Evtushenko,10.15789/1563-0625-foi-3159,2025-12-20,Medical Immunology (Russia),"Global studies show that valvular heart disease still takes one of the leading places in the structure of mortality from cardiovascular diseases, being among the major causes of heart failure, including those among the employed population. Xenogeneic tissues are widely used in cardiac surgery, both in biological prosthetic heart valves, and as vascular and intracardiac patches. Modern chemical methods of xenogenic tissue treatment aimed at elimination of its immunogenicity but they do not, however, completely remove xenoantigens from the tissues. The residual carbohydrate antigens are thought to be a trigger of immune response against the animal xenotissues. At the same time, the role of immune response to xenogeneic antigens for induction of inflammation, valve dysfunction, and calcification are under discussion. The aim of this review was to summarize the research data on immune response to xenogeneic tissue implanted into the heart, and to find tools of preventing this immune conflict. Modification of pericardium of large animals by various methods does not entirely remove carbohydrate epitopes from extracellular matrix and cell membranes, which are recognized by pre-existing antibodies of M and G classes. The highly dynamic functioning of xenogeneic biological prostheses increases their antigenicity by reducing the primary cross-linking of extracellular matrix and activating the alternative complement pathway associated with adsorption iC3b complement component on xenogeneic tissue, serving as an opsonin for micro- and macrophages. The inflammatory endotypes of individual patients may be genetically determined by increased synthesis of certain cytokines. In particular, rheumatic heart disease, as a basis for the disorders of mitral heart valves, is characterized by an increase in TNFα, IFNγ and IL-6. Any of these cytokines may be targets for biological therapies aimed at limiting the constitutional inflammatory endotype. The OMICs technologies applied to various studies of biological degradation of xenogeneic heart valve prostheses, their implantation, and wide clinical examination of patients, may help us to find novel variants of immune-inflammatory endotypes leading to dysfunction of bioprostheses, and to identify target molecules for potential inhibition of antixenogeneic immune response."
