This in-vitro study assessed coronary perfusion in a high-risk VIV-TAVI scenario. A patient deemed at high-risk and treated with preventive Chimney stenting was selected as case study. A 3D-printed aortic root model was fabricated from pre-operative imaging and used to replicate the patient's VIV-TAVI setting. A CoreValve-Evolut-23 was implanted within a Trifecta-19 at five depths, with commissural alignment and 60° misalignment, to explore procedural variability and associated risk margins. The model was tested in a pulsatile mock loop with a coronary perfusion simulator. Flow and pressure were recorded pre- and post-VIV-TAVI under physiological conditions. Across all tested configurations, VIV-TAVI didn't significantly impair left or right coronary flows. The recommended depth optimized hemodynamic valve performance. Findings suggest refining coronary obstruction risk stratification in VIV-TAVI to improve decision-making regarding preventive interventions."

First-phase ejection fraction (EF1), a sensitive marker of early systolic function, aids in assessing systolic-diastolic relationships in human hypertension and aortic stenosis. This study examines temporal changes in these relationships in mouse models of HFpEF and elevated afterload. Mouse models of abdominal aortic banding (AAB) and HFpEF (induced by hypertension and high fat feeding) underwent comprehensive serial echocardiography. In AAB, EF1 significantly decreased at week 1 post-surgery (18.8 ± 1.2 vs 24.3 ± 0.8%, p<0.001) compared to controls, with further reduction at week 3 (16.8 ± 0.6%) and week 6 (13.9 ± 0.9%, both p<0.001). EF, global longitudinal strain (GLS) and longitudinal strain rate (LSR) remained unchanged until week 3. Isovolumic relaxation time (IVRT) was the only abnormal index of diastolic function at week 1. In the HFpEF model, EF1 significantly decreased at week 2 (19.1 ± 1.1 vs 25.8 ± 1.0%, p<0.001) compared to controls, while EF, GLS, and LSR were unaltered. At week 3, EF1 decreased further (18.1 ± 0.7%) alongside a significant reduction in GLS (p<0.01), while EF and LSR remained unchanged. IVRT increased early in the HFpEF model, followed by later left atrial (LA) enlargement. EF1, an early marker of systolic impairment, decreases early in HFpEF and afterload-induced dysfunction, accompanied by IVRT prolongation. LA dilatation appears later. These findings highlight the interplay between systolic and diastolic dysfunction in HFpEF progression."

However, data on the sex-related impact on bioprosthetic valve durability and very long-term clinical outcomes remain scarce. This study aimed to assess 10-year survival, prognosis, and valve performance in males and females undergoing TAVR with self-expanding bio-prostheses (CoreValve/Evolut R).
Consecutive patients with severe symptomatic aortic stenosis treated with TAVR between 2007 and 2014 at ten Italian centers were prospectively included in the Medtronic One Hospital Clinical Service (OHCS) database and included in the present analysis. The overall population was classified according to sex. The primary endpoint was a composite of all-cause mortality, heart failure rehospitalization, or stroke at 10 years. Secondary endpoints included the single components of the primary endpoint, cardiovascular death, and valve performance.
Among 1944 patients included in the analysis, 54.9% (n = 1068) were female. Compared to males, females were older and exhibited a higher baseline risk profile, characterized by more advanced renal disease and higher transvalvular gradients, yet they more frequently had preserved left ventricular ejection fraction and a lower prevalence of prior cardiovascular events. At 10 years, the primary endpoint occurred significantly more often in male patients, a finding that persisted after adjustment for relevant confounders (adjusted HR 1.15; p = 0.028) and was primarily driven by all-cause mortality. Structural valve deterioration, bioprosthetic valve failure, and valve performance were comparable between sexes at the 10-year follow-up.
Despite older age and increased procedural risk, female patients demonstrated more favorable long-term survival and similar valve durability compared to males over 10 years following TAVR with first-generation CoreValve/Evolut R prostheses. These findings underscore the long-term reliability of self-expanding valves and highlight the need for individualized, sex-specific strategies in TAVR patient selection and management."

PubMed,aortic stenosis,Histological investigation of persistent fifth aortic arch with arch obstruction in a neonate.,Seiji Asagai; Takeshi Shinkawa; Saeko Yoshizawa; Kei Inai,10.1016/j.jccase.2025.04.009,2025-08,Journal of cardiology cases,"Persistent fifth aortic arch (PFAA) is a rare congenital heart disease caused by maldevelopment of the primitive aortic arch and can cause obstruction of the aortic arch. The histological structure of a fifth aortic arch differs from that of normal aortic arches. Therefore, it is unclear whether the tissue of a fifth aortic arch can be safely utilized to reconstruct the aortic arch during surgical repair of arch obstruction. We herein report the case of a neonate who underwent surgical repair of a PFAA with interrupted aortic arch, right aortic arch, and aberrant left subclavian artery. Similar to those for a ductus arteriosus, the histological findings of the resected PFAA in this case showed intimal thickening, myxoid deposition in the intima and media, and proliferation and migration of smooth muscle cells into the intima. When reconstructing the aortic arch, we suggest that, if possible, the fifth aortic arch tissue be resected.
The histological findings of a persistent fifth aortic arch (PFAA) are important in determining the treatment strategy because the tissue may be unsuitable for reconstruction of the aortic arch. In the present case, the tissue of the PFAA was histologically similar to that of a ductus arteriosus and thus may have caused re-stenosis or formation of an aneurysm in the future. We therefore recommend resecting the PFAA tissue during aortic arch reconstruction."

Digital health,"Health systems face increasing waiting times for transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI), incurring excess deaths and morbidity. To determine whether remote patient monitoring (RPM) using connected technologies can mitigate these risks by prioritizing patients awaiting TAVI, we aimed to measure the clinical safety and effectiveness of an RPM-based prioritization programme.
Prospective observational cohort study of all patients awaiting TAVI at Imperial College Healthcare NHS Trust, London, UK, between 24th April 2023 and 15th November 2023. An RPM pathway was implemented for all patients accepted for TAVI. These patients responded to a weekly symptom questionnaire via web, smartphone RPM platform or telephone monitoring; with rule-based clinical escalation. The primary endpoint was the rate of adverse events (defined as emergency department presentation, unplanned hospitalization, or death), compared with a propensity score-matched (PSM) historical control group. Secondary endpoints included pathway performance characteristics for detection of deterioration. 200 patients met inclusion criteria. Despite growth of the waiting list, responsible for longer waiting times experienced by the RPM group [median 104 days (IQR 61.00-176.00) vs. 75 days (IQR 38.75-118.00)], there was no difference in rates of adverse events between RPM-patients and historical controls (Log rank P = 0.9). The RPM pathway had high sensitivity for prediction of waiting list death (100%). Patients deemed at high-risk of deterioration experienced shorter waiting times to treatment.
RPM for patients awaiting TAVI is feasible and may mitigate the adverse effects of longer waiting times through accurate detection of deterioration and by informing prioritization decisions."

Adults with SAS, prospectively registered in the Dutch Congenital Cor Vitia (CONCOR) registry between 2001-2019, were included. All-cause mortality, SAS (re-) operation, and cardiovascular events, including arrhythmias, heart failure, (re-)operation for aortic regurgitation (AR), were assessed. Longitudinal changes in echocardiographic peak velocity, interventricular septal thickness (IVST), and left ventricular posterior wall thickness (LVPW) were analysed using linear mixed-effects models. Differences in the history of SAS repair (operated/unoperated patients), isolated/non-isolated SAS, and sex were explored.
Overall, 312 patients were included [age: 26.0 (interquartile range, IQR: 20.0-35.3) years, 68.3% history of SAS repair] with a median follow-up of 16 (IQR: 10-20) years (4423 patient-years). Unadjusted survival at 15 years was lower in the operated group compared to the unoperated group (P = .009) and no significant differences were observed between sexes (P = .083) or isolated/non-isolated SAS (P = .810). The cumulative incidence of (re-)operation for AR at 15 years was 7.6% (95% CI 4.7%-11.0%). The hazard of SAS repair during follow-up was higher in the unoperated group compared to the operated group [HR 0.2 (95% CI 0.1-0.5), P < .001], after correction for covariates. Peak velocity progression was 0.1 m/s (P = .357) during the first period and 0.3 m/s (P = .032) during the second (after ±10 years). No patient showed fast progression (≥0.3 m/s/year) in peak velocity. At baseline no evidence of left ventricular hypertrophy was observed, following IVST/LVPW criteria.
Survival of adult SAS patients with a history of SAS repair was substantially lower compared to the unoperated group, reflecting a potentially more severe SAS phenotype. Nevertheless, long-term clinical event rates were considerable. SAS remained stable, suggesting less echocardiographic follow-up may suffice, particularly in mild phenotypes without AR. Additionally, follow-up should focus on the clinical sequelae of SAS."

Patients with a small aortic annulus (SAA) make up to one-third of the cases and face higher risks of prosthesis-patient mismatch and high valvular gradients.
This meta-analysis aimed to compare balloon-expandable and self-expanding valves used in TAVR in patients with a SAA, focusing on hemodynamic and clinical outcomes.
We systematically searched Cochrane Central, PubMed, and EMBASE for studies comparing balloon-expandable and self-expanding valves in patients with SAA undergoing TAVR. Random effects models were applied to generate odds ratios (ORs) and mean differences with 95% confidence interval (CI).
Fifteen studies (two randomized controlled trials and 13 propensity-matched studies) with 5149 patients (48.4% balloon-expandable valves) were identified. BEVs were associated with a lower indexed effective orifice area (mean difference: -0.18, 95% CI: -0.25 to -0.10; P < 0.00001) and higher transvalvular mean pressure gradient (mean difference: 4.32, 95% CI: 3.39-5.24; P < 0.00001) and peak pressure gradients (mean difference: 4.87, 95% CI: 1.23-8.51; P = 0.009). Permanent pacemaker implantation (OR: 0.57, 95% CI: 0.44-0.73; P < 0.0001) and major bleeding (OR: 0.67, 95% CI: 0.47-0.96; P = 0.03) were lower in balloon-expandable valves. BEVs increased the odds of any prosthesis-patient mismatch (OR: 2.28, 95% CI: 1.61-3.22; P < 0.00001) and severe prosthesis-patient mismatch (OR: 3.16, 95% CI: 2.19-4.58; P < 0.00001).
In patients with SAA undergoing TAVR, SEVs offer superior hemodynamic performance, whereas BEVs are associated with fewer conduction disturbances and bleeding events. Both valve platforms yielded similar clinical outcomes, underscoring the need for individualized device selection."

This process leads to cytotoxicity and organ dysfunction. Cardiac involvement is the main prognostic determinant and requires a multidisciplinary management approach. In recent years, the treatment of AL amyloidosis has significantly evolved with the introduction of innovative agents such as proteasome inhibitors, immunomodulators, and monoclonal antibodies like daratumumab, which has shown a favorable impact on hematological outcomes and organ function. The daratumumab-CyBorD regimen is currently the standard first-line therapeutic option. The therapy is tailored based on the stage of cardiac and renal damage, aiming for a complete hematological and organ response. The management of cardiac involvement, including aortic stenosis, atrial fibrillation, thromboembolic risk, conduction disorders, arrhythmias, and heart failure, plays a crucial role in prognosis. An integrated multidisciplinary approach in specialized centers experienced in the disease is essential to optimize clinical outcomes."

Coronary angiography found severe coronary artery disease. After completing a course of antibiotics and recovering from his acute illness, the patient underwent left atrial tumor resection, aortic valve replacement, aortic aneurysm repair, and coronary artery bypass grafting. Pathology confirmed the tumor was a myxoma. This case illustrates that allowing time for clinical stabilization and completion of a course of antibiotics for sepsis due to anaplasmosis prior to urgent cardiovascular surgery may be a reasonable approach."

We performed a retrospective cohort study of patients who underwent TAVR at the 4 largest centers in Israel between July 2008 and March 2023. Mortality predictors were assessed using multivariable Cox regression analysis.
The cohort included 6191 patients (51% females; mean age 82.7 ​± ​5.4 years; median follow-up 5.9 years). The overall estimated 5- and 10-year survival was 70 and 42%, respectively. To assess temporal trends, patients were stratified to early (2008-2015; n ​= ​2058) and late (2016-2023; n ​= ​4133) eras. Patients in the early TAVR era had significantly lower survival probability, compared to the late era (hazard ratio 2.0 (95% confidence interval 1.8-2.2), p ​< ​0.001], with an 8-year survival of 39 and 71%, respectively. Using an age threshold of ≥80 years, defined using spline analysis the 8-year survival in the early vs. late eras was 37 vs. 47% among older patients and 66 vs. 82% among younger patients.
Lifespan following successful TAVR has markedly improved over the past decade across age groups. Notably, patients younger than 80 years, at the time of TAVR exhibit an estimated survival exceeding 10 ​years. These findings should be integrated into Heart Team decision-making for optimal lifelong management of AS."

A systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) published through February 2025 was conducted using major databases. Outcomes were pooled using mean differences or risk ratios with 95% confidence intervals.
Six RCTs with 272 patients were included. No significant difference was found between EBCR and usual care for peak VO2 change (MD: 1.46, 95% CI: [-0.16 to 3.08], p = 0.076) and six-minute walk distance (6MWD) change (MD: 18.72, 95% CI: [-2.24 to 39.68], p = 0.08).

Patients with an aortic annulus area ≤430 mm2 undergoing TAVI with either NAV or ULTRA from the NAVULTRA registry were included. Propensity-matched analysis was performed for adjustment. Primary endpoints included 1-year mortality, a composite endpoint (all-cause mortality, disabling stroke, or heart failure hospitalisation), and 30-day device-oriented outcomes (severe prosthesis-patient mismatch, moderate or greater paravalvular leak [PVL], mean gradient ≥20 mmHg).
Among 1,617 patients, 524 propensity score-matched pairs were analysed. At 1 year, all-cause mortality was 8.8% with NAV versus 9.0% with ULTRA (adjusted p=0.585), and the composite endpoint occurred in 11.3% versus 11.8%, respectively (adjusted p=0.149). The device-oriented endpoint favoured NAV compared to ULTRA (6.0% vs 29.3%; adjusted p<0.01), with a lower residual transvalvular gradient (7.3 mmHg vs 12.7 mmHg; adjusted p<0.01), and reduced incidence of any prosthesis-patient mismatch (odds ratio 0.27, 95% confidence interval: 0.18-0.43; adjusted p<0.01).

A male patient in his 30s with childhood TOF repair presented with mild right-sided hemiparesis and motor aphasia due to an ischemic infarction. Cerebral angiography revealed ITCB at the T2 level with severe left internal carotid artery stenosis, a right aortic arch, and aberrant left subclavian artery. Percutaneous transluminal angioplasty initially resolved the stenosis, but progressive restenosis required carotid artery stenting, achieving sustained patency. Embryologically, neural crest anomalies and persistence of fetal vascular structures, including the ductus caroticus and the ductus arteriosus, may underpin ITCB associated with TOF. Carotid artery stenting in this setting is technically more challenging, as the guide catheter must be positioned unusually low in the thorax, risking proximal slipping of the guiding system into the aorta."

However, their combined role in patients undergoing transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) remains unclear. This study aimed to determine whether the combined assessment using pulmonary artery pulsatility index (PAPi) and PAC can stratify clinical outcomes in patients with aortic stenosis (AS) undergoing TAVI.
This retrospective single-centre study included 77 patients with severe AS who underwent right heart catheterisation within 3 months before TAVI. Patients were stratified into four groups based on the median values of PAPi and PAC. The primary endpoint was a composite of all-cause death or heart failure-related hospitalisation.
During a median follow-up of 3.60 years (interquartile range: 1.89-4.62), 15 patients experienced the primary endpoint. Kaplan-Meier's analysis showed significant stratification by PAPi-PAC groups (log-rank p = 0.040).

Of the 651 patients with AS, 256 had mild anaemia (mean Hb 11.2 g/dL, standard deviation [SD] ± 0.8), 122 patients had moderate-severe anaemia (Hb 8.7 ± 1.2 g/dL) and 273 patients had no anaemia (Hb 13.8 ± 1.3 g/dL). Patients with more severe anaemia presented with higher-grade New York Heart Association IV symptoms ( P = 0.002). More profound degrees of anaemia were independent predictors of increased all-cause mortality (mild anaemia: adjusted hazard ratio (aHR) 1.84, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.42-2.39, P < 0.001; moderate/severe anaemia: aHR 2.77, 95% CI 2.00-3.82, P < 0.001) and increased composite endpoints (mild anaemia: aHR 1.25, 95% CI 1.01-1.55, P = 0.047; moderate/severe anaemia: aHR 1.33, 95% CI 1.33-1.76, P < 0.001) compared to no anaemia. Anaemia was a significant effect modifier of aortic valve replacement on all-cause mortality in AS on the additive scale (relative excess risk due to interaction 2.16, 95% CI 0.21-4.54, P = 0.04).
Anaemia in AS was associated with worse symptomology, all-cause mortality and composite endpoints of cardiovascular outcomes in Southeast Asian patients."

Its occurrence with transposition of the great arteries (TGA) is exceptionally rare, and the presence of coexisting aortic valve stenosis adds significant hemodynamic complexity. We describe a term neonate who presented immediately after birth with severe cyanosis and desaturation, requiring intubation and prostaglandin E₁ infusion. Chest radiography demonstrated marked cardiomegaly, while echocardiography confirmed TGA with a large ventricular septal defect (VSD), a dysplastic pulmonary valve resulting in free pulmonary regurgitation with massive main pulmonary artery dilatation, hypoplastic branch pulmonary arteries, and moderate aortic valve stenosis. Given the complexity of the cardiac anatomy, the guarded prognosis, and significant limitations in social support, including the poor socioeconomic status of very young parents who lived far from the nearest tertiary hospital, the multidisciplinary team elected to pursue conservative management. This rare constellation of cardiac lesions underscores the challenges of early recognition, risk stratification, and decision-making in neonates with severe conotruncal malformations."

Heart & vasculature,"There is debate whether surgical aortic valve replacement (SAVR) or transcatheter implantation (TAVI) provide better results for treatment of aortic valve stenosis. While randomized clinical trials (RCTs) are considered to compare the average treatment effect of two methods in a selected patient population, registry data, although biased, reflect every day clinical practice and provide external validation of RCTs. We evaluated the impact of SAVR or TAVI on long-term survival based on local reports from all available regions in the world.
We systematically searched three databases selecting risk-adjusted registry studies comparing outcomes for SAVR and TAVI with at least five years of follow-up. Reports without all-cause mortality were excluded. One time-to-event curve was reconstructed from survival curves. Cox regression model and sensitivity analysis were performed.
From 10,399 screened studies, 13 met the inclusion criteria with 28,344 patients in the final analysis (follow-up: 5-9 years). In ten studies, survival rates favored SAVR, three showed no difference and none favored TAVI. Hazard ratio (HR) for overall survival was 0.58 (95 %CI: 0.54-0.61, p < 0.01 - favors SAVR). A landmark analysis with a 6-months split showed no significant survival difference in the first 6 months (HR: 0.94, 95 %CI: 0.86-1.02, p = 0.14) and better survival for SAVR compared to TAVI thereafter (HR: 0.43, 95 %CI: 0.40-0.46, p < 0.01). All sensitivity analyses supported this outcome.
This systematic regional registry-type comparison revealed that SAVR is associated with increased long-term survival compared to TAVI, which appears to be independent of the world region in which the study was performed."

This study aims to compare mortality and other outcomes by prosthesis type for patients aged 50-70 years who received SAVR in a well-characterized Australian cohort.
Data were prospectively collected at the time of heart valve surgery and linked administrative outcome data. This analysis includes all patients aged 50-70 years who had SAVR in Western Australian public hospitals between 2010 and 2020. The primary endpoint was all-cause mortality. Secondary endpoints were cardiovascular mortality, separately and combined with admission for either non-fatal myocardial infarction or for non-fatal stroke (MACE), major bleeding, and days alive and out of hospital (DAOH). Outcomes, categorized by prosthesis type (mechanical or bioprosthetic), were compared using propensity matching. Within the initial cohort of 706 patients undergoing SAVR (mean age 62.5 years, SD 6), propensity score matching identified 149 patients each with mechanical or bioprosthetic valves. After adjustment, patients who received mechanical valves had lower all-cause mortality [adjusted hazard ratio (aHR) 0.51; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.27-0.98; P = 0.04] and MACE (aHR 0.53; 95% CI 0.30-0.95; P = 0.03) during median follow-up of 3.6 years. Mechanical valves were associated with increased risk of major bleeding (aHR3.40; 95% CI 1.32-8.77; P = 0.01). There was no difference in risk of cardiovascular mortality, admissions for non-fatal MI, non-fatal stroke, or DAOH by prosthesis type.
Patients aged 50-70 years who underwent mechanical valve SAVR had lower risk of all-cause mortality and MACE compared with those who received a bioprosthesis, despite higher bleeding risk. Randomized comparisons are necessary to confirm these findings."

Heart failure,"Mitral regurgitation (MR) is a frequent comorbidity in patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM), which includes distinct subtypes with various characteristics. However, data on the long-term prognostic impact of MR and its progression or regression over time remain limited, particularly across individual HCM subtypes.
Patients with HCM were retrospectively included from a Japanese multicenter registry and compared by MR severity (moderate or greater versus mild or less) within each subtype: hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy (HOCM), end-stage HCM (ES-HCM), and other HCM (including nonobstructive, midventricular obstruction, and apical HCM).
Among 3602 patients (HOCM: n=837; ES-HCM: n=275; other HCM: n=2490), the prevalence of moderate or greater MR was highest in HOCM (36.3%), followed by ES-HCM (21.5%) and other HCM (8.5%). During a median follow-up of 5.3 (interquartile range, 2.1-9.3) years, the cumulative 5-year incidence of all-cause death or heart failure hospitalization was not significantly different between the moderate or greater MR and mild or less MR groups in HOCM (14.6% versus 12.4%; P=0.35) or ES-HCM (60.7% versus 54.7%; P=0.84). After adjustment for clinical covariates, no significant association was observed in either subtype (HOCM: hazard ratio, 1.13 [95% CI, 0.79-1.60], P=0.51; ES-HCM: hazard ratio, 0.84 [95% CI, 0.55-1.28], P=0.42). In contrast, in other HCM, moderate or greater MR was significantly associated with the higher 5-year cumulative incidence of all-cause death or heart failure hospitalization (34.2% versus 13.9%, P<0.001), which remained significant after adjustment, with a significant interaction (hazard ratio, 1.45 [95% CI, 1.09-1.91], P=0.01; Pinteraction=0.02). MR severity improved over time in HOCM, showed no clear change in ES-HCM, and worsened in other HCM (P<0.001, 0.46, and <0.001, respectively; Pinteraction <0.001).
In patients with HCM, moderate or greater MR was not associated with worse outcomes in HOCM or ES-HCM, but had significant prognostic implications in other HCM subtypes, suggesting the need for HCM subtype-specific MR management."

This study compared clinical outcomes in patients undergoing non-surgical treatment (NT) of aortic valve (AV), aortic valvuloplasty (AVP), and aortic valve replacement (AVR). This multicenter, retrospective observational cohort study included 338 moderate AR patients undergoing rheumatic MV surgery from January 2015 to January 2024. We followed up with patients for a median of 43.4 months. Furthermore, more-than-mild aortic valve dysfunction (AVD) in the follow-up period was our primary outcome. Our secondary outcomes were all-cause mortality and cardiac valve reoperation before discharge and during follow-up. We classified patients into three groups, namely, NT (n = 128), AVP (n = 91), and AVR (n = 119) groups, respectively. Moreover, 33.0%, 30.1%, and 3.9% of patients achieved our primary outcome, while 4.2%, 5.6%, and 9.6% of them attained our secondary outcomes in the three groups, respectively. We observed that fewer patients from the AVR group had achieved the primary outcome than those in the NT [adjusted relative risk (RR), 0.41; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.21-0.68; p = 0.002] and AVP groups (adjusted RR, 0.14; 95% CI, 0.04-0.43; p = 0.002), respectively. The secondary outcomes did not significantly differ among the three groups. Without increasing surgical risks, the concurrent AVR significantly improves AV status in moderate AR patients undergoing rheumatic MV surgery throughout follow-up. None or mild AVD was observed in many patients from the NT group during the follow-up, thereby warranting the delay of surgery for AV."

However, data on long-term survival and causes of death after M-TEER remain limited.
This single-center registry included consecutive patients undergoing M-TEER with the MitraClip device for severe MR between February 2016 and June 2020. The primary objective was long-term mortality trends and causes of death. Over a median follow-up of 3.3 years (IQR 1.3-5.1; maximum 8.5 years), 130 of 218 patients (59.6%) died, with 55.4% due to cardiovascular (CV) causes, mainly heart failure (HF, 34.6%). Non-CV deaths were attributed to sepsis (15.4%), malignancy (10.8%), trauma (3.8%), and multi-organ failure (1.5%). CV mortality accounted for 55% of deaths within 1 year and 68.4% beyond 5 years, with no significant change in the CV/non-CV mortality ratio over time. Among 88 survivors, non-fatal CV events were infrequent: 12.5% were rehospitalized for HF and 2.3% underwent repeat M-TEER. Non-CV hospitalizations occurred in 9.1%, mainly due to fractures or pneumonia. Independent predictors of all-cause mortality included ischemic secondary MR etiology, prior HF, TAPSE/sPAP ≤0.36, and ≥moderate tricuspid regurgitation, while a low MitraScore predicted better survival. A low MitraScore risk was associated with a significantly lower all-cause and CV mortality compared to a high Mitrascore risk (48.6% vs 83.9%, p < 0.001; 21.0% vs 64.4%, p ≤ 0.001).
Long-term mortality after M-TEER remains influenced by extra-mitral cardiac involvement and non-cardiac comorbidities. The MitraScore preserves its prognostic accuracy during extended follow-up."

Although both del Nido and St. Thomas cardioplegia solutions are widely used, comparative evidence in adult rheumatic mitral valve replacement remains limited. This study aimed to compare their myocardial protective efficacy and clinical outcomes.MethodsA prospective comparative study was conducted between May 2022 and October 2024. Total 50 adult patients undergoing mitral valve replacement-20 with severe mitral regurgitation (MR) and 30 with severe mitral stenosis (MS) were included. Patients were divided into two groups based on cardioplegia type (del Nido or St. Thomas). Intraoperative parameters, postoperative left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF), troponin I levels, inotropic and ventilatory support, and ICU/hospital stay were analysed.ResultsBaseline characteristics were comparable across groups. The mean number of cardioplegia doses was significantly lower in the del Nido group (1.6 ± 0.5 vs 3.2 ± 0.8; p < 0.001). Postoperative LVEF was better preserved with del Nido cardioplegia (MS: 53.3 ± 7.2% vs 45.3 ± 10.6%; p = 0.023). Troponin I levels at 6, 24, and 48 h were lower in the del Nido group, though not statistically significant. Patients receiving del Nido required less inotropic and ventilatory support, with shorter ICU and hospital stays. One in-hospital death occurred in the del Nido group due to sepsis.ConclusionDel Nido cardioplegia offers comparable or superior myocardial protection to St. Thomas solution in adult mitral valve replacement, with fewer interruptions, reduced dosing, and faster postoperative recovery."

We evaluated endothelial activation during surgical correction of chronic MR by assessing adhesion molecules ICAM-1 and VCAM-1, classic markers of inflammation, and their association with postsurgical LV dysfunction (LVD).
The study included asymptomatic patients with grade 3-4 degenerative MR. Transthoracic echocardiography data and blood samples were collected before and five days after surgical correction of MR. Circulating levels of adhesion molecules were measured by ELISA.
Ejection fraction, end-diastolic diameter (EDD), and volume all decreased significantly after surgery. A significant decline in ICAM-1 concentration was observed between the two periods (457.11±256.12 vs. 240.29±157.14 ng/mL; p=0.031), whereas VCAM-1 levels did not change significantly. Leukocyte count and C-reactive protein were significantly higher in the postoperative period. Early postoperative LVD (in 35.7% of patients) was not correlated with adhesion molecule levels. However, we observed significant changes in ICAM-1 levels associated with postoperative EDD >5.6 cm, which indicates LV dilatation. These patients had markedly lower preoperative and postoperative ICAM-1 values than others.
Serum ICAM-1 levels significantly decline following surgical correction of MR and are associated with postoperative enlargement of the LV. Our study highlights dynamic changes in endothelial activity and underscores the need for a better understanding of this process in MR."

Left atrial reservoir strain (LASR) is a sensitive marker of atrial dysfunction and may offer incremental prognostic value. This study evaluated whether LASR predicts all-cause mortality and heart failure (HF) hospitalizations in FMR, its performance in VFMR versus AFMR, and its utility over standard echocardiographic parameters.
We retrospectively analyzed 102 patients (mean age 68 ± 14 years, 41.2% female) with at least moderate FMR who underwent transesophageal echocardiography between 2018 and 2023. Patients were categorized into VFMR (LV dysfunction or remodelling) and AFMR (LA enlargement with preserved LV function). LASR was assessed using speckle-tracking echocardiography. Primary and secondary endpoints were all-cause mortality and HF hospitalization, respectively. Cox models evaluated associations with outcomes, including subgroup analysis by LASR quartiles and additional risk stratification combining LASR with peak tricuspid regurgitation (TR) velocity.
LASR was independently associated with all-cause mortality in multivariate Cox regression (adjusted HR = 0.887, p = 0.039). Higher LASR quartiles were associated with improved survival (p = 0.013). When combined with peak TR velocity in a composite risk model, patients with LASR ≤ 9.0% or TR velocity > 3.0 m/s had significantly higher risks of mortality (HR = 2.853, p = 0.012) and HF hospitalization (HR = 3.922, p = 0.029).
LASR, particularly when combined with TR velocity, provides strong prognostic value in FMR, supporting its potential role in refining risk assessment."

A systematic literature review was done on PubMed for studies until November 2024. The search incorporated keywords of STE and TEER, including original research on STE's predictive value in TEER patients. Studies concerning surgical mitral valve repair or unrelated imaging techniques were excluded. Twenty-nine articles were included, indicating that STE metrics, especially global longitudinal strain (GLS), correlate with clinical outcomes like heart failure progression and mortality. Baseline GLS was determined as predictive of hospitalization and mortality, while post-TEER GLS improvements were associated with better functional capacity. Furthermore, left atrial function metrics were significant in predicting arrhythmia recurrence. This study highlights the utility of STE in predicting outcomes for TEER patients. While findings are encouraging, additional research is essential to elucidate the long-term effects of TEER on cardiac function, thereby enhancing patient selection and management approaches. This review highlights the relevance of STE in prognosticating outcomes for patients undergoing TEER. Further investigations are essential to clarify the long-term repercussions of TEER on cardiac functionality, thereby refining patient selection and management strategies."

During routine follow-up, a mass was detected on the atrial surface of the mitral clip. The initial suspicion was thrombus. Transesophageal echocardiography confirmed a mass on the mitral clip. 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography/computed tomography showed focal uptake at the mitral valve level. Based on the modified Duke criteria and European Society of Cardiology 2023 guidelines, the diagnosis was considered ""possible infective endocarditis."" However, the concurrent neoplastic condition and lack of typical pathogens raised the alternative hypothesis of nonbacterial thrombotic endocarditis (NBTE). The patient was treated with intravenous anticoagulation and antibiotics. Serial imaging demonstrated a reduction in the size of the mass, but surgical intervention was precluded due to frailty.

A total of 112 patients were enrolled. Sixteen patients (14.2%) died during the 1st year postprocedure, so that they were excluded from the study due to the nonavailability of follow-up echocardiography. Ninety-six patients were included in a single-center, observational study with 67 (69.7%) males and a mean age of 61 ± 14 years. All patients who were selected (n = 96) had completed a 1-year follow-up after M-TEER therapy. Patients were stratified into two groups: right ventricular dysfunction (RVdysf) group (Tricsupid annular plane systolic excursion [TAPSE] <17 mm, [n = 59]) and No-RVdysf group (TAPSE < 17 mm, [n = 37]).
Procedural success was reported in 94.8% and at baseline RV-dysf group showed greater LV end-systolic dimension (left ventricular end-systolic diameter 53 mm vs. 48 mm, P = 0.022), LV end-systolic volume (LVESV 142 ml vs. 89 ml, P = 0.028), and significantly lower LV ejection fraction (LVEF 29.7% vs. 35.8%, P = 0.038). In the RVDysf group, RV dimensions did not change significantly at follow-up but TAPSE showed improvement in RV function after mitral TEER therapy (TAPSE at baseline 14 vs. follow-up 16 mm, P = 0.010). The right ventricular systolic pressure (RVSP) also decreased significantly in the RVdysf group (RVSP 55 vs. 42.5 mmHg, P = 0.000). The left atrial volume decreased significantly (54 ml/m2 vs. 47 ml/m2, P = 0.002), but no significant change was seen in the right atrial volume in this group of patients. When comparing the median differences of both groups at baseline and follow-up, some parameters show slight numerical differences between the groups, the P values generally indicate a lack of statistically significant differences.
Patients with preexistent RV dysfunction showed greater biventricular enlargement and impaired systolic function compared to those with normal RV function. At 1-year follow-up, the M-TEER therapy resulted in positive left ventricular remodeling and improvement in right ventricular systolic function in patients with baseline RV dysfunction, but the magnitude of these improvements was not statistically different from those observed in patients with normal RV function."

Though low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), particularly those in SSA, face a greater burden of RHD, existing systematic reviews have not specifically focused on cardiac and obstetric complications among affected women. We aimed to study cardiac and obstetric complications in pregnant and postpartum women with RHD in SSA and to evaluate the rate of valvular interventions in pregnant or postpartum women with severe disease.
We performed a systematic search in MEDLINE and online sources for studies of women of childbearing age (15-49 years) with RHD published after 2000 in SSA. Included study types were randomized controlled trials, retrospective and prospective cohort studies, case-control studies, case reports, and case series. Two authors independently extracted data and critically appraised articles. PROSPERO registration number: CRD42024628121.
We identified 1,478 unique citations, and nine full-text studies met inclusion criteria. Included studies were case series (7), one cohort study, and one case-control study, including a total of 787 pregnant women with cardiac disease, of whom the majority had RHD. Mitral stenosis and regurgitation were the most common valve lesions. Heart failure and arrhythmia occurred in at least 12.9% and up to 36% of study participants, respectively. Eight studies reported deaths due to cardiac causes (median: six deaths due to cardiac disease; total number of deaths: 56). Preterm labor/delivery was the most reported obstetric event, with incidence ranging from 5.2-35.2%. Few pregnant patients received any valve intervention.

Heart failure and arrhythmia occurred in at least 12.9% and up to 36% of study participants, respectively. Fifty-six deaths were reported from cardiac causes. Preterm labor/delivery was the most reported obstetric event, and few pregnant patients received any valve intervention. We found that women with RHD in SSA are at risk for adverse cardiac and obstetric outcomes in pregnancy, particularly heart failure and preterm labor. Future efforts may include registries focused on pregnant women with RHD and scaling cardiac interventional capacity to benefit pregnant women with RHD in SSA."

The efficacy of transcatheter mitral edge-to-edge mitral repair (TEER) in patients with amyloidosis remains uncertain. We herein present four cases of TEER for transthyretin cardiac amyloidosis. TEER reduced the MR in all cases. However, two of the four individuals died within one year, and in one case, a recurrent MR deterioration occurred. Although TEER can reduce MR in individuals with cardiac amyloidosis, the long-term outcomes appear to be poor owing to disease progression or comorbidities, thereby underscoring the need for careful patient selection."

Cranial systemic hypertension with caudal systemic hypotension, left ventricular thickening with mild mitral and aortic regurgitation, and cardiogenic pulmonary edema were detected from initial diagnostic testing at the referral institution. A non-contrast-enhancing lesion involving the thoracic aorta along the ascending aorta, aortic arch, isthmus, and proximal descending aorta causing near-complete occlusion of the aortic lumen was revealed from computed tomography imaging. Conservative management for congestive heart failure was instituted. Due to poor quality of life, the dog was euthanized. On autopsy, the cranial aorta was obstructed by a large chronic organizing thrombus with mild neutrophilic and lymphoplasmacytic aortic arteritis. The heart was enlarged with left ventricular concentric hypertrophy and myocardial fibrosis with secondary congestive heart failure. Renal necrosis and hepatocellular atrophy were presumed secondary to reduced perfusion and hypoxia. The underlying etiology of the thrombus and arteritis was unresolved. Similar pathologic findings have not been reported in dogs to the best of the authors' knowledge. Aortic thrombus should be considered as a differential for a mass-like occlusive lesion in the proximal aorta in the dog."

Current guidelines lack evidence-based recommendations for optimal postprocedural antithrombotic strategies, leading to heterogeneous clinical practices. And there are no randomized controlled trials (RCTs) available to compare different antithrombotic strategies following TEER.
STAR-TEER trial is an investigator-initiated, multicenter, randomized, parallel controlled, open-label trial, aiming to assess the safety and efficacy of de-escalated antithrombotic strategies with monotherapy in post-TEER patients with or without indications for oral anticoagulation (OAC) respectively. This trial plans to enroll 1,912 patients stratified into two cohorts: patients in Cohort A (requiring long-term OAC, n = 880) will be randomized 1:1 to rivaroxaban monotherapy or rivaroxaban plus clopidogrel, and patients in Cohort B (no OAC indication, n = 1,032) will be randomized 1:1 to aspirin monotherapy or aspirin plus clopidogrel. The primary outcome is all bleeding complications within 12 months post-TEER. The two key secondary outcomes are non-procedure-related bleeding within 12 months post-TEER (key secondary outcome 1) and a composite of ischemic events including all-cause mortality, stroke, systemic embolism, and myocardial infarction within 12 months post-TEER (key secondary outcome 2). A hierarchical hypothesis testing will be performed, with the primary outcome and key secondary outcome 1 tested for superiority, followed by the key secondary outcome 2 tested for noninferiority.
The STAR-TEER trial is the first large RCT to stratify patients based on OAC indication and compare different antithrombotic strategies following TEER in these two distinct cohorts."

We aimed to describe long-term outcomes after mitral valve repair in children and to identify echocardiographic predictors of mitral valve reintervention.
We retrospectively reviewed all consecutive patients younger than 18 years who underwent mitral valve repair between 2000 and 2024 at a single tertiary centre. Patients with atrioventricular septal defects or single-ventricle physiology were excluded. Preoperative and predischarge echocardiography assessed mitral regurgitation grade and mean transmitral gradient. Clinical and echocardiographic follow-up data were reviewed and analysed. Reintervention was analysed using competing-risk methods including postoperative mean transmitral gradient and residual mitral regurgitation at discharge.
A total of 112 children were included (age range 5 days-17 years; body weight 2.3-100 kg). Operative mortality was 0.9% (n = 1), late mortality 3.6% (n = 4), and one patient underwent heart transplantation. The cumulative incidence of mitral valve reintervention was 27.5%, 32.9%, 46.6% and 46.6% at 5, 10, 15 and 20 years, respectively. In the Fine and Gray model, higher postoperative mean transmitral gradient was associated with an increased cumulative incidence of reintervention (subdistribution hazard ratio 1.26 per 1 mmHg, 95% confidence interval 1.16-1.38; p < 0.001), whereas moderate-or-greater residual mitral regurgitation at discharge was not significantly associated (subdistribution hazard ratio 0.54, 95% confidence interval 0.25-1.17; p = 0.12). Death and/or heart transplantation events were rare during follow-up.
In this paediatric cohort, mitral valve repair was associated with low operative mortality and satisfactory long-term survival, but reintervention represented the main late risk. Higher postoperative mean transmitral gradient was associated with reduced valve durability, whereas moderate-or-greater residual regurgitation was not independently associated. These findings support efforts to minimise postoperative transmitral gradients when feasible, while individualising the balance between residual stenosis and regurgitation according to valve pathology and repair complexity."

Cardiovascular imaging,"Current guidelines for degenerative mitral regurgitation (MR) emphasize left ventricular (LV) dysfunction. However, subclinical alterations in left atrial (LA) or LV strain may manifest earlier in severe MR.
This study sought to determine whether combined LA and LV strain measurements improve long-term mortality prediction in severe degenerative MR, especially in asymptomatic individuals.
This retrospective derivation cohort included 1,314 patients (mean age: 55 ± 13 years; 35% women) who underwent valve repair or replacement for severe MR. Preoperative peak atrial longitudinal strain (PALS) and LV-global longitudinal strain (GLS) were measured. Patients were categorized into 4 groups by using spline-derived thresholds (PALS: <21.4%; LV-GLS: >-20.5%). The primary outcome was all-cause mortality (median follow-up, 8.4 years). External validation included 605 independent patients.
Impaired PALS (adjusted HR [aHR]: 2.11; P < 0.001) and impaired LV-GLS (aHR: 1.66; P = 0.008) were independently associated with high mortality. The group with both impaired PALS and LV-GLS demonstrated the worst outcome (aHR: 2.50; P < 0.001). In asymptomatic patients (n = 900), the combined use of both strain parameters outperformed traditional LV dysfunction criteria (LV ejection fraction ≤60% or LV end-systolic dimension ≥40 mm), thereby significantly improving net reclassification (net reclassification index = 0.436; P < 0.001) and discrimination (integrated discrimination improvement = 0.024; P = 0.003). Subgroup analyses demonstrated that the prognostic contribution of each strain parameter varied by the functional status of the other chamber. External validation confirmed these associations.
Concomitant impairment of both PALS and LV-GLS identified patients at the highest mortality risk. These findings support an integrated atrial-ventricular strain assessment to improve prognostic stratification, particularly in asymptomatic patients with severe degenerative MR who are undergoing MV surgery."

Aim of this study was to assess feasibility and reliability of pulmonary artery banding (PAB) as a pathological acute model of functional TR. Eight pigs underwent right thoracotomy, with an umbilical tape placed around the main pulmonary trunk, followed by controlled reduction of the pulmonary artery lumen via a tourniquet system. No animals died during the procedure. After PAB, right ventricular (RV) mean pressure, RV basal and mid-diameter and tricuspid septo-lateral diameter significantly increased (+ 97%, + 23%, + 32%, + 20%, p < 0.01 for all). Consequently, TR was at least moderate-to-severe in all the animals and these modifications remained stable for up to one hour. PAB therefore represents a reliable, one-step model of functional TR ideal to test the efficacy of new tricuspid devices."

In particular, the autonomic impairment observed in Chagas disease patients involved predominantly the parasympathetic control of heart rate at the sinus node level, and the adrenergic innervation at the myocardial ventricular level. The autonomic derangements observed in Chagas cardiomyopathy patients have only recently been explored in terms of their prognostic relevance, and their potential clinical implications for therapeutic purposes remain to be investigated. Over the last nearly seven decades, our laboratory has accumulated significant expertise using several tests described above to evaluate autonomic control of heart rate, now focusing on various pathophysiological clinical conditions. The effect of endurance physical training and of aging was mostly focused on studies of normal volunteers whose responses at baseline served as controls to be compared during tests employed in individuals with some morbid clinical conditions. By far, the pathophysiology of Chagas heart disease involving the autonomic nervous system was the most predominant subject studied in our laboratory, since the early studies in the 1960s until the late studies just recently published in international journals (Central Illustration). Other pathological conditions focused on our studies were mitral valve prolapse, heart failure, post-cardiac surgery, and hyperthyroidism."

Although typically tolerated, severe PR can lead to right ventricular dysfunction and negative clinical outcomes; however, its specific impact within the wider HF population needs further clarification.
This study was designed to evaluate the association between the severity of PR and N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide (pro-BNP) levels, its effect on functional capacity measured by the six-minute walk test (6MWT), and the incidence of significant clinical problems in patients with HF.
Between 2016 and 2023, we conducted a retrospective study involving 579 HF patients who underwent echocardiography at two tertiary institutions. Based on semi-quantitatively evaluated PR severity, patients were classified into four groups: No PR, Mild PR, Moderate PR, and Severe PR. Group comparisons used Chi-square tests and Kruskal-Wallis. Multivariate linear regression and Spearman correlation analyses were performed to assess associations.
Pro-BNP levels significantly increased across PR severity groups (Median: 2,157 pg/mL [No PR] to 23,541 pg/mL [Severe PR], p<0.0001). In contrast, 6MWT distance significantly decreased with deteriorating PR severity (Median: 254 m [No PR] to 72 m [Severe PR], p<0.0001). The prevalence of orthopnea and pleural effusion also increased with PR severity. After multivariate adjustment, PR severity remained independently associated with higher pro-BNP levels (β=0.48, p=0.002) and lower 6MWT distance (β=-0.39, p=0.008).
In patients with HF, increasing severity of PR is independently associated with elevated pro-BNP levels, reduced functional capacity, and a higher burden of clinical complications."

In this retrospective observational cohort study, we included patients with severe aortic valve diseases undergoing TAVR between February 2016 and April 2022. Patients were followed, and univariable and multivariate Cox regression were applied for outcome analysis using a composite endpoint including all-cause mortality, nonfatal myocardial infarction, unstable angina, heart failure rehospitalization. The incremental prognostic value of CT-FFR was also analyzed.
A total of 251 patients were enrolled (mean age, 67 ± 10 years; 176 men). During a mean follow-up period of 36 months, 60 patients (23.9%) experienced MACE.

Because stroke is the most common neurologic complication associated with cardiac disease, most newer pharmacologic agents and interventions have been designed to reduce the risk of cardioembolism, particularly from atrial fibrillation, the most prevalent cardiac arrhythmia. Common cardiac procedures such as coronary artery bypass grafting and valve replacement surgery can result in stroke and cognitive decline.

This retrospective study selected 1,976 eligible patients who underwent their first aortic valve replacement surgery from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care IV (MIMIC-IV) database. Univariate and multivariate Cox proportional hazards models were developed. A nomogram prediction model was constructed, and its performance was evaluated through receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves, calibration curves, and decision curve analysis (DCA). Multivariate Cox regression analysis showed that after adjusting for age, sex, comorbidities, and laboratory indicators, for each 1-unit increase in HRR, the risk of mortality decreased by 90.7% (HR = 0.093, 95% CI: 0.028-0.315), 87.3% (HR = 0.127, 95% CI: 0.041-0.390), and 87.5% (HR = 0.125, 95% CI: 0.045-0.348) at 1, 3, and 5 years, respectively, with statistically significant trends (P for trend < 0.05). Restricted cubic spline (RCS) analysis did not reveal a nonlinear relationship between HRR and mortality (P-non-linear > 0.05). The nomogram model performed well in both the training and validation sets, with AUCs of 0.834 and 0.766 for 1-year predictions, respectively. This study demonstrates that preoperative HRR is a significant independent predictor of long-term all-cause mortality in aortic valve replacement recipients. Integrating HRR into clinical risk assessment may enhance prognostication and support individualized management strategies."

Transvenous pacemakers (TVP) have been the standard of care for such cases, although they carry the risk of numerous complications, such as surgical pocket and lead infections. Leadless pacemakers (LP) were introduced as an alternative to minimize these risks. This study aims to compare the outcomes of leadless versus TVP implantation in patients undergoing valve intervention during the peri-procedural duration.
We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of studies identified through a comprehensive search of the PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, and Cochrane Library databases, performed in accordance with the Cochrane Handbook, to compare leadless and TVP in valve intervention patients during the peri-procedural period. Data analysis was performed using Comprehensive Meta-analysis (CMA, version 3.7.107). Primary outcomes included mortality, rehospitalization, and device- or procedure-related complications. Risk ratios (RRs) and mean differences (MDs) were calculated for dichotomous and continuous outcomes, respectively, both with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). The protocol was prospectively registered (PROSPERO: CRD420251150891).
The meta-analysis included 5 cohort studies comprising 10,494 participants. 794 patients received LP and 9,700 received conventional TVP. LP patients had a significantly higher mortality risk (RR = 1.85; 95% CI, 1.06-3.20; p = 0.029), longer hospital stay (MD = 0.67; 95% CI, 0.43-0.90; p < 0.001) and lower ventricular pacing burden (MD = -11.39; 95% CI, -18.98 to -3.80; p = 0.003) compared to patients with conventional TVP. There was no statistically significant difference between the two groups regarding rehospitalization, pocket infection, lead/device dislodgement, and vascular complications.
In this meta-analysis, LP implantation was associated with reduced ventricular pacing burden, but at the expense of a longer hospital stay and increased mortality risk compared with conventional TVP. No significant differences were observed between the two modalities in terms of rehospitalization, pocket infection, lead/device dislodgement, and vascular complications. These findings suggest that although LP were associated with higher observed mortality, this association is likely driven by selection bias, as leadless devices are preferentially implanted in patients with higher baseline risk and greater comorbidity burden.

This makes detailed visualisation and characterisation of cardiac anatomy and pathology increasingly important. As a result, there is a growing interest in interventional imaging for procedural guidance. Specifically, there is an increasing interest in using intracardiac echocardiography (ICE) as a complementary or alternative tool to transoesophageal echocardiography. Furthermore, new-generation three-dimensional matrix array ICE probes provide the possibility of obtaining multiplanar reconstruction imaging, playing a crucial role in structural heart interventions. To date, we still need guidelines that summarise the technical details of the most used ICE probes and that standardise procedure protocols. The purpose of this expert review is to provide an overview of ICE technology, describe the technical characteristics of the available probes, and present a review by a group of experts on their use in guiding structural heart interventions based on global clinical experience."

Defining this relationship in greater detail can potentially provide insight into device selection and patient-specific treatment goals. We therefore sought to better understand the relationship between both baseline TR severity and change in TR after TTVI and the extent of improvement in health status after TTVI.
As part of the Tri-QOL (Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire Validation in Tricuspid Valve Disease) study, data from 11 studies of TTVI devices were transferred to the US Food and Drug Administration to harmonize and anonymize before analysis by an independent center. This secondary, observational analysis used patient-level data from the 6 single-arm studies of patients who underwent TTVI to explore the association of change in KCCQ-OS with TR grade using multivariable models, adjusted for age, sex, chronic lung disease, and baseline KCCQ-OS. The primary model included TR grade at baseline, TR grade at 1 month, and the interaction between the two.
Among 1056 patients with ≥severe TR who underwent TTVI, mean age was 79.1±7.1 years, 60.3% were female, and mean baseline Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire-overall summary score [KCCQ-OS] was 49.5±22.3. Baseline TR grade was severe in 33.5%, massive in 35.9%, and torrential in 30.6%. One-month after TTVI, TR was none/trace in 21.7%, mild in 27.2%, moderate in 28.1%, and ≥evere in 23.1%, while the mean change in KCCQ-OS was 17.0±21.3 points. In a multivariable model that included TR grade at baseline, TR grade at 1 month, and their interaction, there was a strong association between reduction in TR and improvement in KCCQ-OS, with no consistent evidence of a threshold of TR grade below which there was no further improvement in KCCQ-OS. However, among patients with baseline torrential TR, the extent of health status improvement plateaued for patients achieving moderate or less TR at 1 month (ie, a 3-grade improvement from baseline).
Health status improvement after TTVI was most strongly associated with the degree of TR reduction, although there was minimal additional improvement for most patients beyond a 3-grade reduction in TR. These findings support the goal of achieving mild or less TR with TTVI, although patients with torrential TR at baseline may be well served if moderate TR can be achieved."

Surgical repair technique is dependent on the degree of tricuspid leaflet dysfunction and the decision to undergo univentricular or biventricular repair. Patients with a severely dysplastic tricuspid valve are less suited to a cone repair alone and require leaflet reconstruction. Currently used patch materials include autologous untreated pericardium and treated pericardium, with limitations such as unpredictable shrinkage and no growth potential, respectively. To overcome these challenges, we used living autologous wall of the right atrium to reconstruct the tricuspid valve leaflets in a 1-year-old girl with Ebstein's anomaly and a severely dysplastic tricuspid valve."

This study investigates the pathogenic potential of missense VUS in the ROBO4 gene, previously associated with vascular integrity and ascending aortic aneurysm. Clinical and genetic data from five patients with heterozygous ROBO4 VUS and thoracic aortic aneurysms or dissections were analyzed. Computational tools including AlphaFold2, AlphaMissense, REVEL, PolyPhen-2, SIFT, FATHMM, MutationTaster2, GranthamMatrix, and PhastCons were utilized to predict pathogenicity and structural impacts. Patients exhibited varying severities of aortic pathology, from elective aneurysm repairs to extensive familial aneurysmal histories. Structural modeling revealed significant differences in residue positions and biochemical properties, particularly for extracellular domain variants affecting critical beta-sheet structures involved in vascular stability. Notably, patient-specific predictions aligned computational evidence with clinical severity, suggesting potential genotype-phenotype correlations. For example, a variant (Q44P) showed strong pathogenic predictions coinciding with severe familial presentations. These computational predictions, validated by clinical data, highlight a novel and efficient workflow for evaluating VUS pathogenicity, informing precision medicine, and guiding counseling for aortic degenerative diseases. Ultimately, we demonstrate the value of integrating computational modeling with clinical data to decipher the pathogenic significance of genetic variants in cardiovascular diseases."

Their dynamic alterations profoundly influence critical biological processes. However, Existing research primarily focuses on single-PTM site prediction and remains confined by single-modality analysis. This study introduces UniGraphPTMs, the first universal PTM site prediction framework based on multimodal fusion and graph neural networks. UniGraphPTMs employs a master-slave architecture to break branch independence through multi-stage interactions. We pioneer the integration of the protein structure pre-training model Saprot with ProtT5 and ESM-C, enabling comprehensive exploration of protein sequence-structure multimodal embeddings. The master branch utilizes xLSTM and Mamba for sequence feature extraction, while the slave branch innovatively constructs a Hierarchical Graph Neural Network for multi-level structural feature extraction. To optimize cross-modal interactions, a novel Low-Rank Cross-Attention Bidirectional Gating fusion module is designed. Furthermore, by incorporating a hierarchical contrastive loss function and pioneering a dual-modality adaptive weighting mechanism, we effectively address the challenge of synergistic learning across multiple losses. Evaluated across 11 datasets encompassing 6 distinct PTM types, UniGraphPTMs outperforms all previous models, demonstrating average improvements of 3.27% in AUC, 4.31% in MCC, and 3.94% in AP. Furthermore, we conducted a proof-of-concept study on multi-PTM joint prediction."

Emerging evidence indicates that retinal microvascular alterations, detectable through Optical Coherence Tomography Angiography (OCTA), may serve as promising non-invasive biomarkers for PD. However, the lack of definitive diagnostic tests for early-stage PD underscores an urgent need for objective, non-invasive tools to facilitate timely detection and intervention. In this retrospective study, OCTA images were obtained from 53 PD patients and 39 healthy controls. Both the superficial vascular complex (SVC) and deep vascular complex (DVC) were segmented to extract 22 quantitative features, including foveal avascular zone (FAZ) descriptors and vascular density measures. A patient-based cross-validation strategy was employed to partition the dataset into training, validation, and independent test sets, ensuring that data from the same individual did not appear across multiple subsets. To reduce dimensionality and enhance generalizability, we applied a combined feature selection framework using Univariate Feature Selection, Recursive Feature Elimination, and Random Forest Feature Importance. Multiple machine learning algorithms were then trained and optimized, with the best-performing classifiers (XGBoost, Random Forest, and K-Nearest Neighbors) integrated into a weighted ensemble model. The ensemble approach outperformed individual classifiers, achieving an accuracy of 74.28%, sensitivity of 90%, specificity of 53.33%, and an AUC of 0.75 on the independent hold-out test set. Feature analysis revealed that both morphological descriptors (form factor, convexity, solidity, roundness) and vascular density parameters, including vessel area density (VAD) and vessel skeleton density (VSD) contributed strongly to model performance. A graphical user interface (PDAI - Parkinson's Disease Artificial Intelligence) was developed to facilitate clinical adoption, enabling interactive preprocessing, feature visualization, and automated prediction. Our findings provide a promising and non-invasive framework to support PD classification and screening, warranting further validation in larger and multi-center cohorts."

Their activity ensures the correct transcription level of each individual gene, which is essential for cellular homeostasis and responses to a wide range of signals. One of the major challenges in genomics is to build computational models that accurately predict genome-wide gene expression from the sequences of regulatory elements1. Here we present promoter activity regulatory model (PARM), a cell-type-specific deep-learning model trained on specially designed massively parallel reporter assays (MPRAs) that query human promoter sequences. PARM is experimentally and computationally lightweight so that cell-type-specific and condition-specific models can be generated that reliably predict autonomous promoter activity across the genome from the DNA sequence alone. PARM can also design purely synthetic strong promoters. We leveraged PARM to systematically identify binding sites of transcription factors that probably contribute to the activity of each natural human promoter and to detect the rewiring of these regulatory interactions after various stimuli to the cells. We also uncovered and experimentally confirmed substantial positional preferences of transcription factors that differ between activating and repressive regulatory functions and a complex grammar of motif-motif interactions. Our approach provides a highly economic strategy towards a deeper understanding of the dynamic regulation of human promoters by transcription factors."

Dysfunction of the somato-cognitive action network (SCAN)-which is thought to control action execution6,7 by coordinating arousal, organ physiology and whole-body motor plans with behavioural motivation-is a potential contributor to the diverse clinical manifestations of PD. To investigate the role of the SCAN in PD pathophysiology and treatments (medications, deep-brain stimulation (DBS), transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) and MRI-guided focused ultrasound stimulation (MRgFUS)), we built a large (n = 863), multimodal, multi-intervention clinical imaging dataset. Resting-state functional connectivity revealed that the substantia nigra and all PD DBS targets (subthalamic nucleus, globus pallidus and ventral intermediate thalamus) are selectively connected to the SCAN rather than to effector-specific motor regions. Importantly, PD was characterized by specific hyperconnectivity between the SCAN and the subcortex. We therefore followed six PD cohorts undergoing DBS, TMS, MRgFUS and levodopa therapy using precision resting-state functional connectivity and electrocorticography recording. Efficacious treatments reduced SCAN-to-subcortex hyperconnectivity. Targeting the SCAN instead of effector regions doubled the efficacy of TMS treatments. Focused ultrasound treatment benefits increased when the target was closer to the thalamic SCAN sweet spot. Thus, SCAN hyperconnectivity is central to PD pathophysiology and its alleviation is a hallmark of successful neuromodulation. Targeting functionally defined subcortical SCAN nodes may improve existing therapies (DBS, MRgFUS), whereas cortical SCAN targets offer effective non-invasive or minimally invasive neuromodulation for PD."

Agricultural genetics contributed to the mixed-model and Bayesian frameworks underlying modern polygenic scores, while human genomics has driven advances in nonlinear modeling, federated learning and biology-informed artificial intelligence. We propose a roadmap centered on interoperable data standards, shared benchmarks and cross-disciplinary training to unify predictive genomics across species. Together, these efforts establish genomic prediction as a comparative science capable of explaining how genetic information drives form and function across the diversity of life.

The proposed two-stage framework integrates image enhancement and classification by jointly leveraging original low-exposure images and their super-resolved counterparts. We further construct and publicly release a low-iodine, low-radiation CTPA dataset developed in collaboration with a clinical institution to support reproducible research in safe imaging. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method substantially improves diagnostic performance compared with single-branch baselines, achieving an area under the ROC curve (AUC) of 0.928 while maintaining balanced sensitivity and specificity. These findings suggest that the proposed framework enables accurate and safer PE diagnosis under reduced contrast and radiation exposure, offering a practical solution for improving diagnostic safety in clinical CTPA imaging."

The aim of this study was to develop a deep learning (DL) radiomics model to predict NIILs post-CAS from dual-energy CT (DECT) images.
This study retrospectively enrolled patients from three centers. Carotid plaques were delineated on multiparametric DECT images. A combined model integrating clinical-radiological, handcrafted radiomics (HCR), and DL features was constructed using a support vector machine algorithm to predict NIILs. The model's performance was assessed through the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC). To improve the interpretability of the model, SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) analysis was applied.
This study involved 336 patients divided into the training (n = 135), internal validation (n = 58), and external test (n = 143) cohorts. NIILs were present in 38.5%, 37.9%, and 39.9% of the subjects, respectively. Symptomatic events and plaque ulceration were identified as independent risk factors for NIILs. The combined model incorporating 2 clinical-radiological risk factors, 9 HCR features, and 15 DL features demonstrated satisfactory performance in predicting NIILs, with AUCs of 0.908, 0.842, and 0.856 in the three cohorts, respectively. The predictions of the combined model were explained both locally and globally by SHAP analysis.
The combined model demonstrated high accuracy in identifying patients at elevated risk for NIILs post-CAS and can serve as an interpretable tool for optimizing treatment strategies.

Expert readers manually annotated a total of 120 OCT volumes for RPE loss and HT. Dice similarity coefficients (DSC) were calculated to quantify the spatial overlap between the lesions within each OCT device. Intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC) and Bland-Altman analyses were used to assess inter-device agreement. Spatial overlap between HT and RPE loss ranged from moderate to good, with HT lesions being significantly larger than RPE loss areas across all devices (p < 0.001). Overall agreement was good for HT and RPE loss. Systematic biases emerged, with Cirrus yielding consistently smaller measurements compared to Spectralis or Maestro2. Lesion measurements demonstrated good agreement across all three OCT devices, yet device-dependent differences require caution when comparing data. Accounting for inter-device variability is an essential step toward reliable clinical endpoints and successful integration of automated OCT algorithms into clinical trials and routine AMD care."

These lines are susceptible to various hazards, including floating objects (e.g., balloons and kites), bird nests, debris, and other foreign objects that may attach to or hang from power lines or towers. Such objects pose significant safety risks by potentially disrupting the normal functioning of the power system. Leveraging the advances in deep learning and computer vision, object detection models such as YOLO have been widely employed in power-grid inspections. However, traditional models often struggle to balance low-frequency background information (e.g., sky, grass) with high-frequency salient structures (e.g., power lines, towers), leading to suboptimal detection accuracy and robustness for small, low-contrast foreign objects. This paper presents an enhanced YOLOv11 detector tailored for high-voltage transmission line environments. First, we integrate a Wavelet-Transform Convolution (WTConv) block into the backbone to decompose features into multi-frequency sub-bands, apply lightweight depth-wise convolution in the wavelet domain, and reconstruct them losslessly, thereby enlarging the effective receptive field while preserving fine structural details. Second, we develop a Progressive Feature Pyramid Network (PFPN) that performs two-stage top-down / bottom-up refinement and employs adaptive spatial fusion to alleviate semantic inconsistency and cross-scale conflicts in cluttered corridor scenes. Third, we introduce an Inner-EIoU loss that focuses regression on the inner region of ground-truth boxes, improving localisation of tiny and low-contrast targets. Extensive experiments on our Transmission-Line Foreign-Object (TLFO) dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed design. Compared with the YOLOv11 baseline, the improved detector raises mAP₀.₅ from 0.841 to 0.872 and mAP₀.₅:₀.₉₅ from 0.620 to 0.640, increases Precision from 0.918 to 0.962, reduces parameters from 5.97 M to 4.83 M, and boosts inference speed from 24.1 FPS to 28.5 FPS at 1280 × 768 resolution. Additional experiments on MS COCO val2017 show that the proposed modules are not overfitted to the power-grid domain, yielding a + 1.6 point improvement in mAP₀.₅:₀.₉₅ over the YOLOv11 baseline. These results indicate that the combination of WTConv, PFPN, and Inner-EIoU provides a practical, real-time solution for foreign-object detection in power-grid inspection scenarios."

Voice-based biomarkers have recently shown potential to capture treatment-related changes in Major Depressive Disorder (MDD). While prior studies have been cross-sectional experiments with single speech sample, this study addresses a critical gap by evaluating intra-patient changes in speech over treatment period, providing insight into how these voice biomarkers evolve within individuals.
We collected pre- and post-treatment voice samples from 48 adolescent MDD patients. We hypothesized that deep learning models could detect clinically meaningful changes in depressive states during treatment. Therefore, we compared machine learning and deep learning models for depressive classification. Additionally, we introduced the Dual Voice-based Depressive State Analysis (DVDSA) method to categorize intra-patient depressive state changes as recovery, worsening, or unchanged, highlighting the deep learning models' ability to detect these variations.
Among the acoustic features, only the fundamental frequency exhibits significant changes between pre- and post-treatment states after Holm-Bonferroni correction. Machine learning models demonstrate limited performance in distinguishing treatment states, with the best F1-score reaching 65.83%. In contrast, deep learning model, particularly WavLM, achieves remarkably higher performance in binary classification, with an F1-score of 78.05%. The WavLM maintains robust performance, when applied to the DVDSA method, achieves an F1-score of 70.58%.
These findings suggest that machine learning models and individual acoustic features may not sufficiently capture treatment-related changes in MDD patients.

Due to unpredictable reasons such as atmospheric conditions, mechanical problems, power outages, sensors limits, etc., recording systems may fail which causes gaps in data recording. In this study, original artificial intelligence (AI) models are developed for the modeling and reconstruction of missing SC data. Two novel swarm-based deep neural networks (DNNs)-the nonlinear group method of data handling (NGMDH) and a long short-term memory (LSTM) model integrated with the turbulent flow of water-based optimization (TFWO) algorithm were developed and applied to model SC records. The results were also compared with six conventional and two ensemble machine learning (ML) models. The efficacies of the models were evaluated in five hypothetical scenarios. Then, in the derivation phase, the best models were applied to the SC datasets comprising 5% gaps. The results highlighted the extraordinary role of AI-based models in improving knowledge on SC distribution in coastal waters. The new LSTM-TFWO and NGMDH-TFWO models, with average normalized root mean square error (NRMSE) of 0.11 and 0.11, and R² of 0.742 and 0.71, are approximately 11% and 6.36% more accurate than LSTM and NGMDH models, respectively. However, the tree-based models, with an average NRMSE of 0.05, demonstrate substantially higher accuracy than these complex DNN architectures. Among all the ML methods evaluated, ensemble models showed superior performance in reconstructing gaps in SC datasets. XGBoost achieved the highest accuracy, as indicated by an NRMSE of 0.031. Consequently, ensemble models are recommended for application in simulating various types of engineering problems."

This study focuses on recognizing six emotional states neutral, happy, sad, fear, anger, and surprise using internal body parameters such as blood pressure, oxygen saturation, blood glucose, heart rate, and body temperature. Leveraging an Internet of Things (IoT) enabled framework, real-time data was collected from participants. An exhaustive experimental assessment has been performed on 11 different classification algorithms of the machine learning platform. Among the algorithms, the Random Forest algorithm performed better than all other algorithms with 90.56% accuracy and 93.34% F1-score. Moreover, the precision and recall of the proposed system are extremely high. Model Robustness and generalization performances were evaluated by conducting internal as well as external validation. On conducting internal validation through k-fold cross-checking, the accuracy increased to 93.18%, clearly validating the consistency in the performance of the model. Further, the external validation was conducted by using the conventional DEAP emotional tasks, showing a collective accuracy of about 94% along with very good max and weighted average precision, recall, and F1-score values for all classes of emotions. This clearly validates the efficacy of the chosen physiological features as well as the correctness of the devised approach. The findings indicate that physiological signals, combined with IoT and machine learning, provide an effective framework for emotion recognition. This research contributes to the development of real-time, non-invasive emotion recognition systems, with promising applications in healthcare, wearable devices, and personalized user experiences. Future work will explore the integration of additional physiological parameters and advanced deep-learning models for enhanced accuracy and scalability, and usage in advanced technology."

Crossref,mitral regurgitation,Mechanisms of mitral valve development and disease,Enshi Wang; Bin Zhou,10.3389/fcvm.2026.1773671,2026-02-04,Frontiers in Cardiovascular Medicine,"The mitral valve apparatus comprises the annulus, valve leaflets, chordae tendineae, and papillary muscles, forming an integrated biomechanical unit essential for unidirectional blood flow. The leaflets and chordae are primarily derived from endocardial cells, and damage to these structures results in either mitral stenosis or mitral regurgitation, depending on the underlying pathology. This review compares three major mitral valve diseases, rheumatic mitral stenosis, congenital mitral stenosis, and myxomatous mitral valve prolapse, to highlight their distinct etiologies, molecular mechanisms, and structural endpoints. Rheumatic mitral stenosis is an acquired immune-mediated disease triggered by Group A streptococcal infection, in which molecular mimicry leads to autoantibody formation and chronic inflammation. Immune-cell infiltration and cytokine release drive the progression of leaflet fibrosis, commissural fusion, calcification, and pronounced chordal shortening, ultimately culminating in fixed obstruction. Large-scale genetic studies have not identified strong causal genes, instead revealing associations with immune-related risk loci, while valve-specific epigenetic mechanisms are poorly explored. Congenital mitral stenosis arises from developmental abnormalities of the mitral valve complex during embryogenesis and is classified into four anatomical subtypes. Due to its low incidence, the condition remains the least studied at the molecular and genetic levels. In contrast, myxomatous mitral valve prolapse is a degenerative, polygenic disorder driven by aberrant TGF                     β                     -dependent endothelial-to-mesenchymal transformation, valve interstitial cell activation, and extracellular matrix remodeling. Genetic studies have identified multiple causal genes, including                     FLNA                     ,                     DCHS1                     ,                     DZIP1                     , and                     TNS1                     , underscoring its mechano-genetic origin. Despite their distinct causes, immune-mediated, developmental, and degenerative/genetic, all three diseases converge on progressive structural failure of the MV apparatus. Notably, pathological remodeling of the chordae plays a decisive role in disease progression and the need for surgical intervention. A deeper understanding of both shared and disease-specific mechanisms, particularly valve- and chordae-specific molecular regulation, is essential to advance translational research in mitral valve disease."

The occurrence of RHF and tricuspid regurgitation represents a critical indicator of hospitalization rates and all‐cause mortality. However, RHF has remained understudied, specifically with respect to the tricuspid valve.                                                           Methods                                            Using the outbred sheep (                       Ovis aries                       ) model of pulmonary artery banding that induces RHF and tricuspid regurgitation, we generated 3 batches of RNA sequencing for 354 samples containing right ventricle, left ventricle, each tricuspid and mitral valve leaflet, and the pulmonary artery representing both male and female sheep. The reads were assembled into a de novo sheep heart transcriptome for differential analysis.                                                                                Results                     The de novo sheep heart transcriptome enhanced transcript mapping of reads by 43% to 45% in the heart valves relative to the reference transcriptome. Identified transcripts produce validated tissue‐specific pathways in ventricles (2756 isoforms), pulmonary arteries (535 isoforms), and valves (1215 isoforms), with transcript differences between the mitral and tricuspid valve involved in extracellular and endocrine signaling. Pulmonary artery banding resulted in the most significant transcriptional changes in the tricuspid valve with alterations in endocrine and immune pathway genes.                                                           Conclusions                     This project highlights the complexity of heart valve tissues and their transcriptional activity in a sheep model of RHF. It suggests potential therapeutic interventions in heart valve remodeling in pulmonary artery hypertension, RHF, and tricuspid regurgitation. This work highlights the need for further human and model organism research into the dynamic valve cells and genes."

Its clinical presentation varies widely, contingent on its severity and any co-occurring cardiac anomalies. Although most cases are identified in childhood, some individuals remain asymptomatic and may not be diagnosed until later in life. Conversely,                     rheumatic mitral valve disease                     represents one of the major causes of acquired cardiac disorders among children and young adults, particularly in developing regions such as India. Despite a significant decline in rheumatic heart disease incidence in India recently, it still poses a major public health challenge. Existing rheumatic heart disease studies report an average prevalence of 0.5 per 1,000 children aged 5-15 years. This report details the unusual co-occurrence of Ebstein’s anomaly and mitral valve stenosis rheumatic in origin in a 65-year-old man, a rare finding in an unoperated patient of this age."

This prospective study aimed to develop a novel end‐to‐end deep learning model for preoperative artificial intelligence assessment in transcatheter edge‐to‐edge mitral valve repair (TEERAI‐pre) candidates using multiview, multimodal echocardiography.                                                           Methods                     TEERAI‐pre, a video vision transformer–based classification model, predicts morphological suitability for transcatheter edge‐to‐edge mitral valve repair from multiview, multimodal echocardiography. A transformer‐based feature‐level fusion module was designed in TEERAI‐pre to integrate multiview, multimodal features for final prediction. An internal data set of 633 patients (7997 transthoracic echocardiographic videos; 766 pulsed‐wave Doppler images) was split for 5‐fold cross‐validation. An external data set of 150 patients (1735 transthoracic echocardiographic videos; 169 pulsed‐wave Doppler images) across 2 hospitals evaluated generalizability. Reference standards were provided by 2 experienced valvular cardiologists per international guidelines.

External validation yielded 73.3% accuracy, 74.0% precision, and 74.0% recall. Multiview multimodal integration improved performance. Binary classification (red versus green) showed TEERAI‐pre matched senior experts and outperformed intermediate/junior echocardiologists. Feature‐level fusion outperformed output‐level fusion and single‐view model. Backbone selection and calibration analysis confirmed robust performance.

With a focus on the prevalent psychological complications following the onset of this condition, this study aimed to explore the correlation between antenatal depression and Corona disease anxiety, personality traits, and postpartum depression during the COVID-19 pandemic.                                                           Materials and Methods:                     This cross-sectional descriptive-analytical study investigated women receiving care at health centers affiliated with Kerman University of Medical Sciences during the last month of their pregnancy and the postpartum period in 2022. Following the acquisition of informed consent, participants were assessed using various measures, including demographic and obstetric information, the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale, the Corona Disease Anxiety Scale (CDAS), and the NEO Personality Inventory-Revised during their third trimester of pregnancy. The same group of participants completed the Edinburgh Depression Scale and the Corona Disease Anxiety Scale (CDAS) 4-6 weeks after childbirth.                                                           Results and Discussion:                     There was a significant correlation between family income, unwanted pregnancy as perceived by both the mother and father, and antenatal depression. Additionally, marital satisfaction played a significant role in postpartum depression. Furthermore, antenatal depression was significantly associated with neuroticism, agreeableness, and physical symptoms related to Corona disease anxiety. Personality traits, with the exception of extroversion and conscientiousness, and various domains of Corona disease anxiety, excluding psychological symptoms, were also significantly associated with postpartum depression.                                                           Conclusion:                     During pandemics or epidemics, such as the COVID-19 outbreak, experiencing mental distress during pregnancy can contribute to mental health issues during the postpartum period. This risk is particularly true in individuals with unique personality traits, emphasizing the need for increased focus on mental health within prenatal care during these crises."
Crossref,valvular heart disease,The Severity of Disease and Hospital Length of Stay for the First and Second Admission of COVID-19 Patients: An Observational Study from Southeastern Iran,Milad Ahmadi Gohari; Mohammad Hossein Mehrolhassani; Shoboo Rahmati; Elham Sharifpoor; Hossein Mirzaei; Yunes Jahani,10.2174/0126667975341163241129050027,2026-10,Coronaviruses,"Background:                     This study aimed to investigate the severity of disease and length of hospital stay for COVID-19 patients admitted to a hospital in southeastern Iran.                                                           Method:                     This cross-sectional study was conducted in Kerman, Iran. Data were collected from patients who visited Afzalipour Hospital in Kerman more than twice during the COVID-19 epidemic from the end of February 2020 to March 21, 2021. We conducted two key analyses: 1. Mixed effect logistic regression was used to check the relationship between the variables and COVID-19 severity. 2. Mixed effect linear regression was used to check the relationship between the variables and the length of stay in the hospital.                                                           Results:                     The findings indicated that the most important risk factors for the severity of COVID-19 were heart diseases (OR=1.67,95%CI:1.20-2.30), increasing age (OR=2.23 for age&gt;54, 95%CI:1.70- 2.90), male gender (OR=1.47,95%CI:1.10-1.96), respiratory diseases other than asthma, and frequency of admission (OR=1.60,95%CI:1.20-2.15). All patients who underwent readmission experienced a shorter duration of hospitalization during their subsequent admission (OR=0.94,95%CI:0.91,0.96) and had a higher mortality rate (30% within 14 days, 26.6% between 14-90 days). Patients readmitted at intervals of 14-90 days and greater than 90 days exhibited lower disease severity compared to those readmitted within the 0-14 day period.                                                           Conclusion:                     Examining readmissions, the severity of COVID-19, and the length of hospital stay in affected patients are important factors for planning and allocating resources for COVID-19 management and treatment. These factors can help policymakers develop effective clinical guidelines for hospitalization or outpatient treatment of COVID-19 patients and contribute to reducing the burden of disease in the community."

Kinovea, as an accessible motion-analysis software, provides both visual and quantitative feedback. However, its application in supporting technique development among beginner athletes remains insufficiently explored. Aim: This study aims to describe the use of Kinovea in biomechanics training and examine its contribution to the awareness of kinematic characteristics and movement techniques among beginner athletes. Methods: A descriptive qualitative design involved 72 beginner athletes aged 18–25 years selected through purposive sampling. Data were collected over 16 weeks through interviews, field observations, and motion video recordings analyzed using Kinovea. Kinematic data focused on joint angles, stride behavior, and movement phases during walking, running, and the flight phase. Qualitative data were analyzed using content analysis with NVivo 12, while kinematic results were interpreted descriptively to identify performance patterns and areas for technical refinement. Result: Kinematic analysis showed coordinated joint-angle patterns across all phases. Walking analysis identified arm swing angles of 50.9°–58.8° and leg separation angles of 64.3°–67.2°, indicating a stable gait rhythm. The running analysis revealed knee angles of 68.8°–69.8° and elbow angles of 87.6°–89.1°, indicating efficient propulsive mechanics. The flight phase demonstrated knee angles of 81.2°–87.8° and elbow angles of 80.4°–88.3°, suggesting effective momentum use and postural stability. These measurements supported stride-efficiency assessment and technique evaluation. Qualitative findings revealed that Kinovea enabled athletes to interpret movement phases and identify technical inefficiencies through slow-motion and frame-by-frame visualization. Conclusion: Kinovea supports basic motion analysis by providing clear kinematic information and helping beginner athletes observe and refine their movement techniques. The findings also offer practical value for coaches by enabling more precise identification of inefficient patterns and guiding targeted corrections during early-stage training."
