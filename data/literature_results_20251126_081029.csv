PubMed,aortic stenosis,Geriatric nutritional risk index and C-reactive protein: prognostic impact in transcatheter aortic valve implantation.,Kayo Sugiyama; Masanobu Fujimoto; Wataru Suzuki; Kentaro Mukai; Masato Tochii; Hirotaka Watanuki; Tetsuya Amano; Katsuhiko Matsuyama,10.1007/s00380-025-02631-6,2025-11-25,Heart and vessels,"The impact of inflammatory and nutritional indices in patients undergoing transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) remains controversial. Therefore, we aimed to analyze the prognostic impact of Geriatric Nutritional Risk Index (GNRI) and C-reactive protein (CRP) in these patients. We included 122 patients who underwent elective TAVI for aortic valve stenosis (AS) between April 2017 and May 2023. The primary outcome was all-cause mortality, and secondary outcomes were major adverse cerebral/cardiovascular events (MACCEs). Patients with a low GNRI, high CRP levels, and a combination of a low GNRI and high CRP levels exhibited significantly high all-cause mortality. The GNRI and CRP levels alone were significantly associated with late mortality in the univariate analysis; however, this trend was absent in the multivariate analysis. The combination of a low GNRI and high CRP levels was significantly associated with late mortality in the univariate and multivariate analyses. The GNRIs at 6 months showed no significant changes, and the low GNRI in patients before surgery persisted after TAVI. There was no association between low GNRI after TAVI and late mortality or MACCE. The combination of malnutrition (indicated by a low GNRI) and inflammation (indicated by high CRP levels) may be a risk factor for long-term mortality in patients undergoing TAVI for AS."

A Scoping Review of Literature.",Gianmarco Zuccon; Salvatore Scali; Jacob Budtz-Lilly; Leonardo Foresti; Stefano Pirrelli; Joao-Rocha Neves; Antonino Maria Logiacco; Cristiano Calvagna; Sandro Lepidi; Mario D'Oria,10.1016/j.jss.2025.10.030,2025-11-24,The Journal of surgical research,"The objectives of this scoping review were threefold: (1) to assess the incidence and risk factors of iliac limb occlusion (ILO); (2) to evaluate the evidence linking ILO to short- and long-term outcomes in patients undergoing endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR) for abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA); and (3) to identify recurring themes and gaps in the literature to guide further research and suggest standardized reporting details for future studies.
A scoping review methodology was employed in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses extension for Scoping Reviews guidelines. Specific Population, Intervention, Comparison, Outcome questions were developed prior to the literature search. Studies published in English between January 1, 2000, and December 31, 2024, were considered. Inclusion criteria were as follows: (1) studies reporting ILO following standard EVAR; (2) a minimum sample size of 50 patients; (3) at least 1 y of follow-up; and (4) reporting of relevant clinical outcome measures.
Fifty-two studies met inclusion criteria and were analyzed. These included one randomized controlled trial, five prospective registry studies, five prospective nonrandomized cohort studies, and 41 retrospective cohort studies. Collectively, these studies evaluated 17,716 patients (15,133 males) who underwent EVAR for AAA. Only half of the studies provided details on timing or clinical presentation of ILO. The diagnosis was primarily clinical, with symptoms reported in up to 93.6% of cases (289 symptomatic and 20 asymptomatic patients). When specified, most patients (64.4%, n = 154) presented with acute limb ischemia or rest pain, while one third (35.6%, n = 85) had claudication. The reported incidence of ILO varied significantly across studies, ranging from 0.86% to 11.20%, with approximately half reporting rates between 3 and 6%. Both patient- and procedure-related factors were associated with increased risk of ILO after EVAR. Several authors emphasized the importance of addressing intraoperative findings- such as iliac stenosis >50%, residual stenosis >50% or kinking of the iliac limb-to help mitigate ILO risk. A total of 385 secondary interventions for ILO correction were reported. Of these, 55.9% (n = 223) involved open surgical revascularization, 28.6% (n = 114) were hybrid procedures, and 15.5% (n = 62) were treated using only endovascular techniques. Notably, only nine studies reported treatment outcomes, including a total of 3713 patients. When provided, treatment results were favorable, with immediate technical success rates ranging from 80% to 100%.
ILO is one of the most common failure modes of EVAR, with a reported incidence from 0 to 11% during follow-up. Several anatomical and procedural factors have been identified to increase risk of ILO, and increasing evidence supports the use of intraoperative strategies to mitigate risk of these complications. Although secondary interventions are often successfully managed using endovascular or hybrid approaches, further research is needed to refine prevention strategies and improve long-term EVAR durability."

Case reports,"Noonan syndrome is commonly associated with cardiac abnormalities such as pulmonary valve stenosis, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, and atrial septal defect.
A 19-year-old woman who was diagnosed with Noonan syndrome at birth had been receiving medical treatment for hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. The patient developed symptomatic hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy, characterized by biventricular outflow tract obstruction. Surgical intervention was performed, including atrial septal defect closure and myectomy through left and right ventriculotomy approaches.
A right ventriculotomy was performed to resect the parietal band, septal myocardium, and anterior wall muscle. This was followed by a left ventriculotomy, enabling an extended septal myectomy from the resection margin near the aortic valve down toward the apex. This approach allowed for the removal of abnormal muscle bundles that were not visible through the aortic valve.
When myectomy for hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy is challenging, surgical access via both left and right ventriculotomy should be strongly considered."

This study aimed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of a novel fully-recyclable self-expanding short-frame ScienCrown TAVR system for severe AS.
A prospective, multicenter, single-arm study (NCT05202977) was conducted. We enrolled consecutive patients with symptomatic severe AS undergoing TAVR with the ScienCrown valve. The primary endpoint was all-cause mortality at 1 year.
Overall, 128 patients were enrolled (mean Society of Thoracic Surgeons score, 5.40%), of whom 63.28% had a bicuspid aortic valve (BAV). The device success rate was 99.20% (124/125), and the procedure success rate was 96.88% (124/128). The 1-year mortality rate (follow-up rate, 100%) was 5.47%, significantly lower than the performance goal of 25% (p<0.0001). At the 1-year point, specific clinical outcomes included stroke, myocardial infarction, paravalvular leak ≥ moderate, and new pacemaker implantation in 3.91%, 4.69%, 2.34%, and 7.03% of patients, respectively. Hemodynamic performance (mean transaortic valve gradient, 10.51 ± 5.63 vs. 56.63 ± 20.00 mmHg; effective orifice area, 1.88 ± 0.52 vs. 0.61 ± 0.25 cm2; and peak velocity, 2.16 ± 0.52 vs. 4.76 ± 0.79 m/s) and quality of life scores (82.93 ± 11.62 vs. 61.09 ± 19.02) had significantly improved. Patients with different types of BAV had outcomes similar to those of patients with tricuspid aortic valves.
ScienCrown demonstrated favorable safety and efficacy with sustained clinical and hemodynamic benefits at 1 year for patients with severe AS."
PubMed,aortic stenosis,Severe Aortic Stenosis and Regurgitation in a Young Athletic Doctor With Bicuspid Aortic Valve Managed With On-X® Mechanical Valve Replacement.,Inderjeet Singh; Akash Xavier; Jayant Bajaj,10.7759/cureus.95274,2025-10,Cureus,"We present the case of a 28-year-old athletic male physician with asymptomatic bicuspid aortic valve (BAV), diagnosed with severe aortic stenosis (AS) and moderate aortic regurgitation (AR) following self-auscultation prompted by nocturnal palpitations and chest vibrations. Echocardiography and computed tomography (CT) confirmed severe AS (peak gradient 79 mmHg, aortic valve area 0.6 cm²), moderate AR, and left ventricular hypertrophy. Due to an aortic annulus size mismatch, the Ross procedure was deemed unsuitable, and an On-X® (Artivion, Inc., Kennesaw, Georgia, United States) mechanical aortic valve was implanted. Postoperative echocardiography demonstrated a peak gradient of 11 mmHg and an ejection fraction of 55%. The patient was discharged on warfarin, aspirin, statins, beta-blockers, and calcium channel blockers with counseling on anticoagulation management. This case highlights the challenges of managing BAV in young, active patients and the role of mechanical valve replacement when anatomical constraints preclude other options."

A search for articles in the PubMed database was conducted considering the PRISMA guidelines. The clinical trial had to meet the following criteria: 1) the presence of two comparison groups: aortic valve replacement (AVR) and AVR+septal myectomy (SME); 2) hypertrophy of the left ventricular outflow tract (LVOT) should be associated with severe aortic stenosis. Keywords for searching on the PubMed digital platform (according to MeSH): «aortic stenosis», «aortic valve», «septal myectomy». Statistical analysis was performed using Review Manager (RevMan) software, 5.4.1 (The Cochrane Collaboration, 2020) version. The meta-analysis results are presented as a forest plot. The heterogeneity of the studied sample was assessed using χ2 test and I2 heterogeneity index in each case. The heterogeneity was considered to be statistically significant at p<0.1 and I2>50%.
There were no statistically significant differences between the groups in the risk of fatal outcome in both the early (p=0.85) and late (p=0.89) post-operative periods. The thickness of the LV posterior wall (95% confidence interval - CI from -0.93 to -0.03), LV end-diastolic dimension (95% CI from -3.67 to -0.29) were lower in the AVR+SME group than in patients of the comparison group.
This meta-analysis demonstrates that SME in AVR is safe procedure and promotes reverse myocardium remodeling in a greater extent than performing isolated AVR. However, the number of studies for analysis was small and the investigated publications are retrospective analysis with investigation of different endpoints. Furthermore, not every study reports important factors contributing to LV remodeling."
PubMed,aortic stenosis,Patient-Informed Fluid-Structure Interaction Simulations of Bicuspid Aortic Valve in Young Adults Reveal Regionalized Differences in Mechanical Stress.,Hail B Kazik; Harkamaljot S Kandail; Joy Lincoln; John F LaDisa,10.1007/s10439-025-03919-4,2025-11-24,Annals of biomedical engineering,"Bicuspid aortic valve (BAV) is a common congenital cardiovascular defect characterized by two, rather than three, cusps. Many BAV patients prematurely develop calcification and aortic stenosis by age 35, which is more severe with fusion of the right and noncoronary (RC/NC) cusps. The mechanisms underlying calcification observed within the coaptation, attachment, and fusion regions of BAV patients are unknown. While abnormal mechanical stimuli induced by the bicuspid anatomy likely plays a role, little is known about regionalized mechanical stimuli in these susceptible cusp regions of young patients prior to calcification. Strongly coupled fluid-structure interaction simulations were conducted using physiologic boundary conditions derived from data of a 23-year-old patient with RC/NC BAV and an age-matched tricuspid aortic valve control. Cusp material properties were implemented for the first time from biaxial testing of non-calcific BAV tissue. Additional simulations elucidated the independent and collective contributions of cusp fusion, material properties and boundary conditions. Results show BAV cusps experience higher time-averaged wall shear stress (TAWSS) over the coaptation region (2.92-fold increase), decreased oscillatory shear index (OSI) within the free edge (1.6-fold) and coaptation (1.4-fold) regions, and an increase in von Mises stress in the coaptation (5.72-fold), belly (6.79-fold), and attachment (5.18-fold) regions of the fused and nonfused cusps. These results reveal putative regions susceptible to calcification in BAV patients experience differences in mechanical stimuli that may contribute to the onset of calcification and provide insight for future in vitro and ex vivo studies focusing on mechanosensitive pathways involved in BAV-induced calcification."

This retrospective study included 128 patients who underwent transfemoral TAVI between December 2018 and June 2023. ADL was assessed using the Katz Index preoperatively and one week postoperatively. Patients with decreased scores were assigned to the ADL-decline group. Clinical, physical, cognitive, and perioperative data were analyzed. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was performed to identify predictors of ADL decline.
ADL decline occurred in 25 patients (20%), who were significantly older (87.9 vs. 85.1 years, p = 0.004), had lower preoperative Short Physical Performance Battery (SPPB) scores (7.2 vs. 9.7, p = 0.001), and lower preoperative grip strength (14.6 vs. 17.4, p = 0.04). All three patients of with postoperative cerebral infarction experienced ADL decline. No significant differences in anesthesia methods (general anesthesia vs. monitored anesthesia care) or sedative drugs (propofol vs. remimazolam) were noted. Multivariate analysis revealed that older age (adjusted odds ratio [OR]: 1.15; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.01-1.31; p = 0.03) and lower preoperative SPPB score (adjusted OR: 0.83; 95% CI: 0.69-0.98; p = 0.03) were independent predictors of ADL decline.
Older age and reduced preoperative physical function were associated with ADL decline after TAVI. In contrast, anesthesia methods and sedative drug choices did not influence postoperative ADL. These findings may help guide patient selection and inform perioperative rehabilitation strategies to preserve independence after TAVI."

To compare long-term results for patients with favourable and hostile anatomy (HA) for CAS.
Single-centre, retrospective study of patients who underwent CAS from 2004 to 2024 at a public hospital in Latin America. Anatomical data were extracted from preoperative imaging regarding the aorta, the supra-aortic trunks, and the internal carotid arteries (ICA). Short-term outcomes included the primary composite outcome of major stroke and death (S/D); any ischaemic neurological event (AINE); major stroke, any stroke. Multivariate analysis (MA) was performed to identify classifying anatomical factors regarding hostility to CAS. Long-term outcomes, defined as AINE; cumulative survival; major stroke-free survival; and stent primary patency (SPP), were analysed using Kaplan-Meier estimates.
MA associated hostile anatomy with complex ICA, defined as either significant tortuosity or near-occlusion. One hundred and eighty-seven CAS procedures were performed in 172 patients, of which 79 (42.3%) had HA. HA correlated with a higher perioperative incidence of AINE (p = .018), any stroke (p = .029), and S/D (p = .049), but not with major stroke (p = .054). At 5 years, the HA group presented higher cumulative incidence of AINE (p = 0,047) and lower SPP (p = 0,011). There were no differences between groups for cumulative survival and major stroke-free survival.
The presence of a significantly tortuous or near-occluded ICA correlated with higher incidence of AINE and S/D in patients submitted to CAS. HA for CAS correlated with higher cumulative incidence of AINE and lower SPP rates during follow-up."

We retrospectively analyzed 149 patients with persistent or paroxysmal atrial fibrillation who underwent cardiovascular surgery between January 2015 and October 2023. Resected left atrial appendages were histologically evaluated for thrombus and amyloid deposition. After excluding 11 patients with transthyretin-type amyloids and 10 with rheumatic mitral valve stenosis, 128 patients (median age, 72.0 years; range, 37-84 years) were assessed. Patients were categorized into the thrombus and no-thrombus groups. Clinical data, echocardiographic findings, and atrial natriuretic peptide amyloid grades (0-3) were compared.
Fresh or organized thrombi and atrial natriuretic peptide amyloid deposition were observed in 28 (21.9%) and 110 (85.9%) patients, respectively. Moderate or greater aortic stenosis was more frequent in the thrombus group (p  = 0.004). Although overall atrial natriuretic peptide amyloid deposition rates were similar (p = 0.377), amyloid deposition degree was significantly greater in the thrombus group (p < 0.001). Multivariate logistic regression identified moderate or greater aortic stenosis and amyloid deposition degree as independent predictors, whereas moderate or greater mitral regurgitation was a negative predictor.
Moderate or greater aortic stenosis and atrial natriuretic peptide amyloid deposition degree predicted left atrial appendage thrombus formation, whereas moderate or greater mitral regurgitation was a negative predictor."

Current diagnosis of PPMI relies on fixed cutoffs, lacking the integration of time- and dose-dependent effects of hs-cTnT. This limits the precision of risk stratification and subsequent patient management.
To investigate the non-linear and time-dependent effects of pre- and post-procedural hs-cTnT levels on outcomes after TAVI, these findings were compared to the dichotomized definition of PPMI proposed by the Valve Academic Research Consortium-3 (VARC-3).
Consecutive patients undergoing TAVI between 2011 and 2024 at two tertiary university hospitals with available hs-cTnT measurements were enrolled. The primary outcome was all-cause mortality at 1 year. Multivariable Cox proportional hazards models were fitted. To relax the proportional hazards assumption, allowing for hazard ratios (HRs) to vary over time and across hs-cTnT values, a Royston-Parmar model was fitted.
Among 5158 patients, the HR for all-cause mortality at 1 year associated with VARC-3 defined PPMI was not statistically significant. Continuous variable analysis showed that both higher pre- and post-procedural hs-cTnT levels correlated with increased all-cause mortality risk at 1 year. Time-dependent models revealed the hazard to be greatest for higher hs-cTnT levels early post-procedurally and to decline over time.
The dichotomized VARC-3 definition of PPMI showed no prognostic value. Modelling hs-cTnT as continuous and time-dependent revealed a dynamic risk trajectory after TAVI. Incorporating these non-linear and time-dependent effects into risk prediction models may improve clinical decision-making and personalize post-procedural surveillance."

We retrospectively reviewed the medical records of 129 patients who underwent the Ozaki procedure between January 2017 to July 2025. The cohort was divided into a PMV group that included patients with ≥ 75th (20.5 h) percentile for duration of mechanical ventilation and a Non-PMV group which included all other patients. Similarly, the cohort was divided into a PPH group that included patients with ≥ 75th (14d) percentile for duration of postoperative hospital stay and a Non-PPH group which included all other patients. There were 36 cases (27.91%) with postoperative PMV and 34 cases (26.36%) with postoperative PPH. There was no death in the non-PMV group, while 2 patients in the PMV group died in hospital and 1 patient underwent heart transplantation during follow-up. One patient in the PPH group and one in the non-PPH group died in hospital, and one patient in the PPH group underwent transplantation during follow-up. Patients in the PMV or PPH group were younger, had lower body weight, had lower preoperative LVEF, had more concomitant procedures, had longer cardiopulmonary bypass time, longer aortic cross-clamp time, longer operation time, longer cardiac intensive care unit stay, longer mechanical ventilation time, longer postoperative hospital stay, a higher rate of delayed chest closure and a higher rate of early reoperation, However, during follow-up, the results were similar to those of the control group for moderate or greater aortic valve stenosis or regurgitation, aortic valve dysfunction, neoaortic valve reoperation, late any reoperation and death/transplantation after surgery.

However, as a diagnostic test, the real-world clinical utility of AI-ECG reliability requires the consistency of its results when repeated under similar conditions.
To evaluate the reliability of AI-ECG models for different ECGs for the same person, across different diagnostic labels, and using varied modeling approaches.
We used ECG images (2000-2024) from 5 hospitals and an outpatient network within a large, integrated US health system. For each individual, we identified multiple ECGs recorded within a 30-day period. We evaluated 7 models: 6 convolutional neural networks (CNNs) trained to detect individual SHDs, including LV systolic dysfunction, left valve diseases and severe LVH; an ensemble XGBoost integrating individual CNNs as a composite screen for multiple SHDs. We used concordance correlation coefficient (CCC), Spearman correlation, Cohen's kappa, and percent agreement in binary screen status to test model reliability. We evaluated factors associated with different AI-ECG outputs (Δ probability> 0.5) and assessed stability across ECG layouts (digital, printed, photo).
Across sites, we identified 1,118,263 ECG pairs, with a median 1 (1-3) days between ECGs. The ensemble XGBoost had the higher test-retest correlation (CCC: 0.89-0.92) and agreement (kappa: 0.75-0.82) between pairs compared with CNNs (CCC: 0.78-0.88; kappa: 0.57-0.72). After adjusting for demographics, ECG pairs that included one or both inpatient ECG were significantly more likely to yield unstable predictions (ORs: 1.60 [1.50-1.70] and 1.91 [1.78-2.05], respectively) compared with pairs with both ECGs obtained in outpatient settings. Among outpatient pairs across sites, the XGBoost model had a CCC of 0.89-0.94, a Spearman correlation of 0.90-0.94, and a kappa of 0.78-0.84, with concordance rates of 89-92%. Notably, ensemble model predictions were also stable across different ECG layouts.
An ensemble AI-ECG model integrating multiple CNN predictions had higher reliability compared with models for individual disorders. Discordance was more common in inpatient ECGs, suggesting instability in high-acuity settings. Reliable ensemble AI-ECG model outputs support readiness for clinical implementation for SHD screening.

While each condition has been extensively studied in isolation, there is limited data on the clinical characteristics of patients with combined AS-MS.
We retrospectively identified patients with significant AS and concomitant significant MS from the echocardiography database between 2003 and 2018. Exclusion criteria included left ventricular ejection fraction <50%, other significant valvular lesions, prior cardiac surgery, and associated congenital heart disease. Patients with isolated AS were compared to patients with combined AS-MS.
Of 1470 patients with severe AS, a total of 353 patients were included: 41 with combined AS-MS and 312 with isolated AS. The prevalence of combined AS-MS was 11% among patients with significant AS. Compared to patients with isolated AS, patients with combined AS-MS were significantly younger (50 vs. 63 years, p < 0.001), had a lower prevalence of hypertension (44% vs. 64%, P = 0.017) and diabetes (22% v. 42%, p = 0.013), and a greater prevalence of atrial fibrillation (17% vs. 5%, p = 0.003). Patients with combined AS-MS had a significantly larger left atrial size (4.79 ± 0.70 cm vs. 3.93 ± 0.73 cm, p < 0.001), higher peak tricuspid velocities (3.14 ± 0.59 m/s vs. 2.72 ± 0.45 m/s, p < 0.001), and greater prevalence of moderate or severe tricuspid regurgitation (15% vs. 1%, p < 0.001). Echocardiographic parameters assessing transvalvular flow rate did not differ significantly between the two groups. After multivariate adjustment for age and gender combined AS-MS was associated with worse 5-year overall survival (HR 2.672, 95% CI 1.060-6.732, p = 0.037).
Combined mitral and aortic stenosis is not uncommon (11%) but linked to worse outcomes than isolated AS. Despite expectations, concomitant significant MS did not increase prevalence of paradoxical low-flow, low-gradient AS."
PubMed,aortic stenosis,Access Site and Pacemaker Outcomes After TAVR in HFrEF Patients: Axillary vs Femoral Approach.,Laith Rhabneh; Raed Ababneh; Emad Algorani; Jamil Wafi; Mohammed Alkhanafsa; Huthaifa Ababneh; Abdel Rahman Alwardat; Mohammed Aloqaily,10.5455/aim.2025.33.209-214,2025,Acta informatica medica : AIM : journal of the Society for Medical Informatics of Bosnia & Herzegovina : casopis Drustva za medicinsku informatiku BiH,"Aortic stenosis is a prevalent disease affecting approximately 10% of the population by the eighth decade, it is a fatal disease without treatment, with an annual mortality rate reaching 25%. Valve replacement, either through surgical or transcatheter approach, is the only therapeutic option. Over the last 15 years, the indications for transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) have spread to include young and low surgical risk patients.
Our study aims to address this gap in the literature by comparing the adverse outcome after TAVR through axillary versus femoral access in heart failure reduce ejection fraction (HFrEF) patients who underwent TAVR within 30 days of the procedure.
We used data from TriNetX US collaborative network database, including HFrEF patients who had TAVR through axillary or femoral access between 2015 and 2025. Propensity score matching was done to minimize the difference in baseline characteristics between the two cohorts. Outcomes were observed within the first 30 days of TAVR.
A total of 206 patients in each cohort (axillary vs. femoral) were studied after propensity score matching. The incidence of permanent pacemaker (PPM) insertion was comparable between groups (5.0% vs. 5.1%; OR: 0.984, 95% CI: 0.400-2.419; HR: 0.365, 95% CI: 0.097-1.376; p = 0.157). Secondary outcomes showed no significant differences between the axillary and femoral approaches, including major vascular complications (OR: 0.542, 95% CI: 0.238-1.231; HR: 0.448, 95% CI: 0.192-1.046), acute kidney injury (OR: 0.922, 95% CI: 0.430-1.976; HR: 0.940, 95% CI: 0.459-1.922), all-cause mortality (OR: 1.010, 95% CI: 0.411-2.482; HR: 1.040, 95% CI: 0.433-2.498), cerebrovascular accident (OR: 0.980, 95% CI: 0.390-2.460; HR: 1.142, 95% CI: 0.384-3.399), and acute coronary syndrome (OR: 0.885, 95% CI: 0.355-2.208; HR: 1.211, 95% CI: 0.271-5.412).
Our study finding showed no difference in the permanent pacemaker insertion or secondary outcomes (Major vascular complications, Acute Kidney Injury, Cerebrovascular accident, Acute coronary syndrome, and All-cause mortality) within the first 30 days of TAVR in patients with HFrEF, whether the access axillary or femoral."

Initially supported with a percutaneous femoral IABP, the patient developed significant lower limb deconditioning. To mitigate this, a surgically placed tunneled Dacron graft IABP was introduced to improve mobility and reduce atrophy, enabling structured prehabilitation while awaiting orthotopic heart transplantation (OHT). This approach allowed for safe ambulation and physical therapy without compromising device function, ultimately enhancing functional status pre-OHT. Post-transplant, he required temporary veno-arterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) and IABP support for primary graft dysfunction and was eventually weaned off devices. Another case involved a 63-year-old male transferred from an outside hospital (OSH) with 95% left mainstem stenosis and diffuse triple vessel coronary artery disease (preoperative right femoral IABP was placed). After emergency triple vessel coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG), he required left femoral veno-arterial ECMO for poor right ventricular (RV) function. He recovered postoperatively, had subsequent ECMO decannulation and IABP replacement with tunneled graft, and was able to engage in physical therapy, with improvement in upright tolerance. Further research is needed to assess infection risks and validate the promising tunneled Dacron graft technique."

100 patients receiving TAVR surgery were selected and rolled into an observation group (Obs group, 50 cases) and a control group (Ctrl group, 50 cases) according to postoperative myocardial status. The changes in MEP before and after the TAVR and the STP within 3 days after surgery were compared and analysed.
Creatine Kinase MB (CK-MB) levels were (21.6±8.8) IU/L, (17.2±7.1) IU/L, and (15.2±6.4) IU/L at 12 h, 24 h, and 72 h after TAVR, respectively, in the Obs group; and the cTnT levels were (0.284±0.13) ng/mL, (0.315±0.15) ng/mL, and (0.363±0.22) ng/mL, respectively, at the same time points. The CK-MB and cTnT levels in the Obs group were increased more obviously based on the conditions in the Ctrl group (P&lt;0.05). After surgery, 23 cases of bleeding occurred in the Obs group, significantly more than 8 cases in the Ctrl group (P&lt;0.05). Differences in ultrasonic test results were not obvious (P&gt;0.05).
The MEP of patients after TAVR generally increased, and the increase in the degree of patients with MD was more significant, which may be an indicator to judge the postoperative MD. Patients with postoperative MD had a higher probability of postoperative bleeding."
PubMed,aortic stenosis,Aortic Calcification Can Serve as an Independent Predictor of Arteriovenous Fistula Failure in Maintenance Hemodialysis Patients.,Zhuang Feng; Wang Yingdeng; Xian Shuli,10.7759/cureus.95213,2025-10,Cureus,"Background This study aimed to observe the relationship between aortic calcification and the primary patency rate of new autologous internal fistulas in maintenance hemodialysis patients and to explore the possibility of predicting the dysfunction of autologous internal fistulas using the aortic calcification score. Methodology A total of 75 patients who underwent autologous arteriovenous fistula and hemodialysis for the first time in our hospital between January 2016 and December 2019 were selected. Abdominal aortic calcification index (ACI) was recorded at the time of internal fistula establishment. Patients were divided into high- and low-calcification groups based on the ACI results. The primary patency rate of autologous internal fistulas in the two groups was observed over five years. Results Of the 75 patients, 70 (93.33%) had varying degrees of aortic calcification, with 37 patients in the high calcification group (ACI > 10%). During the five-year follow-up period, 64 patients developed internal fistula dysfunction due to various causes, including 35 cases of thrombosis and 19 cases of fistula stenosis. At 12, 36, and 60 months, the primary patency rates of internal fistulas in the low calcification group were 92.5%, 57.5%, and 17.5%, respectively, whereas those in the high calcification group were 85.7%, 30.4%, and 9.1%, respectively. The difference in primary patency rates between the two groups was statistically significant after five years (F = 4.443, p = 0.035). Cox analysis showed that autologous internal fistula dysfunction was related to ACI (hazard ratio = 2.114, 95% confidence interval = 1.146-3.899, p = 0.017). Conclusions A higher aortic calcification score was associated with dysfunction of the autologous arteriovenous fistula within five years. Patients with higher aortic calcification scores require more frequent monitoring of the internal fistula function and early intervention to prolong the service life of the internal fistula."

He was non vegetarian and had no addictions. On general physical examination his vitals were stableand respiratory system examination revealed decreased breath sounds in the right hemithorax. All his routineblood investigations were normal. Chest radiograph revealed homogenous opacity in the right middle andlower zones. Contrast enhanced computed tomography of thorax and abdomen showed a well defined encapsulatedcystic lesion of size 12x10x14cm with internal floating membranes (water lily sign or Camelotte sign) with masseffect on adjacent lung parenchyma causing atelectasis and compression of adjacent vessels (Figure 1). Hydatid serology (IgG) was positive. Patient was treated symptomatically and referred for surgical intervention."

These parameters need to be considered when cut-off values indicating the need for&#x0D; treatment or even surgery are established. The aim of present work is to study the relation of&#x0D; weight of the heart with age and weight of cadaver.&#x0D; Material and Methods: The study was performed in the Department of Anatomy, Shri Ram&#x0D; Murti Smarak Institute of Medical Sciences, Bareilly on 30 hearts from embalmed cadavers.&#x0D; The hearts were procured from the cadavers available in our department. The heart was&#x0D; thoroughly cleaned and measurements were taken.&#x0D; Results: The mean heart weight was 223.37 ± 57.78 g. Significant relationship between age of&#x0D; the cadaver and weight of the heart (p=0.0004), weight of cadaver and weight of heart&#x0D; (p=0.0001) was observed.&#x0D; Conclusion: The above study provides valuable data of the heart in our geographical location,&#x0D; which may be useful for cardiac surgeons and physicians."
