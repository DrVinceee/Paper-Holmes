Data on the clinical burden associated with elevated lipoprotein(a) levels in patients at high and very high cardiovascular risk remain limited. We evaluated the prevalence of ASCVD and LDL-C target achievement in subjects with high and very high elevated Lp(a) levels referred to a lipid unit.
In this retrospective study, 1755 subjects were evaluated; 265 with Lp(a) ≥240nmol/L were included. The population was divided into two groups: high Lp(a) (240-429nmol/L, n=216) and very high Lp(a) (≥430nmol/L, n=49). ASCVD prevalence was 58% in the very high group and 48% in the high group (p=0.23). Age and statin intensity were higher in the very high Lp(a) group. LDL-C target achievement was low in both groups: 20.0% and 25.4% of very high-risk patients reached <55mg/dL as well as 18.2% and 17.2% of high-risk patients reached <70mg/dL in very high and high Lp(a) groups, respectively.
Subjects with elevated Lp(a) levels showed a high prevalence of ASCVD and low LDL-C target attainment despite high-intensity statin therapy. These findings support the need for Lp(a) screening and additional lipid-lowering strategies in high-risk patients."

This study evaluated the prognostic impact of PPM following TAVI in relation to baseline right-sided cardio-pulmonary remodelling.
Consecutive patients who underwent transfemoral TAVI for severe symptomatic AS between 2015 and 2022 were identified (n=1,118). PPM was defined at discharge according to Valve Academic Research Consortium-3 criteria. Baseline right-sided cardio-pulmonary remodelling was defined as either right ventricular dysfunction (RVD: tricuspid annular plane systolic excursion [TAPSE] <17mm) or pulmonary hypertension (PH: pulmonary arterial systolic pressure [PASP] ≥60mmHg). Multivariable Cox regression identified independent predictors of all-cause mortality.
Moderate and severe PPM were observed in 235 (21.0%) and 72 (6.4%) patients, respectively, and RVD and PH in 95 (8.5%) and 286 (26.0%) patients, respectively. Moderate (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR] 1.42 [95% CI 1.15-1.76], p<0.001) and severe (aHR 5.94 [95% CI 4.45-7.94], p<0.001) PPM were independently associated with all-cause mortality. In patients with moderate and severe PPM, PH (aHR 1.48 [95% CI 1.08-2.03], p=0.014) and RVD (aHR 2.14 [95% CI 1.07-4.29], p=0.033) were significant and independent predictors of all-cause mortality. In patients with baseline RVD/PH, severe PPM (aHR 4.75 [95% CI 3.20-7.04], p<0.001) remained significantly and independently associated with all-cause mortality.
PPM is associated with increased risk of mortality following TAVI, particularly in patients with pre-existing right-sided cardio-pulmonary remodelling. These results support the need for improved detection and prevention of PPM after TAVI, especially in vulnerable subgroups of AS patients with RVD/PH."

Advances,"Reduced LV ejection fraction (LVEF) in aortic stenosis may result from afterload mismatch or reduced contractility. Limited data exist on post-transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) LVEF changes and factors linked to persistent low LVEF.
The aim of this substudy was to identify variables associated with persistent low LVEF after TAVI.
The COMPARE-TAVI 1 trial is an all-comer study in which patients scheduled for transfemoral TAVI were randomized 1:1 to receive either the Sapien 3/Sapien 3 Ultra or Myval/Myval Octacor transcatheter heart valve. Patients were categorized into 2 groups based on their baseline LVEF: low LVEF (≤40%) or normal LVEF (>40%). Serial LVEF were analyzed alongside 12-month mortality.
Of 1,029 patients, men comprised 60%. The mean LVEF was 55% ± 14%. Among patients with low baseline LVEF (n = 151, 15%), the mean LVEF improved from 31% ± 6% to 45% ± 15% at 1 month, and 52% ± 14% at 12 months (P < 0.001). However, 20% of these patients had persistent LVEF ≤40% at 1 year, while 5% of patients with normal baseline LVEF declined to ≤40%. Chronic heart failure, pacemaker pre-TAVI, baseline LVEF, left ventricular end-diastolic diameter, aortic mean gradient, and stroke volume index were associated with persistent low LVEF at 1 year. No significant differences in 1-year mortality were observed between groups.
TAVI improves LVEF in the majority of patients with low baseline LVEF. However, a subset of patients experiences persistent left ventricular impairment, with chronic heart failure, pacemaker, and baseline LVEF as key predictors."

Transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) is effective in MAVD patients with mortality rates comparable to pure aortic stenosis (PAS). While most TAVR complications also occur at similar rates between the MAVD and PAS populations, recent studies have shown conflicting results.
A systematic literature review was conducted on PubMed and Embase for studies on the outcomes of TAVR in MAVD from inception until May 2024. Primary outcomes were short- and long-term mortality. Secondary outcomes were paravalvular regurgitation (PVR), vascular and bleeding complications, pacemaker implantation, and cerebrovascular complications. A random-effects model was used to pool risk ratios (RR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI).
Eleven observational studies, including 133,558 patients, were included in the analysis. There were no significant differences in primary endpoints (p>0.05). MAVD was associated with a higher risk of paravalvular regurgitation (RR: 1.29, 95% CI: 1.07-1.55) and higher risk of vascular complications (RR: 1.20, 95% CI: 1.01-1.44). No significant differences were noted in other secondary outcomes (p>0.05), although there was a nonsignificant trend towards a decreased risk of cerebrovascular complications associated with TAVR in MAVD patients.
TAVR is an intervention with similar mortality and complication risk in MAVD and PAS patients. Future research is needed to further clarify the outcomes of TAVR in patients with MAVD, especially regarding cerebrovascular complications, long-term mortality, and the association of paravalvular regurgitation with mortality."

Advances,"Homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (HoFH) is a rare genetic disorder characterized by extreme elevations in low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels and premature cardiovascular disease.
The objective of this study was to assess the prevalence, clinical presentation, and current therapeutic approaches for aortic stenosis in Canadian patients with HoFH.
Demographic data, lipid profiles, and genetic testing results for patients with HoFH were collected prospectively since 2008. Reports from echocardiography, cardiac catheterization, and surgical or transcatheter interventions involving the aortic valve and/or ascending aorta were retrieved from medical records.
Data were available for 63 patients with either a clinical diagnosis (n = 14, 22.2%) or genetic confirmation (n = 49, 77.8%) of HoFH. The median age at diagnosis was 14.0 years (Q1-Q3: 6.0 to 31.0), the median highest recorded low-density lipoprotein cholesterol level was 13.0 mmol/L (Q1-Q3: 10.6-16.3), and 17 patients (27.0%) developed moderate-to-severe aortic stenosis. Extensive calcification of the aortic valve and ascending aorta, combined with severe valvular and/or supravalvular stenosis and coronary ostial stenosis, necessitated complex and often consecutive surgical procedures. Six transcatheter aortic valve replacements were performed in 4 patients, 4 of which failed. Thirteen patients (20.6%) underwent at least 1 surgical aortic valve procedure. Patients developed aortic stenosis at a young age despite intensive treatment, including lipoprotein apheresis started at an early age.
Moderate-to-severe aortic stenosis was observed in 27.0% of patients in the Canadian HoFH Registry, with 20.6% requiring invasive intervention. The severe aortic phenotype associated with HoFH requires complex, multidisciplinary surgical management in specialized centers with appropriate expertise."

Comparative outcome data for balloon-expandable valves (BEV) and self-expanding valves (SEV) in this population remain scarce.
This retrospective single-center study evaluated 246 consecutive subjects with left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) < 50% who underwent transfemoral TAVR between January 2015 and June 2025. Clinical, echocardiographic, and procedural characteristics were compared between BEV (n = 96) and SEV (n = 150) recipients. Long-term all-cause mortality served as the primary endpoint.
Individuals treated with BEV were older (78.8 +- 7.9 vs. 75.7 +- 9.8 years; P = 0.019) and demonstrated higher EuroSCORE II (European System for Cardiac Operative Risk Evaluation II) values (24.9 +- 6.2% vs. 22.2 +- 15.8%; P = 0.01). Periprocedural and in-hospital clinical outcomes, including mortality, vascular complications, and pacemaker requirement, were comparable between groups. SEV implantation yielded lower post-procedural transvalvular gradients (mean 7.8 +- 4.0 mmHg vs. 9.6 +- 4.1 mmHg; P = 0.001). Although crude mortality was observed more frequently among BEV patients (50.0% vs. 36.0%; P = 0.041), Kaplan-Meier survival curves showed no survival difference (log-rank P = 0.92). In multivariable Cox regression, predictors of long-term mortality included older age (hazard ratio [HR] 1.05; P = 0.007), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) (HR: 2.64; P < 0.001), coronary artery disease (HR: 2.08; P = 0.018), lower serum albumin (HR: 0.63; P = 0.011), and lower hemoglobin (HR: 0.84; P = 0.023); valve type was not predictive.
In patients with LVSD undergoing TAVR, BEV and SEV provided comparable procedural and long-term outcomes. Although SEV yielded lower postoperative gradients, valve type did not affect survival. Future studies with larger samples and higher use of new-generation devices are warranted to refine valve selection in this high-risk group."

We aimed to determine the incidence and risk factors for CVE at 30 days and 1 year after TAVI in a large, real-world patient cohort and evaluate the association of these events with all-cause mortality at 1 year.
All consecutive patients undergoing TAVI at a single centre between April 2008 and February 2024 were included in the analysis. CVE were defined as a composite of stroke and transient ischaemic attack.
One thousand and three patients (mean age 81.8 ± 7.0 years, 52.6% male, median EuroSCORE II 6% [Q1 = 3.51%; Q3 = 10.9%]) underwent TAVI with a self-expandable valve (SEV) (n = 275; 27.4%) or balloon-expandable valve (BEV) (n = 728; 72.6%). The cumulative incidence of CVE was 3.6% (95% confidence interval (95% CI) = [2.6%; 4.9%], n = 36) at 30 days (77.8% within 48 h) and 6.2% (95% CI = [4.8%; 7.8%], n = 62) at 1 year. Risk factors associated with a lower risk of CVE at 30 days included BEV vs. SEV (OR 0.32 [0.16-0.63], p = 0.0009) and larger baseline aortic valve area (AVA) (ORUnit = 0.1 cm2 0.74 [0.61-0.91], p = 0.0035), while the risk was higher in the case of new-onset atrial fibrillation (AF) (OR 3.19 [1.18-8.59], p = 0.0218), diabetes (OR 2.00 [1.01-3.97], p = 0.0484), and conversion to sternotomy (OR 16.57 [4.62-59.48], p < 0.0001). Analysis at 1-year follow-up identified the same associations. Finally, the occurrence of CVE significantly increased 1-year all-cause mortality (OR 2.44 [1.32-4.50], p = 0.0045).
CVE after TAVI were associated with double the odds of 1-year all-cause mortality. Risk factors associated with CVE include the use of a SEV, new-onset AF, diabetes, conversion to sternotomy, and a smaller AVA."

This shift raises important questions about valve durability, reintervention strategies, and long-term outcomes compared with surgical aortic valve replacement. Younger patients often present with unique anatomical challenges, including bicuspid aortic valves, and are expected to outlive their first valve prosthesis, making lifetime management a central concern. While new valve technologies show promise, long-term data remain limited. Careful patient selection, shared decision-making, and ongoing prospective studies are essential to guide the role of TAVR in this population."

Digital health,"There is a lack of studies investigating the pathophysiologic and phenotypic distinctiveness of aortic stenosis (AS). This heterogeneity has important implications for identifying optimal intervention timing and potential medical management. This study seeks to identify phenogroups of AS using unsupervised machine learning to improve risk stratification.
A total of 349 patients with asymptomatic AS from the PROGRESSA study were included in this analysis. Echocardiographic, clinical and blood sample data were used in the unsupervised clustering process. Longitudinal echocardiographic data were used to evaluate AS progression. Five clusters of patients were revealed using 18 variables selected by an unsupervised machine learning algorithm. Amongst them, aortic valvular phenotype, mean gradient, peak jet velocity (Vpeak), and left ventricle stroke volume were selected as discriminatory variables. Following the clustering process, characteristics differed between clusters, including age, body mass index, and sex ratio (all P < 0.001). Of note, cluster 1 showed higher AS severity at baseline with significantly higher initial Vpeak (344 [314; 376] cm/s) and calcium score (1257 [806; 1837] UA) (P < 0.001). Patients from cluster 1 had a faster AS progression (progression of Vpeak = 22 [9; 39] cm/s/year), and calcium score (213 [111; 307] UA/year) (P < 0.001). Cluster 1 was also associated with a higher composite risk of mortality and aortic valve replacement when adjusted for age, sex, and baseline AS severity (P < 0.001).
Artificial intelligence-guided phenotypic classification revealed 5 distinct groups and enhanced risk stratification of patients with AS. This approach may be useful to optimize and individualize medical and interventional management of AS."

While Impella-supported high-risk PCI (HRPCI) has demonstrated improved outcomes, its safety in patients with AS remains inadequately established.
We evaluated the effectiveness and safety of Impella support in patients with AS undergoing HRPCI.
Patients from the PROTECT III study (NCT04136392), a single-arm, FDA-audited, multicenter investigation of Impella-supported HRPCI, were assessed. AS severity was classified as none/trivial, mild, moderate, or severe. The primary outcome was 90-day major adverse cardiac and cerebrovascular events [MACCE, defined as the composite of all-cause mortality, MI, stroke/transient ischemic attack (TIA), and revascularization]. Secondary outcomes included in-hospital complications, stroke/TIA, and vascular complications requiring surgery.
Of the 594 patients with available echocardiographic data, 490 had none/trivial AS, while 34, 24, and 46 had mild, moderate, or severe AS, respectively. Patients with AS were older, had fewer incidences of diabetes, were more likely to have left main disease, and had higher left ventricular ejection fraction. Severely calcified lesions and atherectomy were more frequent among patients with moderate or severe AS. No significant differences were observed in PCI-related complications, stroke/TIA, and 30-day or 90-day MACCE across AS severity groups. However, transfusion rates were higher in patients with AS.
In patients undergoing Impella-supported HRPCI, 90-day MACCE and PCI-related complications were similar across all levels of AS severity. These findings suggest that the procedure is safe in this complex, high-risk population.

We aimed to evaluate the impact of a CVC in managing the treatment pathway of patients undergoing TAVI across Europe before and after implementing 8 Benchmark best practices.
The BENCHMARK registry (ClinicalTrials NCT04579445) was a multicenter international study of patients with severe symptomatic aortic stenosis undergoing TAVI with balloon-expandable valves across 28 European centers. Primary outcomes were hospital and intensive care length of stay (LoS). The secondary outcome was 30-day patient safety.
Of 2323 patients, 1262 were treated at centers without a pre-existing CVC and 1061 at centers with a pre-existing CVC; propensity matching resulted in 891 matched pairs. The total procedural time was significantly reduced in both groups (p < 0.001) after implementing Benchmark best practices. Hospital LoS was lower before Benchmark when a CVC was present and was significantly shorter in both groups following implementation (p < 0.001), as was the critical care LoS (p < 0.001). The presence of a CVC did not affect safety outcomes but was associated with a reduced risk of major vascular bleeding when combined with Benchmark best practices. Patient satisfaction was higher in centers with a pre-existing CVC (p < 0.001).
The addition of a CVC to the multidisciplinary team and their sustained contributions to processes of care align with the implementation of Benchmark practices, significantly decrease the health service requirements of TAVI patients, and are associated with improved patient-reported experiences."

However, the decision to continue anticoagulation therapy during the TAVR perioperative period and the optimal regimen for postoperative anticoagulation therapy remain debatable.
We searched the PubMed, EMBASE, MEDLINE, and Cochrane Library databases from their date of establishment to September 2024. We evaluated the choice of anticoagulation regimen in the TAVR perioperative and postoperative period. The primary outcomes were stroke, major bleeding, all-cause death, and net adverse clinical events (NACEs). The secondary outcomes were any bleeding, life-threatening bleeding, thrombotic events, and cardiovascular death. We conducted a meta-analysis with a RR and 95% CI. We performed subgroup analyses based on the follow-up duration, study design, and whether oral antiplatelet drugs (OAP) were used.
We compared four studies with peri-procedural continuation or discontinuation of oral anticoagulants (OACs). We did not observe a difference between the two groups with major bleeding, stroke, all-cause death, and NACEs (P > 0.05). Seventeen studies compared the effects of direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) and vitamin K antagonists (VKAs) after TAVR. The risk of NACEs (RR: 0.84, 95% CI :0.71-0.99, P = 0.04) and cardiovascular death (RR: 0.78, 95% CI: 0.69-0.87, P < 0.0001) was significantly lower in the DOACs than in the VKAs, but there were no statistically significant differences between the two groups with other outcomes. In the subgroup analysis, the beneficial effects of DOACs on NACEs were observed in the early postoperative (P < 0.05). During the long-term follow-up time after TAVR, DOACs had a lower risk of all-cause mortality and cardiovascular death compared to VKAs (P < 0.05), but an increased risk of any bleeding (P < 0.05). In RCTs, the risk of any bleeding owing to DOACs was higher (P < 0.05). In cohort studies, DOACs led to lower NACEs and cardiovascular death (P < 0.05). When administered in combination with OAP drugs, DOACs posed a lower risk for cardiovascular death and all-cause death than VKAs (P < 0.05). If not administered in combination with OAP drugs, DOACs posed a lower risk for all-cause death (P < 0.05).
In patients undergoing TAVR with established indications for OACs, periprocedural continuation of OACs may offer comparable clinical outcomes to temporary discontinuation. Furthermore, DOACs after TAVR appear to be associated with more favorable clinical outcomes than VKAs, although this benefit must be weighed against a potentially increased risk of bleeding. Further large-scale RCTs are warranted to validate these findings."

Despite advances, stroke remains a serious complication, impacting morbidity, mortality, and long-term cognitive function, thus the need for effective prevention strategies.
Based on a targeted review of the PubMed literature, this review addresses mechanisms and risk factors for stroke after TAVR and evaluates current preventive approaches. Cerebral embolic protection devices (CEPDs), particularly the Sentinel system, are discussed alongside other devices. Antithrombotic strategies before, during, and after TAVR are also reviewed, emphasizing the balance between thromboembolic protection and bleeding risk in an elderly population.
While some studies suggest CEPDs may reduce stroke, randomized trials have not confirmed broad and robust benefit, and high cost limits routine adoption. Future work should focus on high-risk subgroups, device refinement, and large-scale trials. For now, individualized antithrombotic therapy and selective CEPD use remain central to stroke prevention in TAVR."

Uncertainty and the need for reliable information regarding symptoms and progress was a significant problem.While some expressed unease at a major intervention for an asymptomatic condition, there were no outright objections to the idea.Those who declined participation in the RCT did so for personal reasons, for example, their home circumstances did not permit the required period of recovery or they felt too old to risk intervention.Reasons for accepting early intervention included the belief that the condition was serious and likely to deteriorate, and so better to have the intervention before such deterioration, as well as avoiding long waiting lists. Trusting clinicians' judgement played a part in some decisions. Patients also wanted choice in the type of intervention received.The longitudinal interviews (n=32) showed satisfaction in the early intervention group despite some problems in the the early recovery phase, especially for those undergoing surgical AVR.
Where evidence supports major intervention for an asymptomatic condition, patients are likely to accept the offer, although personal circumstances play an important role in decision-making. Where a condition is not well known to the public, such as AS, patients rely on clinicians and other resources to help decide. Liaison with patient groups in developing shared decision-making resources may help with complex decisions.

It demonstrates that not all aortic diseases are amenable to endovascular treatment and that open surgical treatment remains highly important, especially in younger patients with hereditary aortic diseases."

Cardiovascular Imaging,"Assessing cardiac function is critical for managing cardiovascular disease, guiding treatment, monitoring progression, and risk stratification. While left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) is firmly established, it has limitations. Myocardial contraction fraction (MCF) - the ratio of stroke volume to myocardial volume, is simple to compute without additional analysis and offers a promising alternative to LVEF.
MCF was assessed across four datasets spanning healthy controls and chronic structural cardiac disease, with direct comparison to LVEF. Association between age, sex and MCF were investigated in 3,541 healthy subjects from the UK Biobank and sex-specific reference ranges derived. Several cohorts were recruited to investigate the discriminative power of MCF and LVEF between health and physiological adaption (n=278 veteran athletes), pathological hypertrophy (hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, amyloid, Fabry, severe aortic stenosis, and hypertension; n=633) and dilatation (n=103 dilated cardiomyopathy). Ability to track disease severity was assessed by looking at 41,558 subjects from the UK Biobank. Finally, prognostication was assessed on 1,277 consecutive patients from an independent external dataset. All images were analysed using the same validated AI algorithm.
MCF varied with sex (mean MCF: 0.94 male; 1.1 female) but not age. Sex-specific reference ranges were established: [0.68-1.20] for male, [0.82-1.38] for female. MCF decreased in pathological disease (e.g. mean MCF: 0.72 HCM; 0.69 severe AS; 0.5 amyloid; 0.9 hypertension) but there was no significant decrease in LVEF other than in amyloid (mean EF: 76% HCM; 64% severe AS; amyloid 56%; 65% hypertension). Both MCF and EF decreased in DCM (EF 34%; MCF 0.58). MCF decreased with worsening hypertension, whereas LVEF increased (P<0.05). MCF had superior prognostic ability to LVEF (MCF vs LVEF: HR=0.772 vs HR=0.816; χ²=198 vs χ²=151; p<0.001).
We established MCF reference ranges, showing superior performance for detecting early disease and tracking progression compared to LVEF. MCF offers enhanced prognostic utility, complementing established metrics of LV function."

This study sought to investigate 5-year clinical outcomes in patients with severe aortic stenosis with a small annulus compared with those with a large annulus following transcatheter aortic valve replacement with newer-generation balloon-expandable valves.
A total of 3182 patients with aortic stenosis treated with balloon-expandable valves were divided into small-annulus (≤430 mm2) and large-annulus (>430 mm2) groups. A 1:1 propensity-matched analysis was performed to adjust baseline differences. The primary end point was all-cause death at 5-year follow-up. Secondary end points included heart failure hospitalization, bioprosthetic valve failure, and aortic valve reintervention.
Among 533 matched pairs, compared with the large-annulus group, the small-annulus group had higher rates of aortic valve mean gradients ≥20 mm Hg (14.1% versus 2.9%; P<0.001) and severe prosthesis-patient mismatch (9.8% versus 5.2%; P=0.019). At 5 years, there were no significant differences in all-cause death (hazard ratio, 0.75 [95% CI, 0.52-1.09]; P=0.13). The incidence of heart failure rehospitalization, bioprosthetic valve failure, and aortic valve reintervention were similar between groups. Both groups achieved similar sustained improvements in New York Heart Association functional class and Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire-Overall Summary scores.
Despite higher transvalvular gradients and a greater rate of severe prosthesis-patient mismatch, 5-year clinical outcomes in patients with a small annulus were comparable to those with a large annulus following transcatheter aortic valve replacement using newer-generation balloon-expandable valves."

To describe the clinical spectrum, morphological variants and sarcomere gene mutations in patients with HCM from northwestern Mexico.
We conducted a prospective, cross-sectional study of patients diagnosed with HCM by echocardiography. Morphological variants were classified as: asymmetric septal, concentric, mid-cavity, lateral, and apical according to the location of the greatest LV thickening. Next-generation sequencing was performed with a predesigned panel of 19 genes associated with HCM.
A total of 110 patients (47.3% women; median age 58) were enrolled. Apical HCM was the most frequent morphological variant (42%), followed by asymmetric septal HCM (35%). Patients with apical HCM were older than those with other variants (p = 0.002). Patients with asymmetric septal hypertrophy had a higher septal/posterior wall thickness ratio (1.85 ± 0.6, p = 0.0001) and a larger left atrial anteroposterior diameter (48 ± 9, p = 0.0001). LV outflow obstruction, systolic anterior motion, and severe mitral regurgitation were more prevalent in patients with asymmetric septal HCM (p = 0.0001). Patients with concentric HCM had the greatest E/e' ratio (16.3 ± 8, p = 0.01). Among genotyped patients, 44% had a sarcomeric gene mutation, most commonly MYBPC3 (24%) and MYH7 (7%), with no significant differences across morphological variants.
Apical HCM was the most frequent morphological variant of HCM in the studied population. Consistent with global reports, MYBPC3 and MYH7 were the most commonly identified gene mutations."

This study compared early and late outcomes of the two approaches in patients with degenerative mitral regurgitation (MR).
A single-center retrospective analysis was performed of 976 patients (mean age 60 ± 13 years) who underwent mitral valve repair, with or without concomitant procedures, between 2001 and 2022. Patients were categorized by surgical approach: sternotomy (n = 437) or right mini-thoracotomy (n = 539).Early outcomes, long-term mortality, cumulative incidence of mitral-related reintervention, and serial echocardiographic changes were evaluated.
Median (interquartile range) clinical follow-up was 12.8 (8.4-16.6) years in the sternotomy group and 4.9 (3.1-7.1) years in the mini-thoracotomy group. In the matched cohort, the mini-thoracotomy approach was associated with shorter operative time and reduced hospital stay. In-hospital mortality was 0% in both approaches. The long-term all-cause mortality and cumulative incidence of mitral-related reoperation were comparable between the approaches. The mixed-effect model indicated both approaches achieved durable MR reduction and favorable left ventricular remodeling, while mini-thoracotomy showed greater reductions in left atrial size and tricuspid regurgitation gradient.
Compared with sternotomy, right mini-thoracotomy mitral repair provided excellent early safety and faster recovery. Long-term repair durability, reflected by comparable cumulative incidence of mitral-related reoperation, was similar to sternotomy, while survival estimates should be interpreted in the context of differential follow-up duration. When performed at experienced centers, minimally invasive mitral valve repair represents a viable alternative for degenerative MR."

Advances,"Mitral annular calcification (MAC) is a progressive degenerative condition characterized by calcium deposition on the mitral apparatus, and is associated with adverse outcomes. Data on mitral regurgitation (MR) caused by MAC are limited.
This study evaluates the prognostic significance of left atrial strain (LAS) in patients with severe MR due to MAC.
We conducted a retrospective, single-center cohort study including patients with isolated severe MR due to MAC. Clinical data were retrieved, and the primary outcome was all-cause mortality. Echocardiographic parameters including LAS were recorded. The cohort was stratified by the median reservoir LAS (LASr).
Between January 2010 and August 2023, 128 patients with isolated severe MR due to MAC were identified and followed for a median of 134 days (IQR: 33-1,812 days). The median age was 81 years (IQR: 71-88), and 93/128 patients (72.7%) were females. A total of 45/128 patients underwent mitral valve (MV) intervention, whereas 83/128 received conservative management. During follow-up, 63/128 patients died. Patients with LASr ≤13.6% had significantly poorer outcomes (P = 0.031), whereas MV intervention improved survival across the spectrum of LASr (P < 0.05). In multivariate Cox analysis, mortality risk increased as LASr worsened (HR: 1.054; 95% CI: 1.002-1.109), whereas MV intervention improved prognosis (HR: 0.173; 95% CI: 0.075-0.397).
LASr is associated with all-cause mortality in patients with isolated severe MR due to MAC and can serve as a valuable prognostic imaging marker for risk stratification. MV intervention improves prognosis across the spectrum of LASr."

The renal, internal carotid, and vertebral arteries are most frequently involved. Secondary arterial hypertension and stroke are common clinical manifestations of FMD, as illustrated in the present case. A 39-year-old leucodermic male with a history of arterial hypertension, treated with amlodipine 10 mg and valsartan 160 mg, with poor compliance, presented to the emergency department with a one-week history of left-sided weakness and inability to walk. On examination, he was hypertensive (189/98 mmHg), with normal cardiac and pulmonary auscultation, left-sided hemiparesis predominantly affecting the leg, and a hemiparetic gait. Initial and 24-hour follow-up brain CT scans showed no evidence of acute ischemic or hemorrhagic lesions. ECG revealed sinus rhythm and voltage criteria for left ventricular hypertrophy. Echocardiography demonstrated left ventricular hypertrophy, left atrial dilation, and mild mitral regurgitation. Transcranial Doppler showed no right-to-left shunt. Brain MRI revealed an ischemic lesion in the right side of the pons, and magnetic resonance angiography demonstrated the absence of flow in the V4 segment of the left vertebral artery and reduced caliber of the left internal carotid artery. Laboratory tests showed worsening renal function after initiation of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor therapy. Thrombophilia screening was negative. Due to suspected renal artery stenosis, CT angiography was performed, revealing saccular dilatations in both renal arteries with a ""string-of-beads"" appearance, suggestive of FMD. The patient was managed medically with blood pressure control. He began motor rehabilitation with partial recovery of neurological deficits and was discharged for follow-up in the outpatient clinic. In this patient, FMD was the underlying cause of the ischemic stroke that prompted hospitalization. The coexistence of difficult-to-control hypertension and target-organ damage in a young adult raised suspicion of secondary hypertension, and subsequent etiologic investigation led to the diagnosis of FMD."

Consequently, to address this challenge, intraoperative assessment of mitral valve coaptation pressure (MCP) has emerged as a promising approach. This study presents the first precise transcatheter measurement of MCP in animal hearts. Data were obtained using two custom-made force sensors: a 3Fr piezoresistive pressure catheter and a 15Fr flexible piezoelectric sensor. Experiments were conducted in both ex vivo (excised pig hearts activated by a pump) and in vivo (transseptal approach in a living pig) models. In a living pig with a healthy MV under normal hemodynamic conditions (peak systolic left ventricular pressure of 100 mmHg), the MCP ranged from 200 to 300 mmHg (25-40 kPa). Ex vivo experiments demonstrated that MCP was affected by transmitral pressure, mitral function changes (i.e., regurgitation), and MV morphology. These findings provide valuable insights into MV biomechanics and establish a solid foundation for developing medical devices to guide MVr procedures."

Asia,"Current guidelines do not include phenotypical classifications in functional mitral regurgitation (FMR).
The study sought to classify FMR into 3 morphological phenotypes and assess determinants of mortality.
We included patients with ≥moderately severe FMR from 2 tertiary centers. FMR was classified as ventricular functional mitral regurgitation with symmetrical tethering (VFMRst), ventricular functional mitral regurgitation with asymmetrical tethering (VFMRat), or atrial functional mitral regurgitation (AFMR). The primary composite endpoint was cardiovascular death and death equivalent (ie, left ventricular assist device implantation or heart transplantation).
Of 699 patients (70 years [Q1-Q3: 60-79 years], 46% female), VFMRst was the most prevalent (54%). VFMRat exhibited larger mitral regurgitation vena contracta (7.7 mm [Q1-Q3: 7-8.7 mm] vs 7.3 mm [Q1-Q3: 6.7-8.2 mm]) but smaller left ventricular end-diastolic volume index (100 mL/m2 [Q1-Q3: 83-128 mL/m2] vs 106 mL/m2 [Q1-Q3: 88-132 mL/m2]) than VFMRst (both P ≤ 0.037). AFMR with hamstrung posterior mitral valve (MV) exhibited larger left atrial volume index (96 mL/m2 [Q1-Q3: 77-145 mL/m2] vs 78 mL/m2 [Q1-Q3: 63-97 mL/m2]) and mitral regurgitation vena contracta (7.5 mm [Q1-Q3: 6.8-8.6 mm] vs 7.0 mm [Q1-Q3: 6.4-8.2] mm) than AFMR with central MV malcoaptation (both P ≤ 0.010). At a median follow-up of 2.6 years (Q1-Q3: 0.9-5 years), 193 primary endpoints occurred. Five-year event-free survival was higher in AFMR (71 ± 4%) than VFMRst (64 ± 3%) and VFMRat (63 ± 4%) (P ≤ 0.030), but adjusted outcomes were similar across groups (all P ≥ 0.139). Besides conventional markers, multivariable models demonstrated that low diastolic blood pressure (DBP), left atrial reservoir strain (LASr), and left ventricular longitudinal strain from the apical 4-chamber view (A4C-LVLS) independently linked to primary endpoints (all P ≤ 0.043). Adjusted spline curves showed increased primary endpoint risk with DBP ≤73.7 mm Hg, LASr ≤14.8%, and A4C-LVLS ≤9.3%.
VFMRat exhibited more disproportionate features than VFMRst. AFMR with hamstrung posterior MV may indicate a more advanced disease stage. Morphological phenotypes alone were not associated with adjusted outcomes. LASr, A4C-LVLS, and DBP may assist in risk stratification in FMR."

This retrospective study consecutively enrolled 175 patients with severe AS who underwent either SAVR or TAVR. Transthoracic echocardiograms obtained at baseline, 30 days, and 1 year after the procedure were analyzed by multiple echocardiographers at our institution.
At baseline, the TAVR group was significantly older (74 ± 7 years vs. 62 ± 9 years, p < 0.001) and had a higher prevalence of hypertension (53.5% vs. 31.0%, p = 0.003), coronary artery disease (38.4% vs. 23.0%, p = 0.028), and atrial fibrillation (16.3% vs. 2.3%, p = 0.002). Additionally, the TAVR cohort demonstrated significantly worse cardiac functional status (p < 0.001). Compared to TAVR patients, SAVR patients (N = 87) exhibited a more pronounced reduction in left ventricular end-systolic dimension (-0.5 ± 0.65 cm vs. -0.2 ± 0.47 cm, p < 0.001) and left ventricular end-diastolic dimension (-0.6 ± 0.64 cm vs. -0.3 ± 0.55 cm, p < 0.001) at the 1-month follow-up. A decrease in left ventricular mass was observed in both groups from baseline to 1 month postoperatively, with the SAVR group showing a significantly greater reduction (LV mass: -67.3 ± 59.31 g vs. -38.2 ± 46.49 g, p = 0.003; LVMI: -39.1 ± 33.93 g/m2 vs. -22.5 ± 27.08 g/m2, p = 0.005). However, these differences were not sustained at the 1-year follow-up. SAVR patients experienced a transient decline in right ventricular function at 1 month, which recovered by 1 year postoperatively. At the 1-year follow-up, the TAVR group experienced a higher incidence of Major Adverse Cardiac Events (MACE) (p = 0.01), despite showing significant improvement in the severity of both mitral and tricuspid regurgitation compared to baseline (p < 0.001). Although pulmonary artery pressure improved in both groups after AVR, the SAVR group demonstrated significantly lower pressure at 1 year (p < 0.001).
In patients with severe aortic stenosis, SAVR was associated with more significant regression of left ventricular dimensions and mass at 1 month compared to TAVR, alongside a transient impairment of right ventricular function. By 1 year postoperatively, however, no significant differences in ventricular remodeling were observed between the two groups."

Advances,"Acute mitral regurgitation (MR) is a serious complication of takotsubo syndrome (TTS). However, its incidence and prognostic implications are still poorly investigated.
This study aimed to assess the clinical characteristics, short- and long-term outcomes of patients with TTS complicated by acute, reversible, moderate or severe MR.
The study included TTS patients from the Takotsubo Italian Network multicenter registry. The primary outcome was the composite of in-hospital acute heart failure, cardiogenic shock, and mortality. Secondary outcomes included mortality and the recurrence of TTS at the longest available follow-up. The propensity score weighting technique was performed to account for potential confounders between patients with and without acute moderate or severe MR.
The study included 1,025 patients (mean age 70 ± 11 years, 91.6% females); of them, 186 (18.2%) showed acute moderate or severe MR. Logistic regression analysis showed a significantly higher risk for the primary outcome (adjusted OR: 2.29; 95% CI: 1.83-2.88), acute heart failure (adjusted OR: 2.17; 95% CI: 1.70-2.77), and cardiogenic shock (adjusted OR: 2.46; 95% CI: 1.69-3.59) in patients with acute MR compared to those without. Also, the coexistence of left ventricular outflow tract obstruction with acute MR further increased the risk for the primary outcome (adjusted OR: 5.26; 95% CI: 3.22-8.59). At long-term follow-up (median 29 months), patients who developed acute MR during hospitalization showed a significantly higher risk of mortality (adjusted HR: 1.82; 95% CI: 1.21-2.74).
In this real-world study, acute MR was associated with a significantly higher risk of adverse events during hospitalization and long-term mortality. Early echocardiographic detection of acute MR can support prognostic stratification and management of TTS patients."

Traditionally, physiologic pacing has been achieved with biventricular pacing with a right ventricular lead and a coronary sinus branch lead. Randomized trials involving more than 10,000 patients with heart failure have shown clinical, exercise, and quality-of-life benefits associated with biventricular pacing, as well as improved LVEF and reduced mitral regurgitation and ventricular volumes. These benefits are greatest in patients with left bundle-branch block and a QRS duration of 150 msec or longer. Recent studies support targeting the His bundle or left bundle branch as an alternative cardiac physiologic pacing strategy. Ongoing randomized trials are expected to more clearly define the comparative efficacy and safety of conduction system pacing as compared with biventricular pacing."

A single-center retrospective cohort study included 54 patients who underwent mitral valve repair for mitral regurgitation between January 2020 and July 2021. We measured the distance between the mitral annulus and the LCX (ML distance) using MPR of intraoperative TEE images. As an exploratory analysis, we compared the ML distance between patients with MAD (group D: N = 11) and those without (group N: N = 43).
The LCX was closest to the mitral annulus at 70-90 degrees counterclockwise from the anteroposterior axis. No cases of LCX injury were observed. MAD was most frequently observed at P1, and all patients in group D had disjunction at P1. The minimum ML distance was significantly shorter in group D than in group N (3.2 [1.1] mm in group D, and 4.9 [2.1] mm in group N). Overall, the ML distance was shorter in group D than in group N, and was significantly shorter at 70-100 degrees.

Data were retrieved from the multicenter European Registry of Type A Aortic Dissection (ERTAAD). Bootstrapped least absolute shrinkage and selection operator logistic regression and multilevel multivariate logistic regression were performed for variable selection to identify predictors of hospital death, and logistic regression was used for the prediction of CABG.
A total of 292 (8.04%) of 3633 patients required additional CABG. The in-hospital mortality rate was 33% for patients undergoing CABG vs 16% of non-CABG recipients (P < .001; odds ratio [OR], 2.52; 95% CI, 1.93-3.35). Dissection of the aortic root involving the right coronary cusp (P < .001; OR, 7.83; 95% CI, 5.55-11.0), a tear in the aortic root (P = .002; OR, 2.08; 95% CI, 1.29-3.32), mitral valve insufficiency (P = .034; OR, 1.33; 95% CI, 1.01-1.71), and a genetic syndrome (P < .001; OR, 3.23; 95% CI, 1.66-5.99) independently predicted the need for CABG.
The need for additional CABG is not a rare occurrence during repair of type A aortic dissection and is associated with an increased mortality risk. Intimal tear localization and right coronary sinus dissection should be carefully examined in the preoperative image evaluation to stratify the risk of revascularization and plan the most appropriate approach."

An 83-year-old man with unstable angina underwent a percutaneous coronary intervention. On the same night as the percutaneous coronary intervention, a guidewire perforation of the left circumflex artery side branch was identified, resulting in cardiac tamponade. Transcatheter embolization of the culprit vessel was performed using gelatin sponge particles. Severe acute mitral regurgitation with circulatory collapse developed 30 hours later secondary to anterolateral iPMR. Despite mechanical circulatory support, the patient died 2 days after mitral regurgitation onset.
Pathologic findings revealed embolic materials within the anterolateral papillary muscle, causing new papillary muscle necrosis and rupture.

Treatment pathways for aSMR are undefined, and limited data exist regarding outcomes following mitral transcatheter edge-to-edge repair (MTEER). The analysis aimed to evaluate outcomes in patients with aSMR treated with MTEER from the EXPANDed studies.
One-year outcomes were assessed in patients from the EXPANDed studies (EXPAND and EXPAND G4) who met criteria for aSMR. aSMR was defined by the presence of atrial fibrillation, left ventricular ejection fraction ≥45%, and at least 1 dilated LA parameter per echocardiographic core laboratory assessment: LA volume index, LA diameter, or LA diameter index.
Of the 967 patients with SMR treated with MTEER in the EXPANDed data set, 160 (17%) met criteria for aSMR. Patients with aSMR were elderly (78±8 years), symptomatic (Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire Overall Summary score, 48±27 pts), and had small left ventricular and large LA dimensions at baseline. Acute procedural success was achieved in 97.5% of patients with aSMR, with MR reduction to ≤1+ in 95.2% at 1 year. There were significant 1-year improvements in quality of life (+19 pt Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire Overall Summary) and functional capacity (New York Heart Association I/II 80%). The 1-year all-cause mortality rate was 9%, with patients experiencing a 56% reduction in 1-year heart failure hospitalization rates from pre- to post-MTEER.

Previous case reports include right ventricular dysfunction associated with sudden cardiac death and ventricular arrhythmia. Other case reports with similar clinical presentation triad differ by either left ventricular involvement or having an abnormal presentation of systemic diseases.
We report a case series of right ventricular dysfunction, atrial tachyarrhythmias, and cardiac conduction system disease in a single family. The proband in this case series is a 70-year-old Egyptian male who presented to our care for dual-chamber pacemaker generator replacement. He had the pacemaker for 10 years because of complete heart block. Device interrogation showed recorded paroxysmal atrial fibrillation episodes. Transthoracic echocardiography showed normal left ventricle internal dimensions and ejection fraction, dilated right ventricle with preserved systolic function, severe tricuspid regurgitation, and systolic pulmonary artery pressure of 40 mmHg. On reviewing his old records, there was no right ventricular affection 10 years ago; progressive right ventricular dysfunction occurred over the last decade. Despite guideline-directed medical therapy, the patient's clinical status deteriorated, and surgical tricuspid valve replacement was performed with a tissue valve. Since the surgical intervention, his clinical status and functional capacity improved, and repeated echocardiography showed no tricuspid regurgitation with persistence of the right ventricular dilatation but with normal right ventricular function. On reviewing his family history, the triad of right ventricular dysfunction, atrial tachyarrhythmias, and cardiac conduction system disease occurred in affected family members with various presentations. There was no left ventricular involvement, no history of ventricular arrhythmias in any of the affected members, and there was no history of sudden cardiac death across all three generations.
Familial clustering of right ventricular dysfunction, atrial tachyarrhythmias, and cardiac conduction system disease do exist. This constellation of findings is not well described in literature. Further reporting of similar cases and investigating of genetic bases are required."

The prevalence of VHD continues to rise, placing increasing demands on cardiovascular imaging and longitudinal management. AI systems have been applied across echocardiography, cardiac computed tomography (CCT), and cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) to automate image classification, segmentation, disease detection, and severity assessment. The most mature AI models have centered on transthoracic echocardiography (TTE), where deep learning (DL) frameworks enable whole-study interpretation and preliminary report generation. Applications in CCT and CMR remain in earlier stages but show promise for segmentation, tissue characterization, and pre-procedural planning.
AI has the potential to enhance the accuracy, reproducibility, and efficiency of imaging-based VHD assessment. Key challenges remain around generalizability, transparency, and clinical integration. Multidisciplinary collaboration is essential to ensure that AI complements, rather than replaces, human expertise."

This study sought to investigate propofol sensitivity and establish specific electroencephalography (EEG) biomarkers to guide safer anesthesia delivery in this high-risk population.
In this prospective observational trial, 40 patients (20 VD vs. 20 non-cardiac controls) received Schnider model-guided propofol target-controlled infusion. Primary outcome was effect-site propofol concentration at loss of consciousness (CeLOC). Prefrontal EEG dynamics (spectral power, bicoherence, burst suppression) were analyzed.
VD patients exhibited 34% lower CeLOC versus controls (2.8 vs. 4.25 µg/mL; p = 0.0001). EEG revealed distinct neurosignatures: elevated β and θ power (β: 3.16 vs. 1.68, p = 0.0303; θ: 1.21 vs. 0.88, p = 0.0166), higher spectral power ratio (SPR: 1.38 vs. 1.98; p = 0.022), and intensified burst suppression (ratio: 0.11 vs. 0.32; p < 0.0001). Bicoherence analysis demonstrated impaired cross-frequency coupling in β and δ bands (β: 40.95 vs. 34.75, p = 0.0253; δ:43.5 vs. 30.95, p < 0.0001).
VD is associated with heightened propofol sensitivity and distinct EEG signatures, including patterns suggestive of thalamocortical dysrhythmia and cortical suppression. These findings suggest that disease-specific EEG monitoring may inform the development of precision anesthesia protocols for cardiac populations."

Congenital anomalies of the atrioventricular valve or septum (CAAVAS) and functionally univentricular heart (FUH) are complex subtypes of CHD, where disruptions in key molecular pathways are implicated. This study investigates the genetic burden contributing to these anomalies. This case-control study included 48 participants: 24 patients diagnosed with CAAVAS or FUH and 24 healthy controls. Whole-exome sequencing (WES) was conducted to assess genetic burden by evaluating minor allele frequencies (MAF) using gnomAD and predicting functional impact of variants with REVEL scores. A secondary filtration was performed, focusing on 349 genes associated with abnormal heart valve morphology (HP:0001654) as defined by the Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) database, to identify pathogenic variants exclusive to the case group. Genetic burden risk (GBR) analysis revealed a significantly higher median number of common variants in the case group compared to controls (p = 0.035). Genetic analysis identified variants in genes involved in contractile cardiac and cytoskeletal proteins (MYH3, ACTC1), extracellular matrix proteins (FBN1, FREM1, HSPG2), ciliary proteins (EVC2, PKD1L1), enzymes (POLG, DNASE1L3), cell-signaling proteins (TGFB2, CCDC22) and transcription factors (NKX2-5, NONO). This study highlights the significant role of genetic burden and gene variants associated with congenital mitral and tricuspid valve anomalies. Our findings reinforce the strong genetic predisposition underlying these malformations, as evidenced by the increased genetic burden in affected individuals compared to controls without CHD."

However, valvular heart disease and somnolence, mainly caused by activating the serotonin 5-HT2B receptor (5-HT2BR) and dopamine D3 receptor (D3R), respectively, currently challenge their clinical use. Here, we aimed to develop a novel dopamine receptor agonist with superior therapeutic efficacy for PD, while minimising adverse reactions.
Matsupexole, a novel nonergot dopamine receptor agonist, was evaluated by agonist activity for D2LR and a 6-hydroxydopamine-lesioned male rat PD model. To explore its adverse effects, the agonist activity for other receptors, including 5-HT2BR and D3R, and the resulting porcine heart valve interstitial cell (PHVIC) proliferation and non-rapid eye movement (REM) sleep induction in male rats were evaluated, in comparison with existing dopamine receptor agonists.
Matsupexole exhibited potent agonist activity for D2LRs without inducing 5-HT2BR activation or promoting PHVIC proliferation. Matsupexole demonstrated sustained efficacy in the PD model. In contrast, despite its strong D2LR agonist activity, cabergoline, an ergot dopamine receptor agonist, significantly evoked PHVIC proliferation. Reflecting its higher D2LR/D3R selectivity, matsupexole did not affect non-REM sleep induction. Although pramipexole, a D3R-favouring nonergot agonist, showed efficacy in the rat PD model, its effect was shorter in duration, and it strongly promoted non-REM sleep. The stabilised interaction between Val1905.39 in D2LR and matsupexole, but not pramipexole, further supports the higher D2LR/D3R selectivity of matsupexole.
Matsupexole is a promising future, potentially best-in-class dopamine receptor agonist for treating PD."

Histoplasma infection occurs through inhalation of spores typically found in contaminated soil. The clinical forms are variable, ranging from asymptomatic to fatal presentations. Asymptomatic individuals may develop reactivated disease years after the primary exposure. Most cases of histoplasmosis are confined to the pulmonary system. In rare instances, fungal elements disseminate to the heart valves, where destructive injury occurs. CASE REPORT A 59-year-old woman presented with vascular bypass occlusion, 2 months after aortobifemoral bypass for aortoiliac occlusive disease. She reported severe, unrelenting nausea and vomiting; a large aortic valve mass was detected on transthoracic echocardiography. Bacterial endocarditis was initially suspected, but cultures were unrevealing. Follow-up microbial cell-free DNA testing identified Histoplasma capsulatum and low-level Streptococcus mitis/oralis, prompting further evaluation for disseminated histoplasmosis. Bone marrow biopsy showed Histoplasma negativity according to polymerase chain reaction. The patient subsequently underwent aortic valve replacement, and pathology confirmed fungal elements consistent with H. capsulatum. Gram and acid-fast bacilli staining of the aortic valve yielded negative results. CONCLUSIONS Fungal endocarditis carries substantial morbidity and is challenging to diagnose due to its nonspecific presentation over time and the absence of standardized blood culture protocols. Treatment options include surgical valve replacement and targeted antifungal therapy. This case underscores the diagnostic difficulties associated with fungal endocarditis, particularly in the context of negative cultures and a history of travel to endemic areas, when microbial coinfection cannot be definitively excluded."

A retrospective review was performed on 171 patients with DCVSDs of all ages who underwent the MRVIAT procedure between 2022 and 2024.
The procedure was successfully completed in all 171 patients without conversion to median sternotomy or in-hospital mortality. The median age was 1.3 years (range, 0.1-39.0 years), with seven patients (4.1%) aged ≥18 years. The median weight was 10.2 kg (range, 3.8-86.6 kg). Among them, nine patients (5.3%) weighed ≤5 kg, 83 (48.5%) weighed ≤10 kg, 81 (47.4%) weighed 10-50 kg, and seven (4.1%) weighed ≥50 kg. Complications included mild residual shunting in two cases (1.2%), incision infection in one case (0.6%), and pulmonary infection in one case (0.6%). Over a median follow-up of 1.3 years (range, 0.3-2.5 years), no thoracic deformities or moderate-to-severe valvular regurgitation were observed.
The MRVIAT technique is a safe and viable option for the surgical treatment of DCVSD in patients across all age groups. It provides a minimally invasive approach with a small, inconspicuous incision and avoids peripheral cannulation, making it a promising alternative to median sternotomy."

BPV was considered for those with a significant component of valvular pulmonary stenosis (PS) on echocardiography. A strategy of stepwise dilation using progressively larger balloon sizes, andmonitoring pulmonary artery pressures between each dilation, was adapted.
Thirty patients [TOF (n=13), DORV/DILV (n=7/2), single ventricle/Unbalanced AVCD (n=3), and corrected transposition (n=5)] with median age: 20.5 years (IQR: 14.0-26.8), weight: 49 kg (IQR: 44.1-57.7) underwent BPV. The fluoroscopy and procedure times were 17.8 minutes (IQR:12.7-25.7) and 71 ± 26 minutes (mean ± SD), respectively. The balloon-to-annulus ratio was 1.01 (0.96-1.2). Saturation improved significantly from 76.7±9.6% to 90.2±4.4%. Complications included transient arrhythmias in five patients and fatal re-perfusion pulmonary edema during repeat BPV in one. At a median follow-up of 51 months (IQR: 26.75-139.25 months), majority of patients demonstrated sustained symptomatic relief. Seven patients underwent corrective surgery, and four required repeat BPV.
In a selected subgroup of anatomically suited patients with CCHD and PS, stepwise dilatation of the pulmonary valve resulted in improved oxygenation and symptomatic relief, which was sustained on follow-up, making it an attractive low-resource option for palliation, particularly in resource constrained LMIC settings."

This study aims to provide essential insights into the management of HF patients in Poland, with a particular focus on individuals experiencing recurrent hospitalizations, over the period 2014-2021.
This observational study analyzes long-term registry data from the Polish Ministry of Health and the Health Needs Map. It includes more than 1,000,000 patients diagnosed with HF (ICD-10: I50) or pulmonary edema (ICD-10: J81), treated across all medical facilities operating under a uniform national healthcare system. This study inherently employs a population-based approach, encompassing all medical facilities that treat patients with these ICD-10 codes.
Here, we present data on HF prevalence, incidence, and the healthcare pathway. The number of diagnosed HF cases in Poland increased to 1.02 million by December 31, 2019. In 2021, the standardized HF prevalence rate reached 2,626 per 100,000 population, with the highest prevalence observed in individuals aged 80-89 years (32%). Heart failure hospitalizations (HFH) in 2019 were 1022 per 100,000, decreasing to 205,000 in 2021. Notably, the number of hospitalizations exceeded the number of patients receiving treatment by 18-25%. Between 2014 and 2021, more than 9.2 million healthcare services were recorded, accounting for 48% of all HF-related encounters.
This study, relevant to both Polish and international cardiologists, provides a comprehensive overview of HF trends and associated risks, offering insights that may help refine diagnosis and treatment strategies in Central and Eastern European populations."

We report a case of L. garvieae bioprosthetic aortic and mitral valve endocarditis in a 75-year-old man, complicated by multiple cerebral septic emboli, lumbar discitis/osteomyelitis and bilateral pulmonary nodules. Despite initial stabilization with antibiotic therapy and medical heart failure management, the patient deteriorated approximately a year after his index admission with worsening valvulopathy and ultimately died of complications of his infection. This case highlights the emergence of L. garvieae as an opportunistic pathogen in humans, with increasing cases identified due to improved recognition and enhanced diagnostics."

Many patients later recall vivid, often frightening delusional experiences, but sustained delusional conviction in such memories long after delirium resolution is rarely reported.
We describe a woman in her late 60s with congenital aortic valve disease, three previous aortic valve operations and a recent tricuspid valve repair via right mini-thoracotomy. Her postoperative course was severely complicated by hemothorax, repeated thoracotomies, respiratory failure, sepsis, acute kidney injury, anemia and malnutrition, together with exposure to multiple centrally acting drugs (benzodiazepines, opioids, pregabalin, dexmedetomidine). While being treated on a general cardiothoracic ward she developed delirium, with disorientation, sleep-wake disruption and prominent persecutory and somatic delusions that staff were mocking her, taking humiliating photographs and ""videos"", and forcing tablets into her throat. Delirium resolved with optimization of medical status, reduction of deliriogenic medications and short-term low-dose olanzapine, yet she retained a fixed belief that these ward events had truly occurred. For almost a year, including during a later admission for prosthetic valve endocarditis with paravalvular leak and an unsuccessful percutaneous closure attempt, she repeatedly reported these experiences as factual abuse despite psychotherapy and psychoeducation. Only during a subsequent elective admission, when reconsidering a high-risk redo valve operation that she ultimately declined, did she spontaneously reframe the memories as symptoms of ""a mental disorder"" and apologize to staff.
This case highlights how delirium-related persecutory experiences can consolidate into persistent trauma-like autobiographical memories with prolonged delusional conviction, and underscores the need for structured delirium follow-up, explicit psychoeducation for patients and families, and close collaboration between cardiology, cardiac surgery, psychiatry and psychology."

Extraction from the Heart Valve Society aortic valve database (Aortic Valve Insufficiency and ascending aorta Aneurysm InternATiOnal Registry [AVIATOR]) was performed and two groups of patients operated between July 2007 and December 2022 were identified: Group 1 including patients undergoing VSRR with ejection fraction (EF) ≤50% (n=279) and Group 2 including patients undergoing Bentall with EF ≤50% (n=46). All patients had at least grade 2 aortic regurgitation.
Similar cardiopulmonary bypass and cross-clamping time were reported. No statistically significant difference was reported between the groups in terms of postoperative bleeding, transfusion rate, reoperations, pacemaker rate implantation, ischaemic complications, and acute kidney injury. Follow-up mortality was similar between the groups, without any significant differences, and the weighted mixed-effect linear models showed improvement in EF in both groups; progressive inverse left ventricular remodelling is significantly higher in Group 2.
While both techniques can improve left ventricular function in patients with reduced EF, the Bentall procedure offers marginally better results in terms of left ventricular inverse remodelling. However, the choice between Bentall and VSRR should ultimately be determined by the surgeon's expertise and familiarity with each technique."

The model first transforms the complex covariance matrix of the array signal into two real covariance matrices via the method of separating real and complex parts. Subsequently, a CNN is employed to extract spatial features from the array signal. Finally, a SMoE mechanism is utilized to handle hybrid noise environments, which dynamically adapts to diverse noise conditions via sparse expert activation. With our staged training strategy, the model achieves 0.94[Formula: see text] RMSE at 0 dB SNR with six noise types, outperforming conventional approaches.

However, the classic K_Means algorithm suffers from two major limitations: (1) its reliance on a single, often suboptimal distance metric (typically Euclidean), and (2) the lack of a mechanism to refine clusters post-assignment, which can lead to poor cohesion and misgrouping. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a novel enhanced K-Means clustering framework with two key innovations: (i) a hybrid distance approach that combines cosine and cityblock (Manhattan) metrics in a tunable weighted manner to better capture the structure of medical data and (ii) an efficient cluster refinement mechanism based on Z-score outlier detection to reassign distant samples and improve cluster quality. First, we evaluate K_Means using five distance metrics-Euclidean, cosine, cityblock, Chebyshev, and Minkowski-on two public medical datasets: Breast Cancer Wisconsin (BCW) and Heart Disease. Then, we introduce the hybrid distance strategy, systematically varying the weight between cosine and cityblock to identify the optimal combination. Following initial clustering, our refinement step identifies data points far from their cluster centroids (using Z-score) and reassigns them to more suitable clusters, significantly enhancing cluster homogeneity and separation. The proposed method is evaluated using multiple metrics: accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, Adjusted Rand Index (ARI), homogeneity, and execution time. Results show substantial improvements over traditional approaches and advanced clustering methods (deep clustering and spectral clustering methods). For the BCW and Heart Disease datasets, the proposed method achieves accuracies of 0.9825 and 0.9000, outperforming Euclidean K-Means (0.8752, 0.8316) and cosine-based K-Means (0.9350, 0.8418). Homogeneity scores also enhance significantly from 0.7721 to 0.8676 (for BCW dataset) and from 0.4335 to 0.5352 (for Heart Disease dataset)-demonstrating the effectiveness of the refinement step. This work presents an original, practical enhancement to K_Means clustering for healthcare applications, offering improved accuracy, interpretability, and robustness through a hybrid distance strategy and a novel refinement mechanism. The results provide deeper insights into unsupervised learning for medical data analysis and support its potential in real-world clinical decision-making."

However, many existing NAS approaches depend on hand-crafted architecture descriptors or shallow performance predictors, which fail to capture the structural complexity of candidate networks and often lead to unreliable search guidance. We introduce Graph Embedding Comparator with Isomorphic Multi-Comparison (GEC-IMC), an evolutionary NAS framework that learns architecture representations directly from their graph structure. A graph convolutional network encodes architectures into embeddings, while a contrastive learning strategy ensures that architectures with similar accuracy are mapped closer in the embedding space. On top of these embeddings, a comparator estimates the relative performance between two architectures, enabling more precise pairwise assessments during search. To further increase robustness, GEC-IMC incorporates an isomorphic multi-comparison mechanism, which evaluates multiple structurally equivalent variants of each architecture and aggregates their pairwise outcomes into a global score. This ranking score provides consistent feedback for evolutionary selection. Experiments on standard NAS benchmarks demonstrate that GEC-IMC achieves state-of-the-art performance with improved robustness over existing predictors. Ablation studies confirm the complementary roles of embedding learning and multi-comparison in enhancing search efficiency."

Participating teams of the HaN-Seg challenge were tasked to auto-segment 30 organs-at-risk (OARs) in the head and neck region using paired contrast-enhanced computed tomography and T1-weighted magnetic resonance images. The teams were ranked according to their geometric performance, measured by the Dice similarity coefficient (DSC) and 95th-percentile Hausdorff distance (HD95). Here, we extend this evaluation with a forward dosimetric analysis, also known as dosimetric impact approximation, including the verification of OAR dosimetric restriction compliance, assessment of OAR priority ratings, evaluation of segmentation performance relative to tumor proximity, and correlation analysis between geometric and dosimetric metrics.
All six teams from the previous geometric analysis were assessed for dosimetric performance on the original 14 test cases. Dosimetric analysis revealed minor performance differences among teams, with the best- and worst-performing teams achieving dosimetric compliance in 70.7% and 67.7% of OAR auto-segmentations, respectively. Most teams successfully met priority 1 dosimetric restrictions including the spinal cord, brainstem, optic chiasm, and optic nerves in 11 out of 14 test cases. The lowest compliance rates were observed for the oral cavity and submandibular glands. Correlation analysis revealed no clear relationship between geometric and dosimetric metrics.
The high dosimetric compliance highlights the practical utility of deep learning OAR auto-segmentation methods. Lower compliance for the oral cavity and submandibular glands most probably stems from their proximity to tumors and the corresponding steep dose gradients, where certain dosimetric constraints are inherently challenging to meet in clinical practice, or from the limitations of the forward dosimetric analysis. These findings underpin the critical need for both geometric and dosimetric evaluations of OAR auto-segmentation tools to ensure robust validation. Such a comprehensive assessment will be essential as commercial deep learning tools become increasingly integrated into the radiotherapy planning workflow."

Machine learning plays a significant role in predicting the properties of emerging contaminants, while the common use of single-task models may lead to overfitting. This study integrated molecular graphs with key molecular descriptors (MDs) to develop a graph convolutional network (GCN) model based on multitask learning (MTL), using a dataset of 6,820 substances. By using multitask learning, this model emphasizes the interrelationships among three properties, enabling simultaneous multitask binary classification for persistence, mobility, and toxicity. The results demonstrate that the developed MTL-GCN-MD model outperforms both single-task GCN models and traditional machine learning models based on molecular descriptors. The multitask architecture of the MTL-GCN-MD model effectively reduces the risk of overfitting, enabling the model to achieve a balanced accuracy of over 0.81 across three distinct identification tasks on the test sets. Through the visualization of multi-level feature distributions and atomic attention weights, the model's prediction mechanism was systematically analyzed. Kernel density estimation, scaffold diversity, and Tanimoto coefficient were employed to define the model's application domain.

However, assessing these functional benefits often requires time-consuming chemical assays that limit scalability. In this study, we investigated whether deep learning (DL) could offer a faster, more efficient alternative. Using liquid chromatography (LC)-MS quadrupole time-of-flight metabolomics, we analyzed 18 fermented milk samples (derived from camel and bovine milk fermented with different bacterial strains) and measured their bioactivity across 9 in vitro assays, including antioxidant capacity (2,2'-azino-bis(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid), 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl), enzyme inhibition (angiotensin-converting enzyme, DH), and anticancer activity (HT-29, MDAMB). To address the challenge of limited sample size, we implemented a robust preprocessing pipeline including outlier detection, robust scaling, and data augmentation techniques. We trained a one-dimensional convolutional neural network (1D-CNN; DL) architecture with regularization strategies to predict these bioactivity scores from preprocessed LC-MS data. The model achieved strong performance with a mean absolute error of 0.548 ± 0.089 across all outputs through 3-fold cross-validation, demonstrating effective generalization despite the small dataset. Principal component analysis revealed biologically meaningful structure in the metabolomic data, distinguishing samples by milk type and fermentation condition.

To validate the effectiveness of this design, we further examined variants of the fusion strategy and attention mechanism. Evaluation results show that ClathPLM demonstrates excellent overall classification performance and robustness, surpassing current state-of-the-art methods. Moreover, the model performs strongly on an additional case-study dataset and shows good scalability on an extra vesicular transport proteins (VTPs) dataset.

Across the included studies, external validation on independent-site data is rare (∼10%), full code release (including search procedures) is limited (∼26%), and only a minority substantively addresses search stability (∼23%). Despite clear clinical relevance, multi-objective search that explicitly optimizes latency or memory is also uncommon (∼23%).

We propose a novel Fuzzy Rough Set-inspired (FRS) loss function that addresses these challenges by integrating pixels' fuzzy similarity relations with a boundary uncertainty model in a convex combination method. To obtain the boundary uncertainty model, the fuzzy lower and upper approximations of a set of pixels and membership weights are utilized. The FRS loss function enhances boundary sensitivity and handles prediction uncertainty through its dual components: a fuzzy similarity term that captures gradual transitions at lesion boundaries, and boundary uncertainty model that deals with uncertainty and mitigates class imbalance. Extensive experiments across five diverse medical imaging datasets - breast ultrasound, gastrointestinal polyps, brain Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), chest Computed Tomography (CT), and skin lesions - demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. The FRS loss achieves superior segmentation performance with an average improvement of 2.1% in Dice score compared to the best baseline method, while demonstrating statistically significant improvements across all evaluated metrics (p < 0.001). The FRS loss shows its robustness to moderate class imbalance while maintaining computational efficiency (mean inference time 0.075-0.12 s per image, 4.5 MB memory). These results suggest that the FRS loss function provides a robust and interpretable framework for precise medical image segmentation, particularly in cases with ambiguous boundaries and moderate imbalance.

PubMed,deep learning,Image-space compensation of inter-crystal scattering in PET using a neural network based filter.,Dóra Varnyú; Ákos Rábely; László Szirmay-Kalos,10.1186/s40658-026-00837-9,2026-01-25,EJNMMI physics,"In positron emission tomography (PET), gamma photons arriving at the detector ring may undergo one or more Compton scattering events, potentially reaching a different scintillation crystal than its initial interaction point. This phenomenon, known as inter-crystal scattering (ICS), can lead to incorrect line of response (LOR) assignments, introducing spatial blurring and noise in the reconstructed image. Existing ICS correction methods include energy-based heuristics, Compton kinematics, Monte Carlo simulation, and deep learning to recover the first interaction position of the photons in the detector. These corrections are performed in the LOR domain, since that is where ICS manifests. However, in ordered-subset expectation-maximization (OS-EM) reconstruction, only a subset of LORs is processed at each iteration, making LOR-domain corrections difficult to apply on-the-fly.
We propose a novel ICS correction technique performed entirely in the image domain. A neural network is trained to predict spatially-varying 3D filter kernels that model the blurring effect of ICS across the image volume. These kernels are applied to the PET image estimate prior to each OS-EM forward projection. We evaluated our method on simulated and real PET data using two network variants: one predicting full 3D kernels (ICS-Net-direct), and another using a compact skew normal representation (ICS-Net-skewnorm).
Both ICS-Net-direct and ICS-Net-skewnorm significantly improved the spatial resolution and the contrast of the output image, while also being computationally efficient. We found that ICS-Net-skewnorm is better suited for structural, symmetric reconstruction objects, while ICS-Net-direct performs best in complex, real-world scenarios.
The proposed image-domain ICS correction technique enables efficient and effective compensation of inter-crystal scattering for OS-EM reconstruction. Network selection should be guided by the target imaging scenario to maximize performance."
PubMed,deep learning,MGM as a Large-Scale Pretrained Foundation Model for Microbiome Analyses in Diverse Contexts.,Haohong Zhang; Yuli Zhang; Zixin Kang; Jiayun Xiong; Ronghua Yang; Kang Ning,10.1002/advs.202513333,2026-01-25,"Advanced science (Weinheim, Baden-Wurttemberg, Germany)","Microbial communities are integral to human health, biotechnology, and environmental systems, yet their analysis is hindered by data heterogeneity and batch effects across studies. Traditional supervised methods often fail to capture universal patterns, limiting their utility in diverse contexts. Here, we present the Microbial General Model (MGM), the first large-scale foundation model for microbiome analysis, pretrained on 260,000 samples using transformer-based language modeling. MGM employs self-attention mechanisms and autoregressive pre-training to learn contextualized representations of microbial compositions, enabling robust transfer learning for downstream tasks. Benchmark evaluations demonstrate MGM's superior performance over conventional methods (average ROC-AUC = 0.99 vs. 0.68-0.97) in microbial community classification, with enhanced generalization across geographic regions. MGM also captures spatial and temporal microbial dynamics, as evidenced by its application to a longitudinal infant cohort, where it delineated delivery mode-specific microbiome trajectories and identified keystone genera such as Bacteroides and Bifidobacterium in vaginal deliveries and Haemophilus in cesarean deliveries. Furthermore, through prompt-guided generation, MGM produced realistic microbial profiles conditioned on disease labels. By integrating self-supervised learning with domain-specific fine-tuning, MGM advances the scalability and precision of microbiome analyses, offering a unified framework for diagnostics, ecological studies, and therapeutic discovery."

With a focus on the prevalent psychological complications following the onset of this condition, this study aimed to explore the correlation between antenatal depression and Corona disease anxiety, personality traits, and postpartum depression during the COVID-19 pandemic.                                                           Materials and Methods:                     This cross-sectional descriptive-analytical study investigated women receiving care at health centers affiliated with Kerman University of Medical Sciences during the last month of their pregnancy and the postpartum period in 2022. Following the acquisition of informed consent, participants were assessed using various measures, including demographic and obstetric information, the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale, the Corona Disease Anxiety Scale (CDAS), and the NEO Personality Inventory-Revised during their third trimester of pregnancy. The same group of participants completed the Edinburgh Depression Scale and the Corona Disease Anxiety Scale (CDAS) 4-6 weeks after childbirth.                                                           Results and Discussion:                     There was a significant correlation between family income, unwanted pregnancy as perceived by both the mother and father, and antenatal depression. Additionally, marital satisfaction played a significant role in postpartum depression. Furthermore, antenatal depression was significantly associated with neuroticism, agreeableness, and physical symptoms related to Corona disease anxiety. Personality traits, with the exception of extroversion and conscientiousness, and various domains of Corona disease anxiety, excluding psychological symptoms, were also significantly associated with postpartum depression.                                                           Conclusion:                     During pandemics or epidemics, such as the COVID-19 outbreak, experiencing mental distress during pregnancy can contribute to mental health issues during the postpartum period. This risk is particularly true in individuals with unique personality traits, emphasizing the need for increased focus on mental health within prenatal care during these crises."
Crossref,valvular heart disease,The Severity of Disease and Hospital Length of Stay for the First and Second Admission of COVID-19 Patients: An Observational Study from Southeastern Iran,Milad Ahmadi Gohari; Mohammad Hossein Mehrolhassani; Shoboo Rahmati; Elham Sharifpoor; Hossein Mirzaei; Yunes Jahani,10.2174/0126667975341163241129050027,2026-10,Coronaviruses,"Background:                     This study aimed to investigate the severity of disease and length of hospital stay for COVID-19 patients admitted to a hospital in southeastern Iran.                                                           Method:                     This cross-sectional study was conducted in Kerman, Iran. Data were collected from patients who visited Afzalipour Hospital in Kerman more than twice during the COVID-19 epidemic from the end of February 2020 to March 21, 2021. We conducted two key analyses: 1. Mixed effect logistic regression was used to check the relationship between the variables and COVID-19 severity. 2. Mixed effect linear regression was used to check the relationship between the variables and the length of stay in the hospital.                                                           Results:                     The findings indicated that the most important risk factors for the severity of COVID-19 were heart diseases (OR=1.67,95%CI:1.20-2.30), increasing age (OR=2.23 for age&gt;54, 95%CI:1.70- 2.90), male gender (OR=1.47,95%CI:1.10-1.96), respiratory diseases other than asthma, and frequency of admission (OR=1.60,95%CI:1.20-2.15). All patients who underwent readmission experienced a shorter duration of hospitalization during their subsequent admission (OR=0.94,95%CI:0.91,0.96) and had a higher mortality rate (30% within 14 days, 26.6% between 14-90 days). Patients readmitted at intervals of 14-90 days and greater than 90 days exhibited lower disease severity compared to those readmitted within the 0-14 day period.                                                           Conclusion:                     Examining readmissions, the severity of COVID-19, and the length of hospital stay in affected patients are important factors for planning and allocating resources for COVID-19 management and treatment. These factors can help policymakers develop effective clinical guidelines for hospitalization or outpatient treatment of COVID-19 patients and contribute to reducing the burden of disease in the community."

Kinovea, as an accessible motion-analysis software, provides both visual and quantitative feedback. However, its application in supporting technique development among beginner athletes remains insufficiently explored. Aim: This study aims to describe the use of Kinovea in biomechanics training and examine its contribution to the awareness of kinematic characteristics and movement techniques among beginner athletes. Methods: A descriptive qualitative design involved 72 beginner athletes aged 18–25 years selected through purposive sampling. Data were collected over 16 weeks through interviews, field observations, and motion video recordings analyzed using Kinovea. Kinematic data focused on joint angles, stride behavior, and movement phases during walking, running, and the flight phase. Qualitative data were analyzed using content analysis with NVivo 12, while kinematic results were interpreted descriptively to identify performance patterns and areas for technical refinement. Result: Kinematic analysis showed coordinated joint-angle patterns across all phases. Walking analysis identified arm swing angles of 50.9°–58.8° and leg separation angles of 64.3°–67.2°, indicating a stable gait rhythm. The running analysis revealed knee angles of 68.8°–69.8° and elbow angles of 87.6°–89.1°, indicating efficient propulsive mechanics. The flight phase demonstrated knee angles of 81.2°–87.8° and elbow angles of 80.4°–88.3°, suggesting effective momentum use and postural stability. These measurements supported stride-efficiency assessment and technique evaluation. Qualitative findings revealed that Kinovea enabled athletes to interpret movement phases and identify technical inefficiencies through slow-motion and frame-by-frame visualization. Conclusion: Kinovea supports basic motion analysis by providing clear kinematic information and helping beginner athletes observe and refine their movement techniques. The findings also offer practical value for coaches by enabling more precise identification of inefficient patterns and guiding targeted corrections during early-stage training."

Optimal management requires integrated risk stratification, multimodality imaging, tailored revascularization timing, and post-procedural care. This review synthesizes evidence on preoperative assessment (invasive angiography vs CT-angiography), decision-making for percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), staged vs concomitant approaches, and long-term antithrombotic and surveillance strategies to optimize outcomes. Introduction Severe aortic stenosis (AS) and CAD frequently coexist due to shared risk factors and pathophysiology. While TAVI has transformed AS treatment, untreated significant CAD may impair periprocedural hemodynamics and long-term prognosis. Preoperative Evaluation Coronary computed tomography angiography (CCTA) is increasingly preferred for its high negative predictive value and ability to assess anatomy for TAVI planning. Invasive coronary angiography remains the gold standard when revascularization is anticipated. Functional assessment (fractional flow reserve [FFR] or instantaneous wave-free ratio [iFR]) is recommended for intermediate lesions (50–70%) to guide intervention. Revascularization Strategies Staged PCI (prior to TAVI) is favored in most guidelines for complex or high-risk anatomy, minimizing contrast load and procedural time during valve deployment. Concomitant PCI during the same session may be considered in straightforward single-vessel disease or unstable presentations, though it carries higher acute kidney injury risk. Post-TAVI PCI is emerging as a viable option in select cases with favorable valve positioning. Multidisciplinary Heart Team Integration The Heart Team should weigh SYNTAX score, frailty, bleeding risk, and life expectancy. Hybrid approaches (e.g., PCI of proximal lesions pre-TAVI, distal optimization post-TAVI) are gaining traction. Antithrombotic Management and Follow-up Post-PCI/TAVI regimens typically involve dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) for 1–6 months, transitioning to single antiplatelet therapy (SAPT) or anticoagulation if indicated. Long-term surveillance includes echocardiography, stress testing, and symptom monitoring. Conclusion A structured, multidisciplinary strategy incorporating advanced imaging, physiology-guided PCI, and individualized timing improves safety and durability in TAVI recipients with coexistent CAD."

METHODS: We analyzed 2 multicenter registries that consecutively enrolled patients with severe aortic stenosis before and after the introduction of transcatheter AVR in Japan (CURRENT AS [CURRENT AS, Contemporary Outcomes After Surgery and Medical Treatment in Patients With Severe Aortic Stenosis] Registry-1: 2003–2011; Registry-2: 2018–2020). Data were derived from hospital electronic health records. The primary outcome was 1-year all-cause mortality. Secondary outcomes included hospitalization for heart failure, cardiovascular death, and noncardiovascular death. we Multivariable Cox proportional hazards models were adjusted for age, sex, body mass index, hypertension, current smoking, diabetes on insulin therapy, prior myocardial infarction, prior symptomatic stroke, atrial fibrillation or flutter, aortic or peripheral vascular disease, creatinine level, hemodialysis, anemia, liver cirrhosis (child B or C), malignancy currently under treatment, chronic lung disease (moderate or severe), coronary artery disease, peak aortic jet velocity, any combined moderate or severe valvular disease, and tricuspid regurgitation pressure gradient. RESULTS: A total of 6645 patients (Registry-1: 3448 patients, and Registry-2: 3197 patients) were included. Patients in Registry-2 were older than those in Registry-1 (81.7 versus 77.8 years), and an initial AVR strategy was more frequently selected (49.9% versus 31.3%). The cumulative 1-year incidence and adjusted risk of 1-year all-cause mortality were lower in Registry-2 than in Registry-1 (10.2% versus 16.0%, P &lt;0.001, hazard ratio, 0.55 [95% CI, 0.47–0.63]). In contrast, the incidence and adjusted risk of hospitalization for heart failure did not differ between Registry-2 and Registry-1 (8.5% versus 9.0%, P =0.66, hazard ratio, 0.88 [95% CI, 0.75–1.04]). CONCLUSIONS: The overall 1-year mortality outcome of patients with severe aortic stenosis improved in the posttranscatheter AVR era compared with the pretranscatheter AVR era, with no noticeable improvement in hospitalization for heart failure."

Merlet; Stéphane Avril; Léonard Féasson; F. Hoffmann-La Roche; M. Bäck; David Hupin,10.3389/fcvm.2025.1625436,2026-01-23,Frontiers in Cardiovascular Medicine,"Postoperative atrial fibrillation (POAF) affects 38%–63% of patients undergoing surgical replacement for calcific aortic valve stenosis (CAVS), increasing morbidity, stroke risk, and hospital stay. POAF results from an interplay between pre-existing arrhythmogenic substrates, acute surgical triggers, unresolved inflammation, and autonomic nervous system (ANS) imbalance. Specialized pro-resolving mediators (SPMs) orchestrate inflammation resolution and tissue homeostasis; their deficiency may sustain valvular inflammation and promote arrhythmogenesis. Transcutaneous vagus nerve stimulation (tVNS) is a non-invasive approach that enhances parasympathetic tone, restores sympathovagal balance, and modulates inflammatory pathways. While tVNS has been applied postoperatively, its preoperative, preventive use in POAF has not been explored, representing a novel therapeutic strategy. In patients with CAVS, preoperative tVNS could reduce POAF by regulating ANS activity and limiting perioperative inflammation. Mechanistic insights may be gained through perioperative sampling, analysis of excised valvular and atrial tissue, and biomechanical assessments comparing stimulated and control groups. Preoperative tVNS thus offers a promising strategy to prevent POAF while addressing valvular inflammation, bridging translational physiology with clinical cardiology and potentially opening new avenues for the management of CAVS."
OpenAlex,aortic stenosis,Successful treatment of <i>low-flow-low-gradient</i> aortic stenosis and complex coronary artery-disease in a patient with severly depressed left-ventricular function by protected PCI and transfemoral TAVR via Y-graft vascular prothesis: A case report,Yusuf Nejahsie; Samer Hakmi; S Willems; Wolfgang Tigges; E Tigges,10.1093/ehjcr/ytag035,2026-01-22,European Heart Journal - Case Reports,"Abstract Introduction Low-flow, low-gradient aortic stenosis (LFLG AS) is a subset of aortic stenosis associated with a poor prognosis and high operative risk, particularly in the presence of concomitant coronary artery disease requiring intervention. In patients considered inoperable, minimally invasive approaches often remain the only alternative. However, there are limited data on treatment strategies and outcomes in patients with LFLG AS and severe ischemic cardiomyopathy undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) and transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR), especially in cases with challenging transfemoral access. Case summary An 87-year-old male presented with progressive dyspnea and angina. Diagnostics revealed a non-ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI), acute heart failure, acute-on-chronic renal failure, LFLG AS (aortic valve area of 0.7 cm²), and a left ventricular ejection fraction of 10%. Coronary angiography showed severe coronary artery disease requiring revascularization. Due to excessive surgical risk, we planned a staged interventional treatment by Heart Team consensus. First, high-risk PCI with mechanical circulatory support was performed, followed by transfemoral TAVR using a self-expandable 29-mm bioprosthesis via a femoral Y-graft conduit. The patient reported immediate relief of symptoms. Follow-up echocardiography at discharge and at three months showed improvement of the aortic valve function and an increase of the ejection fraction to 35%. The patient remained asymptomatic and resumed his daily activities. Discussion This case demonstrates that Impella®-supported PCI prior to transfemoral TAVR is feasible and safe, even in the presence of a femoral Y-graft, in a patient with LFLG AS and severely reduced ejection fraction."

Previous studies have suggested that liver SWE can serve as an indirect marker of hepatic congestion. However, it remains unclear whether liver SWE measured after transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) is associated with clinical outcomes. Methods: A total of 127 consecutive patients with severe aortic stenosis who underwent TAVI and had liver SWE measured using abdominal ultrasonography at discharge were enrolled. Liver SWE was obtained from the right hepatic lobe via an intercostal approach. Patients were stratified by the median liver SWE value (1.36 m/s): low-SWE group (< 1.36 m/s; n = 59) and high-SWE group (≥ 1.36 m/s; n = 68). The primary endpoint was a composite of all-cause death and heart failure (HF) rehospitalization. Results: All 127 patients were followed for 24 months, during which 21 (16.5 %) experienced the primary endpoint. Kaplan–Meier analysis showed a higher cumulative incidence of the primary endpoint in the high-SWE group than in the low-SWE group (log-rank P = 0.019). In Cox proportional hazards models adjusted using inverse probability of treatment weighting, high liver SWE was independently associated with an increased risk of the primary endpoint (hazard ratio 3.66; 95 % confidence interval 1.30–10.32; P = 0.014). Conclusion: High liver SWE after TAVI was independently associated with an increased 24-month risk of all-cause death and HF rehospitalization."

METHODS: In this retrospective single-center analysis with computed tomography angiography data from 2013 to 2025, cutoffs were determined from 1294 transthoracic echocardiography-based conclusive severe or nonsevere patients by congruence of maximum velocity, mean pressure gradient, and effective AVA by transthoracic echocardiography. In separate receiver operator curves analyses for tricuspid and bicuspid valves, the severe stenosis likely cutoff was defined by Youden index and the unlikely cutoff by a negative likelihood ratio &lt;0.1. Cutoffs were internally validated in 480 patients, compared with the Agatston score by net reclassification index, and tested in 190 separate normal flow-low gradient-aortic stenosis cases. RESULTS: Correlation between aAVA CTA and effective AVA by transthoracic echocardiography was moderate and strong in tricuspid and bicuspid valves, respectively (Pearson r 0.67 and 0.78; P &lt;0.001). Severe stenosis was likely in tricuspid valves at aAVA CTA ≤0.95 cm² (sensitivity 87%, specificity 78.9%) and unlikely at ≥1.10 cm² (negative likelihood ratio, 0.092). In bicuspid valves severe stenosis was likely at aAVA CTA ≤1.08 cm² (sensitivity 88.3%, specificity 77.3%) and unlikely at ≥1.20cm 2 (negative likelihood ratio, 0.091). Validation showed comparable results. Net reclassification index compared with the Agatston score was 0.16 for likely and 0.17 for unlikely cutoffs ( P &lt;0.001). Cutoffs were applied to 190 suspected severe low-gradient cases. Adding aAVA CTA as an additional severity marker led to reclassification to nonsevere in 5.8% of cases. CONCLUSIONS: Direct planimetry of AVA is feasible and shows utility in low gradient-aortic stenosis. However, as the hemodynamic effect is impacted by valve shape, cutoff values should differentiate between tricuspid and bicuspid valves."
OpenAlex,aortic stenosis,Non-invasive pressure-volume analysis: a novel method for evaluating ventricular function in patients with aortic stenosis,Darijan Ribic; Espen W. Remme; Otto A. Smiseth; Richard Massey; Christian Eek; Joakim Alfredsson; L. Gullestad; Kaspar Broch; Kristoffer Russell,10.3389/fcvm.2025.1740710,2026-01-22,Frontiers in Cardiovascular Medicine,"Background and aims Conventional echocardiographic measurements like ejection fraction (EF) and global longitudinal strain (GLS) evaluate left ventricular (LV) function without considering concurrent loading conditions. A more comprehensive characterization of cardiac function and energetics can be achieved through pressure-volume analysis, but its clinical application is limited by the requirement for invasive measurements. We aimed to develop a clinically accessible, non-invasive method for pressure-volume loop analysis. Methods We obtained simultaneous 3-dimensional echocardiograms and invasive LV pressures with micromanometer-tipped catheters during transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) for severe aortic stenosis. Volume-time traces from the echocardiograms were combined with invasive LV pressures and non-invasive pressure estimates to construct pressure-volume loops. We used echocardiograms before and after TAVR to evaluate changes in myocardial function via non-invasive pressure-volume studies. Results In same-beat comparisons, stroke work calculated using non-invasive LV pressure estimations correlated well with stroke work calculated using invasive LV pressures ( r = 0.95, ICC = 0.95, p &amp;lt; 0.0001, y = 0.90X + 1,836, mean bias −549 mmHg*mL, standard deviation 774 mmHg*mL; 95% limits of agreement: −2,006 to +967 mmHg*mL). After TAVR, stroke work fell substantially, ventricular efficiency increased, ventriculo-arterial coupling improved, and both total and resting energy consumption decreased. On the other hand, LV biplane EF and GLS remained unchanged. Conclusions This study confirms the validity and clinical accessibility of non-invasive pressure-volume loop analysis in patients with aortic stenosis. The method identified and characterized changes in myocardial energetics, function, and ventriculo-arterial interaction, that are not typically detected by conventional echocardiography. These findings highlight the potential of non-invasive pressure-volume analysis in clinical and research practice."
OpenAlex,aortic stenosis,Outcomes of aortic valvuloplasty with pericardium patch for congenital aortic stenosis and regurgitation in pediatric patients,Pinyan Huang; Junjie Zong; Weicong Ye; Song Wang; Ran Li; Han Zhang; Zilong Luo; Jiahong Xia; Jizhang Yu; Jian Wu; Cheng Zhou,10.3389/fcvm.2025.1724329,2026-01-21,Frontiers in Cardiovascular Medicine,"Background Surgical strategies for congenital aortic stenosis and regurgitation in children, particularly in infants (&amp;lt;1 year), remain controversial. Aortic valvuloplasty (AVP) with pericardial patch has gained increasing attention, but its durability and clinical benefits remain uncertain. Methods We retrospectively analyzed pediatric patients (≤12 years) undergoing AVP with pericardial patch in our center between July 2017 and July 2025. Infants (&amp;lt;1 year) were analyzed separately as subgroups. Primary outcome was the change in aortic valve hemodynamics, including median peak gradient, median peak velocity, and degree of aortic regurgitation. Secondary outcomes included major complications, overall survival, and freedom from reoperation. Results A total of 35 patients were included, with a median age of 2 years. Among them, 17 were infants, with a median age of 2 months. The median peak aortic valve gradient decreased from 67.0 mmHg to 33.0 mmHg ( p &amp;lt; 0.001), and the median peak velocity decreased from 4.1 m/s to 2.9 m/s ( p &amp;lt; 0.001), postoperatively. No new moderate or severe aortic regurgitation was observed early postoperatively, and preexisting lesions of this severity were resolved. There were no in-hospital deaths or severe complications. At four years, survival was 96% and freedom from reoperation 75.4% in the overall cohort; in infants, survival was 100% with 66.7% freedom from reoperation. Conclusions AVP with pericardium patch is a safe and effective procedure for congenital aortic stenosis and regurgitation in pediatric patients. It represents a promising surgical option for pediatric patients, including infants."

Transcatheter aortic valve replacement has become a revolutionary treatment practice, utilizing various access options, including transfemoral, transaortic, transapical, and other alternatives. The choice of access significantly impacts the safety and outcomes of the procedure. Objective: The study was aimed to analyze the immediate and long- term outcomes on adoption of transapical and transaortic accesses in aortic valve replacement using the domestic MedLab-KT prosthesis. Methods: From June 2018 to September 2025, 66 transcatheter aortic valve replacement surgeries were performed via transapical and transaortic approaches using the “MedLab-KT” prosthesis, including 4 repeat procedures for dysfunction of the biological aortic valve prosthesis by the valve-in-valve technique. A retrospective analysis of the results was conducted, assessing preoperative, intraoperative, and early and late postoperative data. Criteria for technical success, device success, and early safety were assessed. Patients were divided into groups according to time intervals, namely 2018–2021 and 2022–2025, to evaluate the impact of accumulated experience on immediate and long-term surgical outcomes. Results: Intraoperative mortality was recorded in a single case (1.6 %). The rate of 30-day mortality was 9 % (6 patients). The aortic valve implantation procedure was technically successful in 62 cases (93.9 %). Device success was recorded in 56 patients (84.9 %). The early safety rate was 83.3 %. The average follow-up period was 3.5 years. With the accumulation of experience, the early safety rate increased by 15 % but no significant difference was revealed. The rate of 5-year freedom from reoperations was 100 %; 5-year survival rate was 87.9 %. Moreover, 5-year freedom from valve dysfunction was 97.5 % (95 % CI 0.92; 1). Conclusion: The results of this study demonstrate the efficacy and safety of the transapical and transaortic approaches in transcatheter aortic valve replacement using the domestic prosthesis “MedLab-KT”, which demonstrates satisfactory hemodynamic characteristics for the mid-late postoperative period. Analysis of the immediate and long- term results allows us to recommend the transaortic and transapical approaches as alternatives when the transfemoral approach is not possible."
