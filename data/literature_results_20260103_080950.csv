PubMed,aortic stenosis,Transcatheter aortic valve replacement in patients with cancer: A 10-year registry analysis of early and long-term mortality outcomes.,Mark Kheifets; Amos Levi; Gal Madar Dvir; David Belkin; Tamir Bental; Leor Perl; Ran Kornowski; Pablo Codner; Inbar Nardi Agmon,10.1016/j.ijcard.2025.134137,2025-12-31,International journal of cardiology,"Patients with cancer increasingly undergo transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) for severe aortic stenosis (AS), yet the long-term outcomes and prognostic implications of active malignancy remain uncertain. We evaluated short- and long-term mortality following TAVR in patients with active or prior cancer using a large single-center registry.
We conducted a retrospective cohort study of 1511 patients who underwent TAVR at a tertiary center between 2013 and 2022, categorized by cancer status: no cancer, past cancer, or active cancer (defined as diagnosis within 12 months, metastatic disease, or ongoing oncologic treatment). Mortality outcomes were assessed using Kaplan-Meier curves and Cox proportional hazards models, with multivariable adjustment for clinical risk factors.
Among 1511 patients, 1336 (88.4 %) had no cancer, 123 (8.1 %) had past cancer and 52 (3.5 %) had active cancer. Patients with active cancer had similar 30-day (HR 0.82; 95 % CI 0.11-6.01; p = 0.845) and 1-year mortality (HR 1.73; 95 % CI 0.80-3.72; p = 0.160) compared with those without cancer. At 3 years, active cancer was independently associated with increased mortality (HR 2.04; 95 % CI 1.24-3.34; p = 0.004), with the highest risk seen in gastrointestinal and hematologic malignancies. Patients with breast or prostate cancer had more favorable outcomes.
TAVR in patients with active cancer is associated with comparable short- and mid-term outcomes relative to those without patients, supporting its feasibility in selected individuals. Long-term mortality varies by cancer type, highlighting the need for multidisciplinary, individualized decision-making when evaluating procedural candidacy."

However, the long-term prognostic impact of MVHD in this population remains poorly characterized. The aim of this study was to evaluate the long-term clinical outcomes and echocardiographic evolution of MVHD in TAVR recipients.
A total of 1,918 consecutive patients with severe symptomatic aortic stenosis (AS) undergoing TAVR were included. MVHD was defined as the presence of moderate or greater mitral (MR) and/or tricuspid regurgitation (TR) prior to the procedure. Baseline, procedural, and follow-up data (median of 4.0 [2.8-5.2] years) were prospectively collected. Changes in MR and/or TR severity were assessed from baseline to the last available echocardiography RESULTS: A total of 450 (23.5%) patients had MVHD at baseline. The presence of MVHD was associated with an increased all-cause mortality (adjusted HR: 1.21, 95% CI: 1.04-1.40; p=0.011) and cardiovascular mortality (adjusted HR: 1.29, 95% CI: 1.04-1.61; p=0.018) at follow-up. After adjustment, only baseline moderate or greater TR remained independently associated with all-cause mortality (HR: 1.38; CI: 1.04-1.84; p=0.027). At discharge, MR improved in 181 patients (51.7%) with similar rates across MR mechanism (p = 0.582), while those with TR improved in 71 (40.5%). MVHD improvement was sustained over time, whereas the absence of recovery was associated with a higher risk of all-cause mortality and cardiovascular mortality up to 6 years.
Patients with MVHD exhibit worse long-term outcomes after TAVR. While TAVR provides sustained improvement of concomitant valvular lesions in about half of patients, lack of recovery at discharge, predicted poorer long-term survival, highlighting the need for comprehensive baseline assessment and close echocardiographic follow-up in this high-risk population."

The advent of artificial intelligence-enabled electrocardiograms (AI-ECG) and point-of-care cardiac-ultrasonography (POCCUS) offers promising new approaches for patient screening. We explored the feasibility and potential of integrating these innovative technologies into a practical SHD screening framework.
Outpatients undergoing ECG at the Mayo Clinic ECG laboratory between November 2023 and February 2024 were pragmatically offered POCCUS, performed by novice operators and reviewed by expert echocardiographers. AI-ECG and POCCUS findings were integrated to assess SHD, including reduced left ventricular systolic function (ejection-fraction<50%), aortic stenosis, and increased left ventricular wall thickness suggestive of cardiac amyloidosis or hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. Operators were blinded to patients' comorbidities and formal echocardiogram results.
Of 486 patients (median-age 64 years;49% women), 286 had available formal echocardiography, with 17.5% having SHD. AI-ECG had a 32% positive predictive value (PPV) and a 94% negative predictive value (NPV) to detect any SHD. Adding POCCUS increased the overall PPV to 64% with an NPV of 93%, with an increase in diagnostic accuracy from 67% to 88%. Notably, 89.5% (17/19) of the ""false positives"" by AI-ECG+POCCUS had less-than-moderate-SHD. Applying the AI-ECG+POCCUS screening workflow on the entire cohort resulted in a number-needed-to-screen of eight to identify one patient requiring formal echocardiography.
The integration of AI-ECG and POCCUS holds promise as a potentially effective screening method for SHD, facilitating improved patient selection for formal echocardiography."

Cardiovascular interventions,"Cardiac conduction disturbances remain the most frequent complication of transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR), but the clinical implications of new left bundle branch block (LBBB) after TAVR remain controversial. Here, we aim to assess the impact of new LBBB after TAVR on patient outcomes in a large, real-world registry.
The study population consisted of patients in the TVT registry (Society of Thoracic Surgery and American College of Cardiology Transcatheter Valve Therapy Registry) who underwent TAVR for aortic stenosis between 2016 and 2022 and were discharged alive from the index hospitalization. Key exclusion criteria included preexisting conduction defects and a permanent pacemaker before TAVR or during the index hospitalization. Clinical outcomes were compared between patients with and without new LBBB using Cox proportional hazards models adjusted for baseline demographic, clinical, and echocardiographic variables.
Among 202 533 TAVR recipients, 32 933 (16.3%) developed new LBBB after TAVR. Over the study period, there was a significant decrease in the incidence of new LBBB from 19.9% in the first quarter of 2016 to 14.4% in the third quarter of 2022. Patients with new LBBB after TAVR, compared with those without LBBB, had significantly greater 1-year all-cause mortality (adjusted hazard ratio, 1.19 [95% CI, 1.13-1.25]; P<0.001), hospital readmission (adjusted hazard ratio, 1.23 [95% CI, 1.19-1.28]; P<0.001), and new pacemaker requirement (adjusted hazard ratio, 3.50 [95% CI, 3.26-3.76]; P<0.001). Patients with new LBBB also had lower Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire Overall Summary scores (adjusted difference, -1.7 points [95% CI, -2.1 to -1.3]; P<0.001) and left ventricular ejection fraction (adjusted difference, -2.8% [95% CI, -3.4% to -2.2%]; P<0.001).
New LBBB after TAVR is associated with worse 1-year outcomes, including death, rehospitalization, and permanent pacemaker, as well as worse health status and lower left ventricular ejection fraction. These findings suggest that continued efforts to limit the development of conduction disturbance after TAVR are warranted."
PubMed,aortic stenosis,Dual-parameter risk stratification based on device landing zone calcification and aortic annular perimeter for paravalvular regurgitation after self-expanding TAVR.,Jun Shu; Didi Wen; Jingji Xu; Yu Mao; Hui Ma; Jing Zhang; Yao Zhao; Jian Yang; Minwen Zheng,10.1016/j.ejro.2025.100719,2026-06,European journal of radiology open,"The study aimed to identify independent predictors associated with paravalvular regurgitation (PVR) after self-expanding transcatheter aortic valve replacement (SE-TAVR) and to develop a dual-parameter risk stratification model.
This retrospective study enrolled 292 severe aortic stenosis patients underwent SE-TAVR. PVR severity was assessed pre-discharge. Multivariate logistic regression identified independent predictors of mild/moderate PVR, optimal cutoff values for significant anatomical parameters were determined using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis. Patients were subsequently stratified into three risk groups based on these thresholds.
Mild/moderate PVR occurred in 24.0 % of patients. Independent predictors included aortic annular perimeter (OR:1.067, P = 0.015), device landing zone calcific volume (OR:1.006 per 10 mm³, P = 0.025), and presence of sealing skirt (OR:0.412, P = 0.010). The combination of these predictors had a higher discriminative performance (AUC=0.779) than single predictors (P = 0.036, 0.007, and <0.001, respectively), with significant integrated discrimination improvement (integrated discrimination improvement=5.4-6.7 %, P < 0.001). ROC-derived thresholds (device landing zone calcific volume≥1240 mm³ and aortic annular perimeter≥77 mm) stratified patients into three risk groups with progressively increasing PVR incidence: Group A (neither elevate):8.4 %; Group B (either elevated):23.7 %; and Group C (both elevated):48.7 %. Pairwise comparisons confirming differences between Group A vs. B (P = 0.003) and Group B vs. C (P < 0.001). Sealing skirts significantly reduced PVR in Groups A (P = 0.042) but not in Group B and C (P = 0.082 and 0.342).
The dual-parameter model based on device landing zone calcification and aortic annular perimeter significantly enhances PVR risk stratification after SE-TAVR. The dual-threshold model provides a clinically actionable tool for pre-procedural risk stratification and personalized valve selection."

We aimed to evaluate the prognostic value of this RV-PA coupling in patients after TAVR.
RV-PA coupling was defined as the ratio of RV free wall longitudinal strain (RVFWLS) to pulmonary artery systolic pressure (PASP), measured by echocardiography in AS patients undergoing TAVR between April 2012 and November 2022. The endpoints were all cause death, cardiovascular rehospitalization, stroke, and a composite of these.
At a median follow-up time of 3.4 years, 352 (28.8%) patients in 1221 patients had composite clinical events. Patients with higher RVFWLS/PASP ratio were predominantly male, had lower body mass index, more comorbidities, higher Society of Thoracic Surgeons score, more New York Heart Association IV and worse laboratory data, alongside worse cardiac function compared to those with lower RVFWLS/PASP ratio. The fully adjusted multivariable hazard ratios of RVFWLS/PASP ratio and the tertile 3 of RVFWLS/PASP ratio were 2.228 (95% CI, 1.441-3.446) and 2.571 (95% CI, 1.633-4.047). In addition, Kaplan-Meier analyses revealed robust graded association between the RV-PA coupling and clinical outcomes (P <0.001).
The RV-PA coupling (RVFWLS/PASP ratio) is independently and robustly associated with adverse clinical events in patients undergoing TAVR. These data suggest that the RVFWLS/PASP ratio can serve as a risk stratification tool for patient selection and prognostication following TAVR."

This study aimed to evaluate periprocedural and clinical outcomes in patients with large and extra-large annuli undergoing TAVR and to compare results between balloon-expandable (BEVs) and self-expanding valves (SEVs).
This study included patients with severe aortic stenosis (AS) and extra-large annuli who underwent TAVR with either BEVs or SEVs. The primary endpoints were periprocedural and clinical outcomes, including device success, rates of moderate or greater paravalvular leak (PVL), permanent pacemaker (PPM) implantation, new Left bundle branch block (LBBB), stroke, and in-hospital and 1-year mortality. Secondary endpoints included safety outcomes and subgroup analyses comparing outcomes between patients with large (annular perimeter >90 mm and an area >660 mm²) and extra-large annuli (perimeter >96 mm and an area >730 mm²).
A total of 237 patients underwent TAVR, including 160 with BEVs and 77 with SEVs. The mean annular area and perimeter were 737 ± 76 mm² and 96.1 ± 4.1 mm, respectively, with no significant differences between groups. Overall device success was high, though slightly lower in the SEV group (84% vs. 93%, p=0.034), a difference that was no longer statistically significant after multivariate analysis (p=0.234). Moderate or greater PVL occurred more frequently with SEVs (13% vs. 4%, p = 0.016), particularly in patients with extra-large annuli (26% vs. 4%, p = 0.012). One-year mortality was similar between groups (SEV 13% vs. BEV 12%, p = 0.807), and no significant differences were observed in PPM implantation, new LBBB, stroke, or major vascular and bleeding complications.
TAVR is feasible and safe in patients with large and extra-large annuli, with higher rates of moderate or greater paravalvular leak observed in SEV patients with extra-large annuli."

Cases with additional indications or affected nonfirst-degree relative were excluded. Postnatal transthoracic echocardiography (t-Echo) data were reviewed when available. Significant CHD was defined as requiring catheter or surgical intervention in the first year of life.Sixty-five f-Echos were included (mean gestational age: 26.6 ± 3.7 weeks). No significant CHD was identified prenatally. Postnatal t-Echo was performed in 41 (63%) cases, with no significant CHD detected. Two (5%) infants were diagnosed postnatally with BAV, neither requiring intervention during the study interval. Minor findings included one case each of pulmonary valve stenosis and atrial septal defect.In pregnancies with a first-degree relative with BAV and a normal obstetric ultrasound, f-Echo showed no added diagnostic value for detecting significant CHD. Based on the state's birth rate (approximately 35,000/year), BAV prevalence (1-2%), and an average family size of 3.08, an estimated 733 to 1,466 pregnancies annually in Arkansas could qualify for f-Echo under current guidelines. At a cost of $1,000 to 5,000 per study, this translates to an annual healthcare expenditure ranging from $733,000 to 7.33 million. These findings support more targeted screening and the need for multicenter studies. · No significant CHD detected with f-Echo.. · Postnatal t-Echo remains definitive.. · Routine f-Echo may add limited value.. · Cost implications warrant reconsideration."

Performing left atrial appendage closure (LAAC) during TAVI can reduce the risk of thromboembolism while avoiding the need for prolonged anticoagulation.
This single-center study included 5 consecutive patients with severe aortic stenosis and AF who underwent same-session TAVI and LAAC between October 2024 and March 2025. All had contraindications to OAC or high bleeding risk. Procedural details and early outcomes were recorded. Technical success was defined according to Valve Academic Research Consortium-3 (VARC-3) (TAVI) and Munich/The Society for Cardiovascular Angiography & Interventions (SCAI) and the Heart Rhythm Society criteria (LAAC). Continuous variables are presented as mean ± SD or median interquartile range (IQR), and categorical variables as n (%).
Mean age was 75.6 ± 8.4 years; 40% were male. The median Society of Thoracic Surgeons score was 6.0% [IQR 5.5-7.0], median CHA₂DS₂-VA was 4 [4-5], and median hypertension, abnormal renal/liver function, stroke, bleeding history or predisposition, labile INR, elderly, drugs/alcohol concomitantly was 3 [3-4]. All patients received a Meril valve; LAAC devices included Amulet (n = 3) and LAmbre (n = 2). Technical success was achieved in all cases. There were no intra-periprocedural complications, major bleeding (Bleeding Academic Research Consortium ≥3), stroke/transient ischemic attack, or vascular complications. But Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes stage 1 acute kidney injury was observed only in 1 (20%) patient. The median hospital stay was 4 [IQR 3-6] days.
In this study, same-session TAVI and LAAC in AF patients with high bleeding risk were technically feasible and showed an acceptable shortterm safety profile. Larger, prospective studies with longer follow-up are needed to confirm these results."

Cardiovascular interventions,"Heart failure (HF) remains a significant burden following transcatheter aortic valve replacement, adversely impacting survival and quality of life. Identification of patients who may benefit from closer monitoring or adjunctive medical therapy to reduce the risk of HF is an unmet need. The objective of this study was to develop and internally validate a clinical prediction model to determine the 1-year risk of HF hospitalization or death after transcatheter aortic valve replacement.
Using the Society of Thoracic Surgeons/American College of Cardiology Transcatheter Valve Therapy Registry, we analyzed patients who underwent successful transcatheter aortic valve replacement for aortic stenosis and survived to discharge between 2016 and 2019. Covariates were selected based on expert opinion and prior literature. A hierarchical cumulative odds regression model was used to predict a composite outcome of (1) all-cause death, (2) ≥2 HF readmissions, or (3) 1 HF readmission at 1 year.
Among 78 384 patients (median age, 82 years; 45.6% female), 17.4% experienced the composite outcome, including death (10.9%), ≥2 HF readmissions (1.6%), and 1 HF readmission (4.9%). The model demonstrated good discrimination (C statistic, 0.753 derivation and 0.747 validation) and excellent calibration. Among 1-year survivors, performance in predicting HF readmission as an isolated outcome was similar (C statistic, 0.753). A simplified model, including the top 12 variables from the full model, maintained comparable performance (C statistics, 0.74-0.75).
This prediction model effectively stratifies post-transcatheter aortic valve replacement patients by risk of death or HF readmission, supporting its use to guide clinical surveillance and clinical trial enrollment for adjunctive medical therapies aimed at mitigating this risk."

Cardiovascular imaging,"Accurate aortic stenosis (AS) phenotyping requires multimodality imaging which has limited availability. The digital aortic stenosis severity index (DASSi), an AI biomarker of AS-related remodeling on single-view 2-dimensional echocardiography, predicts AS progression independent of Doppler measurements. We sought to evaluate the ability of DASSi to define personalized AS progression profiles and to validate its performance as a scalable alternative to multimodality imaging features of functional, structural, and biological AS severity.
In the SALTIRE-2 trial (Study Investigating the Effect of Drugs Used to Treat Osteoporosis on the Progression of Calcific Aortic Stenosis 2) of participants with mild or moderate AS, we performed blinded DASSi measurements (probability of severe AS, 0-1) on baseline transthoracic echocardiograms. We evaluated the association between baseline DASSi and (1) disease severity by hemodynamic (peak aortic valve velocity), structural (computed tomography-derived aortic valve calcium score), and biological features ([18F]sodium fluoride uptake on positron emission tomography-computed tomography); (2) longitudinal disease progression (change in peak aortic valve velocity and aortic valve calcium score); and (3) incident aortic valve replacement. We used generalized linear mixed or Cox models adjusted for risk factors and aortic valve area.
We analyzed 134 participants (72 [IQR, 69-78] years; 27 [20.1%] women) with a mean baseline DASSi of 0.51 (SD, 0.19). DASSi was independently associated with cross-sectional disease severity: each SD increase was associated with higher peak aortic valve velocity (+0.21 [95% CI, 0.12-0.30] m/s), aortic valve calcium score (+284 [95% CI, 101-467] Agatston units), and [18F]sodium fluoride target-to-background ratiomax (+0.17 [95% CI, 0.04-0.31]). Higher DASSi was also associated with disease progression by Doppler (peak aortic valve velocity) and computed tomography (aortic valve calcium score) at 24 months (P interaction for DASSi × time<0.001), and future aortic valve replacement (75 events over 5.5 [IQR, 2.4-7.2] years, adjusted HR, 1.42 [95% CI, 1.11-1.84] per SD).
DASSi is associated with functional, structural and biological features of AS severity and predicts disease progression and adverse outcomes. DASSi-enhanced echocardiography may provide an accessible alternative to multimodality AS imaging and serve as a predictive enrichment biomarker in clinical trials.

Increasingly, this repair is recognized as an effective and durable surgical approach. The consequences of postoperative leaflet geometry in this repair are relatively unstudied, especially compared with current understanding of optimal geometry for a trileaflet valve. In this work, a computational approach was systematically applied to study the effect of changes in leaflet geometric height in symmetric bicuspidization repair.
Eight model valves with 4 geometric heights spanning a range of typically observed values were constructed at 2 free-edge lengths. Heights varied when loaded in diastole from approximately one-half the annular diameter to just below the annular diameter. Fluid-structure interaction simulations were performed to study the coupled dynamics of the valve and blood. Models were evaluated for stenosis, regurgitation, hemodynamics, mechanics, and diastolic gross morphology.
Cases with loaded geometric height 0.64 to 0.79 times the annular diameter showed the overall best performance, with a coaptation reserve of 4 to 7 mm. Cases with geometric height approximately one-half the annular diameter showed severe regurgitation. Cases with geometric height 0.86 to 0.95 times the annular diameter showed less ""crisp"" coaptation alignment and the appearance of excessive leaflet material.
The intermediate range of geometric height appeared best, with insufficient height causing regurgitation. More geometric height was not always clearly better, as excessively tall leaflets showed less alignment in the coaptation regions."

We aimed to analyze how age, diagnosis, autograft support, and Konno-incision impact outcome.
Patients (0-18 years) undergoing primary/secondary Ross/Ross-Konno from August 1993 to November 2023 were included. Mortality, autograft replacement rate, and greater than mild autograft regurgitation were analyzed in the full cohort and subgroups (age, diagnosis, primary/secondary Ross, Ross/Ross-Konno, autograft support) using time-to-event methods. Propensity-score matching was performed to adjust for differences in baseline characteristics of patients undergoing supported/nonsupported Ross procedures.
In total, 196 patients underwent Ross/Ross-Konno procedures (N = 117/79; 60/40%) with median age/weight of 9.4 years [interquartile range, 3.4-14.1 years]/31.7 kg [12.9-57 kg] and median follow-up of 8.8 years [1.6-14.8 years]. Twenty-year freedom from death, autograft replacement rate, and rate of greater than mild autograft regurgitation was 88.7% (95% confidence interval, 79.8%-93.8%), 13.2% (7.1%-24.7%), and 17.7% (11.3%-27.8%), respectively. Lowest 20-year freedom from death was observed among neonates/infants 47.6% (7.5%-80.8%)/58.9% (34.5%-76.8%) compared with older patients (97.6%; 90.6%-99.4%, P < .001). In total, 83.3% of all deceased neonates/infants had associated mitral valve disease. Patients with isolated aortic valve stenosis and/or Konno-incision were at greater mortality risk (P = .02). 20-year autograft replacement rate was highest among adolescents (12-18 years): 30.7% (15.5-60.9), without statistical significance (P = .08), and greater in secondary Ross: 23.8% (11.4-49.7, P = .03). Matched pairs (supported vs nonsupported Ross, n = 30 each) did not show differences in primary outcomes.
The Ross procedure in pediatric patients demonstrated good long-term outcomes. Mortality risk is greater in neonates/infants and patients with isolated aortic stenosis. Adolescent patients/patients undergoing secondary Ross procedures were associated with greater autograft replacement rates."

The Osaka Prognostic Score (OPS), incorporating CRP, albumin, and lymphocyte count, may address this gap. We aimed to evaluate the prognostic value of OPS for predicting in-hospital and one-year all-cause mortality after TAVI. Materials and Methods: In this retrospective single-center cohort study, 244 patients who underwent transfemoral TAVI between December 2022 and January 2024 were analyzed. OPS was calculated at baseline (range: 0-3), and its prognostic value for in-hospital and one-year all-cause mortality was evaluated using multivariable Cox regression, ROC analysis, and restricted cubic spline (RCS) modeling. Results: In-hospital and one-year mortality rates were 11.5% and 21.7%, respectively. Higher OPS scores were significantly associated with mortality in both periods. OPS independently predicted in-hospital mortality (HR: 2.018; 95% CI: 1.632-2.521; p = 0.017) and one-year mortality (HR: 2.125; 95% CI: 1.300-3.473; p = 0.003). ROC analysis yielded AUC values of 0.776 and 0.859 for in-hospital and one-year mortality, respectively. Kaplan-Meier curves revealed significantly reduced survival in patients with higher OPS (log-rank p < 0.001), and RCS analysis demonstrated a significant nonlinear association between increasing OPS values and mortality risk (p < 0.001). Conclusions: OPS is a simple, cost-effective, and biologically relevant prognostic index that independently predicts both in-hospital and one-year mortality following TAVI. By integrating markers of inflammation, nutrition, and immune competence, OPS may offer additional value in risk stratification and support clinical decision-making in this high-risk population."

Conventional imaging modalities such as ultrasound and computed tomography angiography (CTA) have limited capacity to identify histopathological features of plaque instability, including fibrous cap rupture, lipid-rich necrotic core, and intraplaque hemorrhage. Artificial intelligence (AI) techniques-particularly deep learning (DL) and radiomics-have recently emerged as valuable adjuncts to standard imaging, achieving AUC values of 0.83-0.99 across modalities in identifying vulnerable plaques. This scoping review summarizes the available evidence on the application of AI in the detection and assessment of vulnerable carotid plaques. Methods: A systematic search of the English-language literature was conducted in MEDLINE, SCOPUS, and CENTRAL from 2000 to 30 June 2025, following the PRISMA-ScR framework. Eligible studies applied AI-based approaches (machine learning, deep learning, or radiomics) to evaluate carotid plaque vulnerability using ultrasound, CTA, or MRI. Extracted outcomes included diagnostic performance, correlation with histopathology or neurological events, and predictive modeling for stroke risk. Results: Of 201 records screened, 12 studies met inclusion criteria (ultrasound = 6; CTA = 4; high-resolution MRI = 2; publication years 2021-2025). All reported receiver operating characteristic area-under-the-curve (ROC-AUC) values for endpoints related to plaque vulnerability (symptomatic versus asymptomatic status, presence of intraplaque hemorrhage or lipid-rich necrotic core, fibrous-cap surrogates, and, less frequently, short-term cerebrovascular events). For ultrasound, contrast-enhanced videomics achieved an AUC of 0.87 (10 centers; n = 205), B-mode texture/radiomics reached 0.87 (n = 150), and segmentation-assisted models 0.827 (n = 202); other ultrasound models reported AUCs of 0.88-0.91. For CTA, a symptomatic-plaque machine-learning model yielded AUC 0.89 ( n = 106); a perivascular-adipose-tissue (PVAT) radiomics nomogram achieved AUC 0.836 on external validation; a histology-referenced pilot attained AUC 0.987; and one mild-stenosis TIA model reported ROC performance. For high-resolution MRI (HR-MRI), radiomics-based models showed AUC 0.835-0.864 in single-modality cohorts and up to 0.984 with multi-contrast inputs. Across modalities, AUC ranges were: ultrasound 0.827-0.91, CTA 0.836-0.987 (external 0.836), and HR-MRI 0.835-0.984. Only two out of twelve studies performed external validation; calibration and decision-curve analyses were rarely provided, and most cohorts were single-center, limiting generalizability. Conclusions: AI demonstrates strong potential as a complementary tool for evaluating carotid plaque vulnerability, with high diagnostic performance across imaging modalities. Reported AUCs ranged from 0.83 to 0.99 based primarily on internal or hold-out validation, representing the upper bound of theoretical rather than real-world performance. Nonetheless, large prospective multicenter studies with standardized protocols, histopathological correlation, and external validation are required before clinical integration into stroke prevention pathways."

This effect is exacerbated in the presence of coronary disease (CAD). Treatment with transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) may promote reversal of these pathophysiological conditions.
We performed multimodality assessment of cardiac physiology in patients with AS and concurrent CAD requiring percutaneous coronary intervention, prior to and 6 months after undergoing TAVI. Techniques include: coronary angiography and bolus thermodilution-derived indices of microvascular function (coronary flow reserve (CFR); index of microcirculatory resistance (IMR)); stress perfusion cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) imaging, which was used to measure changes in global myocardial blood flow (MBF) and left ventricular mass (LVM), and computed resting and hyperaemic vessel specific absolute coronary flow (aCBF) and microvascular resistance (MVR) using a computational model of coronary physiology.
Data were obtained for seven patients (10 vessels). CFR increased from 1.53 (1.2-1.7) to 2.35 (2.0-2.7) (p=0.037) 6 months post-TAVI. There was a 33% reduction in resting aCBF from 218 mL/min to 146 mL/min (p=0.004). On CMR, resting MBF fell 37% from 3.0±0.98 mL/min/g to 1.9±0.7 mL/min/g (p=0.033) and stress MBF fell 25% from 3.6±0.57 mL/min/g to 2.7±0.7 mL/min/g (p=0.004). Indexed LVM regressed from 79±14 g/m2 to 71±16 g/m2 (p=0.006). MVR remained unchanged.
CFR increased following TAVI. The mechanism for this was a significant reduction in resting coronary blood flow measured with CMR and modelled computationally. The unchanged MVR and IMR suggest that resting blood flow reduces due to reduced myocardial demand and myocardial remodelling, rather than changes in resistance."

Surgical aortic valve replacement remains the standard treatment but is often deferred due to perceived high surgical risk and frailty, leaving nearly one‑third of patients with severe AR untreated. Transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) offers a less invasive alternative, but off-label use of transcatheter valves designed for aortic stenosis has been limited by anchoring difficulties, valve embolization, and residual regurgitation. Dedicated devices have addressed these challenges with tailored anchoring mechanisms and demonstrated improved procedural success. This case-based review explores the evolving role of TAVR for AR through three patient vignettes that highlight practical considerations for device selection, anchoring strategies, and complication management. While outcomes with dedicated systems are encouraging, further research should establish TAVR in AR treatment. In parallel, device iterations are required to curtail procedure-induced conduction disturbances and broaden anatomical eligibility."

While substituting CT-derived LVOT area in aortic valve area calculations (AVA_CT) increases the calculated valve area, this does not improve its clinical utility. In fact, AVA_CT overestimates the AVA, requiring a higher threshold for defining severe aortic stenosis [AS] (<1.2 cm2). This phenomenon may be attributed to differences in fluid flow dynamics between circular (assumed by echocardiography) and elliptical conduits.
Demonstrate the differences between the calculated AVA before and after implementing a mathematical correction factor for flow in a non-circular conduit.
662 patients with severe AS who underwent aortic valve replacement between 06/2021 and 07/2023. AVA calculated using the continuity equation with both echocardiography and CT data. A correction factor (CF) for elliptical flow was applied per patient.
AVA_CT was significantly higher than AVA_Echo, showing a 23 % increase. After correcting for the elliptical shape of the LVOT, AVA_CT-corrected was lower and closer to AVA_Echo (mean absolute difference of 0.06 cm2) and had superior correlation with invasive measurement. Several patients were reclassified from severe to moderate AS when using AVA_CT; however, applying the correction factor significantly reduced the reclassification.
Incorporating a correction factor for the elliptical geometry of the LVOT improves the accuracy of AVA estimation. The corrected AVA demonstrates better agreement with echocardiographic measurements and reduces the overestimation inherent in CT-based calculations. This approach minimizes discrepancies in patientclassification across AS severity categories."

However, long-term data are limited. This study aimed to evaluate 5-year echocardiographic and clinical outcomes of SEVs versus BEVs in patients with small aortic annulus underwent transcatheter aortic valve replacement.
We analyzed RESOLVE registry patients who underwent transcatheter aortic valve replacement at Cedars-Sinai between 2015 and 2020. Patients with a small aortic annulus (<430 mm2 by computed tomography) were included and followed for up to 5 years. The primary outcome was a composite of all-cause mortality, stroke, or heart failure hospitalization. Secondary outcomes included myocardial infarction, pacemaker implantation, aortic valve reintervention, and structural bioprosthetic valve dysfunction.
Among 1392 transcatheter aortic valve replacement recipients, 423 (78 SEVs, 345 BEVs) met the small annulus criteria. SEVs were associated with lower transvalvular gradients and larger indexed effective orifice area at discharge and 1 year (P<0.001). Moderate-to-severe paravalvular leak was more frequent with SEVs at 30 days (7.7% versus 1.5%, P<0.001), as was permanent pacemaker implantation (17.9% versus 6.1%, P<0.001). At 5 years, the primary outcome did not differ significantly (hazard ratio, 1.21; 95% CI, 0.81-1.82; P<0.33). All-cause mortality, stroke, heart failure hospitalization, structural bioprosthetic valve dysfunction, and reintervention rates were similar between groups.
Although SEVs provide better hemodynamic performance in patients with severe aortic stenosis and small annuli, this advantage did not translate into improved survival or reduced cardiovascular events at 5 years."

To investigate the temporal trend in baseline characteristics and outcomes of patients with secondary MR who underwent transcatheter edge-to-edge repair of the mitral valve in the real world compared with those from the published landmark trials.
A comprehensive systematic literature search was conducted using MEDLINE, EMBASE, and CENTRAL databases, and the identified observational studies were divided into two five-year recruitment periods. The first period included 36 studies that enrolled patients between 2008 and 2012, and the second period included 25 studies that recruited patients between 2013 and 2017-2018. Pooled variables of each five-year recruitment period were compared with those of the landmark trials. A random-effects model was used for statistical comparisons. RStudio and RevMan software were used for the analysis.
Overall, there were no major variations in the findings between the first and the second five-year recruitment periods. EVEREST program vs observational studies: Patients in the EVEREST program were more likely to have non-ischemic MR etiology [odds ratio (OR) = 3.59, 95% confidence interval (CI): 2.92-4.42] and atrial fibrillation (OR = 1.71, 95%CI: 1.42-2.06).

MITRA-FR trial vs observational studies: MITRA-FR patients were less likely to have atrial fibrillation (OR = 0.49, 95%CI: 0.34-0.69) and renal insufficiency (OR = 0.18, 95%CI: 0.11-0.28) but more likely to have a history of myocardial infarction (OR = 1.48, 95%CI: 1.06-2.05) and to receive diuretics (OR = 19.81, 95%CI: 2.75-142.48) and implantable cardiac devices (OR = 1.69, 95%CI: 1.21-2.37). At hospital presentation, they were less likely to be symptomatic (OR = 0.25, 95%CI: 0.18-0.35) without a difference in MR grades 3+ and 4+. There was no difference in terms of MR grade or mortality at 12-month follow-up.
Patients in the landmark studies may have favourable or unfavourable characteristics when compared to those in the observational studies, but this did not translate into different outcomes over time."

The role of concomitant tricuspid annuloplasty (TA) during mitral valve repair (MVr) remains controversial. To address this, we performed a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized and observational studies published up to November 2024, comparing isolated MVr versus MVr with concomitant TA in patients with DMR (CRD42024627505). Reconstructed Kaplan-Meier time-to-event data were analyzed using Cox frailty models to evaluate survival, TR progression, and permanent pacemaker (PPM) implantation. Sensitivity analyses included randomized or propensity-matched cohorts. A total of five studies, including 3,123 patients, were analyzed. Early (1-year) and long-term (up to 15 years) survival were comparable between isolated MVr and concomitant TA (97.3% vs. 96.9%, HR: 1.25, 95% CI: 0.76-2.08, p=0.381 and 72.2% vs 79.7%, HR: 1.28, 95% CI: 0.96-1.72, p=0.092, respectively). Concomitant TA significantly reduced the risk of ≥moderate TR progression (HR: 0.34, 95% CI: 0.17-0.70, p=0.003). However, PPM implantation was higher with TA during the perioperative period (7.4% vs 1.1%, HR 5.76, 95% CI 3.13-10.59) and remained elevated at 2 years. Sensitivity analyses confirmed these findings. In conclusion, in patients undergoing MVr for DMR, concomitant TA effectively prevents TR progression without compromising survival but is associated with increased PPM implantation. These results support a selective, guideline-directed approach to TA based on patient- and disease-specific risk factors."

Clinical signs included coarse lung crackles, mild tachycardia, and muffled heart sounds. Blood analysis showed moderate leukocytosis with neutrophilia and monocytosis. Echocardiography revealed enlargement of the left atrium, significant valvular regurgitation, and small fluid accumulations in the pleural and pericardial cavities. Treatment with furosemide and enalapril provided brief improvement over 2 weeks before the rabbit's death. The case highlights valvular regurgitation as a frequent cause of heart failure in aging rabbits and emphasizes the value of early detection and timely therapy in improving outcomes and extending quality of life in affected animals."

This study compares the early outcomes of these 2 approaches to performing SM in patients with obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (oHCM).
We analyzed the outcomes of 200 consecutive patients undergoing transapical beating-heart myectomy and 200 patients receiving transaortic on-pump myectomy. The primary outcome was procedural success, defined as a peak left ventricular outflow tract (LVOT) gradient <30 mm Hg on predismissal echocardiography. Secondary outcomes included transfusion and postoperative atrial fibrillation rates and intensive care unit (ICU) length of stay.
Both techniques significantly reduced LVOT gradient (median reduction: transapical, 102 mm Hg to 15 mm Hg; transaortic, 88 mm Hg to 12 mm Hg; P < .001 for both). Transapical beating-heart myectomy was associated with a shorter ICU stay (median, 24.0 hours vs 26.0 hours; P < .001), a lower atrial fibrillation rate (9.5% vs 30.0%; P < .001), and fewer transfusions (8.0% vs 22.0%; P < .001) but resulted in a higher incidence of new-onset left bundle branch block (63.8% vs 37.0%; P < .001) and longer postoperative hospital stay (median, 11 days vs 5 days; P < .001), owing mainly to institutional protocols. Overall 30-day mortality was 0.5% (n = 1) in the transapical beating-heart myectomy group and 1.0% (n = 2) in the transaortic on-pump myectomy group (P = .562).
Transapical beating-heart SM provides comparable hemodynamic outcomes to transaortic on-pump myectomy with advantages in ICU recovery time, transfusion rates, and postoperative atrial fibrillation. It may be a viable, less invasive alternative for selected oHCM patients. Further studies, including randomized trials, are needed to assess long-term outcomes."

In this report, we describe a case of K. aerogenes IE in an elderly male patient who initially presented to urgent care with a UTI. He had been diagnosed and prescribed a course of oral antibiotics; however, the treatment failed due to antimicrobial resistance. This led to the development of bacteremia and sepsis requiring hospital admission. He later developed endocarditis as confirmed by echocardiography, which was complicated by mitral regurgitation, respiratory failure, and multiple embolic central nervous system (CNS) strokes. He was treated with intravenous (IV) antibiotics and assessed by cardiac surgery, though operative management was deferred until his overall condition improved.

It is controversial that whether these patients with iASD persistence will progress to a bad prognostic state. So it's worthwhile to evaluate whether the procedure of TEER induced iASD leads to development of a relevant interatrial shunt. This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to identify predictors of iASD persistence in patients with mitral regurgitation (MR) undergoing TEER and assess its effect on in-hospital outcomes and mortality.
In this systematic review and meta-analysis, we conducted a literature search in various databases. Our investigation summarized data from contemporary studies on the incidence of iASD following TEER for MR and its association with clinical outcomes.
10 studies were analyzed, possible predictors of risk factors for the persistence of iASD after TEER seemed to be atrial fibrillation before surgery (OR 1.40; P = .04), residual MR > 2+(OR 2.36; P = .001), residual tricuspid regurgitation > mild(OR 1.52; P = .01), and prolonged fluoroscopic time(MD [in minutes] 5.36; P = .007). Patients with iASD persistence after TEER seemed to have a greater risk to suffer from right heart overload reflecting from the enlarged right ventricle end-diastolic dimension (RVEDD) (MD 3.27; P < .00001) and the enlarged diameter of the right atrium (MD 4.41; P < .00001). Patients with iASD persistence after TEER had a greater risk of heart failure rehospitalization (OR 2.71; P = .003).
This systematic review and meta-analysis identified several related predictors of iASD persistence, possibly leading to right heart volume overload and a higher risk of heart failure rehospitalization. In order to generalize our findings, larger clinical studies in independent patient cohorts are necessary. What's more, there is a need to perform a careful decision for interventional closure of an iASD after TEER."

Methods: This prospective single-center cohort study included 101 patients with chronic heart failure (mean age 62 ± 15.5 years; 70.3% male) with paroxysmal or persistent drug-refractory atrial fibrillation who underwent atrioventricular node ablation and CRT-D implantation. All patients received optimal medical therapy before and after undergoing the procedure. Predictors of 5-year mortality were assessed using exploratory machine-learning methods, including random forest and Shapley additive explanations. Results: During 5-year follow-up, 13 cardiovascular deaths were recorded. Five key predictors of mortality were identified: left ventricular ejection fraction, 6 min walk distance, mean pulmonary artery pressure, systolic relaxation coefficient, and degree of mitral regurgitation. The exploratory predictive model showed high accuracy (92%) in terms of classifying the outcomes. Conclusions: Atrioventricular node ablation (AVNA) combined with CRT-D was associated with the observed long-term clinical outcomes observed in patients with drug-refractory tachysystolic atrial fibrillation. The exploratory machine learning analysis identified key mortality-associated factors, which may support future efforts in personalized risk stratification and hypothesis generation. The combination of AVNA and CRT-D was associated with the observed long-term outcomes in this real-world cohort."

He was admitted with a complaint of exertional and persistent chest pain, accompanied by electrocardiographic changes suggestive of anterior ST-elevation myocardial infarction. Initial investigations, including coronary angiography and optical coherence tomography, revealed unobstructed coronary arteries and no evidence of plaque disruption. Transthoracic echocardiography demonstrated marked asymmetric septal hypertrophy with mild systolic anterior motion of the mitral valve and eccentric mitral regurgitation, in the absence of a resting or provoked left ventricular outflow tract gradient. Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging further confirmed a diagnosis of non-obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM), with late gadolinium enhancement indicating patchy mid-septal and basal fibrosis. In view of these findings, dual antiplatelet therapy was discontinued, and the patient was managed with beta-blockers. He was discharged with plans for outpatient cardiology follow-up, risk stratification for sudden cardiac death, and genetic evaluation. This case highlights the potential for HCM to mimic acute coronary syndromes, particularly in a patient with cardiovascular risk factors, ischaemic ECG changes and ongoing chest pain. It underscores the diagnostic value of advanced imaging modalities in differentiating true myocardial infarction from phenocopies, thereby guiding appropriate and timely management."

On admission, he was found to be in monomorphic ventricular tachycardia (VT) at 150 bpm with hypotension (80/46 mmHg). Synchronised cardioversion with 50 J successfully restored sinus rhythm. Fourteen hours later, he developed acute respiratory distress, and chest imaging demonstrated new bilateral perihilar opacities consistent with pulmonary oedema. He was treated with intravenous furosemide, a glyceryl trinitrate infusion, and non-invasive ventilation, resulting in rapid clinical improvement. ICD interrogation confirmed a prolonged VT episode with a therapy threshold set too high for detection, prompting reprogramming of the VT zone to 130 bpm. The patient was discharged in stable condition after six days. This case underscores that APO after cardioversion may present in a delayed fashion and may be overlooked without prolonged observation. It also highlights the relevance of cardioversion performed for VT, prolonged pre-existing arrhythmic burden, and multiple comorbidities in predisposing patients to post-cardioversion haemodynamic decompensation. Vigilant monitoring and early intervention are crucial to improving outcomes in high-risk patients."

We report a Japanese family with cardiac valvular dysplasia. The proband was diagnosed with multiple valve dysplasia at a primary school health checkup. He also exhibited skin hyperextensibility and joint hypermobility. His younger monozygotic twin brothers were diagnosed with multiple valve dysplasia during their 1-month pediatric checkups. One of them exhibited severe valvular disease and required aortic and mitral valve replacement at age 16 due to progressive regurgitation. All three patients showed no developmental delay or evidence of periventricular nodular heterotopia on brain MRI. We identified a novel hemizygous FLNA variant, NM_001456.4(FLNA):c.2023-6_2026delinsACGCT, in all three patients. Splicing analysis revealed an in-frame deletion of two amino acids, p.Val675_Lys676del. No significant difference was observed in overall expression levels of FLNA transcript between the patient and a healthy individual. In silico structural modeling revealed that this deletion disrupts an α-helix positioned between β-strands of domains 4 and 5, which would impair the structural stability of FLNA. This variant was not found in public genomic databases. In conclusion, we identified a novel likely pathogenic variant in FLNA, p.Val675_Lys676del, the smallest in-frame deletion reported to date in XCVD. Patients with this variant showed variable severity, and some presented with extracardiac features. Our findings expand both the genetic and phenotypic spectrum of XCVD."

It may present with systemic anomalies (Axenfeld-Rieger syndrome) or without (Axenfeld anomaly) and may sometimes be associated with multiple congenital malformations. The estimated prevalence ranges from 1 in 50,000 to 1 in 200,000 live births, with an approximate rate of 1 in 100,000, but no epidemiological studies have been conducted to date. A clinical diagnosis of Axenfeld-Rieger syndrome requires the presence of both Axenfeld and Rieger ocular anomalies, accompanied by extraocular systemic features. Ocular manifestations include iris abnormalities, posterior embryotoxon, juvenile-onset glaucoma (a common complication), and dysgenesis of the iridocorneal angle with iridocorneal adhesions. The most commonly observed systemic anomalies include: umbilical defects; craniofacial dysmorphism; dentofacial abnormalities, such as Class III malocclusion due to maxillary hypoplasia, oligodontia, dental malformations (taurodontism, root dysplasia), microdontia, hypodontia, and anodontia; hearing impairment (partial or complete sensorineural hearing loss); and cardiac anomalies, including non-congenital heart disease and mitral valve insufficiency. Additional anomalies may include hypospadias in males, anal stenosis, endocrine disorders (notably growth retardation) secondary to pituitary dysfunction, psychomotor delay, and various neurological malformations such as Dandy-Walker malformation, mega cisterna magna, posterior fossa cysts, cerebellar vermis hypoplasia, ventriculomegaly, aprosencephaly, cerebral atrophy, microcephaly, arteriovenous malformations (AVM), and digital anomalies such as camptodactyly. Diagnosis is typically made in infancy, based on iris anomalies such as corectopia (displacement of the pupil), polycoria (multiple pupils), and iris hypoplasia. Posterior embryotoxon is frequently observed upon slit-lamp examination. Given the clinical variability, a comprehensive pediatric assessment is essential to identify systemic anomalies and distinguish Axenfeld-Rieger syndrome from the isolated Axenfeld anomaly."
PubMed,mitral regurgitation,Is there still a role for isolated mitral valve surgery in functional mitral regurgitation? A contemporary review.,Ovidio A García-Villarreal,10.24875/GMM.25000018,2025,Gaceta medica de Mexico,"Functional mitral regurgitation (FMR) is the consequence of a series of geometric and functional alterations in the left ventricle, which precipitate structural changes in the mitral valve (MV). Left ventricular remodeling, whether global or localized, generates abnormal tension or tethering of the papillary muscles and chordae tendineae, thereby compromising proper MV closure. Given that FMR is often associated with coronary artery disease, the surgical indication for concomitant MV surgery with coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) is unequivocal. However, the surgical indication for isolated MV surgery in patients with FMR without the need for CABG or other concomitant surgical procedures is more contentious. Excluding the indications for non-surgical procedures, this article examines the context and current status of isolated MV surgery in FMR. Furthermore, a potential decision-making algorithm for surgical interventions in patients with FMR is presented, based on the current accumulated evidence."

Case reports,"Libman-Sacks endocarditis is a form of non-bacterial thrombotic endocarditis, associated with autoimmune conditions such as systemic lupus erythematosus and antiphospholipid syndrome (APLS). Vegetations are usually small and are managed with immunosuppression and anticoagulation.
A 50-year-old female presented to her hospital with left leg weakness, with imaging showing a right parietal stroke and an old occipital lobe stroke. Inpatient transthoracic echocardiography showed a large mitral valve (MV) vegetation with moderate-to-severe mitral regurgitation (MR). She self-discharged against medical advice before further workup could be completed and was lost to follow-up until persuaded to have an outpatient transoesophageal echocardiogram, which showed severe MR with a large (2 cm × 3 cm) mass attached to the posterior MV leaflet. Blood cultures were negative. Review of previous blood tests showed a triple-positive APLS panel, which was positive on repeat testing. She underwent successful mechanical MV replacement. Valve histology was consistent with Libman-Sacks endocarditis. Warfarin therapy was continued, complicated by subdural haematoma (successfully treated), but with no further thrombo-embolic events. Subsequent anti-nuclear antigen testing was positive, and hydroxychloroquine was commenced. Transoesophageal echocardiography 1 year later showed a well-functioning MV prosthesis.
The management of young individuals with ischaemic stroke should include attention to atypical causes. Libman-Sacks endocarditis is usually associated with small vegetations and high thrombotic risk, usually managed medically with anticoagulation and treatment of underlying conditions. Our case was atypical, with the presence of a large vegetation causing significant valvular dysfunction, but it demonstrates that replacement with mechanical prostheses can be a feasible management strategy."

We sought to: validate right ventricular (RV) stroke volumes (SV3DE) and tricuspid regurgitant volumes (RegVol3DE) measured by three-dimensional echocardiography (3DE). Then, we compared the quantitative metrics used to assess TR severity obtained by 3DE and both the conventional and the corrected PISA methods.
3DE RV and left ventricular (LV) SV were collected simultaneously with direct Fick measurements at right heart catheterization (RVSVRHC) in 45 patients (66±14 years, 76% women) with no or trivial TR, and in 57 consecutive patients (73±13 years, 61% women) with mild to torrential (14% mild, 37% moderate, 26% severe, 16% massive, and 7% torrential) TR, and mild or no mitral or aortic regurgitation. In the latter group, RHC and 3DE were combined to derive TR regurgitant volume (RegVol3DE-RHC=RVSV3DE-RVSVRHC) and compared to the 3DE volumetric RegVol (RegVol3DE =RVSV3DE-LVSV3DE). Effective regurgitant orifice area (EROA) and regurgitant fraction (RegFr) were calculated from RegVol3DE, as well as through conventional and corrected PISA methods.
The feasibility of RVSV3DE was 74%. Among patients with no or trivial TR, RVSV3DE and RVSVRHC showed a strong correlation (R2= 0.916, p<0.0001), with a minimal bias (3.7 mL) and reasonable precision (limits of agreement, LOA: -10 mL;18 mL). In those with mild to torrential TR, RegVol3DE correlated with RegVol3DE-RHC (R2=0.918, p<0.0001) and was accurate (bias= -1.3 mL, LOA:-17.9 mL;15.2 mL). EROA, RegVol and RegFr derived from conventional PISA (0.48±0.4 cm2, 38±20 mL, and 36±18%, respectively) were significantly smaller (p<0.05) than those obtained from corrected PISA (0.61±0.5 cm2, 48±24 mL, and 46±24 %, respectively), and volumetric 3DE (0.62±0.5 cm2, 46±25 mL, and 42±18%, respectively).
RVSV measured by 3DE is accurate (minimal bias, acceptable imprecision) when compared to direct Fick RVSVRHC."
PubMed,mitral regurgitation,Global Longitudinal Strain and Biomarker Dynamics in Children With Acute Rheumatic Fever and Mitral Regurgitation: A 12-Month Prospective Study.,Serkan F Çelik; Ugur Karagoz,10.7759/cureus.97492,2025-11,Cureus,"Acute rheumatic fever (ARF) remains a significant cause of acquired heart disease in children, particularly in developing countries. Although left ventricular systolic function is usually preserved, subclinical myocardial dysfunction may be present. Global longitudinal strain (GLS) is a sensitive parameter for detecting early myocardial impairment.
This study aimed to evaluate subclinical myocardial dysfunction in children with ARF-related carditis using GLS and other strain parameters and to assess its progression over a one-year follow-up period according to the severity of mitral regurgitation (MR).
A total of 30 children with ARF-related carditis and preserved systolic function were prospectively enrolled. Patients were divided into two subgroups based on MR severity: moderate MR (Group 1, n = 12) and mild MR (Group 2, n = 18). Conventional echocardiographic parameters and speckle-tracking-derived strain measures were assessed at diagnosis, six months, and 12 months. GLS values were compared with those of age- and sex-matched healthy controls (n = 52).
At diagnosis, GLS was significantly lower in ARF patients than controls (-19.9 ± 2.86 vs. -22.6 ± 4.65; p = 0.02) and at six months (-20.4 ± 3.42 vs. -22.6 ± 4.65, p = 0.04). Although GLS improved in the mild MR subgroup (-21.9 ± 3.82 vs. -22.6 ± 4.65, p = 0.41), it remained significantly impaired in the moderate MR subgroup (-19.25 ± 3.32 vs. -22.6 ± 4.65, p < 0.01) at 12 months. In multivariable linear regression analysis, GLS was negatively correlated with the severity of valve regurgitation (r = -0.53, p = 0.02) and NT-proBNP (r = -0.62, p = 0.012).
GLS and NT-proBNP are sensitive indicators of subclinical myocardial dysfunction in children with ARF-related carditis, especially in those with moderate MR. Longitudinal strain imaging may enhance early detection and guide long-term monitoring."

PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, and Cochrane Library databases were searched from the date of establishment to November 22, 2024. Two investigators independently screened the literature, extracted data, and evaluated the quality of the included studies. Meta-analysis was performed using Stata18.0 software.
Finally, 23 studies were included, all of which scored ≥7 on the Newcastle-Ottawa scale. Meta-analysis results showed that, the left ventricular end-systolic volume index (P < 0.01), left ventricular end-diastolic volume index (P < 0.01), and left ventricular mass index (P < 0.01) of patients with MR were higher than those of healthy individuals. In contrast, the left ventricular ejection fraction (P < 0.01) and global radial strain (GRS) (P < 0.01) of patients with MR was lower than that of healthy individuals; the difference was significant. The E/A of both groups (P = 0.22), global circumferential strain (P = 0.43), global longitudinal strain (P = 0.10), left ventricular relative wall thickness (P = 0.20), and some indexes with significant heterogeneity were analyzed by subgroup according to the degree of MR. The combined results of most subgroup analysis were consistent with the overall results and the heterogeneity was reduced.
There is significant difference in the GRS between patients with MR and healthy individuals, which can provide reference for evaluating left ventricular function in patients with MR."

Case reports,"Infective endocarditis caused by Lactobacillus rhamnosus is extremely rare, particularly in immunocompetent patients without structural heart disease or recent invasive procedures.
A 42-year-old immunocompetent man with no structural heart disease or recent interventions presented with fever and dyspnoea. Blood cultures grew L. rhamnosus. Transoesophageal echocardiography revealed a large vegetation on the aortic valve causing severe regurgitation, along with severe mitral regurgitation due to anterior leaflet perforation. The only identifiable risk factor was regular probiotic consumption. The patient underwent successful double valve replacement and completed 6 weeks of antibiotic therapy with favourable outcome.
A literature review identified 22 published cases of L. rhamnosus endocarditis. Most were associated with underlying valvular disease, invasive procedures, or probiotic use. This case highlights the need to consider Lactobacillus spp. as a potential pathogen, not merely a contaminant, in the appropriate clinical context, and calls for careful patient selection and monitoring when prescribing probiotics."

Tsai; Shivam Singh; Li-Tan Yang,10.3390/jcm15010339,2026-01-02,Journal of Clinical Medicine,"Asymptomatic aortic regurgitation (AR) has traditionally been managed conservatively until symptom onset or overt left ventricular systolic dysfunction. However, adverse myocardial remodeling—detected by myocardial strain, volumetric cardiac magnetic resonance, and fibrosis imaging—often precedes current guideline thresholds for interventions and may be irreversible. Advances in multimodal imaging now enable earlier risk stratification beyond conventional metrics. In parallel, intervention strategies are evolving, including valve repair, valve-sparing root replacement, Ross procedure, and transcatheter aortic valve replacement in selected high-risk patients. This narrative review summarizes contemporary advances in imaging and intervention for asymptomatic AR, while critically appraising current evidentiary and technical limitations that constrain earlier intervention. The review is based on a narrative synthesis of the contemporary literature, drawing from recent clinical studies, imaging advances, and guideline documents rather than a systematic evidence search."

With a focus on the prevalent psychological complications following the onset of this condition, this study aimed to explore the correlation between antenatal depression and Corona disease anxiety, personality traits, and postpartum depression during the COVID-19 pandemic.                                                           Materials and Methods:                     This cross-sectional descriptive-analytical study investigated women receiving care at health centers affiliated with Kerman University of Medical Sciences during the last month of their pregnancy and the postpartum period in 2022. Following the acquisition of informed consent, participants were assessed using various measures, including demographic and obstetric information, the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale, the Corona Disease Anxiety Scale (CDAS), and the NEO Personality Inventory-Revised during their third trimester of pregnancy. The same group of participants completed the Edinburgh Depression Scale and the Corona Disease Anxiety Scale (CDAS) 4-6 weeks after childbirth.                                                           Results and Discussion:                     There was a significant correlation between family income, unwanted pregnancy as perceived by both the mother and father, and antenatal depression. Additionally, marital satisfaction played a significant role in postpartum depression. Furthermore, antenatal depression was significantly associated with neuroticism, agreeableness, and physical symptoms related to Corona disease anxiety. Personality traits, with the exception of extroversion and conscientiousness, and various domains of Corona disease anxiety, excluding psychological symptoms, were also significantly associated with postpartum depression.                                                           Conclusion:                     During pandemics or epidemics, such as the COVID-19 outbreak, experiencing mental distress during pregnancy can contribute to mental health issues during the postpartum period. This risk is particularly true in individuals with unique personality traits, emphasizing the need for increased focus on mental health within prenatal care during these crises."

Method:                     This cross-sectional study was conducted in Kerman, Iran. Data were collected from patients who visited Afzalipour Hospital in Kerman more than twice during the COVID-19 epidemic from the end of February 2020 to March 21, 2021. We conducted two key analyses: 1. Mixed effect logistic regression was used to check the relationship between the variables and COVID-19 severity. 2. Mixed effect linear regression was used to check the relationship between the variables and the length of stay in the hospital.                                                           Results:                     The findings indicated that the most important risk factors for the severity of COVID-19 were heart diseases (OR=1.67,95%CI:1.20-2.30), increasing age (OR=2.23 for age&gt;54, 95%CI:1.70- 2.90), male gender (OR=1.47,95%CI:1.10-1.96), respiratory diseases other than asthma, and frequency of admission (OR=1.60,95%CI:1.20-2.15). All patients who underwent readmission experienced a shorter duration of hospitalization during their subsequent admission (OR=0.94,95%CI:0.91,0.96) and had a higher mortality rate (30% within 14 days, 26.6% between 14-90 days). Patients readmitted at intervals of 14-90 days and greater than 90 days exhibited lower disease severity compared to those readmitted within the 0-14 day period.                                                           Conclusion:                     Examining readmissions, the severity of COVID-19, and the length of hospital stay in affected patients are important factors for planning and allocating resources for COVID-19 management and treatment. These factors can help policymakers develop effective clinical guidelines for hospitalization or outpatient treatment of COVID-19 patients and contribute to reducing the burden of disease in the community."

Kinovea, as an accessible motion-analysis software, provides both visual and quantitative feedback. However, its application in supporting technique development among beginner athletes remains insufficiently explored. Aim: This study aims to describe the use of Kinovea in biomechanics training and examine its contribution to the awareness of kinematic characteristics and movement techniques among beginner athletes. Methods: A descriptive qualitative design involved 72 beginner athletes aged 18–25 years selected through purposive sampling. Data were collected over 16 weeks through interviews, field observations, and motion video recordings analyzed using Kinovea. Kinematic data focused on joint angles, stride behavior, and movement phases during walking, running, and the flight phase. Qualitative data were analyzed using content analysis with NVivo 12, while kinematic results were interpreted descriptively to identify performance patterns and areas for technical refinement. Result: Kinematic analysis showed coordinated joint-angle patterns across all phases. Walking analysis identified arm swing angles of 50.9°–58.8° and leg separation angles of 64.3°–67.2°, indicating a stable gait rhythm. The running analysis revealed knee angles of 68.8°–69.8° and elbow angles of 87.6°–89.1°, indicating efficient propulsive mechanics. The flight phase demonstrated knee angles of 81.2°–87.8° and elbow angles of 80.4°–88.3°, suggesting effective momentum use and postural stability. These measurements supported stride-efficiency assessment and technique evaluation. Qualitative findings revealed that Kinovea enabled athletes to interpret movement phases and identify technical inefficiencies through slow-motion and frame-by-frame visualization. Conclusion: Kinovea supports basic motion analysis by providing clear kinematic information and helping beginner athletes observe and refine their movement techniques. The findings also offer practical value for coaches by enabling more precise identification of inefficient patterns and guiding targeted corrections during early-stage training."

However, in a significant portion of patients, resting findings do not fully reflect the hemodynamic severity of the condition, particularly in asymptomatic individuals with severe valvular disease or those with nonspecific symptoms. In this context, stress echocardiography emerges as a vital imaging modality, providing a dynamic assessment of valvular, ventricular, and pulmonary function under hemodynamic load (from physical exercise or pharmacological agents). Methods: We conducted a comprehensive synthesis and critical evaluation of the current landscape, recent advancements, and future directions regarding the application of stress echocardiography in valvular heart disease. Results: This comprehensive review explores the incremental role of stress echocardiography in valvular heart disease, analyzing the evolution of its clinical applications, from low-flow, low-gradient aortic stenosis to the evaluation of contractile reserve and exercise-induced pulmonary hypertension in mitral stenosis and regurgitation. We discuss standardized protocols, key parameters to monitor, and the diagnostic and prognostic outcomes from major clinical trials and current guidelines. Attention is given to stress echocardiography’s ability to unmask the true severity of the disease and to identify patients at high risk for adverse events, thereby guiding crucial clinical decisions, such as the optimal timing for surgical or transcatheter intervention. Conclusions: The review evaluates the limitations of modality and outlines future research directions, including its integration with new technologies like 3D echocardiography and speckle tracking techniques, to further optimize the role of stress echocardiography as a decision-making tool in the multidisciplinary management of valvular heart disease."

Ruhparwar; Alina Zubarevich; Alexander Weymann,10.3390/jcm15010354,2026-01-02,Journal of Clinical Medicine,"Background/Objectives: Transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) has become the leading treatment option for patients suffering from aortic valve stenosis aged over 70, except in cases of specific contraindications like bicuspid valves, inappropriate access routes, or endocarditis. Minimally invasive aortic valve replacement (MIAVR) has emerged as a potential way to combine the durability of surgery with reduced procedural trauma. This study aims to assess the safety and feasibility of MIAVR in elderly patients. Methods: A total of 990 patients were included in this retrospective cohort study. Among them, 261 (26%) were aged 70 years or older (elderly cohort), and 729 (74%) were younger than 70 years (younger cohort). All patients were followed for at least 30 days postoperatively, with survival data collected through May 2025. Multivariable logistic regression, linear regression, and Kaplan–Meier survival analyses were performed. Results: Elderly patients were more likely to be female (51% vs. 40%, p = 0.001) and carried a heavier burden of vascular and renal comorbidity: renal impairment 33% vs. 17% and extracardiac arteriopathy 45% vs. 30% (both p &lt; 0.001). Major bleeding occurred more frequently in the elderly cohort (7.7% vs. 4.1%; p = 0.02), as did new permanent pacemaker implantation (10% vs. 5.8%; p = 0.021) and sepsis (3.4% vs. 1.1%; p = 0.012). Rates of stroke, perioperative myocardial infarction, ECMO/right-heart failure, re-thoracotomy, and postoperative dialysis were low and comparable across age groups (all p &gt; 0.20). Overall, 30-day mortality was 2.4% (24/990), with crude mortality approximately threefold higher among patients aged ≥70 years (4.6% vs. 1.6%). Conclusions: Our findings indicate that MIAVR is a feasible and safe surgical option across age groups; Elevated morbidity in elderly patients is primarily due to bleeding, pacemaker implantation, and sepsis, while rates of stroke, renal failure, and myocardial infarction are low."

Liu; Luyao An; Liangyi Qie; Lianyue Ma; Xiao Meng; Huixia Lu; Guihua Yao; Mei Dong; Guipeng An,10.3389/fmed.2025.1732507,2026-01-02,Frontiers in Medicine,"Background Severe aortic stenosis (AS) imposes sustained pressure overload on the left ventricle, leading to hypertrophy and myocardial fibrosis, which are key features of adverse cardiac remodeling. Timely transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) may reverse these processes. Transfemoral access remains the primary access method for TAVR, but the limited technique restricts early intervention in patients with narrow femoral arteries. This study aimed to evaluate the safety and feasibility of a novel balloon dilation in sheath (BinS) technique designed to facilitate transfemoral TAVR in such patients. Methods This multicenter, prospective, and first-in-human early feasibility study included patients with severe AS and challenging femoral anatomy who underwent TAVR using the BinS technique between February 2023 and August 2024. The primary endpoint was the 30-day rate of major adverse events. The secondary endpoint was the rate of major adverse events at 6 months. The clinical endpoints included major post-procedural complications. Results Fifteen patients (mean age 73.5 ± 7.3 years; 66.7% male) were treated successfully with the BinS technique via transfemoral access. There were no cases of all-cause mortality, stroke/transient ischemic attack, or severe major vascular access site complications defined by Valve Academic Research Consortium (VARC)-3 at both 30 days and 6 months. No myocardial infarction or paravalvular leakage was observed. 12 patients obtained VARC-3 technical success. Two patients experienced postprocedural arterial dissection, and two developed new-onset conduction abnormalities (left bundle branch block or permanent pacemaker implantation). At 30 days, left ventricular ejection fraction improved significantly from 50.8 ± 17.0% pre-procedure to 59.9 ± 14.6% post-procedure ( p &amp;lt; 0.001). Conclusion The BinS technique appears to be a safe and effective method for enlarging the narrow femoral lumens during TAVR. By broadening transfemoral TAVR eligibility, this approach may permit earlier hemodynamic unloading, thereby mitigating adverse cardiac remodeling and potentially improving long-term outcomes. Larger, longer-term studies are warranted to confirm these findings."
OpenAlex,aortic stenosis,Outcomes of Surgical versus Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement: A Clinical Review,"Stang, Grace",,2026-01-01,Digital Commons - Gardner-Webb University (Gardner–Webb University),"Introduction: Surgical aortic valve replacement (SAVR) has been the predominant treatment for aortic stenosis (AS) for decades. However, transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) is becoming increasingly popular. Originally, TAVRs were only performed on patients who were deemed high-risk for surgery and would have died without the valve replacement. The purpose of this paper is to determine if TAVR or SAVR has better health outcomes for all patients no matter their surgical risk. Methods: A search via PubMed database was done using the key words “aortic stenosis”, “surgical aortic valve replacement”, “transcatheter aortic valve replacement”, and “mortality.” Additional search filters were applied for randomized control trials, systematic reviews, and meta- analyses. Dates were restricted to the last 5 years, and restrictions were added for English language and free full text only. This yielded 67 results and 5 were selected. Results: Of the five reviewed articles, all were meta-analyses and one systematic review. There was a total of 52122 patients. Primary endpoints across all articles were that there is no significant difference between TAVR and SAVR in the outcomes studied. Discussion: This review of studies provided supportive evidence that both TAVR and SAVR are valid treatment options or AS. TAVR had better short-term outcomes while SAVR had better long-term outcomes."

Makaryus,10.3390/jcm15010316,2026-01-01,Journal of Clinical Medicine,"Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide, with ischemic and structural heart diseases being key contributors. While the 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) is a common low-cost diagnostic test, its interpretation is limited by human variability. Through machine learning with large diverse ECG data sets and artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms, ECG analysis can be automated for pattern recognition with higher accuracy. AI-augmented ECG algorithms have been demonstrated to be able to detect myocardial infarction with high accuracy and reduce door-to-balloon coronary intervention times. Similar models can be utilized to detect subtle ECG waveforms suggestive of current or future asymptomatic left ventricular dysfunction, aortic stenosis, and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. Despite these promising results, there is concern for generalizability and bias or errors in training data. As AI systems evolve to multimodal integration, AI-augmented ECG has the potential to redefine cardiovascular diagnostics and enable earlier detection, risk stratification, and precision-guided interventions."

OpenAlex,aortic stenosis,Utility of Fetal Echocardiography in First-Degree Relatives with Bicuspid Aortic Valve and Normal Obstetric Ultrasound.,Alaa Ismail; Jena Schmidt; Elijah H. Bolin; Benjamin Ittleman,,2025-12-31,PubMed,"This study aimed to evaluate the diagnostic yield of fetal echocardiography (f-Echo) in detecting significant congenital heart disease (CHD) in pregnancies with a first-degree relative with a history of bicuspid aortic valve (BAV) and a normal level II obstetric ultrasound.A retrospective review was conducted of all f-Echos performed between 2019 and 2023 for the sole indication of family history of BAV. Cases with additional indications or affected nonfirst-degree relative were excluded. Postnatal transthoracic echocardiography (t-Echo) data were reviewed when available. Significant CHD was defined as requiring catheter or surgical intervention in the first year of life.Sixty-five f-Echos were included (mean gestational age: 26.6 ± 3.7 weeks). No significant CHD was identified prenatally. Postnatal t-Echo was performed in 41 (63%) cases, with no significant CHD detected. Two (5%) infants were diagnosed postnatally with BAV, neither requiring intervention during the study interval. Minor findings included one case each of pulmonary valve stenosis and atrial septal defect.In pregnancies with a first-degree relative with BAV and a normal obstetric ultrasound, f-Echo showed no added diagnostic value for detecting significant CHD. Based on the state's birth rate (approximately 35,000/year), BAV prevalence (1-2%), and an average family size of 3.08, an estimated 733 to 1,466 pregnancies annually in Arkansas could qualify for f-Echo under current guidelines. At a cost of $1,000 to 5,000 per study, this translates to an annual healthcare expenditure ranging from $733,000 to 7.33 million. These findings support more targeted screening and the need for multicenter studies. · No significant CHD detected with f-Echo.. · Postnatal t-Echo remains definitive.. · Routine f-Echo may add limited value.. · Cost implications warrant reconsideration."

Transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) has emerged as an alternative to surgical aortic valve replacement (SAVR), expanding from inoperable to low-risk populations. This systematic review compares short- and long-term outcomes between TAVI and SAVR in patients with severe AS. Following PRISMA 2020 guidelines, PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science were searched (2010–2025). Eligible randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and comparative cohorts reporting mortality, stroke, pacemaker, or valve durability were included. Twenty-one studies (16 RCTs, 5 registries; n≈23,000) were analyzed. Thirty-day mortality was similar (RR 0.94, 95% CI 0.82–1.07). TAVI reduced bleeding (RR 0.63) and acute kidney injury (RR 0.71) but increased pacemaker implantation (RR 2.46) and paravalvular leak (RR 3.32). Five-year results (PARTNER 3, NOTION) showed comparable survival and valve durability. TAVI provides equivalent survival and superior early recovery compared to SAVR, although conduction disturbances and leak remain limitations. SAVR remains preferred for younger or bicuspid patients pending longer durability data."
OpenAlex,aortic stenosis,Tuberculous Aortitis Masquerading as Takayasu Arteritis: A Diagnostic Tightrope in a TB-Endemic Region,Tooba Fatima Iram; Yusra Fatima Anam; Haroon Abdullah Shaheed; Rahul Kumar Agarwal; Naazira Begum,10.5195/ijms.2025.3747,2025-12-31,International Journal of Medical Students,"Background: Tuberculous aortitis is an exceptionally rare extrapulmonary manifestation of Mycobacterium tuberculosis, most often seen in TB-endemic areas. It typically presents with nonspecific symptoms and may closely mimic primary large-vessel vasculitis, particularly Takayasu arteritis. Differentiating between infectious and autoimmune causes of aortitis is critical, as the management pathways diverge significantly namely, anti-tubercular therapy (ATT) versus immunosuppression. This case illustrates the diagnostic complexity and clinical decision-making involved in distinguishing between the two in a high-risk patient. Case Presentation: A 50-year-old woman with a background of hypertension, type 2 diabetes mellitus, chronic atherosclerotic disease, and bilateral renal artery stenosis presented with a two-day history of vomiting and blurring of vision. She had no history of fever, claudication, stroke, postprandial pain, or chest discomfort. On examination, she had a striking discrepancy in blood pressure: 160/80 mmHg in the upper limbs and 80/50 mmHg in the lower limbs. Neurological and systemic examinations were otherwise unremarkable. Initial investigations revealed serum sodium of 119 mmol/L, creatinine of 1.5 mg/dL, and CRP of 21.6 mg/L. ANA was positive, while cANCA and pANCA were negative. CT brain showed chronic right parietal lacunar infarct. A CT aortogram revealed severe narrowing of the descending thoracic and abdominal aorta with &gt;90% stenosis of the coeliac artery, moderate superior mesenteric artery stenosis, and one-third occlusion of the left posterior tibial artery. These findings raised strong suspicion for Takayasu arteritis. However, PET-CT demonstrated metabolically active supraclavicular lymphadenopathy, and Mantoux testing was strongly positive. ESR and CRP showed a rising trend. While a lymph node biopsy was planned, general surgery deemed it inaccessible for sampling at the time. The patient had no systemic features suggestive of autoimmune vasculitis but did meet multiple criteria for large-vessel involvement with TB-related inflammatory markers and imaging findings. Given the constellation of features and the TB-endemic context, a presumptive diagnosis of tuberculous aortitis was made. Conclusion: This case highlights the diagnostic challenge of differentiating tuberculous aortitis from Takayasu arteritis, particularly in regions where tuberculosis is endemic. Radiological findings alone may be insufficient, as both conditions can involve extensive aortic and branch vessel narrowing. In such cases, adjunctive investigations—such as Mantoux testing, PET-CT imaging, inflammatory markers, and careful exclusion of systemic autoimmune features—are critical in guiding diagnosis and therapy. Timely recognition of tuberculous aortitis is vital to prevent inappropriate immunosuppression and its complications. Empirical initiation of ATT in clinically suggestive cases, even in the absence of histopathological confirmation, may be justified in high-burden settings when biopsy is not feasible. Clinicians must maintain a high index of suspicion and adopt a multidisciplinary approach to navigate such diagnostic tightropes.

The objective of this substudy was to compare echocardiographic findings in women with severe aortic stenosis following surgical aortic valve replacement or TAVI. Methods At 48 European centers, 443 women underwent randomization 1:1, and 420 were treated as randomized. Echocardiograms were available in 356 patients and were analyzed by a core laboratory. Results Rates of or greater moderate paravalvular regurgitation was low (&lt;1%) and similar between groups. At 30 days, TAVI was associated with higher mean transprosthetic gradient and smaller aortic valve area, but the rate of severe patient–prosthesis mismatch (3.0 versus 2.6%; P =1) was low and not different between groups. Valve hemodynamics were stable at 1 year. The rate of residual left ventricular hypertrophy (45.3 versus 28.6%; P =0.004) at 1 year was significantly higher with TAVI, whereas the rate of right ventricular systolic dysfunction (14.5 versus 40.7%; P &lt;0.001) and evolution of cardiac damage stage (improved in 21.8 versus 18.1%; worsened in 16.8 versus 47.0%; P =0.001) were better with TAVI. Conclusions Among women with severe aortic stenosis, both TAVI and surgical aortic valve replacement achieve excellent valve hemodynamic results with low and similar rates of moderate or greater paravalvular regurgitation or severe patient–prosthesis mismatch. Surgical aortic valve replacement was associated with lower gradients and more pronounced regression of left ventricular hypertrophy, whereas TAVI was associated with better right ventricular systolic function and evolution of cardiac damage stage.

Increasing evidence identifies lipoprotein(a) [Lp(a)] as a causal factor linking lipid metabolism, inflammation, and valve calcification. Lp(a) levels are largely genetically determined and remain stable throughout life, making them a potential therapeutic target. This review summarizes the current evidence on Lp(a) and AVS pathophysiology, the diagnostic and prognostic role of Lp(a), and the therapeutic potential of Lp(a)-lowering agents. Emerging Lp(a)-targeted therapies, including antisense oligonucleotides and siRNA-based agents, could reshape AVS management by providing the first pharmacological option to slow disease progression in selected high-risk patients."

Assessment of severity assumes the greatest importance when aortic valve replacement is under consideration. In addition to a number of well-known technical frustrations in the Doppler diagnosis, a puzzling and persistent discrepancy between aortic valve gradients obtained by Doppler and those measured at catheterization emerged, further clouding the issue. This discordance led several investigators to the discovery of pressure recovery (PR) of varying degrees in the ascending aorta in AS patients distal to the stenotic valve. PR is often a significant factor in assessing the physiologic burden of AS. The impact of PR must be considered in the comprehensive assessment of AS severity."
