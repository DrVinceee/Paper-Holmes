This process leads to cytotoxicity and organ dysfunction. Cardiac involvement is the main prognostic determinant and requires a multidisciplinary management approach. In recent years, the treatment of AL amyloidosis has significantly evolved with the introduction of innovative agents such as proteasome inhibitors, immunomodulators, and monoclonal antibodies like daratumumab, which has shown a favorable impact on hematological outcomes and organ function. The daratumumab-CyBorD regimen is currently the standard first-line therapeutic option. The therapy is tailored based on the stage of cardiac and renal damage, aiming for a complete hematological and organ response. The management of cardiac involvement, including aortic stenosis, atrial fibrillation, thromboembolic risk, conduction disorders, arrhythmias, and heart failure, plays a crucial role in prognosis. An integrated multidisciplinary approach in specialized centers experienced in the disease is essential to optimize clinical outcomes."

A contrast-enhanced CT revealed a 5.5 cm ascending thoracic aortic aneurysm, bicuspid aortic valve, and a left atrial mass. Transesophageal echocardiography showed a tumor in the left atrium attached to the fossa ovalis. Infectious evaluation was undertaken, and polymerase chain reaction was positive for anaplasmosis. Coronary angiography found severe coronary artery disease. After completing a course of antibiotics and recovering from his acute illness, the patient underwent left atrial tumor resection, aortic valve replacement, aortic aneurysm repair, and coronary artery bypass grafting. Pathology confirmed the tumor was a myxoma. This case illustrates that allowing time for clinical stabilization and completion of a course of antibiotics for sepsis due to anaplasmosis prior to urgent cardiovascular surgery may be a reasonable approach."

We aimed to assess the contemporary lifespan and associated factors in patients with severe AS undergoing TAVR.
We performed a retrospective cohort study of patients who underwent TAVR at the 4 largest centers in Israel between July 2008 and March 2023. Mortality predictors were assessed using multivariable Cox regression analysis.
The cohort included 6191 patients (51% females; mean age 82.7 ​± ​5.4 years; median follow-up 5.9 years). The overall estimated 5- and 10-year survival was 70 and 42%, respectively. To assess temporal trends, patients were stratified to early (2008-2015; n ​= ​2058) and late (2016-2023; n ​= ​4133) eras. Patients in the early TAVR era had significantly lower survival probability, compared to the late era (hazard ratio 2.0 (95% confidence interval 1.8-2.2), p ​< ​0.001], with an 8-year survival of 39 and 71%, respectively. Using an age threshold of ≥80 years, defined using spline analysis the 8-year survival in the early vs. late eras was 37 vs. 47% among older patients and 66 vs. 82% among younger patients.
Lifespan following successful TAVR has markedly improved over the past decade across age groups. Notably, patients younger than 80 years, at the time of TAVR exhibit an estimated survival exceeding 10 ​years. These findings should be integrated into Heart Team decision-making for optimal lifelong management of AS."

Exercise-based cardiac rehabilitation (EBCR) is effective in other cardiac populations, but its benefits after TAVR remain uncertain. This study evaluated the impact of EBCR on functional capacity, cardiac function, quality of life, and safety outcomes in post-TAVR patients.
A systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) published through February 2025 was conducted using major databases. Outcomes were pooled using mean differences or risk ratios with 95% confidence intervals.
Six RCTs with 272 patients were included. No significant difference was found between EBCR and usual care for peak VO2 change (MD: 1.46, 95% CI: [-0.16 to 3.08], p = 0.076) and six-minute walk distance (6MWD) change (MD: 18.72, 95% CI: [-2.24 to 39.68], p = 0.08). Similarly, no significant difference was observed between EBCR and usual care for left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) change (MD: 1.31, 95% CI: [-2.06 to 4.69], p = 0.45), and aortic valve orifice area change (AVOA) (MD: -0.03, 95% CI: [-0.24 to 0.18], p = 0.78).
EBCR did not significantly improve outcomes after TAVR; however, near-significant trends in functional capacity warrant further large-scale investigation.

This study sought to evaluate outcomes of transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) using the intra-annular NAV and the ULTRA THVs in severe aortic stenosis patients with small annuli.
Patients with an aortic annulus area ≤430 mm2 undergoing TAVI with either NAV or ULTRA from the NAVULTRA registry were included. Propensity-matched analysis was performed for adjustment. Primary endpoints included 1-year mortality, a composite endpoint (all-cause mortality, disabling stroke, or heart failure hospitalisation), and 30-day device-oriented outcomes (severe prosthesis-patient mismatch, moderate or greater paravalvular leak [PVL], mean gradient ≥20 mmHg).
Among 1,617 patients, 524 propensity score-matched pairs were analysed. At 1 year, all-cause mortality was 8.8% with NAV versus 9.0% with ULTRA (adjusted p=0.585), and the composite endpoint occurred in 11.3% versus 11.8%, respectively (adjusted p=0.149). The device-oriented endpoint favoured NAV compared to ULTRA (6.0% vs 29.3%; adjusted p<0.01), with a lower residual transvalvular gradient (7.3 mmHg vs 12.7 mmHg; adjusted p<0.01), and reduced incidence of any prosthesis-patient mismatch (odds ratio 0.27, 95% confidence interval: 0.18-0.43; adjusted p<0.01). However, NAV was associated with higher rates of mild paravalvular leak (NAV 33.5% vs ULTRA 23.2%; adjusted p<0.05) and permanent pacemaker implantation (PPI; NAV 20.1% vs 11.9% ULTRA; adjusted p<0.01).
In patients with small aortic annuli, TAVI with both NAV and ULTRA provided comparable 1-year clinical outcomes, but NAV showed better haemodynamic performance at the cost of higher rates of mild PVL and PPI."

A male patient in his 30s with childhood TOF repair presented with mild right-sided hemiparesis and motor aphasia due to an ischemic infarction. Cerebral angiography revealed ITCB at the T2 level with severe left internal carotid artery stenosis, a right aortic arch, and aberrant left subclavian artery. Percutaneous transluminal angioplasty initially resolved the stenosis, but progressive restenosis required carotid artery stenting, achieving sustained patency. Embryologically, neural crest anomalies and persistence of fetal vascular structures, including the ductus caroticus and the ductus arteriosus, may underpin ITCB associated with TOF. Carotid artery stenting in this setting is technically more challenging, as the guide catheter must be positioned unusually low in the thorax, risking proximal slipping of the guiding system into the aorta."

However, their combined role in patients undergoing transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) remains unclear. This study aimed to determine whether the combined assessment using pulmonary artery pulsatility index (PAPi) and PAC can stratify clinical outcomes in patients with aortic stenosis (AS) undergoing TAVI.
This retrospective single-centre study included 77 patients with severe AS who underwent right heart catheterisation within 3 months before TAVI. Patients were stratified into four groups based on the median values of PAPi and PAC. The primary endpoint was a composite of all-cause death or heart failure-related hospitalisation.
During a median follow-up of 3.60 years (interquartile range: 1.89-4.62), 15 patients experienced the primary endpoint. Kaplan-Meier's analysis showed significant stratification by PAPi-PAC groups (log-rank p = 0.040). In Cox regression models, the low PAPi/low PAC group was independently associated with adverse outcomes compared with the other groups (hazard ratio (HR): 3.65, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.28-10.40, p = 0.015 adjusted for age and sex; HR: 3.61, 95% CI: 1.27-10.26, p = 0.016 adjusted for natriuretic peptide levels; HR: 3.07, 95% CI: 1.07-8.81, p = 0.038 adjusted for the Meta-analysis Global Group in Chronic Heart Failure score).
Combined PAPi-PAC assessment identified distinct haemodynamic phenotypes with prognostic significance following TAVI. This approach offers a simple, physiologically grounded framework for postprocedural risk stratification and individualised management."

Several mechanisms, such as multiple comorbidities, haemolysis and acquired coagulopathy, have been postulated. We aimed to address the knowledge gap regarding survival outcomes of Southeast Asians patients with AS and anaemia.
Six hundred and fifty-one consecutive patients in a tertiary academic centre with index echocardiographic diagnosis of AS were stratified into three groups based on haemoglobin (Hb) levels. Baseline demographics, comorbidities, echocardiographic findings and clinical outcomes were compared.
Of the 651 patients with AS, 256 had mild anaemia (mean Hb 11.2 g/dL, standard deviation [SD] ± 0.8), 122 patients had moderate-severe anaemia (Hb 8.7 ± 1.2 g/dL) and 273 patients had no anaemia (Hb 13.8 ± 1.3 g/dL). Patients with more severe anaemia presented with higher-grade New York Heart Association IV symptoms ( P = 0.002). More profound degrees of anaemia were independent predictors of increased all-cause mortality (mild anaemia: adjusted hazard ratio (aHR) 1.84, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.42-2.39, P < 0.001; moderate/severe anaemia: aHR 2.77, 95% CI 2.00-3.82, P < 0.001) and increased composite endpoints (mild anaemia: aHR 1.25, 95% CI 1.01-1.55, P = 0.047; moderate/severe anaemia: aHR 1.33, 95% CI 1.33-1.76, P < 0.001) compared to no anaemia. Anaemia was a significant effect modifier of aortic valve replacement on all-cause mortality in AS on the additive scale (relative excess risk due to interaction 2.16, 95% CI 0.21-4.54, P = 0.04).
Anaemia in AS was associated with worse symptomology, all-cause mortality and composite endpoints of cardiovascular outcomes in Southeast Asian patients."

Its occurrence with transposition of the great arteries (TGA) is exceptionally rare, and the presence of coexisting aortic valve stenosis adds significant hemodynamic complexity. We describe a term neonate who presented immediately after birth with severe cyanosis and desaturation, requiring intubation and prostaglandin E₁ infusion. Chest radiography demonstrated marked cardiomegaly, while echocardiography confirmed TGA with a large ventricular septal defect (VSD), a dysplastic pulmonary valve resulting in free pulmonary regurgitation with massive main pulmonary artery dilatation, hypoplastic branch pulmonary arteries, and moderate aortic valve stenosis. Given the complexity of the cardiac anatomy, the guarded prognosis, and significant limitations in social support, including the poor socioeconomic status of very young parents who lived far from the nearest tertiary hospital, the multidisciplinary team elected to pursue conservative management. This rare constellation of cardiac lesions underscores the challenges of early recognition, risk stratification, and decision-making in neonates with severe conotruncal malformations."

Heart & vasculature,"There is debate whether surgical aortic valve replacement (SAVR) or transcatheter implantation (TAVI) provide better results for treatment of aortic valve stenosis. While randomized clinical trials (RCTs) are considered to compare the average treatment effect of two methods in a selected patient population, registry data, although biased, reflect every day clinical practice and provide external validation of RCTs. We evaluated the impact of SAVR or TAVI on long-term survival based on local reports from all available regions in the world.
We systematically searched three databases selecting risk-adjusted registry studies comparing outcomes for SAVR and TAVI with at least five years of follow-up. Reports without all-cause mortality were excluded. One time-to-event curve was reconstructed from survival curves. Cox regression model and sensitivity analysis were performed.
From 10,399 screened studies, 13 met the inclusion criteria with 28,344 patients in the final analysis (follow-up: 5-9 years). In ten studies, survival rates favored SAVR, three showed no difference and none favored TAVI. Hazard ratio (HR) for overall survival was 0.58 (95 %CI: 0.54-0.61, p < 0.01 - favors SAVR). A landmark analysis with a 6-months split showed no significant survival difference in the first 6 months (HR: 0.94, 95 %CI: 0.86-1.02, p = 0.14) and better survival for SAVR compared to TAVI thereafter (HR: 0.43, 95 %CI: 0.40-0.46, p < 0.01). All sensitivity analyses supported this outcome.
This systematic regional registry-type comparison revealed that SAVR is associated with increased long-term survival compared to TAVI, which appears to be independent of the world region in which the study was performed."

This study aims to compare mortality and other outcomes by prosthesis type for patients aged 50-70 years who received SAVR in a well-characterized Australian cohort.
Data were prospectively collected at the time of heart valve surgery and linked administrative outcome data. This analysis includes all patients aged 50-70 years who had SAVR in Western Australian public hospitals between 2010 and 2020. The primary endpoint was all-cause mortality. Secondary endpoints were cardiovascular mortality, separately and combined with admission for either non-fatal myocardial infarction or for non-fatal stroke (MACE), major bleeding, and days alive and out of hospital (DAOH). Outcomes, categorized by prosthesis type (mechanical or bioprosthetic), were compared using propensity matching. Within the initial cohort of 706 patients undergoing SAVR (mean age 62.5 years, SD 6), propensity score matching identified 149 patients each with mechanical or bioprosthetic valves. After adjustment, patients who received mechanical valves had lower all-cause mortality [adjusted hazard ratio (aHR) 0.51; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.27-0.98; P = 0.04] and MACE (aHR 0.53; 95% CI 0.30-0.95; P = 0.03) during median follow-up of 3.6 years. Mechanical valves were associated with increased risk of major bleeding (aHR3.40; 95% CI 1.32-8.77; P = 0.01). There was no difference in risk of cardiovascular mortality, admissions for non-fatal MI, non-fatal stroke, or DAOH by prosthesis type.
Patients aged 50-70 years who underwent mechanical valve SAVR had lower risk of all-cause mortality and MACE compared with those who received a bioprosthesis, despite higher bleeding risk. Randomized comparisons are necessary to confirm these findings."

Heart & vasculature,"Radiographic markers such as psoas muscle area (PMA) and pleural effusion have been linked to mortality after transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI). We examined their relationship with cause-specific mortality and their incremental prognostic value beyond EuroSCORE II.
This retrospective study included 1090 consecutive TAVI patients treated at Heart Hospital, Tampere University Hospital between 2008 and 2020. Preoperative CT scans were reviewed for L3-level PMA and pleural effusion (>10 mm thickness). Subdistribution hazard models adjusted for age, sex, BMI, and BSA were used to analyze cause-specific mortality. Incremental prognostic value beyond EuroSCORE II was assessed using time-dependent discrimination indexes (AUC and IDI) and net-reclassification index (NRI) at 3 years.
During a median follow-up of 4.3 years (IQR 3.1-6.0), 54% (n = 590) of patients died: 64% (n = 376) from cardiovascular, 30% (n = 177) from non-cardiovascular, and 6% (n = 37) from unnatural causes. PMA and pleural effusion were associated with cardiovascular mortality (PMA: SDH/1SD 0.88, 95% CI 0.78-0.99, p = 0.037; pleural effusion: SDH 1.73, 95% CI 1.37-2.19, p < 0.001). Combined inclusion of PMA and pleural effusion improved NRI = 0.13 (p = 0.004) and IDI = 0.015 (p = 0.004) of overall mortality prediction compared to EuroSCORE II alone.
Psoas muscle area (PMA) and pleural effusion were independently associated with cardiovascular mortality after TAVI, whereas no significant associations were observed with non-cardiovascular deaths. Combined inclusion of these parameters led to a modest but not clinically meaningful improvement in the EuroSCORE II-based prediction of mortality."

Heart & vasculature,"Shear wave elastography (SWE) is a noninvasive ultrasound technique that quantifies liver stiffness. Previous studies have suggested that liver SWE can serve as an indirect marker of hepatic congestion. However, it remains unclear whether liver SWE measured after transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) is associated with clinical outcomes.
A total of 127 consecutive patients with severe aortic stenosis who underwent TAVI and had liver SWE measured using abdominal ultrasonography at discharge were enrolled. Liver SWE was obtained from the right hepatic lobe via an intercostal approach. Patients were stratified by the median liver SWE value (1.36 m/s): low-SWE group (< 1.36 m/s; n = 59) and high-SWE group (≥ 1.36 m/s; n = 68). The primary endpoint was a composite of all-cause death and heart failure (HF) rehospitalization.
All 127 patients were followed for 24 months, during which 21 (16.5 %) experienced the primary endpoint. Kaplan-Meier analysis showed a higher cumulative incidence of the primary endpoint in the high-SWE group than in the low-SWE group (log-rank P = 0.019). In Cox proportional hazards models adjusted using inverse probability of treatment weighting, high liver SWE was independently associated with an increased risk of the primary endpoint (hazard ratio 3.66; 95 % confidence interval 1.30-10.32; P = 0.014).
High liver SWE after TAVI was independently associated with an increased 24-month risk of all-cause death and HF rehospitalization."

Integrated care pathways (ICPs) supported by structured data systems may improve safety and outcomes, but real-world evidence in AS remains limited. We aimed to characterize a contemporary cohort of patients with severe AS managed within an ICP at a tertiary hospital, comparing profiles and outcomes by treatment strategy, and to describe diagnostic procedures and the implementation of cardiac rehabilitation (CR) interventions embedded in the pathway.
Prospective observational study of all consecutive patients with AS evaluated by a multidisciplinary heart team between 2018 and 2022. Baseline characteristics and frailty, diagnostic tests, CR interventions, procedural details, and outcomes were collected via an interoperable data management platform and compared across treatment groups: surgical (SAVR) or transcatheter (TAVR) valve replacement, or conservative management. Early survival was assessed using Kaplan-Meier analysis with log-rank testing.
Among 984 patients (median age 78 years, 42% women), 43.9% underwent SAVR, 49.8% TAVR, and 6.3% were managed conservatively. TAVR and conservative groups were older, frailer, and had higher comorbidity. Device success at 30 days was high (≈91%), with periprocedural death at 2.5% for interventions, vs. 9.7% early mortality for conservative management (p < 0.001). Early survival differed significantly (log-rank p = 0.004). TAVR had higher permanent pacemaker implantation (21.7% vs. 7.4% for SAVR, p < 0.001) and major vascular complications (4.1% vs. 0.2%, p < 0.001), while SAVR had more reoperations (8.3% vs. 0.2%, p < 0.001) and atrial fibrillation (18.9% vs. 10.1%, p = 0.001). Prehabilitation was implemented in 64.6% of candidates, while postprocedural CR remained underutilized (11.3%).
Integrated care for a cohort of patients with AS, supported by structured data management, enabled comprehensive profiling, systematic outcome monitoring, and identification of improvement areas. Both SAVR and TAVR achieved high success with low early mortality, while conservative management had poor survival."

Aortic valve replacement improves outcomes and hematologic abnormalities. Transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) showed lower rates of life-threatening bleeding, fewer perioperative complications, and reduced transfusions compared to surgical replacement. Guidelines recommend dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) for 3-6 months post-TAVR, with 79%-86% of patients experiencing no recurrence of GI bleeds. Management of intestinal angiodysplasia often shows high recurrence rates due to persistent lesions and vWS-2A. Surgical valve replacement also improves bleeding control, even with anticoagulation. Aortic valve replacement should be first-line therapy in severe aortic stenosis with chronic GI bleeding.
Heyde syndrome remains a complex and often underrecognized condition in elderly populations. Continued research is critical to deepen understanding and improve patient outcomes, allowing for more personalized and effective care strategies."

However, the effect of preprocedural diuretic treatment on long-term outcomes in AS patients who undergoing transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) remains unclear. We prospectively enrolled 4,903 consecutive AS patients who underwent TAVI in 7 Japanese hospitals between April 2010 and June 2024 and evaluated the effect of preprocedural diuretics treatment on clinical outcomes. Patients were divided into 2 groups as follows: the Diuretics group, who received diuretic treatment before TAVI (n = 2,073), and the Non-Diuretics group without diuretic treatment (n = 2,830). The median observation period was 2.1 years. The Diuretics group was older and had higher surgical risk scores and more comorbidities, including prior myocardial infarction, atrial fibrillation/flutter, and peripheral artery disease. The Diuretics group included more patients with New York Heart Association (NYHA) classification III/IV, lower left ventricular ejection fraction, and reduced renal function. They had significantly worse all-cause and cardiovascular mortality than those in the Non-Diuretics group (38% versus 26% and 18% versus 10%, respectively; P < 0.001 by log-rank test). After propensity score matching to minimize the influence of confounding factors, preoperative diuretic treatment was associated with worse all-cause mortality (hazard ratio [HR]: 1.29, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.06-1.58, P = 0.012) and cardiovascular mortality (HR: 1.61, 95%CI: 1.15-2.26, P = 0.006). Two fifths of AS patients who undergoing TAVI received preoperative diuretics, and those patients had worse all-cause and cardiovascular mortality. Preprocedural diuretic treatment was an independent predictor of all-cause and cardiovascular mortality after TAVI."

This study compared clinical outcomes in patients undergoing non-surgical treatment (NT) of aortic valve (AV), aortic valvuloplasty (AVP), and aortic valve replacement (AVR). This multicenter, retrospective observational cohort study included 338 moderate AR patients undergoing rheumatic MV surgery from January 2015 to January 2024. We followed up with patients for a median of 43.4 months. Furthermore, more-than-mild aortic valve dysfunction (AVD) in the follow-up period was our primary outcome. Our secondary outcomes were all-cause mortality and cardiac valve reoperation before discharge and during follow-up. We classified patients into three groups, namely, NT (n = 128), AVP (n = 91), and AVR (n = 119) groups, respectively. Moreover, 33.0%, 30.1%, and 3.9% of patients achieved our primary outcome, while 4.2%, 5.6%, and 9.6% of them attained our secondary outcomes in the three groups, respectively. We observed that fewer patients from the AVR group had achieved the primary outcome than those in the NT [adjusted relative risk (RR), 0.41; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.21-0.68; p = 0.002] and AVP groups (adjusted RR, 0.14; 95% CI, 0.04-0.43; p = 0.002), respectively. The secondary outcomes did not significantly differ among the three groups. Without increasing surgical risks, the concurrent AVR significantly improves AV status in moderate AR patients undergoing rheumatic MV surgery throughout follow-up. None or mild AVD was observed in many patients from the NT group during the follow-up, thereby warranting the delay of surgery for AV."

However, data on long-term survival and causes of death after M-TEER remain limited.
This single-center registry included consecutive patients undergoing M-TEER with the MitraClip device for severe MR between February 2016 and June 2020. The primary objective was long-term mortality trends and causes of death. Over a median follow-up of 3.3 years (IQR 1.3-5.1; maximum 8.5 years), 130 of 218 patients (59.6%) died, with 55.4% due to cardiovascular (CV) causes, mainly heart failure (HF, 34.6%). Non-CV deaths were attributed to sepsis (15.4%), malignancy (10.8%), trauma (3.8%), and multi-organ failure (1.5%). CV mortality accounted for 55% of deaths within 1 year and 68.4% beyond 5 years, with no significant change in the CV/non-CV mortality ratio over time. Among 88 survivors, non-fatal CV events were infrequent: 12.5% were rehospitalized for HF and 2.3% underwent repeat M-TEER. Non-CV hospitalizations occurred in 9.1%, mainly due to fractures or pneumonia. Independent predictors of all-cause mortality included ischemic secondary MR etiology, prior HF, TAPSE/sPAP ≤0.36, and ≥moderate tricuspid regurgitation, while a low MitraScore predicted better survival. A low MitraScore risk was associated with a significantly lower all-cause and CV mortality compared to a high Mitrascore risk (48.6% vs 83.9%, p < 0.001; 21.0% vs 64.4%, p ≤ 0.001).
Long-term mortality after M-TEER remains influenced by extra-mitral cardiac involvement and non-cardiac comorbidities. The MitraScore preserves its prognostic accuracy during extended follow-up."

Although both del Nido and St. Thomas cardioplegia solutions are widely used, comparative evidence in adult rheumatic mitral valve replacement remains limited. This study aimed to compare their myocardial protective efficacy and clinical outcomes.MethodsA prospective comparative study was conducted between May 2022 and October 2024. Total 50 adult patients undergoing mitral valve replacement-20 with severe mitral regurgitation (MR) and 30 with severe mitral stenosis (MS) were included. Patients were divided into two groups based on cardioplegia type (del Nido or St. Thomas). Intraoperative parameters, postoperative left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF), troponin I levels, inotropic and ventilatory support, and ICU/hospital stay were analysed.ResultsBaseline characteristics were comparable across groups. The mean number of cardioplegia doses was significantly lower in the del Nido group (1.6 ± 0.5 vs 3.2 ± 0.8; p < 0.001). Postoperative LVEF was better preserved with del Nido cardioplegia (MS: 53.3 ± 7.2% vs 45.3 ± 10.6%; p = 0.023). Troponin I levels at 6, 24, and 48 h were lower in the del Nido group, though not statistically significant. Patients receiving del Nido required less inotropic and ventilatory support, with shorter ICU and hospital stays. One in-hospital death occurred in the del Nido group due to sepsis.ConclusionDel Nido cardioplegia offers comparable or superior myocardial protection to St. Thomas solution in adult mitral valve replacement, with fewer interruptions, reduced dosing, and faster postoperative recovery."

We evaluated endothelial activation during surgical correction of chronic MR by assessing adhesion molecules ICAM-1 and VCAM-1, classic markers of inflammation, and their association with postsurgical LV dysfunction (LVD).
The study included asymptomatic patients with grade 3-4 degenerative MR. Transthoracic echocardiography data and blood samples were collected before and five days after surgical correction of MR. Circulating levels of adhesion molecules were measured by ELISA.
Ejection fraction, end-diastolic diameter (EDD), and volume all decreased significantly after surgery. A significant decline in ICAM-1 concentration was observed between the two periods (457.11±256.12 vs. 240.29±157.14 ng/mL; p=0.031), whereas VCAM-1 levels did not change significantly. Leukocyte count and C-reactive protein were significantly higher in the postoperative period. Early postoperative LVD (in 35.7% of patients) was not correlated with adhesion molecule levels. However, we observed significant changes in ICAM-1 levels associated with postoperative EDD >5.6 cm, which indicates LV dilatation. These patients had markedly lower preoperative and postoperative ICAM-1 values than others.
Serum ICAM-1 levels significantly decline following surgical correction of MR and are associated with postoperative enlargement of the LV. Our study highlights dynamic changes in endothelial activity and underscores the need for a better understanding of this process in MR."

Left atrial reservoir strain (LASR) is a sensitive marker of atrial dysfunction and may offer incremental prognostic value. This study evaluated whether LASR predicts all-cause mortality and heart failure (HF) hospitalizations in FMR, its performance in VFMR versus AFMR, and its utility over standard echocardiographic parameters.
We retrospectively analyzed 102 patients (mean age 68 ± 14 years, 41.2% female) with at least moderate FMR who underwent transesophageal echocardiography between 2018 and 2023. Patients were categorized into VFMR (LV dysfunction or remodelling) and AFMR (LA enlargement with preserved LV function). LASR was assessed using speckle-tracking echocardiography. Primary and secondary endpoints were all-cause mortality and HF hospitalization, respectively. Cox models evaluated associations with outcomes, including subgroup analysis by LASR quartiles and additional risk stratification combining LASR with peak tricuspid regurgitation (TR) velocity.
LASR was independently associated with all-cause mortality in multivariate Cox regression (adjusted HR = 0.887, p = 0.039). Higher LASR quartiles were associated with improved survival (p = 0.013). When combined with peak TR velocity in a composite risk model, patients with LASR ≤ 9.0% or TR velocity > 3.0 m/s had significantly higher risks of mortality (HR = 2.853, p = 0.012) and HF hospitalization (HR = 3.922, p = 0.029).
LASR, particularly when combined with TR velocity, provides strong prognostic value in FMR, supporting its potential role in refining risk assessment."

Transcatheter edge-to-edge repair (TEER) presents a viable treatment option for severe MR in high-risk surgical patients. This review aims to assess the prognostic significance of speckle-tracking echocardiography (STE) in predicting outcomes after TEER and its potential role in patient management. A systematic literature review was done on PubMed for studies until November 2024. The search incorporated keywords of STE and TEER, including original research on STE's predictive value in TEER patients. Studies concerning surgical mitral valve repair or unrelated imaging techniques were excluded. Twenty-nine articles were included, indicating that STE metrics, especially global longitudinal strain (GLS), correlate with clinical outcomes like heart failure progression and mortality. Baseline GLS was determined as predictive of hospitalization and mortality, while post-TEER GLS improvements were associated with better functional capacity. Furthermore, left atrial function metrics were significant in predicting arrhythmia recurrence. This study highlights the utility of STE in predicting outcomes for TEER patients. While findings are encouraging, additional research is essential to elucidate the long-term effects of TEER on cardiac function, thereby enhancing patient selection and management approaches. This review highlights the relevance of STE in prognosticating outcomes for patients undergoing TEER. Further investigations are essential to clarify the long-term repercussions of TEER on cardiac functionality, thereby refining patient selection and management strategies."

We report the case of an 80-year-old woman with multiple comorbidities, including essential thrombocythemia, and a newly diagnosed bladder neoplasm, who recently underwent M-TEER. During routine follow-up, a mass was detected on the atrial surface of the mitral clip. The initial suspicion was thrombus. Transesophageal echocardiography confirmed a mass on the mitral clip. 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography/computed tomography showed focal uptake at the mitral valve level. Based on the modified Duke criteria and European Society of Cardiology 2023 guidelines, the diagnosis was considered ""possible infective endocarditis."" However, the concurrent neoplastic condition and lack of typical pathogens raised the alternative hypothesis of nonbacterial thrombotic endocarditis (NBTE). The patient was treated with intravenous anticoagulation and antibiotics. Serial imaging demonstrated a reduction in the size of the mass, but surgical intervention was precluded due to frailty. A definitive diagnosis could not be established."

A total of 112 patients were enrolled. Sixteen patients (14.2%) died during the 1st year postprocedure, so that they were excluded from the study due to the nonavailability of follow-up echocardiography. Ninety-six patients were included in a single-center, observational study with 67 (69.7%) males and a mean age of 61 ± 14 years. All patients who were selected (n = 96) had completed a 1-year follow-up after M-TEER therapy. Patients were stratified into two groups: right ventricular dysfunction (RVdysf) group (Tricsupid annular plane systolic excursion [TAPSE] <17 mm, [n = 59]) and No-RVdysf group (TAPSE < 17 mm, [n = 37]).
Procedural success was reported in 94.8% and at baseline RV-dysf group showed greater LV end-systolic dimension (left ventricular end-systolic diameter 53 mm vs. 48 mm, P = 0.022), LV end-systolic volume (LVESV 142 ml vs. 89 ml, P = 0.028), and significantly lower LV ejection fraction (LVEF 29.7% vs. 35.8%, P = 0.038). In the RVDysf group, RV dimensions did not change significantly at follow-up but TAPSE showed improvement in RV function after mitral TEER therapy (TAPSE at baseline 14 vs. follow-up 16 mm, P = 0.010). The right ventricular systolic pressure (RVSP) also decreased significantly in the RVdysf group (RVSP 55 vs. 42.5 mmHg, P = 0.000). The left atrial volume decreased significantly (54 ml/m2 vs. 47 ml/m2, P = 0.002), but no significant change was seen in the right atrial volume in this group of patients. When comparing the median differences of both groups at baseline and follow-up, some parameters show slight numerical differences between the groups, the P values generally indicate a lack of statistically significant differences.
Patients with preexistent RV dysfunction showed greater biventricular enlargement and impaired systolic function compared to those with normal RV function. At 1-year follow-up, the M-TEER therapy resulted in positive left ventricular remodeling and improvement in right ventricular systolic function in patients with baseline RV dysfunction, but the magnitude of these improvements was not statistically different from those observed in patients with normal RV function."

We aimed to study cardiac and obstetric complications in pregnant and postpartum women with RHD in SSA and to evaluate the rate of valvular interventions in pregnant or postpartum women with severe disease.
We performed a systematic search in MEDLINE and online sources for studies of women of childbearing age (15-49 years) with RHD published after 2000 in SSA. Included study types were randomized controlled trials, retrospective and prospective cohort studies, case-control studies, case reports, and case series.

We identified 1,478 unique citations, and nine full-text studies met inclusion criteria. Included studies were case series (7), one cohort study, and one case-control study, including a total of 787 pregnant women with cardiac disease, of whom the majority had RHD. Mitral stenosis and regurgitation were the most common valve lesions. Heart failure and arrhythmia occurred in at least 12.9% and up to 36% of study participants, respectively.

Cranial systemic hypertension with caudal systemic hypotension, left ventricular thickening with mild mitral and aortic regurgitation, and cardiogenic pulmonary edema were detected from initial diagnostic testing at the referral institution. A non-contrast-enhancing lesion involving the thoracic aorta along the ascending aorta, aortic arch, isthmus, and proximal descending aorta causing near-complete occlusion of the aortic lumen was revealed from computed tomography imaging. Conservative management for congestive heart failure was instituted. Due to poor quality of life, the dog was euthanized. On autopsy, the cranial aorta was obstructed by a large chronic organizing thrombus with mild neutrophilic and lymphoplasmacytic aortic arteritis. The heart was enlarged with left ventricular concentric hypertrophy and myocardial fibrosis with secondary congestive heart failure. Renal necrosis and hepatocellular atrophy were presumed secondary to reduced perfusion and hypoxia. The underlying etiology of the thrombus and arteritis was unresolved. Similar pathologic findings have not been reported in dogs to the best of the authors' knowledge. Aortic thrombus should be considered as a differential for a mass-like occlusive lesion in the proximal aorta in the dog."

The primary outcome is all bleeding complications within 12 months post-TEER. The two key secondary outcomes are non-procedure-related bleeding within 12 months post-TEER (key secondary outcome 1) and a composite of ischemic events including all-cause mortality, stroke, systemic embolism, and myocardial infarction within 12 months post-TEER (key secondary outcome 2). A hierarchical hypothesis testing will be performed, with the primary outcome and key secondary outcome 1 tested for superiority, followed by the key secondary outcome 2 tested for noninferiority.
The STAR-TEER trial is the first large RCT to stratify patients based on OAC indication and compare different antithrombotic strategies following TEER in these two distinct cohorts."

We aimed to describe long-term outcomes after mitral valve repair in children and to identify echocardiographic predictors of mitral valve reintervention.
We retrospectively reviewed all consecutive patients younger than 18 years who underwent mitral valve repair between 2000 and 2024 at a single tertiary centre. Patients with atrioventricular septal defects or single-ventricle physiology were excluded. Preoperative and predischarge echocardiography assessed mitral regurgitation grade and mean transmitral gradient. Clinical and echocardiographic follow-up data were reviewed and analysed. Reintervention was analysed using competing-risk methods including postoperative mean transmitral gradient and residual mitral regurgitation at discharge.
A total of 112 children were included (age range 5 days-17 years; body weight 2.3-100 kg). Operative mortality was 0.9% (n = 1), late mortality 3.6% (n = 4), and one patient underwent heart transplantation. The cumulative incidence of mitral valve reintervention was 27.5%, 32.9%, 46.6% and 46.6% at 5, 10, 15 and 20 years, respectively. In the Fine and Gray model, higher postoperative mean transmitral gradient was associated with an increased cumulative incidence of reintervention (subdistribution hazard ratio 1.26 per 1 mmHg, 95% confidence interval 1.16-1.38; p < 0.001), whereas moderate-or-greater residual mitral regurgitation at discharge was not significantly associated (subdistribution hazard ratio 0.54, 95% confidence interval 0.25-1.17; p = 0.12). Death and/or heart transplantation events were rare during follow-up.
In this paediatric cohort, mitral valve repair was associated with low operative mortality and satisfactory long-term survival, but reintervention represented the main late risk. Higher postoperative mean transmitral gradient was associated with reduced valve durability, whereas moderate-or-greater residual regurgitation was not independently associated. These findings support efforts to minimise postoperative transmitral gradients when feasible, while individualising the balance between residual stenosis and regurgitation according to valve pathology and repair complexity."

Cardiovascular imaging,"Current guidelines for degenerative mitral regurgitation (MR) emphasize left ventricular (LV) dysfunction. However, subclinical alterations in left atrial (LA) or LV strain may manifest earlier in severe MR.
This study sought to determine whether combined LA and LV strain measurements improve long-term mortality prediction in severe degenerative MR, especially in asymptomatic individuals.
This retrospective derivation cohort included 1,314 patients (mean age: 55 ± 13 years; 35% women) who underwent valve repair or replacement for severe MR. Preoperative peak atrial longitudinal strain (PALS) and LV-global longitudinal strain (GLS) were measured. Patients were categorized into 4 groups by using spline-derived thresholds (PALS: <21.4%; LV-GLS: >-20.5%). The primary outcome was all-cause mortality (median follow-up, 8.4 years). External validation included 605 independent patients.
Impaired PALS (adjusted HR [aHR]: 2.11; P < 0.001) and impaired LV-GLS (aHR: 1.66; P = 0.008) were independently associated with high mortality. The group with both impaired PALS and LV-GLS demonstrated the worst outcome (aHR: 2.50; P < 0.001). In asymptomatic patients (n = 900), the combined use of both strain parameters outperformed traditional LV dysfunction criteria (LV ejection fraction ≤60% or LV end-systolic dimension ≥40 mm), thereby significantly improving net reclassification (net reclassification index = 0.436; P < 0.001) and discrimination (integrated discrimination improvement = 0.024; P = 0.003). Subgroup analyses demonstrated that the prognostic contribution of each strain parameter varied by the functional status of the other chamber. External validation confirmed these associations.
Concomitant impairment of both PALS and LV-GLS identified patients at the highest mortality risk. These findings support an integrated atrial-ventricular strain assessment to improve prognostic stratification, particularly in asymptomatic patients with severe degenerative MR who are undergoing MV surgery."

This prospective study aimed to develop a novel end-to-end deep learning model for preoperative artificial intelligence assessment in transcatheter edge-to-edge mitral valve repair (TEERAI-pre) candidates using multiview, multimodal echocardiography.
TEERAI-pre, a video vision transformer-based classification model, predicts morphological suitability for transcatheter edge-to-edge mitral valve repair from multiview, multimodal echocardiography. A transformer-based feature-level fusion module was designed in TEERAI-pre to integrate multiview, multimodal features for final prediction. An internal data set of 633 patients (7997 transthoracic echocardiographic videos; 766 pulsed-wave Doppler images) was split for 5-fold cross-validation. An external data set of 150 patients (1735 transthoracic echocardiographic videos; 169 pulsed-wave Doppler images) across 2 hospitals evaluated generalizability. Reference standards were provided by 2 experienced valvular cardiologists per international guidelines.
On the internal data set, TEERAI-pre achieved 75.0% accuracy (95% CI, 71.7%-78.4%) for classifying red (unsuitable), yellow (challenging), and green (ideal) zones, with 77.1% precision, 75.5% recall, and 76.2% F1 score. External validation yielded 73.3% accuracy, 74.0% precision, and 74.0% recall. Multiview multimodal integration improved performance. Binary classification (red versus green) showed TEERAI-pre matched senior experts and outperformed intermediate/junior echocardiologists. Feature-level fusion outperformed output-level fusion and single-view model. Backbone selection and calibration analysis confirmed robust performance.
TEERAI-pre demonstrates strong performance in transcatheter edge-to-edge mitral valve repair preoperative assessment using transthoracic echocardiographic videos and images, supporting more accurate patient selection and enhancing clinical workflow efficiency.

In this retrospective observational cohort study, we included patients with severe aortic valve diseases undergoing TAVR between February 2016 and April 2022. Patients were followed, and univariable and multivariate Cox regression were applied for outcome analysis using a composite endpoint including all-cause mortality, nonfatal myocardial infarction, unstable angina, heart failure rehospitalization. The incremental prognostic value of CT-FFR was also analyzed.
A total of 251 patients were enrolled (mean age, 67 ± 10 years; 176 men). During a mean follow-up period of 36 months, 60 patients (23.9%) experienced MACE. AVC score ≥ 2000 (HR = 1.714, 95%CI: 1.020, 2.882, P = 0.042) and CT-FFR ≤ 0.8 (HR = 3.248, 95% CI: 1.760,5.996, P < 0.001) were independent predictors of MACE. The C statistics revealed that adding CT-FFR to the clinical risk factors alone or combined with AVC score provided incremental prognostic value for MACE after TAVR (C-index: 0.710 vs 0.645 [P = 0.012]; and 0.710 vs 0.672 [P = 0.030]).
AVC score and CT-FFR were associated with MACE in patients after TAVR, and CT-FFR presented incremental prognostic value for MACE beyond clinical risk factors alone or combined with AVC score. Therefore, CT-FFR should be incorporated into routine clinical decision-making and risk management for TAVR patients."

During the past two decades, there has been an expansion of pharmacologic and procedural strategies to reduce stroke risk in patients with atrial fibrillation (eg, direct oral anticoagulants, left atrial appendage occlusion, and catheter ablation), patent foramen ovale (ie, percutaneous closure in selected patients), and those undergoing cardiac surgery (eg, embolic protection devices).
Because stroke is the most common neurologic complication associated with cardiac disease, most newer pharmacologic agents and interventions have been designed to reduce the risk of cardioembolism, particularly from atrial fibrillation, the most prevalent cardiac arrhythmia. Common cardiac procedures such as coronary artery bypass grafting and valve replacement surgery can result in stroke and cognitive decline. Neurologists must be aware of the evolving evidence and tools to mitigate neurologic risks in these patients."

The association of HRR (hemoglobin to red cell distribution width ratio) with overall survival outcomes in aortic valve replacement recipients was evaluated. This retrospective study selected 1,976 eligible patients who underwent their first aortic valve replacement surgery from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care IV (MIMIC-IV) database. Univariate and multivariate Cox proportional hazards models were developed. A nomogram prediction model was constructed, and its performance was evaluated through receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves, calibration curves, and decision curve analysis (DCA). Multivariate Cox regression analysis showed that after adjusting for age, sex, comorbidities, and laboratory indicators, for each 1-unit increase in HRR, the risk of mortality decreased by 90.7% (HR = 0.093, 95% CI: 0.028-0.315), 87.3% (HR = 0.127, 95% CI: 0.041-0.390), and 87.5% (HR = 0.125, 95% CI: 0.045-0.348) at 1, 3, and 5 years, respectively, with statistically significant trends (P for trend < 0.05). Restricted cubic spline (RCS) analysis did not reveal a nonlinear relationship between HRR and mortality (P-non-linear > 0.05). The nomogram model performed well in both the training and validation sets, with AUCs of 0.834 and 0.766 for 1-year predictions, respectively. This study demonstrates that preoperative HRR is a significant independent predictor of long-term all-cause mortality in aortic valve replacement recipients. Integrating HRR into clinical risk assessment may enhance prognostication and support individualized management strategies."

Transvenous pacemakers (TVP) have been the standard of care for such cases, although they carry the risk of numerous complications, such as surgical pocket and lead infections. Leadless pacemakers (LP) were introduced as an alternative to minimize these risks. This study aims to compare the outcomes of leadless versus TVP implantation in patients undergoing valve intervention during the peri-procedural duration.
We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of studies identified through a comprehensive search of the PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, and Cochrane Library databases, performed in accordance with the Cochrane Handbook, to compare leadless and TVP in valve intervention patients during the peri-procedural period. Data analysis was performed using Comprehensive Meta-analysis (CMA, version 3.7.107). Primary outcomes included mortality, rehospitalization, and device- or procedure-related complications. Risk ratios (RRs) and mean differences (MDs) were calculated for dichotomous and continuous outcomes, respectively, both with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). The protocol was prospectively registered (PROSPERO: CRD420251150891).
The meta-analysis included 5 cohort studies comprising 10,494 participants. 794 patients received LP and 9,700 received conventional TVP. LP patients had a significantly higher mortality risk (RR = 1.85; 95% CI, 1.06-3.20; p = 0.029), longer hospital stay (MD = 0.67; 95% CI, 0.43-0.90; p < 0.001) and lower ventricular pacing burden (MD = -11.39; 95% CI, -18.98 to -3.80; p = 0.003) compared to patients with conventional TVP. There was no statistically significant difference between the two groups regarding rehospitalization, pocket infection, lead/device dislodgement, and vascular complications.
In this meta-analysis, LP implantation was associated with reduced ventricular pacing burden, but at the expense of a longer hospital stay and increased mortality risk compared with conventional TVP. No significant differences were observed between the two modalities in terms of rehospitalization, pocket infection, lead/device dislodgement, and vascular complications. These findings suggest that although LP were associated with higher observed mortality, this association is likely driven by selection bias, as leadless devices are preferentially implanted in patients with higher baseline risk and greater comorbidity burden. Randomized controlled trials are needed to clarify the comparative safety of leadless versus TVP while minimizing confounding by indication."

Defining this relationship in greater detail can potentially provide insight into device selection and patient-specific treatment goals. We therefore sought to better understand the relationship between both baseline TR severity and change in TR after TTVI and the extent of improvement in health status after TTVI.
As part of the Tri-QOL (Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire Validation in Tricuspid Valve Disease) study, data from 11 studies of TTVI devices were transferred to the US Food and Drug Administration to harmonize and anonymize before analysis by an independent center. This secondary, observational analysis used patient-level data from the 6 single-arm studies of patients who underwent TTVI to explore the association of change in KCCQ-OS with TR grade using multivariable models, adjusted for age, sex, chronic lung disease, and baseline KCCQ-OS. The primary model included TR grade at baseline, TR grade at 1 month, and the interaction between the two.
Among 1056 patients with ≥severe TR who underwent TTVI, mean age was 79.1±7.1 years, 60.3% were female, and mean baseline Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire-overall summary score [KCCQ-OS] was 49.5±22.3. Baseline TR grade was severe in 33.5%, massive in 35.9%, and torrential in 30.6%. One-month after TTVI, TR was none/trace in 21.7%, mild in 27.2%, moderate in 28.1%, and ≥evere in 23.1%, while the mean change in KCCQ-OS was 17.0±21.3 points. In a multivariable model that included TR grade at baseline, TR grade at 1 month, and their interaction, there was a strong association between reduction in TR and improvement in KCCQ-OS, with no consistent evidence of a threshold of TR grade below which there was no further improvement in KCCQ-OS. However, among patients with baseline torrential TR, the extent of health status improvement plateaued for patients achieving moderate or less TR at 1 month (ie, a 3-grade improvement from baseline).
Health status improvement after TTVI was most strongly associated with the degree of TR reduction, although there was minimal additional improvement for most patients beyond a 3-grade reduction in TR. These findings support the goal of achieving mild or less TR with TTVI, although patients with torrential TR at baseline may be well served if moderate TR can be achieved."

Transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) volume continues to increase with evolving indications and practice changes.
This study aims to provide insight regarding procedure access and outcomes to evaluate for potential racial disparities in the contemporary era of TAVR.
TAVR patients (aged ≥18) were identified in the National Inpatient Sample from 2016 to 2019 and grouped by race. Baseline characteristics and in-hospital outcomes were compared between White and non-White patients before and after propensity-score matching. Primary outcomes were in-hospital mortality and a composite outcome. The individual components of the composite outcome served as secondary outcomes.
Of 42,877 total TAVR patients, 37,319 were White and 5558 were non-White. Annual procedure volume in both groups increased significantly (Ptrend < 0.001 for both). The proportions of White and non-White patients remained steady over time (12.5%-13.5% non-White, Ptrend = 0.117). The characteristics of White and non-White patients differed significantly. There was no difference in in-hospital mortality (1.5% vs 1.6%, P = 0.585) or composite outcome (23.8% vs 24.6%, P = 0.316). Non-White race was associated with higher rates of acute renal failure (odds ratio [OR]:1.21, 95% confidence interval [CI]:1.10-1.33, P < 0.001), transfusion (OR:1.18, 95%CI:1.05-1.32, P = 0.006), and vascular complications (OR:1.62, 95%CI:1.29-2.04, P < 0.001), but lower rates of permanent pacemaker implantation (OR:0.83, 95%CI:0.75-0.93, P = 0.001).
TAVR remains safe in both White and non-White patients with comparable in-hospital mortality and overall outcomes. Differences in baseline characteristics and individual complications indicate the presence of racial disparities in procedure accessibility and outcomes.Meeting presentation: Presented at the Transcatheter Cardiovascular Therapeutics (TCT) 2024, October 27-30, 2024, Washington D.C."

PubMed,deep learning,Integrating deep learning and radiomics for precise identification of luminal A/B breast cancer subtypes on dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI.,Jianfeng Shangguan; Elena Shchukina; Dimitar Monov; Svetlana Larina,10.1186/s40644-026-00996-z,2026-02-03,Cancer imaging : the official publication of the International Cancer Imaging Society,"Accurate differentiation between luminal A and B subtypes of breast cancer is critical for selecting therapeutic strategies. However, current approaches rely predominantly on invasive biopsy and immunohistochemical (IHC) analysis. Therefore, the development of non-invasive imaging-based methods capable of reliably classifying tumor subtypes remains an urgent task.
To develop and validate a hybrid classification model combining radiomic and deep learning features extracted from dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (DCE-MRI) to differentiate between luminal A and B subtypes of invasive breast cancer. The study included 312 women from China, Russia and Bulgaria with confirmed luminal subtypes of breast cancer. All patients underwent standardized pre-treatment DCE-MRI, and subtypes were determined using IHC. Tumors were semi-automatically segmented, and radiomic features were extracted using PyRadiomics. Additionally, deep features were extracted from DCE-MRI using a 3D ResNet-50 convolutional neural network. Three models were constructed: a radiomics-based model, a deep learning-based model, and a hybrid model that integrated both approaches using a stacking ensemble method. Model performance was evaluated using AUC, sensitivity, specificity, and other metrics on a test dataset and an independent external validation cohort (n = 148). SHAP and Grad-CAM techniques were applied for model interpretability.
The hybrid model significantly outperformed the individual approaches, achieving an AUC of 0.921, sensitivity of 88.6%, and specificity of 89.7% on the test dataset. Performance remained robust in the external validation cohort (AUC = 0.903). Statistical tests (DeLong and bootstrapping) confirmed the significance of these differences. The most important contributors were radiomic features related to shape and texture (e.g., entropy, sphericity) and high-level deep features. Visualizations highlighted clinically relevant model attention areas.
The proposed hybrid approach represents a clinically applicable, non-invasive method for classifying breast cancer subtypes, potentially complementing or partially replacing biopsy in selected cases. It enhances diagnostic accuracy while maintaining interpretability. Future work will focus on prospective validation and integration with genomic and clinical data within the framework of precision oncology."

This study aimed to systematically evaluate the diagnostic performance of AI models using clinical intraoral images and dental radiographs.
Following the PRISMA-DTA guidelines, PubMed, Embase, Scopus, Web of Science, and IEEE Xplore were systematically searched for studies published between January 2015 and June 2025. Eligible studies applied AI models for caries diagnosis with extractable sensitivity and specificity. Data on dentition, dataset, analysis unit, caries prevalence in test dataset, and preprocessing methods were extracted. Reporting quality and risk of bias were assessed using CLAIM and QUADAS-2. Pooled estimates were calculated with a bivariate random-effects model, with subgroup analyses by image type and analytical unit.
25 studies met the criteria, and 13 were included in the meta-analysis. Pooled sensitivity, specificity, and the area under the curve (AUC) were 0.86, 0.91 and 0.94, respectively. Intraoral image-based models achieved higher sensitivity (0.88) and AUC (0.95), while radiograph-based models showed higher specificity (0.92). Tooth-level analyses yielded stable, clinically relevant performance (0.87/0.91). High heterogeneity (I² > 90%) was partly explained by image type, model architecture, reference standard variation, and test set caries prevalence.
AI models showed good diagnostic accuracy for caries detection across imaging modalities and analytical units. However, given the substantial heterogeneity and limitations in study quality and reference standards, these summary estimates should be interpreted with caution. AI-based systems may serve as complementary decision-support tools in clinical practice, but further standardization, external validation, and high-quality multicenter studies are required before broad clinical implementation."
PubMed,deep learning,Data-efficient learning for accurate identification of MAPK1 inhibitors using an active meta-deep learning framework.,Darlene Nabila Zetta; Tarapong Srisongkram,10.1186/s13321-026-01159-9,2026-02-03,Journal of cheminformatics,"Limited experimental data remains a key challenge in applying machine learning to drug discovery, particularly for cancer-related targets. In this study, we present a data-efficient active meta-deep learning framework to predict mitogen-activated protein kinase 1 (MAPK1) inhibitors, which are promising candidates for cancer-related therapies. Our approach integrates active learning (AL) with a meta-model that combines four deep architectures: a convolutional neural network, an attention, a graph convolutional network, and a graph neural network-attention, trained on molecular descriptors and graph-based representations. These models generate four probability-based features that feed into an attention-based meta-learner, improving predictive performance by 5.12% in the area under the precision-recall curve (AUPRC) and 5.48% in the Matthews correlation coefficient (MCC) using only 10% of the training data. Among the AL sampling strategies evaluated, entropy sampling showed competitive performance in selecting informative molecules for model improvement. Overall, our framework achieves an AUPRC of 0.835 ± 0.017 and MCC of 0.817 ± 0.017, on par with a traditional training method despite using only 26.7% of the training data. Compared to a conventional random forest model trained on brute-force, a 100% full training set, our approach shows a 10.6% improvement in AUPRC and modest gains in MCC, confirming the effectiveness of the proposed framework. Under severe class imbalance, balanced accuracy steadily increased across AL iterations, reaching values greater than 0.85 at the final iteration for all uncertainty-driven strategies. Molecular docking confirmed successful prioritization of the top four predicted compounds. Evaluation on an external MAPK1 data set demonstrated generalizability, with our approach achieving an AUPRC of 0.818 and an MCC of 0.403, comparable to the independent test set. These results highlight the potential of combining intelligent data selection with deep learning architectures through the meta-model to accelerate predictive performance in data-scarce drug discovery. Scientific contribution: This study contributes a novel, data-efficient active meta-deep learning framework for predicting MAPK1 inhibitors, addressing the challenge of limited experimental data in a cancer-specific target. By integrating AL with a meta-model composed of four deep architectures, the approach significantly enhances the predictive performance using only a fraction of the training data. The framework achieves superior metrics compared to traditional training methods, highlighting its potential to accelerate drug discovery in data-scarce settings."

This study aimed to develop and evaluate a deep learning (DL)-based system for automatic measurement of eyelid and periorbital parameters and for classifying levator function (LF) in patients with blepharoptosis. We retrospectively included 1,177 patients who underwent ptosis surgery at a tertiary oculoplastic center from January 2016 to November 2021. LF was categorized into good (> 10 mm), fair (4-10 mm), and poor (≤ 4 mm) based on clinical evaluation. The DL model segmented eyelid and eyebrow regions and measured key parameters; manual measurements were performed for comparison. A multinomial logistic regression model incorporating DL-derived features and demographic data was used to predict LF grades. The DL system achieved high segmentation performance (Dice coefficient = 0.910) and strong agreement with manual measurements (ICC = 0.988 for MRD1; 0.902 for CBH). The regression model classified LF grades with an overall accuracy of 0.760 and an AUC of 0.829, within the range of ophthalmologist assessments (highest clinician accuracy = 0.767). This DL-based system offers an efficient, objective tool for periorbital assessment and LF grading, supporting personalized diagnosis and surgical planning in blepharoptosis management."

This paper reviews state-of-the-art PVC detection methods based on electrocardiogram (ECG) and photoplethysmogram (PPG) signals, employing signal processing techniques, traditional machine learning, and deep learning approaches. The existing methods are categorized into three groups: threshold-based or heuristic-based techniques, conventional machine learning models, and deep learning frameworks. Additionally, the paper provides an overview of ECG and PPG signal databases and the benchmark metrics used for performance evaluation. Given that most methods utilize R-peak and systolic peak detection during preprocessing, we also review various preprocessing techniques for detecting R-peaks in ECG signals and systolic peaks in PPG signals. Based on the performance and key contributions of existing PVC detection methods, we highlight major challenges and future directions, considering the presence of various noise sources in ECG and PPG signals-particularly under ambulatory and exercise conditions-and the resource constraints of wearable or portable long-term ECG and/or PPG monitoring devices."

However, predicting it preoperatively remains challenging. In this multicenter study involving 1661 patients across five institutions and the KiTS23 dataset, RENALNet, a 3D deep learning framework trained on nephrographic-phase CT, was developed and validated. RENALNet outperformed radiomics models, further enhancing diagnostic accuracy when combined with radiologists of varying experience. Grad-CAM visualizations concentrated on anatomically significant invasion sites, improving interpretability. Risk scores derived from RENALNet were found to correlate with Ki-67 proliferation indices and effectively stratified 5-year progression-free survival, demonstrating both biological and prognostic relevance. Transcriptomic analysis revealed that high RENALNet risk was associated with gene expression signatures enriched in pathways such as epithelial-mesenchymal transition, IL6-JAK-STAT3 signaling, and PI3K-Akt signaling, highlighting its link to tumor aggressiveness. RENALNet thus offers a biologically interpretable framework for risk stratification in ccRCC, supporting surgical decision-making and advancing the integration of radiogenomic deep learning into precision oncology."

With the growing need for inclusive and real-time communication technologies, efficient and deployable SLR systems are of critical importance. This paper presents TinyMSLR, an explainable, lightweight framework designed for isolated-sign (gloss) classification on resource-constrained devices. TinyMSLR combines a ConvNeXt-Tiny encoder for fine-grained local visual cues with a Swin Transformer encoder for long-range spatio-temporal context, and integrates an adaptive fusion gate to balance both streams. To further improve accuracy under strict compute and memory budgets, we introduce a dual-teacher knowledge distillation (KD) scheme that transfers complementary spatial and contextual knowledge from high-capacity CNN and Transformer teachers to the compact student model. We evaluate TinyMSLR in a controlled multilingual setting using two public datasets (DGS RWTH-PHOENIX-Weather 2014T and Mandarin CSL) by constructing a shared subset of 20 semantically aligned sign classes and segmenting RWTH continuous sequences into single-gloss clips. Therefore, all reported results correspond to isolated-sign recognition rather than continuous sentence-level multilingual CSLR. On this benchmark, TinyMSLR achieves 99.28% training accuracy and 99.01% validation accuracy, with an F1-score of 98.96%, while keeping the parameter count under 2.7M. Inference latency is 24 ms on standard CPUs and under 13.5 ms on edge GPUs. Overall, TinyMSLR demonstrates a practical accuracy-efficiency-explainability trade-off that is well aligned with deployment-ready multilingual isolated-sign systems on the edge."

To address these challenges, this study proposes a Transformer-Augmented Spiking Neural Network (TASNN) that integrates attention-driven contextual modeling with energy-efficient spiking computation for intrusion detection systems (IDS). The framework incorporates Protocol-Aware Adaptive Normalization (PAAN) and Pseudo-Flow Reconstruction (PFR) to improve robustness to heterogeneous traffic patterns. An adaptive spike encoding strategy, including Multi-Scale Adaptive Spike Encoding (MASE) and Eventified Delta Coding (EDC), converts tabular features into sparse spiking representations. In addition, a Cross-Modal Gating (XMG) mechanism dynamically regulates spiking activity, while Spike-Aware Information Fusion (SAIF) supports stable and interpretable feature selection. Experimental evaluation on benchmark datasets demonstrates that TASNN achieves improved classification performance and reduced computational overhead compared to existing methods, highlighting its suitability for energy-constrained and edge-based intrusion detection scenarios."

Specifically, we first prepared an immunochromatographic SERS sensor with excellent surface enhancement capability for the specific recognition of neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL) molecules in serum, significantly enhancing the detection sensitivity of the target molecule. Subsequently, we integrated deep learning algorithms to perform preprocessing, feature extraction, and pattern recognition analysis on complex SERS spectral signals, overcoming the limitations of traditional algorithms in handling high-dimensional nonlinear data. This approach enables rapid, sensitive, and highly specific detection of NGAL. The platform achieves a detection limit as low as 0.1059 ng/mL with a broad linear detection range. For clinical validation, serum samples from 14 volunteers were analyzed. Six deep learning models were employed to classify the acquired clinical spectral data, with the Residual Network (ResNet) model achieving a classification accuracy of 98.81%, a loss value of only 0.0877, and an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of 99.97%. In addition, in the analysis of new samples, the classification and prediction of data from patients and normal individuals were successfully achieved.

However, current deep learning-based methodologies frequently fail to account for physiological rhythms and clinical diagnostic reasoning, thereby compromising their reliability and interpretability. This study proposes a clinically inspired multi-lead oscillatory Transformer framework, named FHGNet, to enhance the precision and interoperability of classifying ventricular tachycardia (VT) and supraventricular tachycardia (SVT). The proposed architecture integrates R-peak detection for heartbeat segmentation and adaptive-length patch extraction with R-wave positional encoding to enhance temporal awareness. It employs a convolutional neural network (CNN) to capture intra-beat morphological features (QRS morphology), a Transformer with FANLayer to model inter-beat rhythmic patterns, and a graph attention network (GAT) to fuse multi-lead dependencies. Additionally, a two-stage classifier is designed to enhance the detection of rare arrhythmia classes. Experimental evaluations on the MIT-BIH Supraventricular Arrhythmia dataset demonstrate FHGNet achieves a macro F1-score of 91.35% outperforming baselines. Ablation studies reveal that removing GAT reduces F1 by 2.42% in multi-lead scenarios, while the two-stage design improves minority class recall by 5.82%. Attention visualization confirms the model focuses on clinically relevant features, such as ST-T segment energy ratios and inter-lead phase differences, aligning with established diagnostic criteria. Additionally, the interpretability of FHGNet is further enhanced by two aspects: 1) Explicit integration of physiological priors (e.g., RR interval variability, intra-beat positional information) in dynamic feature engineering, which enables the model to align with clinicians' rhythm analysis logic; 2) The two-stage classifier strictly follows the clinical diagnostic workflow (first screening abnormalities, then subclassifying), making the decision-making process traceable. This work provides an interpretable, clinically adaptive framework for high-accuracy ECG classification, potentially reducing reliance on invasive electrophysiological studies."

Fiberoptic endoscopic evaluation of swallowing (FEES) is widely used for direct visualization of the swallowing mechanism in children, offering advantages over fluoroscopy such as bedside accessibility and radiation-free imaging. During FEES, patients swallow green-dyed liquid with an endoscope positioned in the throat. Interpreting FEES recordings is a subjective, time-consuming process that requires specialized expertise. Automated, objective analysis tools would be useful to support clinical decision-making. In this study, we propose a hybrid framework for classifying pediatric FEES recordings as normal or abnormal. The approach combines a rule-based analysis which detects the green-tinted swallowed liquid, with a transformer-based deep learning model. Frames are first filtered using a Siamese network to exclude irrelevant or low-quality frames, followed by quantification of the green frame ratio based on frames containing green patches. A confidence-guided decision strategy classifies clear-cut cases via thresholding, while delegating uncertain cases to the deep learning model for further evaluation. Evaluation on 142 pediatric FEES videos (45 normal and 97 with abnormalities) showed that the hybrid approach outperformed both the deep learning and rule-based methods individually, achieving 89.4% accuracy, 96.6% precision, and 93.3% specificity for aspiration. Our results indicate that by combining rule-based and deep learning strategies, we could reliably detect swallowing abnormalities from pediatric FEES videos with accuracies comparable to experts."

Rausch; Aitor Aguirre; Jeremy W. Prokop; Tomasz A. Timek,10.1161/jaha.125.046137,2026-02-03,Journal of the American Heart Association,"Background                     Right‐sided heart failure (RHF), in the presence of tricuspid valve regurgitation, results from left‐sided heart failure, pulmonary hypertension (PH), or heart malformations. The occurrence of RHF and tricuspid regurgitation represents a critical indicator of hospitalization rates and all‐cause mortality. However, RHF has remained understudied, specifically with respect to the tricuspid valve.                                                           Methods                                            Using the outbred sheep (                       Ovis aries                       ) model of pulmonary artery banding that induces RHF and tricuspid regurgitation, we generated 3 batches of RNA sequencing for 354 samples containing right ventricle, left ventricle, each tricuspid and mitral valve leaflet, and the pulmonary artery representing both male and female sheep. The reads were assembled into a de novo sheep heart transcriptome for differential analysis.                                                                                Results                     The de novo sheep heart transcriptome enhanced transcript mapping of reads by 43% to 45% in the heart valves relative to the reference transcriptome. Identified transcripts produce validated tissue‐specific pathways in ventricles (2756 isoforms), pulmonary arteries (535 isoforms), and valves (1215 isoforms), with transcript differences between the mitral and tricuspid valve involved in extracellular and endocrine signaling. Pulmonary artery banding resulted in the most significant transcriptional changes in the tricuspid valve with alterations in endocrine and immune pathway genes.                                                           Conclusions                     This project highlights the complexity of heart valve tissues and their transcriptional activity in a sheep model of RHF. It suggests potential therapeutic interventions in heart valve remodeling in pulmonary artery hypertension, RHF, and tricuspid regurgitation. This work highlights the need for further human and model organism research into the dynamic valve cells and genes."
Crossref,mitral regurgitation,An Oddball Coexistence: Ebstein’s Anomaly with Rheumatic Mitral Valve Disease Surviving into Late Adulthood,Vimal Kumar Nishad; Rishika Patel; Vaibhav Shrivastava,10.1177/26324636261417723,2026-02-03,Indian Journal of Clinical Cardiology,"Ebstein’s anomaly                     is an infrequent                     congenital malformation of the heart                     , in which the septal and posterior leaflets of the tricuspid valve are displaced to the apex, leading to partial “atrialization” of the right ventricle. Its clinical presentation varies widely, contingent on its severity and any co-occurring cardiac anomalies. Although most cases are identified in childhood, some individuals remain asymptomatic and may not be diagnosed until later in life. Conversely,                     rheumatic mitral valve disease                     represents one of the major causes of acquired cardiac disorders among children and young adults, particularly in developing regions such as India. Despite a significant decline in rheumatic heart disease incidence in India recently, it still poses a major public health challenge. Existing rheumatic heart disease studies report an average prevalence of 0.5 per 1,000 children aged 5-15 years. This report details the unusual co-occurrence of Ebstein’s anomaly and mitral valve stenosis rheumatic in origin in a 65-year-old man, a rare finding in an unoperated patient of this age."

Pressman; Arash Kheradvar,10.1161/jaha.125.045018,2026-02-03,Journal of the American Heart Association,"Background                     Mitral annular calcification (MAC) is common and associated with increased cardiovascular risk and, when severe, mitral stenosis (MS). MAC‐related MS differs anatomically and hemodynamically from rheumatic MS (RMS), challenging standard diagnostic methods. This study compares structural and flow characteristics, including  kinetic energy losses, across MAC‐related MS, RMS, and normal mitral valves, and evaluates the applicability of conventional diagnostic metrics in MAC.                                                           Methods                     Three‐dimensional transesophageal echocardiographic data sets from 70 patients (22 normal mitral valves, 26 RMS valves, 22 MAC valves) were used to obtain linear, area, and volumetric measurements for valve comparison. Representative valves from each group were converted into 3‐dimensional silicone models for in vitro testing in a heart flow simulator. Transmitral flow was assessed with particle image velocimetry, flow energetics were quantified, and coefficients of contraction were derived from geometric and effective orifice areas.                                                           Results                     Compared with RMS, MAC‐related MS had smaller anteroposterior dimensions, reduced valve volume, and lower coefficients of contraction. MAC demonstrated the highest transmitral velocities and energy dissipation in vitro. Unlike the normal model, neither MAC nor RMS produced a consistent transmitral vortex ring. Despite having a larger geometric orifice, MAC MS produced a greater pressure drop than RMS, likely due to increased flow disruption and lower coefficients of contraction.                                                           Conclusions                     MAC‐related MS represents a unique pathophysiological entity, characterized by distinct structural and hemodynamic features. These findings underscore the necessity for disease‐specific diagnostic frameworks and multimodality imaging strategies to inform clinical decision making and guide emerging therapeutic approaches."

Although uncommon, associations between cardiac infection and advanced malignancy, particularly with malignancy serving as the source of infection, have been documented in the literature, making this case clinically significant and complex.                                                           Case presentation                     A 54-year-old postmenopausal woman with insulin-dependent diabetes and poorly managed hypertension, who had previously undergone mitral valve replacement with a mechanical prosthesis and tricuspid valve repair for rheumatic mitral stenosis, was admitted for atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response. On admission, she presented with normochromic normocytic anaemia (7.7 g/dL), elevated inflammatory markers (CRP 250 mg/L), and leukocytosis (14,000/µL, neutrophils 10,000/µL). Transthoracic and transesophageal echocardiography identified vegetation on the mitral prosthesis with elevated gradients. Blood cultures were positive for Escherichia coli. A thoraco-abdominopelvic CT scan revealed a rectal tumor, confirmed by FDG-PET, with features consistent with metastatic colorectal cancer, considered the entry point for the infectious endocarditis. Tumor markers including ACE, CA 19 − 9, and CA 72 − 4 were elevated. The patient was treated with dual antibiotic therapy and showed initial clinical improvement but later died due to ventricular tachycardia.                                                           Conclusions                     This case highlights the importance of considering atypical sources, such as metastatic cancer, in unresolved cases of endocarditis. It underscores the need for comprehensive diagnostic assessment, including oncologic evaluation, in patients with prosthetic valve endocarditis caused by atypical pathogens like E. coli. It also stresses the importance of multidisciplinary collaboration between cardiology and oncology teams. This case report is significant due to its illustration of how infectious endocarditis on a prosthetic mitral valve revealed an underlying metastatic colorectal cancer (CRC)."

Materials and Methods: A total of 143 patients with heart failure and left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) under 50% were included in this retrospective cross-sectional study. Patients were classified into two groups according to the presence of VT. Clinical, biochemical, and echocardiographic variables were compared between groups. Independent predictors of VT were identified using multivariable logistic regression analysis. Results: MAC was significantly more prevalent in the VT group compared with controls (43.6% vs. 17.4%, p &lt; 0.001) and was the strongest independent predictor of VT (OR: 2.74; 95% CI: 1.13–6.65; p = 0.026). Higher inflammatory activity, lower serum albumin levels, increased left atrial volume, renal dysfunction, and elevated diastolic filling pressures were also associated with VT. Conclusion: MAC is a strong and independent predictor of ventricular tachycardia in patients with reduced and mildly reduced ejection fraction. Incorporating MAC into the overall arrhythmic risk profile alongside inflammatory, metabolic, and structural parameters may improve risk stratification in this population."

Results and Discussion:                     There was a significant correlation between family income, unwanted pregnancy as perceived by both the mother and father, and antenatal depression. Additionally, marital satisfaction played a significant role in postpartum depression. Furthermore, antenatal depression was significantly associated with neuroticism, agreeableness, and physical symptoms related to Corona disease anxiety. Personality traits, with the exception of extroversion and conscientiousness, and various domains of Corona disease anxiety, excluding psychological symptoms, were also significantly associated with postpartum depression.                                                           Conclusion:                     During pandemics or epidemics, such as the COVID-19 outbreak, experiencing mental distress during pregnancy can contribute to mental health issues during the postpartum period. This risk is particularly true in individuals with unique personality traits, emphasizing the need for increased focus on mental health within prenatal care during these crises."
Crossref,valvular heart disease,The Severity of Disease and Hospital Length of Stay for the First and Second Admission of COVID-19 Patients: An Observational Study from Southeastern Iran,Milad Ahmadi Gohari; Mohammad Hossein Mehrolhassani; Shoboo Rahmati; Elham Sharifpoor; Hossein Mirzaei; Yunes Jahani,10.2174/0126667975341163241129050027,2026-10,Coronaviruses,"Background:                     This study aimed to investigate the severity of disease and length of hospital stay for COVID-19 patients admitted to a hospital in southeastern Iran.                                                           Method:                     This cross-sectional study was conducted in Kerman, Iran. Data were collected from patients who visited Afzalipour Hospital in Kerman more than twice during the COVID-19 epidemic from the end of February 2020 to March 21, 2021. We conducted two key analyses: 1. Mixed effect logistic regression was used to check the relationship between the variables and COVID-19 severity. 2. Mixed effect linear regression was used to check the relationship between the variables and the length of stay in the hospital.                                                           Results:                     The findings indicated that the most important risk factors for the severity of COVID-19 were heart diseases (OR=1.67,95%CI:1.20-2.30), increasing age (OR=2.23 for age&gt;54, 95%CI:1.70- 2.90), male gender (OR=1.47,95%CI:1.10-1.96), respiratory diseases other than asthma, and frequency of admission (OR=1.60,95%CI:1.20-2.15). All patients who underwent readmission experienced a shorter duration of hospitalization during their subsequent admission (OR=0.94,95%CI:0.91,0.96) and had a higher mortality rate (30% within 14 days, 26.6% between 14-90 days). Patients readmitted at intervals of 14-90 days and greater than 90 days exhibited lower disease severity compared to those readmitted within the 0-14 day period.                                                           Conclusion:                     Examining readmissions, the severity of COVID-19, and the length of hospital stay in affected patients are important factors for planning and allocating resources for COVID-19 management and treatment. These factors can help policymakers develop effective clinical guidelines for hospitalization or outpatient treatment of COVID-19 patients and contribute to reducing the burden of disease in the community."

Kinovea, as an accessible motion-analysis software, provides both visual and quantitative feedback. However, its application in supporting technique development among beginner athletes remains insufficiently explored. Aim: This study aims to describe the use of Kinovea in biomechanics training and examine its contribution to the awareness of kinematic characteristics and movement techniques among beginner athletes. Methods: A descriptive qualitative design involved 72 beginner athletes aged 18–25 years selected through purposive sampling. Data were collected over 16 weeks through interviews, field observations, and motion video recordings analyzed using Kinovea. Kinematic data focused on joint angles, stride behavior, and movement phases during walking, running, and the flight phase. Qualitative data were analyzed using content analysis with NVivo 12, while kinematic results were interpreted descriptively to identify performance patterns and areas for technical refinement. Result: Kinematic analysis showed coordinated joint-angle patterns across all phases. Walking analysis identified arm swing angles of 50.9°–58.8° and leg separation angles of 64.3°–67.2°, indicating a stable gait rhythm. The running analysis revealed knee angles of 68.8°–69.8° and elbow angles of 87.6°–89.1°, indicating efficient propulsive mechanics. The flight phase demonstrated knee angles of 81.2°–87.8° and elbow angles of 80.4°–88.3°, suggesting effective momentum use and postural stability. These measurements supported stride-efficiency assessment and technique evaluation. Qualitative findings revealed that Kinovea enabled athletes to interpret movement phases and identify technical inefficiencies through slow-motion and frame-by-frame visualization. Conclusion: Kinovea supports basic motion analysis by providing clear kinematic information and helping beginner athletes observe and refine their movement techniques. The findings also offer practical value for coaches by enabling more precise identification of inefficient patterns and guiding targeted corrections during early-stage training."

OpenAlex,aortic stenosis,[Analysis of optimizing indications for fetal pulmonary valvuloplasty based on a multi-parameter scoring system].,Y Wang; Y Sun; G Luo; S L Pan,,2026-02-02,PubMed,"<b>Objective:</b> To establish a multi-parametric scoring system for predicting postnatal circulatory outcomes in fetuses with critical pulmonary stenosis (CPS) and pulmonary atresia (PA) with intact ventricular septum (IVS), in order to optimize the indications for fetal pulmonary valvuloplasty (FPV). <b>Methods:</b> This was a retrospective cohort study. A total of 96 fetuses diagnosed with CPS-IVS or PA-IVS at Women and Children's Hospital, Qingdao University between July 2018 and June 2021 were included. Fetuses who did not undergo FPV constituted the modeling cohort, while those who underwent FPV constituted the validation cohort. Fetuses were classified into biventricular and non-biventricular circulation groups based on postnatal circulatory outcomes. Prenatal fetal echocardiographic parameters were compared between groups using independent-samples <i>t</i> test, Mann-Whitney <i>U</i> test, <i>χ</i><sup>2</sup> test or Fisher exact test. Based on inter-group differences, parameters associated with postnatal circulatory outcomes were screened in the modeling cohort. For continuous variables, optimal cut-off values were determined using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve and the Youden index and then dichotomized. Right ventricular endocardial fibroelastosis (EFE) was graded as 0, 1 or 2 according to severity. <i>OR</i> of each parameter were calculated, and a multiparametric scoring system was constructed. ROC curve was used to evaluate its predictive performance. Post-FPV outcome improvement was assessed in the validation cohort. <b>Results:</b> Among the 96 fetuses, 78 were assigned to the modeling cohort and 18 to the validation cohort. Postnatally, biventricular circulation was achieved in 56 cases (72%) in the modeling cohort and 13 cases in the validation cohort. In the modeling cohort, the right ventricular long-axis/left ventricular long-axis (RV/LV), tricuspid annulus diameter/mitral annulus diameter (TV/MV) and pulmonary valve annulus/aortic valve annulus (PV/AV) in the non-biventricular group were lower than that in the biventricular group (all <i>P</i><0.05). The optimal cut-off values for predicting postnatal circulatory outcomes were 0.65, 0.82 and 0.78, respectively. There was statistically significant difference in the distribution of circulatory outcomes between fetuses with grade 2 EFE and those with no or grade 1 EFE (<i>χ</i><sup>2</sup>=21.28, <i>P</i><0.001). Therefore, right ventricular EFE was dichotomized in the model as ""none or grade 1"" versus ""grade 2"". Each parameter was assigned a corresponding weight based on its <i>OR</i> value, and an integer score was obtained to construct the scoring system: grade 2 right ventricular EFE was assigned 5 points, RV/LV≤0.65 was assigned 2 points, TV/MV≤0.82 was assigned 2 points, and PV/AV≤0.78 was assigned 1 point, with a maximum total score of 10 points. At cut-off scores of 3, 4, and 5 points, the areas under the curve were 0.88, 0.91, and 0.88, respectively, with the highest specificity (0.95, 95% <i>CI</i> 0.84-0.99) observed at a score threshold of 5 points. In the validation cohort, 15 fetuses had scores ≥5 points, among whom 10 fetuses achieved biventricular circulation after birth, whereas in the modeling cohort, only 1 of 18 fetuses achieved biventricular circulation after birth. <b>Conclusions:</b> A multiparametric scoring system based on prenatal fetal echocardiographic parameters can effectively predict non-biventricular postnatal outcomes in fetuses with CPS-IVS and PA-IVS. By identifying high-risk patients, the indications for FPV can be optimized."
OpenAlex,aortic stenosis,Can Acute Kidney Injury After Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement Alone Predict Poor Prognosis in Diabetic Patients?,Nur Ozer Sensoy; Fatih Levent; Ece Çelebi Coşkun; Günseli Demir; Mustafa Yılmaz,10.37990/medr.1654048,2026-01-31,Medical Records,"Aim: Transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) has become a well-recognized treatment option for patients with symptomatic severe aortic stenosis (AS) who are deemed to have a higher risk for surgical intervention. Due to underlying comorbidities, acute kidney injury (AKI) continues to be a common complication, especially in patients with diabetes mellitus after TAVR. The aim of this study is to evaluate the effect of postoperative AKI development in diabetic patients undergoing TAVR on the development of mortality and major adverse cardiac events (MACE) in these patients. Material and Method: A total of 141 patients who underwent TAVR between January 2015 and January 2020 were grouped according to whether they developed AKI and whether they had MACE. MACE and 5-year mortality status were compared according to whether the patients developed AKI. Results: A total of 35 patients were observed to develop AKI (24.8%). Additionally, MACE was observed in 36 patients (25.5%). Five-year mortality rates (42.9% vs. 15.1%; p = 0.002) and MACE rates (54.3% vs. 16%; p &lt; 0.001) were significantly higher in the AKI group. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses identified AKI as a significant independent predictor of MACE development, regardless of other associated parameters (OR = 3.92, 95% CI: 1.28–12.02; p = 0.017). Conclusion: The most important result obtained in this study is that AKI development in diabetic patients who underwent TAVR with the diagnosis of advanced aortic stenosis has an effect on the development of MACE and long-term mortality independently of other parameters."
OpenAlex,aortic stenosis,"Accuracy of fetal echocardiography in detecting lesions associated with, and predicting surgical plan for, dextro‐transposition of the great arteries and double outlet right ventricle with subpulmonary ventricular septal defect and predicted transposition physiology",Hamsika Chandrasekar; Michelle Kaplinski; S. A. Maskatia; M. J. Beattie; D. Y. Ho; C. D. Reddy; Rajesh Punn,10.1002/uog.70169,2026-01-30,Ultrasound in Obstetrics and Gynecology,"ABSTRACT Objectives In dextro‐transposition of the great arteries (D‐TGA) and double outlet right ventricle with subpulmonary ventricular septal defect (DORV‐SPV) and predicted transposition physiology, the presence of associated lesions, such as ventricular septal defect (VSD), coarctation of the aorta (CoA) or pulmonary stenosis (PS), impacts prenatal counseling and complicates neonatal surgery. This study aimed to evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of fetal echocardiography (FE) and its ability to predict the postnatal surgical plan in fetuses with D‐TGA or DORV‐SPV. Methods This was a single‐center retrospective cohort study of fetuses with D‐TGA or DORV‐SPV who were liveborn, had a recorded plan for postnatal intervention and were managed at Lucile Packard Children's Hospital, Palo Alto, CA, USA, between January 2013 and January 2024. In cases with serial FE examinations, all available FE reports were included in the analysis, in addition to the first postnatal echocardiogram report. For echocardiograms with incomplete measurement data, a single reader retrospectively obtained FE and postnatal echocardiogram measurements while blinded to clinical outcomes. Prenatal predictions for postnatal surgical repair were extracted from the fetal cardiology consultation notes and postnatal clinical data were obtained by chart review. Final FE and postnatal echocardiogram diagnoses, as well as prenatal surgical‐plan predictions and subsequent postnatal surgical repairs performed, were compared and the percentage concordance was calculated to obtain FE diagnostic accuracy. Receiver‐operating‐characteristics (ROC) curves were generated to evaluate the association of FE aortic and pulmonary measurements with postnatal CoA repair. Results The study included 99 fetuses, of which 45 were diagnosed postnatally with simple D‐TGA with no associated lesions (i.e. D‐TGA with intact ventricular septum), 38 with complex D‐TGA with associated lesions and 15 with DORV, and one neonate was diagnosed prenatally with DORV‐SPV but postnatally diagnosed with truncus arteriosus. In the majority (65%) of patients, serial FE was performed. The percentage concordance between fetal and postnatal echocardiogram diagnoses was high for simple D‐TGA (95% (42/44)) and D‐TGA with VSD and PS (100% (3/3)). The concordance was progressively lower for diagnoses of D‐TGA with VSD (93% (25/27)), DORV‐SPV (60% (3/5)), DORV‐SPV with CoA (40% (4/10)), D‐TGA with VSD and CoA (29% (2/7)), D‐TGA with isolated CoA (0% (0/2)) and DORV‐SPV with PS (0% (0/1)). Similarly, surgical‐plan accuracy between prenatal prediction and postnatal repair performed was highest for cases of simple D‐TGA and D‐TGA with VSD and PS, while it was lower for other diagnoses. Qualitative descriptions of VSD size changed frequently over serial FE examinations, with VSDs generally described as larger on later FE. However, between the final FE and postnatal echocardiogram, in those with discordance, the description of VSD size usually became smaller. Only 50% of small VSDs identified on postnatal echocardiography required repair. All patients who underwent postnatal repair of CoA had a VSD present. All area under the ROC curve values for aortic measurements and for ratios of aortic‐to‐pulmonary dimensions in predicting the need for postnatal CoA repair were greater than 0.9. Conclusions Challenges remain in the accurate diagnosis and prediction of the postnatal surgical plan in fetuses with complex D‐TGA and DORV‐SPV. The assessment of qualitative VSD size description changed frequently over serial FE evaluations, and between final FE and postnatal echocardiogram, with small defects often not requiring repair. Aortic and aortic‐to‐pulmonary ratio measurements in fetuses with D‐TGA or DORV‐SPV appear to have improved the discriminatory ability in identifying cases that undergo postnatal CoA repair relative to fetuses with isolated CoA. © 2026 International Society of Ultrasound in Obstetrics and Gynecology."
OpenAlex,aortic stenosis,Delayed complete atrioventricular block 11 months after transcatheter aortic valve replacement in a patient with a short membranous septum: a case report,Jian Xiong; Djandan Tadum Arthur Vithran; Zhixiao Wang; Zheng Cao; Xiaoyong Hu,10.3389/fcvm.2026.1703981,2026-01-30,Frontiers in Cardiovascular Medicine,"Conduction disturbances are among the most frequent complications of transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR), typically occurring within the first 72 h after implantation. However, delayed complete atrioventricular (AV) block is rare and may present late with serious clinical consequences. We describe the case of a 72-year-old man with hypertension who developed complete AV block nearly 1 year after TAVR, underscoring the importance of long-term surveillance in patients with high-risk anatomy. The patient initially presented with progressive exertional dyspnea and was diagnosed with severe low-flow, low-gradient aortic stenosis, with a left ventricular ejection fraction of 33%. Preprocedural computed tomography demonstrated a short membranous septum (4.0 mm) and an annulus–membranous septum distance of 1.2 mm, both of which are recognized predictors of conduction disturbances. He underwent transfemoral TAVR with a self-expanding Qiming L26 valve implanted at a depth of approximately 5 mm. Early recovery was uneventful, aside from a small paravalvular leak, which resolved by the 8-month follow-up, at which time echocardiography showed recovery of systolic function to 60%, and sinus rhythm was observed on electrocardiography. At 11 months following TAVR, a community screening ECG revealed 2:1 AV block, and 3 weeks later, he presented with symptomatic complete AV block and a ventricular escape rhythm at 30 bpm. Repeat CT showed increased frame depth (7.6 and 9.8 mm), suggesting possible valve–septum interaction; however, causal attribution is limited by the absence of immediate/serial CT and electrophysiological mapping, and age-related conduction system disease may have contributed to this finding. A dual-chamber permanent pacemaker was implanted, resulting in complete symptomatic recovery and a stable prosthetic valve function. This case report highlights a rare but clinically important phenomenon of very late conduction block after TAVR and supports a risk-stratified approach to anatomical assessment and long-term rhythm monitoring. However, this inference remains hypothesis-generating, given its single-patient nature."

Oh,10.1161/jaha.125.046558,2026-01-30,Journal of the American Heart Association,"Background Artificial intelligence (AI)–enabled electrocardiography has emerged as a tool for detecting cardiac dysfunction. The prognostic relevance of AI‐enabled electrocardiography–derived diastolic dysfunction (DD) in patients undergoing transcatheter aortic valve replacement had not been assessed. Methods We analyzed 3197 patients undergoing transcatheter aortic valve replacement for severe aortic stenosis between 2010 and 2023 with baseline 12‐lead ECGs processed by a validated AI model to classify diastolic function (grades 0–3). Multivariable Cox models and nested model comparisons assessed associations with all‐cause mortality, including a prespecified analysis in patients with indeterminate echocardiographic grading. Trajectories were defined by change in AI‐enabled electrocardiography DD grade (&lt;2 versus ≥2) from baseline to 30‐day or 1‐year follow‐up. Results At baseline, 21% had grade 3, 57% had grade 2, 8% had grade 1, and 14% had grade 0 AI‐enabled electrocardiography DD. Higher grades were associated with adverse cardiac remodeling and comorbidities. Over a median follow‐up of 3.4 years, grade 3 AI‐enabled electrocardiography DD independently predicted mortality (hazard ratio [HR], 1.80 [95% CI, 1.47–2.20]; P &lt;0.001). AI‐enabled electrocardiography DD improved prognostic discrimination beyond clinical and echocardiographic measures (ΔHarrell concordance statistic, 0.016; Δ χ 2 =57; P &lt;0.001). Among 1259 patients with indeterminate echocardiographic grading, AI‐enabled electrocardiography added prognostic value (ΔHarrell concordance statistic, 0.02; Δ χ 2 =13; P =0.006). Worsening or persistently high‐risk trajectories were associated with increased mortality (HRs, 1.45–1.80; all P &lt;0.05). Conclusions AI‐enabled electrocardiography–derived DD independently predicts mortality after transcatheter aortic valve replacement, adds value beyond echocardiographic grading, and enables dynamic risk stratification through longitudinal tracking."
OpenAlex,aortic stenosis,Patient‐Specific Computational Flow Simulation Reveals Adverse Hemodynamic Factors Associated With Occlusion of Directional Branches After Fenestrated‐Branched Endovascular Aneurysm Repair,Kenneth Tran; Jesse Chait; Emmanuel Tenorio; Weiguang Yang; Alison L. Marsden; Bernardo Mendes; Lee Jc; Gustavo S. Oderich,10.1161/jaha.125.044790,2026-01-30,Journal of the American Heart Association,"Background Fenestrated and branched endovascular aneurysm repair can be complicated by branch vessel occlusion in the absence of structural stenosis. We hypothesized that computational flow simulation could identify adverse hemodynamic features associated with postfenestrated and branched endovascular aneurysm repair branch occlusion. Methods Patients undergoing 4‐vessel fenestrated and branched endovascular aneurysm repair for Extent II to IV thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysms were retrospectively reviewed. Branches that occluded without identifiable kinking or stenosis on computed tomography were included, along with an equal cohort of anatomy‐matched patent controls. Patient‐specific pulsatile rigid‐wall simulations were performed using SimVascular with individualized geometries and boundary conditions. Abnormal time‐averaged wall shear stress (TAWSS) was defined as &lt;10 or &gt;70 dynes/cm 2 . Results Nine patients (36 target vessels) experienced 10 branch occlusions. Postoperative pressure and flow did not differ significantly between occluded and patent renal or mesenteric branches. However, occluded renal and mesenteric branches demonstrated significantly larger postoperative areas of abnormal TAWSS compared with controls (renal: 14.5% versus 5.9%, P =0.003; mesenteric: 17.7% versus 9.9%, P =0.035). Logistic generalized estimating equation modeling showed abnormal TAWSS to be a significant predictor of renal branch occlusion ( P =0.0085). Model estimates suggested occlusion probabilities of 1.1%, 31%, and 94% at 0%, 10%, and 20% abnormal TAWSS surface area, respectively. A cluster‐bootstrapped receiver operating characteristic curve (area under the curve, 0.876) identified a &gt;10.2% threshold that correctly classified 92% of renal occlusions. Abnormal TAWSS frequently localized to distal stent–artery interfaces. Conclusions Elevated abnormal TAWSS within stented renal branches is associated with subsequent branch occlusion after fenestrated and branched endovascular aneurysm repair. Computational flow simulation‐derived TAWSS thresholds may help identify high‐risk branches before failure, warranting prospective validation."

We report a rare case of significant true lumen stenosis and cardiac dysfunction after undergoing total arch replacement for acute type A aortic dissection. Case Summary A 39-year-old man with acute Stanford type A aortic dissection and intimal tear in the ascending aorta underwent the Bentall procedure and total arch replacement with a frozen elephant trunk. He was readmitted one month after discharge with progressive cardiac dysfunction. Myocardial scintigraphy excluded ischemia, and computed tomography revealed severe true lumen stenosis at the distal frozen elephant trunk, resulting in an elevated left ventricular afterload. Thoracic endovascular aortic repair to expand the true lumen resulted in gradual improvement in cardiac function. However, there was progressive dilation of the descending and thoracoabdominal aorta: 26 mm at onset, and 32 mm and 46 mm at two and six months postoperatively, respectively. To close distal re-entries, endovascular aortic repair was performed after two months. His brain natriuretic peptide level decreased from 2901 pg/mL to 142 pg/mL over eight months; open abdominal aortic replacement was performed nine months after the onset, after sufficient cardiac function recovery (ejection fraction = 40%). Discussion True lumen stenosis is a substantial reversible cause of cardiac dysfunction after type A dissection surgery. Thoracic endovascular aortic repair effectively reduces the afterload and restores cardiac function; long-term imaging and staged intervention are essential to address distal aortic remodeling."

To assess the contribution of aortic valve (AV) calcification severity to permanent pacemaker (PP) insertion after transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) during the hospitalization. Material and methods . The study included 94 patients with severe aortic stenosis who underwent TAVI. All patients underwent multislice computed tomography (CT) before the procedure to assess AV calcification. Results . During the hospital period, eight patients (8,5%) required PP implantation. CT made it possible to reveal that patients who underwent pacemaker implantation after TAVI compared with patients without pacemaker had higher calcium volume in the left coronary cusp (LCC) (424,6 mm 3 [223,1-524,7] vs 151,6 mm 3 [91,9-276,2], respectively, p=0,005) and non-coronary cusp (608,2 mm 3 [254,5-805,2] vs 283,7 mm 3 [173,6-398,9], respectively, p=0,035). As a result of multivariate regression analysis, the independent predictors of pacemaker implantation after TAVI were the initial right bundle branch block (RBBB) (odds ratio (OR): 15,77; 95% confidence interval (CI): 2,06-120,5; p=0,008) and LCC calcium volume &gt;300 mm 3 (OR: 7,98; 95% CI: 1,38-46,11; p=0,020). Conclusion . According to the study results, initial RBBB and LCC calcification are independent predictors of permanent pacemaker implantation after TAVI during the hospital period. Further studies are needed to predict and prevent post-operative complications."
OpenAlex,aortic stenosis,Comparing TAVR + PCI vs. SAVR + CABG across short- and mid- to long-term horizons in patients with severe aortic stenosis and concomitant CAD: a systematic review and meta-analysis,Xiang Fang; Xuge Zhang; Fei Wei; Shenghong Feng; Xiaomei Chen,10.3389/fcvm.2026.1640906,2026-01-30,Frontiers in Cardiovascular Medicine,"Background The optimal revascularization approach for intermediate- and high-risk individuals with severe aortic stenosis (AS) and concomitant coronary artery disease (CAD) remains uncertain, particularly regarding the comparative short- and mid- to long-term outcomes of transcatheter aortic valve replacement with percutaneous coronary intervention (TAVR + PCI) vs. surgical aortic valve replacement with coronary artery bypass grafting (SAVR + CABG). Methods A systematic search of major databases was conducted up to March 2025 to identify studies comparing TAVR + PCI vs. SAVR + CABG in this population. Meta-analyses were performed using a random-effects model to estimate pooled odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Evidence quality was assessed using the GRADE framework. Results Thirteen studies comprising 53,869 patients were analyzed. Compared with SAVR + CABG, TAVR + PCI was associated with lower 30-day risks of stroke, myocardial infarction, and acute kidney injury, but higher permanent pacemaker implantation. No differences were found in all-cause mortality, major vascular complications, or major bleeding. In mid- to long-term follow-up (≥2 years), the TAVR + PCI group exhibited increased risks of all-cause mortality, myocardial infarction, and repeat revascularization, with similar stroke rates between strategies. Certainty of evidence ranged from very low to moderate. Conclusions In intermediate- and high-risk patients with severe AS and concomitant CAD, TAVR + PCI appears to confer short-term safety advantages but may be associated with less favorable mid- to long-term outcomes compared with SAVR + CABG. These findings support individualized revascularization strategies that balance early procedural safety against longer-term risks and highlight the need for further randomized trials with extended follow-up.

OpenAlex,aortic stenosis,Early outcomes of transcatheter aortic valve implantation using the hydra thv self-expanding valve in challenging anatomical scenarios: a three-case series,Thao Nguyen Phan; The Huy Nguyen; Duc Ngoc Ly; Cong Tien Nguyen,10.47972/vjcts.v54i.1642,2026-01-29,Tạp chí Phẫu thuật và Tim mạch và Lồng ngực Việt Nam,"Objective: To evaluate the feasibility, safety, and early outcomes of transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) using the Hydra THV self-expanding valve in challenging anatomical scenarios. Methods: This descriptive case series included three patients who underwent TAVI at the Cardiovascular Center, E Hospital. The cohort comprised one valve-in-valve procedure for a degenerated surgical bioprosthesis and two cases of native severe calcific aortic stenosis. All patients underwent comprehensive pre-procedural assessment, including clinical evaluation, electrocardiography, transthoracic echocardiography, and multidetector computed tomography according to a standard TAVI protocol. Hydra THV sizing was based on annular perimeter and the perimeter-derived diameter. Early outcomes were assessed using contemporary standardized TAVI endpoint definitions. Results: All three TAVI procedures were successfully performed via the transfemoral approach. There were no cases of in-hospital mortality, major vascular complications, stroke, or acute coronary obstruction. Following the intervention, transaortic valve gradients were markedly reduced, valve hemodynamics were favorable, and paravalvular regurgitation was no more than mild. The valve-in-valve case involving a small annulus was managed successfully without coronary-related complications. All patients experienced early clinical improvement. Conclusions: In this small case series, TAVI using the Hydra THV self-expanding valve demonstrated favorable early feasibility and safety, even in complex anatomical settings such as valve-in-valve procedures and patients with peripheral arterial disease. Larger studies with extended follow-up are needed to further evaluate long-term valve performance and durability."
OpenAlex,aortic stenosis,Assessment of left ventricular global longitudinal strain in patients with severe aortic valve stenosis before and after surgery using 2d speckle-tracking echocardiography,Dinh Hoan Nguyen; Trần Thúy Nguyên,10.47972/vjcts.v54i.1644,2026-01-29,Tạp chí Phẫu thuật và Tim mạch và Lồng ngực Việt Nam,"Objective: To evaluate changes in left ventricular global longitudinal strain (GLS) in patients with severe aortic valve stenosis before and after surgical aortic valve replacement using two-dimensional speckle-tracking echocardiography. Methods: A prospective, cross-sectional study conducted in patients with severe aortic valve stenosis undergoing surgery, with longitudinal follow-up at 1 month and 3 months postoperatively. The study was carried out at the Cardiovascular Center, E Hospital, from October 2024 to November 2025. Results: A total of 30 patients were included, with a mean age of 64.5 ± 6.0 years, and 56.7% were male. Preoperatively, the mean left ventricular ejection fraction (EF) was 55%, the mean GLS was −15.7 ± 4.8, and the mean transaortic pressure gradient was 54.7 ± 16.5 mmHg. Postoperatively, global longitudinal strain showed a trend toward improvement over the follow-up period at 1 week and 3 months, respectively. Postoperative GLS demonstrated a strong correlation with preoperative EF and left ventricular end-diastolic diameter. Conclusions: Left ventricular global longitudinal strain assessed by 2D speckle-tracking echocardiography is a useful parameter for evaluating left ventricular function in patients with severe aortic valve stenosis before and after surgical valve replacement and shows a strong correlation with conventional echocardiographic parameters."
OpenAlex,aortic stenosis,Sex differences in the prevalence and risk factors for aortic valve calcification in the general population,Athena Adeli; Professor Eva Swahn; Lars Lind; Stefan Söderberg; A Blomberg; Gunnar Engström; C J Östgren; Tomas Jernberg; Göran Bergström; Magnus Settergren; Anne Wang; Bahira Shahim,10.1136/heartjnl-2025-326468,2026-01-29,Heart,"Background Aortic valve calcification (AVC) is a disease process driven by inflammation and lipid infiltration, serving as a precursor to aortic stenosis. While male sex has been implicated as a risk factor for AVC, sex-specific differences, particularly among younger individuals in the general population, are not well characterised. Methods The Swedish CArdioPulmonary BioImage Study was used, comprising 30 154 individuals between 50 and 64 years, randomly selected from the general population. Study participants were part of a prospective cohort and underwent laboratory tests, clinical examinations, comprehensive questionnaires and cardiac CT. Cardiac CT was used for determining presence of AVC. Logistic regression analysis was performed to assess associations between traditional cardiovascular risk factors and AVC. Results In total, 29 160 participants were included and AVC was found in 1291 men (9%) and 730 women (5%). Male sex was an independent predictor of AVC (OR 1.91; 95% CI 1.71 to 2.13). Characteristics associated with AVC were similar between the sexes. In the adjusted analyses, lipoprotein(a), hyperlipidaemia, hypertension and smoking were strongly associated with AVC, whereas low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, diabetes, glycated haemoglobin and estimated glomerular filtration rate showed no significant associations with AVC. Higher body mass index (BMI) was associated with AVC in men but not women. Conclusions Male sex was independently associated with AVC, and the prevalence of AVC was nearly twice as high in men as in women. Traditional cardiovascular risk factors, including lipoprotein(a), hyperlipidaemia, hypertension and smoking, were associated with AVC, with similar associations between sexes, except for BMI, which was associated with AVC in men but not in women."
OpenAlex,aortic stenosis,High Risk Repeated Cardiac Surgery for Recurrent Subaortic Stenosis With a Favorable Outcome: A Case Report,Feras Zoreka; Abeer H Alkudsi; Abdulsater Allababidi; Lubana Shadoud,10.1097/cd9.0000000000000185,2026-01-29,Cardiology Discovery,"Abstract Subaortic stenosis is a form of left ventricular outflow tract obstruction, accounting for approximately 14% of cases. It occurs as an acquired lesion after repair of congenital heart disease and rarely following mitral valve repair or replacement. A 40-year-old female presented with dyspnea on minimal exertion, palpitations, and chronic hemolytic anemia. Her medical history included cardiac surgery at the age of 10 for closure of an atrial septal defect and mitral valve repair. Then, at the age of 28, she underwent another cardiac surgery to resect a subaortic stenosis, which recurred within one year. This recurrence led to a redo surgery involving mitral valve replacement with a 25-mm St. Jude prosthesis. Subsequent investigations demonstrated membranous subaortic stenosis with severe aortic valve insufficiency and partial de-insertion of the mitral valve with a small atrial septal defect. Management aimed to eliminate all systemic and structural factors contributing to increased flow in the left ventricular outflow tract, which are known to play an important role in the recurrence of subaortic stenosis. For this purpose, the patient underwent the fourth cardiac surgery involving aortic valve replacement, membrane resection, repair of the leak around the mitral valve, and atrial septal defect closure. She recovered within 2 months after surgery and resumed her job. During a 6-year follow-up period, she remained in good health with no evidence of cardiac dysfunction. Despite the considerable risks associated with repeated surgical interventions for recurrent subaortic stenosis, favorable long-term outcomes may outweigh these risks."
OpenAlex,aortic stenosis,Abstract WP125: Lipoprotein(a) and Echocardiographic Findings in Ischemic Stroke: Aortic Plaque as a Potential Signal,Solomon Oak; Gauri Patil; Connor Davy; Laura Stein; Steven Rudolph,10.1161/str.57.suppl_1.wp125,2026-01-29,Stroke,"Background: Lipoprotein(a) [Lp(a)] is a genetically determined, pro-atherogenic lipoprotein associated with ischemic stroke risk. While both Lp(a) and aortic arch plaque are established stroke risk factors, no studies have directly examined the relationship between Lp(a) levels and aortic arch plaque presence or characteristics in ischemic stroke patients. Aortic arch plaque is an established embolic source, but its relationship with Lp(a) levels in stroke patients has not been examined. Methods: We analyzed 188 consecutive ischemic stroke patients (2024–2025) from the Mount Sinai Health System Get With The Guidelines–Stroke registry with documented Lp(a) levels and echocardiographic evaluations. We abstracted patient demographics, including sex, age, race, and past medical history. Echocardiogram findings included ejection fraction (EF), aortic plaque, aortic stenosis, and left atrial enlargement. We additionally abstracted stroke subtype, as defined by TOAST classification. Based on previously established methods in Lp(a) research, patients were stratified by cohort-based Lp(a) tertiles (≤65, &gt;65–165, &gt;165 nmol/L). We compared echocardiographic findings and TOAST stroke subtypes across Lp(a) groups. Kruskal-Wallis and chi-square/Fisher’s tests were used for group comparisons. Results: Median age was 68.5 years (IQR 61–78), 45.7% were female, and median Lp(a) was 100 nmol/L (IQR 56–188). Race distribution significantly differed across Lp(a) tertiles ( p =0.008). Black patients comprised 39.7% of the lowest tertile, 70.5% of the middle tertile, and 66.1% of the highest tertile, despite representing 58.0% of the overall cohort. Eighteen (9.6%) patients had aortic arch plaque, which was more common in the highest Lp(a) tertile (17.5%) than in the middle (8.1%) or lowest (3.2%) ( p =0.02). Other echocardiographic findings and stroke subtype did not differ by Lp(a) tertile. Conclusions: In this cohort of ischemic stroke patients, higher Lp(a) was associated with the presence of aortic arch plaque on echocardiography. Although there was no difference in stroke subtype, aortic arch plaque may be an underrecognized source of stroke in patients with elevated Lp(a) and may provide further support for efforts to aggressively modify the atherosclerotic risk factor profile in these patients."
OpenAlex,aortic stenosis,Vessel‐Oriented Analysis on the Relationship Between Quantitative‐Flow Ratio and Mortality in Patients With Severe Aortic Stenosis and Intermediate Coronary Lesions,Iginio Colaiori; Luca Paolucci; Fabio Mangiacapra; Emanuele Barbato; Giulia Nardi; J A V I E R Escaned; Gianluca Campo; JUAN SANCHIS; Francesco Versaci; Giuseppe Biondi‐Zoccai; Achille Gaspardone; Marco Vitolo; Giorgio Benatti; Luigi Vignali; G Y H Lip; Vincenzo Guiducci,10.1002/ccd.70491,2026-01-29,Catheterization and Cardiovascular Interventions,"ABSTRACT Background Quantitative flow ratio (QFR) is effective in predicting mortality in patients undergoing transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR). How QFR reclassifies coronary artery disease (CAD) at vessel‐level compared to angiography and how this influences the risk of death, remains undetermined. Methods We calculated QFR from consecutive 280 TAVR patients with bystander coronary stenoses. All lesions were managed conservatively. Angiographic CAD was defined by a diameter stenosis ≥ 50%, functional CAD by a QFR ≤ 0.80. The outcome was mortality at 3 years. Results Overall, 635 lesions were included. Angiographic CAD was evident in 165 (26.0%), functional CAD in 17 (11.2%) (reclassification: p &lt; 0.001). Angiography/QFR mismatch occurred in 22.5%, mostly in large vessels and lesions located in the proximal left anterior descending (LAD). QFR ≤ 0.80 was an independent predictor of death (HR 2.91, 95% CI 1.94−4.36; p &lt; 0.001). The risk was progressively increased for lower QFR values and positive QFR at LAD site (vs. QFR &gt; 0.80 HR: 3.92, 95% CI 2.78−5.53; p &lt; 0.001; vs. QFR ≤ 0.80 at non‐LAD site: HR 2.65, 95% CI 1.07−6.59; p = 0.034). Conclusions QFR leads to a significant reclassification of CAD rates at vessel‐level and shows a significant prognostic value in patients undergoing TAVR."

Schreyer,10.1093/ehjcr/ytag075,2026-01-29,European Heart Journal - Case Reports,"Abstract Background Caseous calcification of the mitral annulus (CCMA), also referred to as “toothpaste tumour”, is a rare variant of calcification of the mitral annulus (MAC). The prognosis and pathogenesis of CCMA remain obscure. Overall CCMA is benign and usually asymptomatic, but can manifest with abscess formation, embolic events such as stroke or significant mitral valve dysfunction. Case Summary We report two cases of CCMA in elderly female patients. Patient 1 presented with dyspnoea and was diagnosed with CCMA and aortic valve stenosis. When her symptoms worsened over time, severe coronary artery disease was diagnosed in addition. Multimodality imaging, using transoesophageal echocardiography (TEE), cardiac computed tomography (CT) and cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (CMRI) confirmed CCMA that remained stable over the lifetime of the patient. Due to high surgical risks, a conservative management was chosen. Six years later, the patient died from decompensated aortic stenosis with cardiogenic shock. Patient 2 initially presented with chest pain. Three-vessel coronary artery disease was diagnosed and treated with stent implantation by staged percutaneous coronary intervention. Subsequent imaging (TEE, cardio-CT) revealed CCMA. Annual echocardiographic examination showed stable dimensions of the CCMA lesion over six years of follow-up. Discussion Early recognition of CCMA is crucial because it may lead to serious complications. Although spontaneous resolution has been reported, CCMA remained stable over several years in both of our cases. Both patients were elderly women with arterial hypertension and chronic renal failure, supporting the hypothesis of an atheroma-like pathogenesis."
OpenAlex,aortic stenosis,Case Report: Newly discovered ELN gene mutation in congenital heart disease: case analysis and review,peiwen Cheng; Guozhen Wang; Jialin Qiu; Xia Xie; Y F An,10.3389/fped.2026.1671066,2026-01-29,Frontiers in Pediatrics,"Introduction Supravalvular aortic stenosis (SVAS) is a rare left ventricular outflow tract obstruction, most commonly caused by pathogenic variants in ELN. Truncating variants in exons 1–29 typically produce non-syndromic SVAS through elastin haploinsufficiency, whereas C-terminal variants are linked to autosomal dominant cutis laxa. However, clinically and mechanistically well-characterized variants in the distal part of this “stenotic zone,” such as exon 28, remain uncommon. Methods We conducted a retrospective family-based case report with standardized clinical evaluation, serial echocardiography, and trio whole-exome sequencing with Sanger confirmation and conservation analysis. Results A female infant presented at 1 month with severe sinotubular junction narrowing (Z-score −4.8, peak gradient 24 mmHg), severe peripheral pulmonary artery stenosis, a small atrial septal defect, and moderate mitral regurgitation. Her father had severe SVAS with mild PPAS and prior aortic root enlargement, without syndromic features. Trio sequencing identified a novel heterozygous ELN exon 28 frameshift variant, c.1879_1883dup (p.Ala629LeufsTer15), inherited from the father. Ala629 is fully conserved, and the duplication introduces a premature stop codon, consistent with nonsense-mediated decay and elastin haploinsufficiency. At 9 months, SVAS progressed (peak gradient 35 mmHg), while PPAS gradients regressed by &amp;gt;40%. Conclusion This novel exon 28 ELN frameshift expands the non-syndromic SVAS spectrum and illustrates a characteristic pattern of progressive aortic stenosis with improving PPAS, supporting ELN testing and targeted longitudinal surveillance in similar patients and families."
OpenAlex,aortic stenosis,Evidence-based guidelines for aortic stenosis: Focus on surgical aortic valve replacement versus transcatheter aortic valve implantation for young patients,Jorge Alcocer; Eduard Quintana; María Dolores Cepero Ascaso; Ricard Pruna,10.1177/02184923251415153,2026-01-29,Asian Cardiovascular and Thoracic Annals,"Transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) has revolutionized the management of aortic stenosis and is now an established alternative to surgical aortic valve replacement (SAVR) for all surgical risk categories. However, the extension of TAVI to younger, low-risk patients has raised important questions regarding the long-term outcomes, valve durability, and lifetime management strategies for these patients. This narrative review summarizes the current evidence from pivotal randomized trials and contemporary registries comparing TAVI and SAVR in young, low-risk patients, integrating the latest 2025 ESC/EACTS guidelines. While short-term outcomes and early recovery favor TAVI, SAVR remains associated with proven durability, lower rates of conduction disturbances, and a potential advantage in long-term outcomes as follow-up data extend beyond five years. Anatomical challenges such as bicuspid valves, coronary access, and patient–prosthesis mismatch further complicate the use of TAVI in this population. A “SAVR-first” lifetime management approach appears to provide greater procedural flexibility and a lower reintervention risk. Ultimately, the choice between TAVI and SAVR in young patients should be individualized through a multidisciplinary Heart Team process, balancing early procedural benefits with long-term durability and reintervention considerations. This review highlights the need for dedicated long-term data and patient-tailored strategies in the evolving management of aortic stenosis in young low-risk individuals."
OpenAlex,aortic stenosis,Successful valve-in-valve transcatheter aortic valve implantation using a hydra transcatheter aortic valve in a patient with severe degeneration of a surgical bioprosthesis: a case report,Thao Nguyen Phan; The Huy Nguyen; Le Anh Do; Cong Tien Nguyen,10.47972/vjcts.v54i.1634,2026-01-29,Tạp chí Phẫu thuật và Tim mạch và Lồng ngực Việt Nam,"Bioprosthetic aortic valve degeneration is increasingly encountered and poses significant management challenges, particularly in elderly patients at high surgical risk [1]. Valve-in-valve transcatheter aortic valve implantation (ViV-TAVI) has emerged as an effective alternative to redo surgery in this complex population [1–3]. At the Cardiovascular centre, E Hospital, we report a case of 71-year-old man presenting with severe stenosis of a 21mm surgical bioprosthesis implanted 11 years earlier. Given the prohibitive risk of redo surgery [3], the Heart Team performed ViV-TAVI using a Hydra THV 22mm self-expanding transcatheter heart valve. The procedure was uneventful. At 15 days follow-up, transthoracic echocardiography demonstrated excellent hemodynamics performance with a peak transvalvular gradient of 9 mmHg and a mean gradient of 4 mmHg and the patient had returned to New York Heart Association (NYHA) functional class I. This case highlights the feasibility and favorable early outcomes of Hydra THV in ViV-TAVI for small surgical bioprostheses, a subgroup frequently associated with high residual gradients and patient–prosthesis mismatch [5–7]. This report aims to describe a Valve-in-Valve TAVI procedure in a small bioprosthetic valve, emphasize the role of multimodality imaging, evaluate post-procedural hemodynamic outcomes, and discuss potential complications and preventive strategies, with particular focus on coronary obstruction and patient–prosthesis mismatch."
OpenAlex,aortic stenosis,Abstract DP311: One-Stop Head-Neck-Aortic Vessel Wall MRI: A New Imaging Approach for Assessing Supracardiac Atherosclerosis in Stroke,Qianmei Jiang; Jing Jing; Zhe Zhang; Yongjun Wang,10.1161/str.57.suppl_1.dp311,2026-01-29,Stroke,"Background: Supracardiac atherosclerosis—including carotid, vertebrobasilar, intracranial, and aortic arch arteries—is a major cause of stroke. While vessel wall MRI (vwMRI) can assess plaques, current techniques lack full head-neck-aortic coverage and efficiency. Purpose: To develop and validate a rapid, comprehensive head-neck-aortic vwMRI approach for assessing supracardiac atherosclerosis, comparing it with supra-aortic CTA and evaluating its value in identifying causes of embolic stroke of undetermined source (ESUS). Materials and Methods: A new non-contrast 3D head-neck-aortic vwMRI approach was developed for assessing supracardiac vasculature in ischemic stroke patients. It integrates a multi-coil hardware system with 3D black- and gray-blood vwMRI, accelerated by a novel neural network-based technique, achieving about 15-minute total scan time(Figure 1). Plaque vulnerabilities, stenosis, and stroke etiologies were compared between vwMRI and supra-aortic CTA. Results: From October 2024 to March 2025, 108 patients (mean age, 56 ± 14 years; 89 male) with ischemic stroke or transient ischemic attack underwent both vwMRI and supra-aortic CTA. vwMRI detected 301 plaques in 88 patients, versus 246 plaques in 75 patients by CTA (κ=0.583, p&lt;0.001). For plaque vulnerabilities, black- and gray-blood vwMRI achieved 91% accuracy for calcification using CTA as reference (Figure 2). vwMRI identified intraplaque hemorrhage and ulceration in 27.8% and 25.9% of cases, respectively, while CTA identified ulceration in 23.1% and had limited sensitivity for hemorrhage. For ≥50% vascular stenosis, CTA found 49 patients (25 occlusions), and vwMRI found 47 (24 occlusions), with identified causes including atherosclerosis (n=41), thrombus (n=3), and dissection (n=3). For stroke etiologies, of the 38 initially classified as ESUS by conventional evaluation including CTA, vwMRI reclassified 16 (14 with culprit plaques, 2 dissections), reducing the ESUS proportion from 35.2% (38/108) to 20.4% (22/108) (Figure 3). Conclusion: This one-stop, 15-minute head-neck-aortic vwMRI approach offers comprehensive and detailed evaluation of supracardiac atherosclerosis, improving stroke etiological classification—especially in ESUS patients—compared to CTA."
