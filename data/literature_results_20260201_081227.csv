In this scoping review, we critically appraised the literature on IgG4-related CAI, aiming to explore clinical, radiological and histopathological characteristics as well as treatment strategies and prognosis.
A comprehensive search was performed on January 02, 2025 in PubMed® to identify studies describing individuals with IgG4-related CAI, including both coronaritis (true arteritis of the coronary vessel wall) and periarteritis (peri-coronary involvement), and considering case reports, case series, retrospective cohort studies and observational studies. Two reviewers independently conducted the revision of literature under the guidance of the methodologist to identify eligible studies. Data extraction included clinical presentation, imaging findings, histopathology, treatment, and outcomes. Given the heterogeneity of the studies, descriptive statistical analysis was used whenever possible to summarise the data.
Out of 964 screened references, 143 articles met the above-mentioned inclusion criteria. Most CAI cases were included in case reports (90.2 %), 7 % in case series and 2.8 % in retrospective cohort studies or observational studies. CAI predominantly affected males in the sixth decade of life and frequently coexisted with aortic and large vessel involvement. All segments of the coronary arterial tree could be involved, even the smallest branches. Images detected by various methods revealed several types of lesions: stenosis, wall-thickening, aneurysm, ectasia, pseudotumor, pseudoaneurysm, dissection, and soft tissue masses. Increase serum IgG4 levels and increased inflammatory markers were reported. Histopathology was consistent with IgG4-RD in all coronary samples obtained. Glucocorticoid therapy, alone or combined with immunosuppressants and/or surgical interventions, was the most commonly reported treatment. Rituximab seemed to be an effective therapy for IgG4-related CAI even without associated glucocorticoids. Despite treatment, relapse and progression of coronary lesions were noted in some cases.
Early identification and multidisciplinary management og IgG4-related CAI are crucial to reduce morbidity and mortality. Available data on the response to various treatments are limited, as dedicated coronary artery imaging was not consistently obtained soon enough after treatment to assess response. In addition, long-term follow-up was not available for all patients. Further studies are required to understand the real prevalence, natural history, optimal diagnostic strategies, and therapeutic approaches for this serious condition."
PubMed,aortic stenosis,Early outcomes of the Myval Octacor transcatheter heart valve in transcatheter aortic valve implantation: a single-center study from Serbia.,Valentina Balint; Mihajlo Farkic; Jovan Petrovic; Matija Furtula; Milos D Babic; Dragan Topic; Ida Subotic; Vladimir Zobenica; Alfonso Ielasi; Luca Testa; Milovan Bojic; Aleksandra Nikolic,10.25270/jic/25.00264,2026-01-30,The Journal of invasive cardiology,"Aortic stenosis (AS) is the most common valvular heart disease, with transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) now preferred for select severe cases. This study evaluated the early safety and performance of the new Myval Octacor Transcatheter Heart Valve (THV) (Meril Life Sciences), for which limited clinical data exist.
The authors retrospectively analyzed 43 consecutive patients with severe AS who underwent TAVI using the Myval Octacor THV at a tertiary cardiac center. Primary outcomes included all-cause mortality, stroke, major vascular complications, conduction abnormalities, new pacemaker implantation, paravalvular leak, and valve failure at 30 days follow-up.
The median age was 81 years (IQR: 7), and 22 patients (51.2%) were female. Coronary artery disease was present in 24 (55.8%). Technical success rate was 100%. Mean pressure gradient decreased significantly post-procedure (55 mm Hg [IQR: 24] vs 5 mm Hg [IQR: 2]; P ≤ .001). No in-hospital deaths occurred. Two patients (4.7%) received permanent pacemakers during hospitalization, and 3 (7.0%) required pacemakers within a week because of conduction issues. Two patients (4.7%) experienced Bleeding Academic Research Consortium Type 3a bleeding. At 30 days, 42 patients remained in follow-up (98%), with 55% improved to New York Heart Association Class I. No vascular complications, stroke, acute kidney injury, valve thrombosis, or endocarditis occurred. One patient had valve failure from a significant paravalvular leak and 1 noncardiac death occurred 2 weeks post-discharge.
Early outcomes suggest that the Myval Octacor THV is a safe and effective option for TAVI in severe AS; however, larger studies with longer follow-up are required."
PubMed,aortic stenosis,"Accuracy of fetal echocardiography in detecting lesions associated with, and predicting surgical plan for, dextro-transposition of the great arteries and double outlet right ventricle with subpulmonary ventricular septal defect and predicted transposition physiology.",H Chandrasekar; M Kaplinski; S A Maskatia; M J Beattie; D Y Ho; C D Reddy; R Punn,10.1002/uog.70169,2026-01-30,Ultrasound in obstetrics & gynecology : the official journal of the International Society of Ultrasound in Obstetrics and Gynecology,"In dextro-transposition of the great arteries (D-TGA) and double outlet right ventricle with subpulmonary ventricular septal defect (DORV-SPV) and predicted transposition physiology, the presence of associated lesions, such as ventricular septal defect (VSD), coarctation of the aorta (CoA) or pulmonary stenosis (PS), impacts prenatal counseling and complicates neonatal surgery. This study aimed to evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of fetal echocardiography (FE) and its ability to predict the postnatal surgical plan in fetuses with D-TGA or DORV-SPV.
This was a single-center retrospective cohort study of fetuses with D-TGA or DORV-SPV who were liveborn, had a recorded plan for postnatal intervention and were managed at Lucile Packard Children's Hospital, Palo Alto, CA, USA, between January 2013 and January 2024. In cases with serial FE examinations, all available FE reports were included in the analysis, in addition to the first postnatal echocardiogram report. For echocardiograms with incomplete measurement data, a single reader retrospectively obtained FE and postnatal echocardiogram measurements while blinded to clinical outcomes. Prenatal predictions for postnatal surgical repair were extracted from the fetal cardiology consultation notes and postnatal clinical data were obtained by chart review. Final FE and postnatal echocardiogram diagnoses, as well as prenatal surgical-plan predictions and subsequent postnatal surgical repairs performed, were compared and the percentage concordance was calculated to obtain FE diagnostic accuracy. Receiver-operating-characteristics (ROC) curves were generated to evaluate the association of FE aortic and pulmonary measurements with postnatal CoA repair.
The study included 99 fetuses, of which 45 were diagnosed postnatally with simple D-TGA with no associated lesions (i.e. D-TGA with intact ventricular septum), 38 with complex D-TGA with associated lesions and 15 with DORV, and one neonate was diagnosed prenatally with DORV-SPV but postnatally diagnosed with truncus arteriosus. In the majority (65%) of patients, serial FE was performed. The percentage concordance between fetal and postnatal echocardiogram diagnoses was high for simple D-TGA (95% (42/44)) and D-TGA with VSD and PS (100% (3/3)). The concordance was progressively lower for diagnoses of D-TGA with VSD (93% (25/27)), DORV-SPV (60% (3/5)), DORV-SPV with CoA (40% (4/10)), D-TGA with VSD and CoA (29% (2/7)), D-TGA with isolated CoA (0% (0/2)) and DORV-SPV with PS (0% (0/1)). Similarly, surgical-plan accuracy between prenatal prediction and postnatal repair performed was highest for cases of simple D-TGA and D-TGA with VSD and PS, while it was lower for other diagnoses. Qualitative descriptions of VSD size changed frequently over serial FE examinations, with VSDs generally described as larger on later FE. However, between the final FE and postnatal echocardiogram, in those with discordance, the description of VSD size usually became smaller. Only 50% of small VSDs identified on postnatal echocardiography required repair. All patients who underwent postnatal repair of CoA had a VSD present. All area under the ROC curve values for aortic measurements and for ratios of aortic-to-pulmonary dimensions in predicting the need for postnatal CoA repair were greater than 0.9.
Challenges remain in the accurate diagnosis and prediction of the postnatal surgical plan in fetuses with complex D-TGA and DORV-SPV. The assessment of qualitative VSD size description changed frequently over serial FE evaluations, and between final FE and postnatal echocardiogram, with small defects often not requiring repair. Aortic and aortic-to-pulmonary ratio measurements in fetuses with D-TGA or DORV-SPV appear to have improved the discriminatory ability in identifying cases that undergo postnatal CoA repair relative to fetuses with isolated CoA. © 2026 International Society of Ultrasound in Obstetrics and Gynecology."

FoCUS can be applied in stroke assessments performed by stroke neurologists when a cardioembolic stroke is suspected.
An international multicenter, prospective validation study was conducted to assess neurologists' ability to perform FoCUS. The FoCUS examination was defined as a simplified 2D transthoracic echocardiography. Neurologists and cardiologists performed the FoCUS independently and blinded. A twenty-question test evaluated neurologists' ability to recognize sources of cardioembolic stroke from recorded FoCUS studies.
A total of 432 paired studies involving 216 patients were conducted across 11 centers. No significant differences were found between neurologists and cardiologists in detecting: Left Ventricle (LV) dysfunction (7.4% vs 7.9%, p = 0.834), LV dilation (2.8% vs 2.3%, p = 0.766), VC collapsibility (7.2% vs 9.1%, p = 0.501), Right Ventricle dysfunction (0.9% vs 0.9%, p = 0.999), and pericardial effusion (0.5% vs 1.9%, p = 0.212). Cohen Kappa showed substantial agreement for LV dysfunction (0.640), moderate for LV dilation (0.589), and fair for VC collapsibility (0.226). Neurologists demonstrated 93.82% sensitivity and 92.92% specificity for detecting embolic sources. Success rate for LV akinesia was 88% (16/18), LV dysfunction 83% (15/18), complex aortic plaque 88% (16/18), and mitral stenosis 55% (10/18).
Properly trained neurologists can reliably perform FoCUS, particularly for assessing LV function and dilation, with better results in patients with favorable echocardiographic windows. While VC assessment requires further training, neurologists demonstrated high accuracy in identifying cardioembolic sources (over 90% of cases correctly identified). This study supports implementing standardized FoCUS training for neurologists through collaboration with cardiology specialists to enhance stroke diagnostics and management."

The prognostic relevance of AI-enabled electrocardiography-derived diastolic dysfunction (DD) in patients undergoing transcatheter aortic valve replacement had not been assessed.
We analyzed 3197 patients undergoing transcatheter aortic valve replacement for severe aortic stenosis between 2010 and 2023 with baseline 12-lead ECGs processed by a validated AI model to classify diastolic function (grades 0-3). Multivariable Cox models and nested model comparisons assessed associations with all-cause mortality, including a prespecified analysis in patients with indeterminate echocardiographic grading. Trajectories were defined by change in AI-enabled electrocardiography DD grade (<2 versus ≥2) from baseline to 30-day or 1-year follow-up.
At baseline, 21% had grade 3, 57% had grade 2, 8% had grade 1, and 14% had grade 0 AI-enabled electrocardiography DD. Higher grades were associated with adverse cardiac remodeling and comorbidities. Over a median follow-up of 3.4 years, grade 3 AI-enabled electrocardiography DD independently predicted mortality (hazard ratio [HR], 1.80 [95% CI, 1.47-2.20]; P<0.001). AI-enabled electrocardiography DD improved prognostic discrimination beyond clinical and echocardiographic measures (ΔHarrell concordance statistic, 0.016; Δχ2=57; P<0.001). Among 1259 patients with indeterminate echocardiographic grading, AI-enabled electrocardiography added prognostic value (ΔHarrell concordance statistic, 0.02; Δχ2=13; P=0.006). Worsening or persistently high-risk trajectories were associated with increased mortality (HRs, 1.45-1.80; all P<0.05).
AI-enabled electrocardiography-derived DD independently predicts mortality after transcatheter aortic valve replacement, adds value beyond echocardiographic grading, and enables dynamic risk stratification through longitudinal tracking."
PubMed,aortic stenosis,Patient-Specific Computational Flow Simulation Reveals Adverse Hemodynamic Factors Associated With Occlusion of Directional Branches After Fenestrated-Branched Endovascular Aneurysm Repair.,Kenneth Tran; Jesse Chait; Emmanuel Tenorio; Weiguang Yang; Alison Marsden; Bernardo Mendes; Jason T Lee; Gustavo S Oderich,10.1161/JAHA.125.044790,2026-01-30,Journal of the American Heart Association,"Fenestrated and branched endovascular aneurysm repair can be complicated by branch vessel occlusion in the absence of structural stenosis. We hypothesized that computational flow simulation could identify adverse hemodynamic features associated with postfenestrated and branched endovascular aneurysm repair branch occlusion.
Patients undergoing 4-vessel fenestrated and branched endovascular aneurysm repair for Extent II to IV thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysms were retrospectively reviewed. Branches that occluded without identifiable kinking or stenosis on computed tomography were included, along with an equal cohort of anatomy-matched patent controls. Patient-specific pulsatile rigid-wall simulations were performed using SimVascular with individualized geometries and boundary conditions. Abnormal time-averaged wall shear stress (TAWSS) was defined as <10 or >70 dynes/cm2.
Nine patients (36 target vessels) experienced 10 branch occlusions. Postoperative pressure and flow did not differ significantly between occluded and patent renal or mesenteric branches. However, occluded renal and mesenteric branches demonstrated significantly larger postoperative areas of abnormal TAWSS compared with controls (renal: 14.5% versus 5.9%, P=0.003; mesenteric: 17.7% versus 9.9%, P=0.035). Logistic generalized estimating equation modeling showed abnormal TAWSS to be a significant predictor of renal branch occlusion (P=0.0085). Model estimates suggested occlusion probabilities of 1.1%, 31%, and 94% at 0%, 10%, and 20% abnormal TAWSS surface area, respectively. A cluster-bootstrapped receiver operating characteristic curve (area under the curve, 0.876) identified a >10.2% threshold that correctly classified 92% of renal occlusions. Abnormal TAWSS frequently localized to distal stent-artery interfaces.
Elevated abnormal TAWSS within stented renal branches is associated with subsequent branch occlusion after fenestrated and branched endovascular aneurysm repair. Computational flow simulation-derived TAWSS thresholds may help identify high-risk branches before failure, warranting prospective validation."

How QFR reclassifies coronary artery disease (CAD) at vessel-level compared to angiography and how this influences the risk of death, remains undetermined.
We calculated QFR from consecutive 280 TAVR patients with bystander coronary stenoses. All lesions were managed conservatively. Angiographic CAD was defined by a diameter stenosis ≥ 50%, functional CAD by a QFR ≤ 0.80. The outcome was mortality at 3 years.
Overall, 635 lesions were included. Angiographic CAD was evident in 165 (26.0%), functional CAD in 17 (11.2%) (reclassification: p < 0.001). Angiography/QFR mismatch occurred in 22.5%, mostly in large vessels and lesions located in the proximal left anterior descending (LAD). QFR ≤ 0.80 was an independent predictor of death (HR 2.91, 95% CI 1.94-4.36; p < 0.001). The risk was progressively increased for lower QFR values and positive QFR at LAD site (vs. QFR > 0.80 HR: 3.92, 95% CI 2.78-5.53; p < 0.001; vs. QFR ≤ 0.80 at non-LAD site: HR 2.65, 95% CI 1.07-6.59; p = 0.034).
QFR leads to a significant reclassification of CAD rates at vessel-level and shows a significant prognostic value in patients undergoing TAVR."

While male sex has been implicated as a risk factor for AVC, sex-specific differences, particularly among younger individuals in the general population, are not well characterised.
The Swedish CArdioPulmonary BioImage Study was used, comprising 30 154 individuals between 50 and 64 years, randomly selected from the general population. Study participants were part of a prospective cohort and underwent laboratory tests, clinical examinations, comprehensive questionnaires and cardiac CT. Cardiac CT was used for determining presence of AVC. Logistic regression analysis was performed to assess associations between traditional cardiovascular risk factors and AVC.
In total, 29 160 participants were included and AVC was found in 1291 men (9%) and 730 women (5%). Male sex was an independent predictor of AVC (OR 1.91; 95% CI 1.71 to 2.13). Characteristics associated with AVC were similar between the sexes. In the adjusted analyses, lipoprotein(a), hyperlipidaemia, hypertension and smoking were strongly associated with AVC, whereas low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, diabetes, glycated haemoglobin and estimated glomerular filtration rate showed no significant associations with AVC. Higher body mass index (BMI) was associated with AVC in men but not women.
Male sex was independently associated with AVC, and the prevalence of AVC was nearly twice as high in men as in women. Traditional cardiovascular risk factors, including lipoprotein(a), hyperlipidaemia, hypertension and smoking, were associated with AVC, with similar associations between sexes, except for BMI, which was associated with AVC in men but not in women."

This study evaluates long-term, real-world outcomes according to MDT-selected management strategy within routine clinical practice in this clinically important patient group.
We conducted a retrospective cohort study of all patients with severe AS discussed at a transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) MDT at a tertiary UK centre between January 2014 and December 2016. Patients were categorised as TAVI or non-TAVI (conservatively managed). Demographic, clinical and frailty data were collected, including Charlson Comorbidity Index, Clinical Frailty Scale (CFS) and number of prescribed medications. Survival was analysed using Kaplan-Meier estimates and Cox proportional hazards modelling adjusted for age, sex, frailty, comorbidity burden and medication count.
A total of 373 patients were included (TAVI=178; non-TAVI=195). Patients undergoing TAVI were younger (81.3 years vs 83.5 years; p=0.01) and less frail (CFS 3.9 vs 4.9; p<0.01). Survival at 1 year, 2 years and 5 years was significantly higher following TAVI (87.6%, 74.7%, 44.9%) compared with conservative management (60.8%, 44.2%, 12.1%; p<0.001). Median survival was 53 months after TAVI versus 20 months without intervention. On multivariable analysis, TAVI was independently associated with reduced mortality (HR 0.38, 95% CI 0.28 to 0.50; p<0.001).
In patients with severe AS discussed at MDT, TAVI was associated with a substantial and durable survival advantage compared with conservative management. These findings highlight the poor prognosis of untreated severe AS and support systematic inclusion of conservatively managed patients in interventional registries to better inform MDT deliberation and shared decision-making."

The primary outcome was to assess the clinical benefit of blood pressure control, and the secondary outcome was to assess renal growth.
Patients under 21 years of age with renovascular hypertension who underwent angioplasty and CBA were reviewed. Thirty patients (70% male; median age 7.5 years [IQR: 5.7 - 12.5]) underwent 35 treatment episodes. 57% had fibromuscular dysplasia (FMD), 23% had FMD + mid aortic syndrome (MAS), and 20% had neurofibromatosis type-1 ± MAS. Clinical and follow-up data were reviewed. Renal artery sizing was calculated from the diameter of the normal portion of the involved artery or the contralateral normal renal artery. In patients with persistent stenosis despite optimal sized balloon angioplasty, CBA was performed.
In total, 37 stenoses were targeted, 6 had prior balloon angioplasty in a separate treatment. Technical success (traversal of stenosis) rate was 89% (33/37). Angioplasty improvement (>30% stenosis improvement) rate was 94% (31/33). No significant relationship between technical failure, angiographic failure and stenosis location/length or syndrome. The AE rate was 16% (6/37), with two moderate (segmental and subsegmental thrombus) and two severe (pseudoaneurysm and arterial perforation). Clinical benefit rate at median follow-up of 59 months (IQR: 37 - 95) was 83% (25/30).
CBA offers a promising alternative for the management of resistant RAS, is technically feasible, and demonstrates clinical benefit. However, the observed AEs underscore the need for careful patient selection."

However, the extension of TAVI to younger, low-risk patients has raised important questions regarding the long-term outcomes, valve durability, and lifetime management strategies for these patients. This narrative review summarizes the current evidence from pivotal randomized trials and contemporary registries comparing TAVI and SAVR in young, low-risk patients, integrating the latest 2025 ESC/EACTS guidelines. While short-term outcomes and early recovery favor TAVI, SAVR remains associated with proven durability, lower rates of conduction disturbances, and a potential advantage in long-term outcomes as follow-up data extend beyond five years. Anatomical challenges such as bicuspid valves, coronary access, and patient-prosthesis mismatch further complicate the use of TAVI in this population. A ""SAVR-first"" lifetime management approach appears to provide greater procedural flexibility and a lower reintervention risk. Ultimately, the choice between TAVI and SAVR in young patients should be individualized through a multidisciplinary Heart Team process, balancing early procedural benefits with long-term durability and reintervention considerations. This review highlights the need for dedicated long-term data and patient-tailored strategies in the evolving management of aortic stenosis in young low-risk individuals."

We herein report the case of a 41-year-old woman with prosthetic valve dysfunction and severe LVOT obstruction due to pannus formation in whom a 12-mm sizer could not be passed. Redo aortic valve replacement with the combined Konno-Nicks procedure successfully enlarged the annulus and LVOT, enabling the implantation of a 4-size larger prosthesis based on intraoperative sizer measurements. Postoperative echocardiography and computed tomography confirmed effective valve enlargement and preserved valve function.
Combined anterior-posterior enlargement can be valuable for redo aortic valve replacement in patients with a small annulus and subvalvular stenosis to prevent prosthesis-patient mismatch.
The combined Konno-Nicks procedure can effectively relieve prosthetic valve dysfunction with severe subvalvular stenosis by enabling larger prosthesis implantation."

It is the main basis of decision making for the patient. Transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) has been established as the standard treatment option for symptomatic aortic stenosis-patients. Current guidelines recommend transfemoral TAVI for patients aged 70 years or older, independently of the surgical risk and for patients below 70 years of age if they are at high surgical risk.
To evaluate beneficial aspects of an explanatory video in addition to conventional medical counseling.
The study was conducted as a prospective, single-arm, monocentric cohort study. Eligible patients received conventional medical counseling, followed by an educational video. Evaluation of the conventional counseling and the educational video was obtained through a 32-item questionnaire. Two hypotheses were tested: Hypothesis 1: Showing an explanatory video in addition to the standard patient consent discussion improves the mediation of medical facts; and hypothesis 2: Showing an explanatory video in addition to the standard patient consent discussion improves patient satisfaction and confidence.
In total, 66 patients, scheduled for transfemoral TAVI were included, 59% of them were male and 41% female, averaging 81 ± 6.1 years old. Conventional medical counseling by the attending physician was the major criterium for overall patient satisfaction and had more influence on the absence of preprocedural tension than the transfer of additional factual knowledge through the video. Nearly two-thirds (61%) reported that the video enhanced their understanding of the procedure's benefits, while 42% indicated a better understanding of the potential risks and 56% felt that watching the video contributed to decreased preprocedural tension.
Conventional medical counseling was most important for overall patient satisfaction. Educational videos aid in information transfer, in the reduction of preprocedural tension and were strongly sought after by the patients."

Since an elevated pressure gradient in the left ventricular outflow tract (LVOT) is a distinguishing feature of DSS, it is hypothesized that the membrane formation is caused by elevated wall shear stress applied to the endocardial endothelial cells (EECs) that line the LVOT, triggering fibrosis. To correlate shear stress to an EEC fibrotic phenotype, we applied fluid shear stress to EECs at physiological and pathological shear rates using a cone-and-plate device, designed to recapitulate physiological wall shear stress in a controlled in vitro environment. Controlled shear stress regimes were applied to EECs to replicate the conditions observed in DSS patients. We found that elevated shear stress triggered EEC alignment as well as endothelial-to-mesenchymal transformation (EndMT) signaling pathways driven by upregulation of SNAI1 gene expression. The EECs were then treated with a small molecule inhibitor of Snail1 protein, CYD19, to attempt to attenuate EndMT signaling, and subsequently subjected to pathological shear stress. The Snail1 inhibitor did downregulate selected markers of EndMT signaling, although only transiently. Interestingly, the application of shear stress had a greater effect on the EEC gene and protein expression than did the Snail1 inhibition. This investigation of EEC response to shear stress reveals the pronounced and complex effect of this mechanical stimulation on the EEC phenotype. Further study should reveal the mechanisms that drive fibrosis and the formation of the DSS membrane."

With a focus on the prevalent psychological complications following the onset of this condition, this study aimed to explore the correlation between antenatal depression and Corona disease anxiety, personality traits, and postpartum depression during the COVID-19 pandemic.                                                           Materials and Methods:                     This cross-sectional descriptive-analytical study investigated women receiving care at health centers affiliated with Kerman University of Medical Sciences during the last month of their pregnancy and the postpartum period in 2022. Following the acquisition of informed consent, participants were assessed using various measures, including demographic and obstetric information, the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale, the Corona Disease Anxiety Scale (CDAS), and the NEO Personality Inventory-Revised during their third trimester of pregnancy. The same group of participants completed the Edinburgh Depression Scale and the Corona Disease Anxiety Scale (CDAS) 4-6 weeks after childbirth.                                                           Results and Discussion:                     There was a significant correlation between family income, unwanted pregnancy as perceived by both the mother and father, and antenatal depression. Additionally, marital satisfaction played a significant role in postpartum depression. Furthermore, antenatal depression was significantly associated with neuroticism, agreeableness, and physical symptoms related to Corona disease anxiety. Personality traits, with the exception of extroversion and conscientiousness, and various domains of Corona disease anxiety, excluding psychological symptoms, were also significantly associated with postpartum depression.                                                           Conclusion:                     During pandemics or epidemics, such as the COVID-19 outbreak, experiencing mental distress during pregnancy can contribute to mental health issues during the postpartum period. This risk is particularly true in individuals with unique personality traits, emphasizing the need for increased focus on mental health within prenatal care during these crises."
Crossref,valvular heart disease,The Severity of Disease and Hospital Length of Stay for the First and Second Admission of COVID-19 Patients: An Observational Study from Southeastern Iran,Milad Ahmadi Gohari; Mohammad Hossein Mehrolhassani; Shoboo Rahmati; Elham Sharifpoor; Hossein Mirzaei; Yunes Jahani,10.2174/0126667975341163241129050027,2026-10,Coronaviruses,"Background:                     This study aimed to investigate the severity of disease and length of hospital stay for COVID-19 patients admitted to a hospital in southeastern Iran.                                                           Method:                     This cross-sectional study was conducted in Kerman, Iran. Data were collected from patients who visited Afzalipour Hospital in Kerman more than twice during the COVID-19 epidemic from the end of February 2020 to March 21, 2021. We conducted two key analyses: 1. Mixed effect logistic regression was used to check the relationship between the variables and COVID-19 severity. 2. Mixed effect linear regression was used to check the relationship between the variables and the length of stay in the hospital.                                                           Results:                     The findings indicated that the most important risk factors for the severity of COVID-19 were heart diseases (OR=1.67,95%CI:1.20-2.30), increasing age (OR=2.23 for age&gt;54, 95%CI:1.70- 2.90), male gender (OR=1.47,95%CI:1.10-1.96), respiratory diseases other than asthma, and frequency of admission (OR=1.60,95%CI:1.20-2.15). All patients who underwent readmission experienced a shorter duration of hospitalization during their subsequent admission (OR=0.94,95%CI:0.91,0.96) and had a higher mortality rate (30% within 14 days, 26.6% between 14-90 days). Patients readmitted at intervals of 14-90 days and greater than 90 days exhibited lower disease severity compared to those readmitted within the 0-14 day period.                                                           Conclusion:                     Examining readmissions, the severity of COVID-19, and the length of hospital stay in affected patients are important factors for planning and allocating resources for COVID-19 management and treatment. These factors can help policymakers develop effective clinical guidelines for hospitalization or outpatient treatment of COVID-19 patients and contribute to reducing the burden of disease in the community."

Kinovea, as an accessible motion-analysis software, provides both visual and quantitative feedback. However, its application in supporting technique development among beginner athletes remains insufficiently explored. Aim: This study aims to describe the use of Kinovea in biomechanics training and examine its contribution to the awareness of kinematic characteristics and movement techniques among beginner athletes. Methods: A descriptive qualitative design involved 72 beginner athletes aged 18–25 years selected through purposive sampling. Data were collected over 16 weeks through interviews, field observations, and motion video recordings analyzed using Kinovea. Kinematic data focused on joint angles, stride behavior, and movement phases during walking, running, and the flight phase. Qualitative data were analyzed using content analysis with NVivo 12, while kinematic results were interpreted descriptively to identify performance patterns and areas for technical refinement. Result: Kinematic analysis showed coordinated joint-angle patterns across all phases. Walking analysis identified arm swing angles of 50.9°–58.8° and leg separation angles of 64.3°–67.2°, indicating a stable gait rhythm. The running analysis revealed knee angles of 68.8°–69.8° and elbow angles of 87.6°–89.1°, indicating efficient propulsive mechanics. The flight phase demonstrated knee angles of 81.2°–87.8° and elbow angles of 80.4°–88.3°, suggesting effective momentum use and postural stability. These measurements supported stride-efficiency assessment and technique evaluation. Qualitative findings revealed that Kinovea enabled athletes to interpret movement phases and identify technical inefficiencies through slow-motion and frame-by-frame visualization. Conclusion: Kinovea supports basic motion analysis by providing clear kinematic information and helping beginner athletes observe and refine their movement techniques. The findings also offer practical value for coaches by enabling more precise identification of inefficient patterns and guiding targeted corrections during early-stage training."

OpenAlex,aortic stenosis,[Analysis of optimizing indications for fetal pulmonary valvuloplasty based on a multi-parameter scoring system].,Y Wang; Y Sun; G Luo; S L Pan,,2026-02-02,PubMed,"<b>Objective:</b> To establish a multi-parametric scoring system for predicting postnatal circulatory outcomes in fetuses with critical pulmonary stenosis (CPS) and pulmonary atresia (PA) with intact ventricular septum (IVS), in order to optimize the indications for fetal pulmonary valvuloplasty (FPV). <b>Methods:</b> This was a retrospective cohort study. A total of 96 fetuses diagnosed with CPS-IVS or PA-IVS at Women and Children's Hospital, Qingdao University between July 2018 and June 2021 were included. Fetuses who did not undergo FPV constituted the modeling cohort, while those who underwent FPV constituted the validation cohort. Fetuses were classified into biventricular and non-biventricular circulation groups based on postnatal circulatory outcomes. Prenatal fetal echocardiographic parameters were compared between groups using independent-samples <i>t</i> test, Mann-Whitney <i>U</i> test, <i>χ</i><sup>2</sup> test or Fisher exact test. Based on inter-group differences, parameters associated with postnatal circulatory outcomes were screened in the modeling cohort. For continuous variables, optimal cut-off values were determined using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve and the Youden index and then dichotomized. Right ventricular endocardial fibroelastosis (EFE) was graded as 0, 1 or 2 according to severity. <i>OR</i> of each parameter were calculated, and a multiparametric scoring system was constructed. ROC curve was used to evaluate its predictive performance. Post-FPV outcome improvement was assessed in the validation cohort. <b>Results:</b> Among the 96 fetuses, 78 were assigned to the modeling cohort and 18 to the validation cohort. Postnatally, biventricular circulation was achieved in 56 cases (72%) in the modeling cohort and 13 cases in the validation cohort. In the modeling cohort, the right ventricular long-axis/left ventricular long-axis (RV/LV), tricuspid annulus diameter/mitral annulus diameter (TV/MV) and pulmonary valve annulus/aortic valve annulus (PV/AV) in the non-biventricular group were lower than that in the biventricular group (all <i>P</i><0.05). The optimal cut-off values for predicting postnatal circulatory outcomes were 0.65, 0.82 and 0.78, respectively. There was statistically significant difference in the distribution of circulatory outcomes between fetuses with grade 2 EFE and those with no or grade 1 EFE (<i>χ</i><sup>2</sup>=21.28, <i>P</i><0.001). Therefore, right ventricular EFE was dichotomized in the model as ""none or grade 1"" versus ""grade 2"". Each parameter was assigned a corresponding weight based on its <i>OR</i> value, and an integer score was obtained to construct the scoring system: grade 2 right ventricular EFE was assigned 5 points, RV/LV≤0.65 was assigned 2 points, TV/MV≤0.82 was assigned 2 points, and PV/AV≤0.78 was assigned 1 point, with a maximum total score of 10 points. At cut-off scores of 3, 4, and 5 points, the areas under the curve were 0.88, 0.91, and 0.88, respectively, with the highest specificity (0.95, 95% <i>CI</i> 0.84-0.99) observed at a score threshold of 5 points. In the validation cohort, 15 fetuses had scores ≥5 points, among whom 10 fetuses achieved biventricular circulation after birth, whereas in the modeling cohort, only 1 of 18 fetuses achieved biventricular circulation after birth. <b>Conclusions:</b> A multiparametric scoring system based on prenatal fetal echocardiographic parameters can effectively predict non-biventricular postnatal outcomes in fetuses with CPS-IVS and PA-IVS. By identifying high-risk patients, the indications for FPV can be optimized."
OpenAlex,aortic stenosis,Early outcomes of transcatheter aortic valve implantation using the hydra thv self-expanding valve in challenging anatomical scenarios: a three-case series,Thao Nguyen Phan; The Huy Nguyen; Duc Ngoc Ly; Cong Tien Nguyen,10.47972/vjcts.v54i.1642,2026-01-29,Tạp chí Phẫu thuật và Tim mạch và Lồng ngực Việt Nam,"Objective: To evaluate the feasibility, safety, and early outcomes of transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) using the Hydra THV self-expanding valve in challenging anatomical scenarios. Methods: This descriptive case series included three patients who underwent TAVI at the Cardiovascular Center, E Hospital. The cohort comprised one valve-in-valve procedure for a degenerated surgical bioprosthesis and two cases of native severe calcific aortic stenosis. All patients underwent comprehensive pre-procedural assessment, including clinical evaluation, electrocardiography, transthoracic echocardiography, and multidetector computed tomography according to a standard TAVI protocol. Hydra THV sizing was based on annular perimeter and the perimeter-derived diameter. Early outcomes were assessed using contemporary standardized TAVI endpoint definitions. Results: All three TAVI procedures were successfully performed via the transfemoral approach. There were no cases of in-hospital mortality, major vascular complications, stroke, or acute coronary obstruction. Following the intervention, transaortic valve gradients were markedly reduced, valve hemodynamics were favorable, and paravalvular regurgitation was no more than mild. The valve-in-valve case involving a small annulus was managed successfully without coronary-related complications. All patients experienced early clinical improvement. Conclusions: In this small case series, TAVI using the Hydra THV self-expanding valve demonstrated favorable early feasibility and safety, even in complex anatomical settings such as valve-in-valve procedures and patients with peripheral arterial disease. Larger studies with extended follow-up are needed to further evaluate long-term valve performance and durability."

Methods: A prospective, cross-sectional study conducted in patients with severe aortic valve stenosis undergoing surgery, with longitudinal follow-up at 1 month and 3 months postoperatively. The study was carried out at the Cardiovascular Center, E Hospital, from October 2024 to November 2025. Results: A total of 30 patients were included, with a mean age of 64.5 ± 6.0 years, and 56.7% were male. Preoperatively, the mean left ventricular ejection fraction (EF) was 55%, the mean GLS was −15.7 ± 4.8, and the mean transaortic pressure gradient was 54.7 ± 16.5 mmHg. Postoperatively, global longitudinal strain showed a trend toward improvement over the follow-up period at 1 week and 3 months, respectively. Postoperative GLS demonstrated a strong correlation with preoperative EF and left ventricular end-diastolic diameter. Conclusions: Left ventricular global longitudinal strain assessed by 2D speckle-tracking echocardiography is a useful parameter for evaluating left ventricular function in patients with severe aortic valve stenosis before and after surgical valve replacement and shows a strong correlation with conventional echocardiographic parameters."
OpenAlex,aortic stenosis,High Risk Repeated Cardiac Surgery for Recurrent Subaortic Stenosis With a Favorable Outcome: A Case Report,Feras Zoreka; Abeer H Alkudsi; Abdulsater Allababidi; Lubana Shadoud,10.1097/cd9.0000000000000185,2026-01-29,Cardiology Discovery,"Abstract Subaortic stenosis is a form of left ventricular outflow tract obstruction, accounting for approximately 14% of cases. It occurs as an acquired lesion after repair of congenital heart disease and rarely following mitral valve repair or replacement. A 40-year-old female presented with dyspnea on minimal exertion, palpitations, and chronic hemolytic anemia. Her medical history included cardiac surgery at the age of 10 for closure of an atrial septal defect and mitral valve repair. Then, at the age of 28, she underwent another cardiac surgery to resect a subaortic stenosis, which recurred within one year. This recurrence led to a redo surgery involving mitral valve replacement with a 25-mm St. Jude prosthesis. Subsequent investigations demonstrated membranous subaortic stenosis with severe aortic valve insufficiency and partial de-insertion of the mitral valve with a small atrial septal defect. Management aimed to eliminate all systemic and structural factors contributing to increased flow in the left ventricular outflow tract, which are known to play an important role in the recurrence of subaortic stenosis. For this purpose, the patient underwent the fourth cardiac surgery involving aortic valve replacement, membrane resection, repair of the leak around the mitral valve, and atrial septal defect closure. She recovered within 2 months after surgery and resumed her job. During a 6-year follow-up period, she remained in good health with no evidence of cardiac dysfunction. Despite the considerable risks associated with repeated surgical interventions for recurrent subaortic stenosis, favorable long-term outcomes may outweigh these risks."
OpenAlex,aortic stenosis,Abstract WP125: Lipoprotein(a) and Echocardiographic Findings in Ischemic Stroke: Aortic Plaque as a Potential Signal,Solomon Oak; Gauri Patil; Connor Davy; Laura Stein; Steven Rudolph,10.1161/str.57.suppl_1.wp125,2026-01-29,Stroke,"Background: Lipoprotein(a) [Lp(a)] is a genetically determined, pro-atherogenic lipoprotein associated with ischemic stroke risk. While both Lp(a) and aortic arch plaque are established stroke risk factors, no studies have directly examined the relationship between Lp(a) levels and aortic arch plaque presence or characteristics in ischemic stroke patients. Aortic arch plaque is an established embolic source, but its relationship with Lp(a) levels in stroke patients has not been examined. Methods: We analyzed 188 consecutive ischemic stroke patients (2024–2025) from the Mount Sinai Health System Get With The Guidelines–Stroke registry with documented Lp(a) levels and echocardiographic evaluations. We abstracted patient demographics, including sex, age, race, and past medical history. Echocardiogram findings included ejection fraction (EF), aortic plaque, aortic stenosis, and left atrial enlargement. We additionally abstracted stroke subtype, as defined by TOAST classification. Based on previously established methods in Lp(a) research, patients were stratified by cohort-based Lp(a) tertiles (≤65, &gt;65–165, &gt;165 nmol/L). We compared echocardiographic findings and TOAST stroke subtypes across Lp(a) groups. Kruskal-Wallis and chi-square/Fisher’s tests were used for group comparisons. Results: Median age was 68.5 years (IQR 61–78), 45.7% were female, and median Lp(a) was 100 nmol/L (IQR 56–188). Race distribution significantly differed across Lp(a) tertiles ( p =0.008). Black patients comprised 39.7% of the lowest tertile, 70.5% of the middle tertile, and 66.1% of the highest tertile, despite representing 58.0% of the overall cohort. Eighteen (9.6%) patients had aortic arch plaque, which was more common in the highest Lp(a) tertile (17.5%) than in the middle (8.1%) or lowest (3.2%) ( p =0.02). Other echocardiographic findings and stroke subtype did not differ by Lp(a) tertile. Conclusions: In this cohort of ischemic stroke patients, higher Lp(a) was associated with the presence of aortic arch plaque on echocardiography. Although there was no difference in stroke subtype, aortic arch plaque may be an underrecognized source of stroke in patients with elevated Lp(a) and may provide further support for efforts to aggressively modify the atherosclerotic risk factor profile in these patients."
OpenAlex,aortic stenosis,Case Report: Newly discovered ELN gene mutation in congenital heart disease: case analysis and review,peiwen Cheng; Guozhen Wang; Jialin Qiu; Xia Xie; Y F An,10.3389/fped.2026.1671066,2026-01-29,Frontiers in Pediatrics,"Introduction Supravalvular aortic stenosis (SVAS) is a rare left ventricular outflow tract obstruction, most commonly caused by pathogenic variants in ELN. Truncating variants in exons 1–29 typically produce non-syndromic SVAS through elastin haploinsufficiency, whereas C-terminal variants are linked to autosomal dominant cutis laxa. However, clinically and mechanistically well-characterized variants in the distal part of this “stenotic zone,” such as exon 28, remain uncommon. Methods We conducted a retrospective family-based case report with standardized clinical evaluation, serial echocardiography, and trio whole-exome sequencing with Sanger confirmation and conservation analysis. Results A female infant presented at 1 month with severe sinotubular junction narrowing (Z-score −4.8, peak gradient 24 mmHg), severe peripheral pulmonary artery stenosis, a small atrial septal defect, and moderate mitral regurgitation. Her father had severe SVAS with mild PPAS and prior aortic root enlargement, without syndromic features. Trio sequencing identified a novel heterozygous ELN exon 28 frameshift variant, c.1879_1883dup (p.Ala629LeufsTer15), inherited from the father. Ala629 is fully conserved, and the duplication introduces a premature stop codon, consistent with nonsense-mediated decay and elastin haploinsufficiency. At 9 months, SVAS progressed (peak gradient 35 mmHg), while PPAS gradients regressed by &amp;gt;40%. Conclusion This novel exon 28 ELN frameshift expands the non-syndromic SVAS spectrum and illustrates a characteristic pattern of progressive aortic stenosis with improving PPAS, supporting ELN testing and targeted longitudinal surveillance in similar patients and families."
OpenAlex,aortic stenosis,Successful valve-in-valve transcatheter aortic valve implantation using a hydra transcatheter aortic valve in a patient with severe degeneration of a surgical bioprosthesis: a case report,Thao Nguyen Phan; The Huy Nguyen; Le Anh Do; Cong Tien Nguyen,10.47972/vjcts.v54i.1634,2026-01-29,Tạp chí Phẫu thuật và Tim mạch và Lồng ngực Việt Nam,"Bioprosthetic aortic valve degeneration is increasingly encountered and poses significant management challenges, particularly in elderly patients at high surgical risk [1]. Valve-in-valve transcatheter aortic valve implantation (ViV-TAVI) has emerged as an effective alternative to redo surgery in this complex population [1–3]. At the Cardiovascular centre, E Hospital, we report a case of 71-year-old man presenting with severe stenosis of a 21mm surgical bioprosthesis implanted 11 years earlier. Given the prohibitive risk of redo surgery [3], the Heart Team performed ViV-TAVI using a Hydra THV 22mm self-expanding transcatheter heart valve. The procedure was uneventful. At 15 days follow-up, transthoracic echocardiography demonstrated excellent hemodynamics performance with a peak transvalvular gradient of 9 mmHg and a mean gradient of 4 mmHg and the patient had returned to New York Heart Association (NYHA) functional class I. This case highlights the feasibility and favorable early outcomes of Hydra THV in ViV-TAVI for small surgical bioprostheses, a subgroup frequently associated with high residual gradients and patient–prosthesis mismatch [5–7]. This report aims to describe a Valve-in-Valve TAVI procedure in a small bioprosthetic valve, emphasize the role of multimodality imaging, evaluate post-procedural hemodynamic outcomes, and discuss potential complications and preventive strategies, with particular focus on coronary obstruction and patient–prosthesis mismatch."
OpenAlex,aortic stenosis,Abstract DP311: One-Stop Head-Neck-Aortic Vessel Wall MRI: A New Imaging Approach for Assessing Supracardiac Atherosclerosis in Stroke,Qianmei Jiang; Jing Jing; Zhe Zhang; Yongjun Wang,10.1161/str.57.suppl_1.dp311,2026-01-29,Stroke,"Background: Supracardiac atherosclerosis—including carotid, vertebrobasilar, intracranial, and aortic arch arteries—is a major cause of stroke. While vessel wall MRI (vwMRI) can assess plaques, current techniques lack full head-neck-aortic coverage and efficiency. Purpose: To develop and validate a rapid, comprehensive head-neck-aortic vwMRI approach for assessing supracardiac atherosclerosis, comparing it with supra-aortic CTA and evaluating its value in identifying causes of embolic stroke of undetermined source (ESUS). Materials and Methods: A new non-contrast 3D head-neck-aortic vwMRI approach was developed for assessing supracardiac vasculature in ischemic stroke patients. It integrates a multi-coil hardware system with 3D black- and gray-blood vwMRI, accelerated by a novel neural network-based technique, achieving about 15-minute total scan time(Figure 1). Plaque vulnerabilities, stenosis, and stroke etiologies were compared between vwMRI and supra-aortic CTA. Results: From October 2024 to March 2025, 108 patients (mean age, 56 ± 14 years; 89 male) with ischemic stroke or transient ischemic attack underwent both vwMRI and supra-aortic CTA. vwMRI detected 301 plaques in 88 patients, versus 246 plaques in 75 patients by CTA (κ=0.583, p&lt;0.001). For plaque vulnerabilities, black- and gray-blood vwMRI achieved 91% accuracy for calcification using CTA as reference (Figure 2). vwMRI identified intraplaque hemorrhage and ulceration in 27.8% and 25.9% of cases, respectively, while CTA identified ulceration in 23.1% and had limited sensitivity for hemorrhage. For ≥50% vascular stenosis, CTA found 49 patients (25 occlusions), and vwMRI found 47 (24 occlusions), with identified causes including atherosclerosis (n=41), thrombus (n=3), and dissection (n=3). For stroke etiologies, of the 38 initially classified as ESUS by conventional evaluation including CTA, vwMRI reclassified 16 (14 with culprit plaques, 2 dissections), reducing the ESUS proportion from 35.2% (38/108) to 20.4% (22/108) (Figure 3). Conclusion: This one-stop, 15-minute head-neck-aortic vwMRI approach offers comprehensive and detailed evaluation of supracardiac atherosclerosis, improving stroke etiological classification—especially in ESUS patients—compared to CTA."

Whelton,10.1161/circimaging.125.018916,2026-01-28,Circulation Cardiovascular Imaging,"BACKGROUND: Racial and ethnic differences have been reported for aortic valve calcium (AVC) and long-term aortic stenosis (AS). Whether these differences are due to differing risk factor profiles or the burden of AVC is unknown. METHODS: Baseline AVC was quantified using the Agatston method among 6812 MESA (Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis) participants. AVC scores were not reported to participants. The primary outcome of long-term moderate or severe AS was adjudicated using standard clinical criteria. We calculated multivariable Cox proportional hazards with log-transformed AVC as a continuous variable for each race and ethnicity. RESULTS: The mean age was 62 years, and 47% of participants were women. Over a median follow-up of 16.7 years, 140 participants were diagnosed with moderate (n=56) and severe AS (n=84). The prevalence of baseline AVC &gt;0 by self-reported race and ethnicity was White (15.8%), Hispanic (13.3%), Black (12.3%), and Chinese (8.3%). The rate of long-term incident moderate-severe AS was highest for White participants (2.1/1000 person-years) and lowest for Chinese participants (0.5/1000 person-years). The association of AVC with moderate-severe AS was significant for all race and ethnicity groups: White hazard ratio, 1.82 (95% CI, 1.62–2.03); Hispanic hazard ratio, 2.18 (95% CI, 1.82–2.62); Black hazard ratio, 2.28 (95% CI, 1.78–2.93); and Chinese hazard ratio, 3.65 (95% CI, 1.05–12.71) per 1 unit higher log transformed AVC. There was no interaction by race and ethnicity ( P =0.26) when modeling Black versus non-Black participants. CONCLUSIONS: The racial and ethnic groups with a higher baseline prevalence of AVC had a higher long-term incidence of moderate-severe AS, but a similar relative association between AVC and moderate-severe AS regardless of baseline atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease risk. Our findings suggest that differences in AS by race and ethnicity may likely be explained by the burden of AVC."
OpenAlex,aortic stenosis,Sex‐based differences in outcomes between male and female patients with bicuspid aortic stenosis following transcatheter aortic valve replacement: A meta‐analysis,Muhammad Huzaifa Ahmed Khan; Muneeb Khawar; Asif Farooq; Ayesha Khalid; Syed Muhammad Ahsan; M. Hamza Naseer Awan; Muhammad Soban Nisar; Asim Elahi; Muhammad Aqib Faizan; Iqra Shahid; Abdullah Munir Ahmed; Faseeh Haider; Rejina Chhetri,10.1002/prm2.70021,2026-01-28,Precision Medical Sciences,"Abstract Bicuspid aortic valve (BAV) is a common congenital anomaly leading to early aortic stenosis. Although transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) offers a less invasive treatment for BAV stenosis, sex‐specific outcome data are scarce. This study evaluates clinical outcomes after TAVR by sex in BAV patients. A systematic literature search was performed across PubMed, ClinicalTrials.gov , and Cochrane CENTRAL to identify relevant English‐language randomized controlled trials and observational studies. Risk ratios (RRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated using fixed‐ or random‐effects models based on heterogeneity. Statistical significance was set at p &lt; .05, and heterogeneity was assessed using the I 2 statistic. Analyses were performed with Review Manager Version 5.3. Four observational studies comprising 7585 patients met inclusion criteria. Males had a higher incidence of acute kidney injury (AKI) (RR = 1.33; 95% CI: 1.13–1.57; p = .0008) and acute myocardial infarction (MI) (RR = 2.18; 95% CI: 1.54–3.07; p = .00001), but a lower risk of in‐hospital mortality (RR = 0.71; 95% CI: 0.51–0.99; p = .04), stroke (RR = 0.70; 95% CI: 0.50–0.95; p = .02), and bleeding (RR = 0.79; 95% CI: 0.63–0.98; p = .03) compared to females. No statistically significant differences were observed in one‐year mortality (RR = 1.08; 95% CI: 0.58–2.03; p = .81), 30‐day mortality (RR = 1.18; 95% CI: 0.51–2.75; p = .69), or arrhythmia (RR = 0.83; 95% CI: 0.52–1.33; p = .45). Males had increased risks of AKI and MI, while females experienced higher in‐hospital mortality, stroke, and bleeding. These findings, derived from a limited number of retrospective observational studies, are hypothesis‐generating and highlight the need for sex‐specific risk stratification and further prospective research to confirm these patterns and guide clinical practice."
OpenAlex,aortic stenosis,Heyde Syndrome: A Literature Review,Yashika Gupta; Asad Muhammad Khan; Viraj Shetty; Yeshwini Murali Krishna; Aadil Maqsood; Ateeq Ur Rehman Sheikh; Masab Ali; Betsy Samuel; Ali Gohar; Abdul Waheed; Mehreen Afzal; Rehan Naseer Ahmad; Saqib Maqsood,10.1002/hsr2.71778,2026-01-28,Health Science Reports,"ABSTRACT Background and Aims Heyde syndrome, a triad of anemia from gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding, aortic valve stenosis, and acquired von Willebrand syndrome, primarily affects individuals over 65. Management requires a multidisciplinary approach, including medical therapy, endoscopic intervention, and valve replacement. Despite advances, many aspects remain unclear. This review explores the epidemiology, pathophysiology, and management of Heyde syndrome while highlighting areas for future research. Methods A comprehensive search of PubMed and Google Scholar focused on English‐language human studies, including case reports, clinical trials, reviews, and expert guidelines. Additional literature on Von Willebrand syndrome and GI angiodysplasia was reviewed. The final search was completed on April 5, 2025. Results Aortic valve replacement improves outcomes and hematologic abnormalities. Transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) showed lower rates of life‐threatening bleeding, fewer perioperative complications, and reduced transfusions compared to surgical replacement. Guidelines recommend dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) for 3–6 months post‐TAVR, with 79%–86% of patients experiencing no recurrence of GI bleeds. Management of intestinal angiodysplasia often shows high recurrence rates due to persistent lesions and vWS‐2A. Surgical valve replacement also improves bleeding control, even with anticoagulation. Aortic valve replacement should be first‐line therapy in severe aortic stenosis with chronic GI bleeding. Conclusion Heyde syndrome remains a complex and often underrecognized condition in elderly populations. Continued research is critical to deepen understanding and improve patient outcomes, allowing for more personalized and effective care strategies."
OpenAlex,aortic stenosis,Integrating Cardiopulmonary Exercise Testing in the Assessment of Aortic Stenosis: A Comprehensive Review,Peter Luke; Helen Banks; C H Eggett,10.3390/healthcare14030329,2026-01-28,Healthcare,"Aortic stenosis is a progressive and insidious form of valve disease with a high mortality if left untreated. While cardiopulmonary exercise testing is recognised as a safe and effective strategy to aid in the management and timing of valvular intervention, it is often underused due to patient frailty and concomitant comorbidities. This study discusses the pathophysiology of aortic stenosis and current evidence supporting the use of cardiopulmonary exercise testing for the risk stratification and management of aortic stenosis."

OpenAlex,aortic stenosis,"Aortic Valve Interventions in Asymptomatic Severe Aortic Stenosis: Who, Why, and When?",Hilal Khan; Abdalazeem Ibrahem; Mohamed Farag,10.3390/jcm15031007,2026-01-27,Journal of Clinical Medicine,"Symptomatic severe aortic stenosis has an extremely high risk of death, ranging from 60 to 90% at five years if left untreated. This has informed the recommendation for urgent intervention upon diagnosis, especially when symptoms develop. Asymptomatic severe aortic stenosis has a four-year mortality between 30 and 50% if left untreated, which is similar to some metastatic cancers. Conservative management for patients with severe asymptomatic aortic stenosis was previously advocated, likely owing to the relative invasiveness of surgical aortic valve replacement. The advent of low-risk transcatheter aortic valve implantation with good medium-term durability has prioritized the need for a paradigm shift in the treatment of asymptomatic severe aortic stenosis towards a more proactive strategy of early intervention to reduce significant adverse events. This article provides a state-of-the-art overview of the contemporary management of patients with asymptomatic severe aortic stenosis."
OpenAlex,aortic stenosis,Vascular Sociology: Integrating Vascular Surgery and Medical Sociology for a Comprehensive Understanding of Vascular Health,Davide Costa; Raffaele Serra,10.3390/jvd5010005,2026-01-26,Journal of Vascular Diseases,"Vascular diseases remain a major global health burden despite remarkable technological advances in vascular surgery and endovascular therapies. Conditions such as peripheral arterial disease, abdominal aortic aneurysm, carotid stenosis, chronic venous disease, diabetic vasculopathies, and vascular chronic ulcers are not only biological entities but are deeply shaped by social structures, cultural norms, and economic inequalities. This article introduces Vascular Sociology as an interdisciplinary field that integrates vascular surgery with medical sociology to provide a more comprehensive understanding of vascular health and disease. Drawing on classical and contemporary sociological theory, including concepts such as social determinants of health, embodiment, illness narratives, and the disease–illness–sickness triad, the article argues that vascular pathology reflects cumulative social exposures across the life course. Socially patterned behaviors, work conditions, food environments, healthcare access, gender norms, and geographic inequalities profoundly influence disease onset, progression, treatment decisions, and outcomes. The paper highlights how surgical success is contingent not only on technical excellence but also on patients’ social contexts, including health literacy, trust in institutions, caregiving resources, and the capacity to adhere to long-term follow-up and rehabilitation. By outlining conceptual foundations, epidemiological evidence, and mixed-methods research strategies, the article positions Vascular Sociology as a framework capable of bridging biomedical knowledge with lived experience. This approach expands the definition of vascular outcomes to include social reintegration, identity transformation, and equity of care, ultimately aiming to improve patient-centered practice, reduce disparities, and inform more socially responsive vascular health policies."
OpenAlex,aortic stenosis,CURRENT ADVANCES IN LIPOPROTEIN(A) MANAGEMENT: CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE AND EMERGING THERAPIES,Szymon Zysiak; Rafał Bednarczyk; Natalia Bednarczyk; Agnieszka Kurek; Natalia Krajewska; Aleksandra Lejman; Aleksandra Mazurkiewicz; Hubert Sidor; Monika Wołosik; Radosław Krzysztof Binkowski,10.31435/ijitss.1(49).2026.4803,2026-01-26,International Journal of Innovative Technologies in Social Science,"Background: Lipoprotein(a) [Lp(a)] is an independent, genetically determined risk factor for atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) and aortic stenosis. Despite its clinical importance, Lp(a) remains largely unaffected by traditional lipid-lowering therapies, contributing to significant residual cardiovascular risk. Aim: This review aims to synthesize current knowledge regarding the clinical significance of elevated lipoprotein(a) levels and to explore the landscape of emerging therapeutic strategies designed to specifically address this challenging cardiovascular risk factor. Materials and Methods: An extensive synthesis of the current literature, prioritizing comprehensive review articles and meta-analyses published within the last five years, was conducted using multiple electronic databases (PubMed, Scopus, Google Scholar). Results: Epidemiological data indicate that 20–30% of the global population has elevated Lp(a) levels (&gt;30–50 mg/dL). While lifestyle and statins show negligible effects on Lp(a) concentration, novel nucleic acid-based therapies - specifically antisense oligonucleotides (pelacarsen) and small interfering RNAs (olpasiran, lepodisiran, zerlasiran) have demonstrated the ability to reduce Lp(a) levels by 70% to over 95%. Furthermore, oral small-molecule inhibitors like muvalaplin offer promising alternatives by disrupting the assembly of the Lp(a) particle. Conclusion: The emergence of targeted RNA-based and small-molecule therapies represents a paradigm shift in cardiovascular prevention. As phase 3 clinical trials progress, these interventions may provide the first definitive means of mitigating the residual risk associated with elevated Lp(a)."

Barbarash,10.15829/1560-4071-2025-6489,2026-01-26,Russian Journal of Cardiology,"Aim . To identify the main differences in patients undergoing surgical treatment of acquired mitral valve (MV) disease depending on the preoperative type of pulmonary hypertension (PH), as well as to identify factors associated with PH persistence and its type one year after surgical treatment of MV disease. Material and methods . This open-label, single-­center prospective study included 40 patients with valvular heart disease (VHD) undergoing MV surgery. These patients had verified PH according to the right heart catheterization (RHC) as follows: 15 patients with isolated post-capillary PH and 25 patients with a combined post-/precapillary PH. Intraoperatively, 26 patients with PH underwent a right lung tissue biopsy with subsequent histological examination. One year after surgery, RHC was performed to assess PH dynamics. The significance ranks of the predictors were used to assess the contribution of factors to PH dynamics after surgery. Results . Patients with VHD and combined post/precapillary PH were characte­rized by more impaired right ventricle-­pulmonary artery coupling, increased le­vels of myocardial strain markers, severe changes in pulmonary circulation hemodynamics, arteriolization of venules, and a higher frequency of pandemic arterial thrombosis (53,3%) compared to patients with isolated postcapillary PH (9%). According to RHC data one year after surgery (n=21), PH regression was observed in 28,5%, while isolated postcapillary PH persisted in 42,85%, and combined post/precapillary PH — in 28,5%. The factors, that made the most significant contribution to PH regression one year after surgery included mitral valve stenosis (100 units), atrial fibrillation (73 units), type 2 diabetes (72 units), combined intervention on the mitral valve and aortic valve (61 units), obesity class (56 units), male sex (48 units). The character of morphological lung changes did not significantly contribute to perioperative dynamics of PH. Conclusion . Patients with VHD and combined post/precapillary PH are characterized by more impaired right ventricle-­pulmonary artery coupling, elevated levels of myocardial strain markers, severe changes in pulmonary circulation hemodynamics with arteriolization of venules and a higher prevalence of pandemic arterial thrombosis. For the first time, potentially modifiable factors have been identified as making the greatest impact on the PH dynamics one year after surgery."
