Although traditionally regarded as rare, contemporary evidence indicates a greater prevalence, particularly among elderly females. While multi-vessel involvement is considered classical, symptomatic single-vessel disease is increasingly recognized in the setting of inadequate collateral circulation. Diagnostic evaluation relies on a combination of imaging modalities including duplex ultrasonography, computed tomography angiography, magnetic resonance angiography and selective use of conventional angiography or functional studies in equivocal cases. Revascularization remains the cornerstone of definitive management. A paradigm shift toward endovascular-first strategies has occurred, driven by superior peri-operative safety, minimal invasiveness and shorter hospitalization. Endovascular therapy is indicated in most anatomically accessible lesions, especially ostial or short-segment stenoses of the celiac or superior mesenteric arteries. Covered stents are preferred in these settings due to enhanced patency. However, limitations include restenosis risk, technical failure in long-segment occlusions and contra-indications in extrinsic compression syndromes such as median arcuate ligament syndrome. Open surgical revascularization remains critical in patients with associated complex aortoiliac disease, long occlusions or failed endovascular attempts. Retrograde bypass from the iliac or infra-renal aorta is favored in high-risk patients for technical ease, while antegrade bypass from the supraceliac aorta may offer greater durability. Hybrid approaches such as retrograde open mesenteric stenting (ROMS), indicated in cases where aortic clamping is not feasible and in acute-on-chronic mesenteric ischemia with bowel gangrene, offer high technical success and favorable mid-term outcomes. Early diagnosis and tailored revascularization strategies remain central to improving long-term clinical outcomes in CMI. Continued refinement of endovascular techniques and hybrid interventions holds promise for optimizing outcomes in anatomically and physiologically diverse patient populations."

However, the durability of transcatheter heart valves (THV) and the risk of leaflet thrombosis preclude the extension of TAVI in young people. This study sought to formulate a proof-of-concept solution for non-invasive, continuous monitoring of THV function using photoplethysmography (PPG) sensors and machine learning models. An in vitro mock circulatory loop was developed using a compliant aortic phantom and an implanted self-expanding Evolut FX device. Two PPG sensors were attached to the phantom surface to record flow signals during various hemodynamic scenarios generated by Latin Hypercube Sampling. Endoscopic imaging measurements of the geometric orifice area (GOA) were used to assess valve performance. PPG-derived metrics and flow variables were used to train regression and classification models that predicted healthy versus decreased leaflet motion. The regression model showed an R2 of 0.83, RMSE of 7.18 mm2, and MAE of 5.58 mm2. The classifier correctly identified reduced leaflet motion (95% accuracy, 0.89 precision, and 0.91 recall). This study demonstrates the efficacy of PPG sensors and machine learning for non-invasive THV monitoring. The approach offers a promising tool for early detection of leaflet dysfunction, thereby improving the management of TAVI patients."

This study evaluates the clinical and procedural impact of aortic angulation in contemporary TAVI procedures.
This retrospective single-center observational study included 509 consecutive patients undergoing transfemoral TAVI between January 2021 and December 2024. Primary end-point was device success according to VARC-3 criteria. Secondary end-points included technical success, early safety at 30 days, procedural time, fluoroscopy time, contrast volume, paravalvular regurgitation (PVR) and permanent pacemaker implantation (PPI). Multivariable logistic and linear regression models were used to assess the association between aortic angulation (in degrees) and clinical outcomes. ROC and spline regression analyses were used to evaluate potential threshold effects.
Device success at discharge was achieved in 89.4% (455/509) of patients, technical success in 96.3% (490/509), and early safety at 30 days in 75.6% (385/509). Aortic angulation did not significantly influence device success (aOR: 0.974, 95% CI: 0.938-1.012, p = 0.175), technical success (aOR 1.034; 95% CI 0.980-1.091; P = 0.22), or early safety (aOR: 0.994, 95% CI: 0.968-1.020, p = 0.633). Similarly, no association was observed between aortic angulation and PPI (aOR 1.016; 95% CI 0.984-1.050; P = 0.34) and PVR. However, aortic angulation significantly correlated with increased fluoroscopy times (coefficient: 0.073, SE: 0.026; P = 0.006) and greater contrast usage (coefficient: 0.406, SE: 0.194; P = 0.037).
While higher aortic angulation increased procedural imaging demand, it did not adversely affect device performance or clinical safety outcomes after TAVI. Importantly, outcomes remained consistent across prosthesis types."

SAS remains an important condition making up a significant minority of patients with progressive fixed left ventricular ouflow tract obstruction. Echocardiography remains the first-line imaging modality to diagnose SAS, evaluate severity of obstruction along with cardiac chamber and valvular function. Transesophageal echocardiography, cardiac computed tomography and cardiac magnetic resonance have adjunctive roles to help delineate SAS anatomy, functional implications and pre-operative planning. A variety of surgical techniques have been developed for SAS with significant obstruction often with symptoms, with excellent contemporary outcomes, though recurrence rates remain significant particularly in younger patients and those with complex anatomical features that may need repeat surgeries. Multi-disciplinary approach to management is necessary to improve clinical outcomes, including multi-modality imaging for diagnosis, risk stratification, treatment guidance and close surveillance, along with meticulous surgery by experienced surgeons, are necessary to improve clinical outcomes for SAS."

The most promising methods for evaluating excess fluid are bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA) and lung ultrasonography with B-line assessment (LUS). The latter is traditionally performed in 28 anatomical locations on the front side of the chest. The study aimed to investigate whether a shorter LUS procedure in 8 locations correlates with other markers of HV and arterial stiffness.
We performed a single dialysis center observational study in adult chronic HD patients. Patients had to be without active malignancy, infection, chronic atrial fibrillation, carotid stenosis, severe aortic stenosis, or peripheral artery disease. We performed predialysis blood pressure measurements, LUS on 8 predefined locations, BIA, carotid-femoral pulse wave velocity (cfPWV) assessment, and laboratory values of the N-terminal prohormone of brain natriuretic peptide.
19 patients were included, 7 male (36.8%). The median age of the patients was 71 years (IQR (60 - 74)), the median dialysis vintage was 51 months (IQR (27 - 87)). We found a statistically significant positive correlation between LUS and overhydration measured by BIA (rs = 0.697; p < 0.001), LUS and intracellular water measured by BIA (rs = 0.478; p = 0.038), and between LUS and extracellular water measured by BIA (rs = 0.462; p = 0.046). Furthermore, we also found a statistically significant negative correlation between LUS and cfPWV (rs = -0.539; p = 0.026).
LUS in 8 locations is associated with markers of HV in HD patients, correlating positively with BIA measurements. Its correlation with cfPWV should be further investigated."

Hemodynamic stability is the main concern of intraoperative anesthesiologic management. Preprocedural, multidisciplinary assessment of the patient is essential prior to TAVI and should include a full anesthesiologic evaluation. TAVI offers a number of advantages to patients and medical teams, but important accompanying complications and anesthesiologic risks remain. In this narrative review, all aspects of sedation in TAVI are presented and analyzed, including methods, patient selection, contraindications, drug administration, intraprocedural parameters, outcomes, and future developments in this field."

Moreover, microRNAs (miRNAs) are emerging as key regulators of cardiovascular pathology and potential circulating biomarkers. We performed high-throughput miRNA profiling in calcified aortic valve tissue and matched patient serum samples using an array that included 98 human miRNAs. Expression data were log10-transformed and filtered to identify biologically relevant miRNAs. Shared miRNAs between tissue and serum were further validated by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) in patients and healthy controls. Of the 49 actively expressed miRNAs, 18 were shared between valve tissue and serum. Thus, qRT-PCR validation revealed significant downregulation of miR-17-5p and miR-29a-3p in CAVD patient serum compared to controls. These results indicate that disease-associated miRNA alterations in calcified valves are mirrored in circulation. miR-17-5p and miR-29a-3p represent promising circulating biomarkers for CAVD, reflecting underlying pathological remodeling and extracellular matrix dysregulation. Our findings provide a framework for non-invasive monitoring of valve calcification and highlight miRNA-mediated pathways as potential therapeutic targets."

Cardiopulmonary exercise testing (CPET) and myocardial mechanics analysis may identify subclinical dysfunction and impaired functional capacity. To evaluate the relationship between functional capacity (by % predicted peak VO2), ventilatory efficiency (VE/VCO2 slope), and myocardial mechanics (speckle tracking echocardiography-STE), and myocardial work (MW) indices) in moderate AS with preserved EF. Methods: We prospectively enrolled 107 patients with moderate AS (AVA 1.0-1.5 cm2; mean gradient 20-40 mmHg; EF ≥ 50%). Functional capacity was classified as preserved (≥83% predicted VO2) or reduced (<83%). Ventilatory efficiency was defined as good (<30) or poor (≥30) VE/VCO2 slope. STE assessed left ventricular (LV), left atrial (LA), and right ventricular (RV) strain, as well as myocardial work indices. Results: Patients with reduced % predicted VO2 had higher LV end-systolic volume (p = 0.035), lower stroke volume index (p = 0.020), and smaller indexed aortic valve area (p = 0.025), with trends toward lower GLS and myocardial work. In contrast, patients with poor ventilatory efficiency (VE/VCO2 ≥ 30) showed significant impairments in global longitudinal strain (GLS, p = 0.002), LA reservoir strain (PALS, p = 0.019) and LA conduit strain (LA Scd, p < 0.001), RV free wall strain (RW FWS, p = 0.029), and myocardial work indices (lower GWI and GCW, higher GWW, reduced GWE; all p < 0.05). LA Scd emerged as the strongest predictor of poor ventilatory efficiency. (receiver operating characteristic (ROC) area under the curve (AUC) 0.723, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.623-0.823, p < 0.001). Conclusions: In moderate AS with preserved EF, impaired ventilatory efficiency is more strongly associated with subclinical LV, LA, and RV dysfunction than reduced % predicted VO2, highlighting the key role of RV impairment. Integrating CPET and STE improves phenotyping, identifying high-risk patients who may benefit from closer surveillance or early intervention. These findings are exploratory and hypothesis-generating; longitudinal data are needed to confirm prognostic implications."

Timely surgical or transcatheter valve replacement is paramount to reduce morbidity and mortality in AS patients provided that the obstruction is hemodynamically important and responsible for the symptoms across a variety of clinical contexts. Despite its recognized role in AS assessment severity, transvalvular gradient (TVG) reflects complex interplay among anatomical, mechanical and fluid-dynamic factors, challenging the ultimate recognition of significant aortic valve obstruction. Careful phenotyping of TVG by assessing its underlying variables may enhance diagnostic work-up, risk stratification and management of AS. Emerging imaging modalities, such as three-dimensional echocardiography, automatic flow and myocardial function assessment, and advanced fluid dynamics analysis are promising for refining multifaceted TVG phenotypes. A deeper understanding of the substrate underlying TVG may add new insight into the trajectory of valve obstruction and its interaction with left ventricular function, thereby supporting the tailoring of TVG-guided clinical strategies of the evolving scenario of AS."

Extracellular vesicles (EVs) have gained attention as stable biomarkers due to their lipid bilayer, which protects proteins, lipids, and RNAs, ensuring reliable detection even in archived samples. This review highlights the role of EVs as biomarkers and delivery tools in CAVD. EVs derived from valvular endothelial, interstitial, and immune cells carry disease-specific signatures, including osteogenic proteins (BMP-2, Annexins), inflammatory miRNAs (miR-30b, miR-122-5p), and lipid mediators. These reflect early pathogenic processes before macroscopic calcification develops. Their presence in minimally invasive samples such as blood, urine, or saliva facilitates diagnosis, while their stability supports long-term monitoring of disease progression and therapeutic response. Advances in purification and single-EV analysis increase specificity, though challenges remain in standardizing methods and distinguishing CAVD-derived EVs from those in atherosclerosis. Beyond diagnostics, engineered EVs show promise as therapeutic carriers. Delivery of anti-calcific miRNAs or combined RNA cargos has reduced calcification and inflammation in preclinical models. Overall, EVs act as molecular mirrors of CAVD, enabling early diagnosis, risk stratification, and novel therapeutic strategies. Yet, clinical translation requires technical refinement and validation of the disease-specific signatures."

We therefore sought to determine whether 4D Flow MRI-derived ascending-aortic kinetic energy (KE) and viscous energy loss (EL), can differentiate BAV subtypes and healthy controls, and are associated with LV remodeling markers.
Seventy-one participants (19 BAV without valve dysfunction, 17 with isolated aortic regurgitation (BAV-AR), 15 with isolated aortic stenosis (BAV-AS), and 20 healthy controls) underwent 3.0 T magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), including cine balanced SSFP and 4D-Flow. Post valvular KE, viscous EL, and the dimensionless EL index were computed from the 4D Flow velocity fields. Global 3D LV strain metrics were derived via cine SSFP feature-tracking technique. Between-group differences were assessed with one-way ANOVA or Kruskal-Wallis tests, and associations were evaluated using Spearman's rank correlation.
Average ascending aortic KE rose progressively from controls (3.3[2.3-4.3]) to uncomplicated BAV (6.7[5.3-9.1]), to BAV-AS (15.4[12.2-29.5]) and peaked in the BAV-AR (19.4[14.9-21.3], p < 0.001). Peak-systolic viscous EL was significantly elevated in both the stenotic (16.2 [9.1-24.4] mW) and regurgitant (11.4 [9.5-17.6] mW) groups compared to controls (4.1 [3.4-5.7] mW), but not in the uncomplicated BAV (6.4 [5.1-8.0] mW). Over the entire systole, viscous EL in the uncomplicated BAV (3.3 [2.5-4.1] mW) was also statistically increased compared to controls (1.7 [1.3-2.3] mW). KE correlated more strongly with regurgitation severity (rho = 0.50, p < 0.001), and EL with stenosis severity (rho = 0.48, p < 0.001). Aortic surgery referral was more closely associated with elevated KE (rho = 0.65, p < 0.001) and viscous EL (rho = 0.64, p < 0.001) than with aortic diameter (rho = 0.50, p < 0.001). Left ventricular Mass index and peak diastolic strain rate circumferential were correlated but more strongly with KE than viscous EL.
4D Flow MRI-derived post-valvular KE and viscous EL may serve as sensitive early biomarkers of LV dysfunction, and might outperform aortic diameter in risk stratification, and guide optimal intervention timing in BAV diseases while they need to be validated in broader populations."

The nationwide SWEDEHEART (Swedish Web-System for Enhancement and Development of Evidence-Based Care in Heart Disease Evaluated According to Recommended Therapies) registry to emulate a target trial comparing TAVR with the ACURATE neo2 vs SAPIEN or Evolut in Sweden, using the same inclusion and exclusion criteria as the investigational device exemption trial. The primary outcome was mortality, stroke, and heart failure hospitalization combined at 1 year. Adjustment by balancing weighting was used.
The ACURATE neo2 was used in 644 patients (33%) and control prostheses in 1,299 patients (67%). With the ACURATE neo2, predilatation was used in 100% and postdilatation in 45% (n = 288). Balloons undersized ≤1 mm were used in 47% (n = 304) of the predilatations and 74% (n = 214) of the postdilatations with the ACURATE neo2. Median follow-up duration was 352 days (Q1-Q3: 193.5-365 days). There was no difference between the ACURATE neo2 and control at 12 months in the primary endpoint (adjusted HR: 0.97; 95% CI: 0.75-1.23), as individual outcomes, or for myocardial infarction, percutaneous intervention, or major bleeding. Within the ACURATE neo2 group, postdilatation was not significantly associated with adverse outcomes.
There was no difference in clinical outcomes at 1 year between the ACURATE neo2 and the Evolut or SAPIEN valves. The discrepancy with the investigational device exemption trial findings may be explained by more rigorous pre- and postdilatation."

Cardiovascular interventions,"Public reporting of transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) outcomes by U.S. News & World Report (USNWR) began in August 2020. The impact of these ratings on case selection has not been studied.
The aim of this study was to evaluate the impact of USNWR hospital TAVR ratings on patient risk profile.
Medicare fee-for-service beneficiaries undergoing TAVR at rated hospitals before and after the release of the USNWR ratings were identified. The causal effect of hospital ratings on patient risk profile (Elixhauser comorbidity score) was estimated using a difference-in-difference analysis comparing lower rated hospitals (average or below average) to high-performing hospitals.
There were 138,147 TAVR patients in the prerating period and 50,650 patients in the postrating period treated at 618 hospitals. Prior to ratings release, all hospitals had similar yearly trends in TAVR patient risk profile. After ratings release, patients treated at lower rated hospitals exhibited a significantly greater decline in Elixhauser comorbidity score compared with those treated at higher rated hospitals (difference-in-difference estimator = -0.48; 95% CI: -0.66 to -0.31; P < 0.0001). Similarly, although all hospitals exhibited declines in the number of high-risk TAVR cases (Elixhauser comorbidity score > 20), lower rated hospitals exhibited a significantly greater decline (incidence rate ratio: 0.56; 95% CI: 0.51-0.62; P < 0.0001).
Since 2020, there has been a substantial decline in the number of high-risk patients receiving TAVR across the United States, driven predominantly by hospitals that received lower USNWR TAVR ratings. This is likely, in part, driven by risk aversion, however, further research is required to understand the reasons behind this decline and identify mitigation strategies."

Cardiovascular interventions,"For patients with asymptomatic, severe aortic stenosis (AS), the EARLY TAVR (Evaluation of TAVR Compared to Surveillance for Patients With Asymptomatic Severe Aortic Stenosis) trial demonstrated that early transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) was superior to clinical surveillance (CS) with respect to the primary endpoint in the intention-to-treat population.
The aim of this study was to compare postprocedural outcomes in the valve implant population.
The valve implant population comprised patients randomized to early TAVR who underwent the procedure and those randomized to CS who underwent delayed aortic valve replacement (AVR). The impact of the clinical presentation at time of delayed AVR was also assessed as progressive valve syndrome (eg, NYHA functional class II) vs acute valve syndrome (AVS; eg, NYHA functional class III or IV, syncope). The primary outcome was the composite of death, stroke, or heart failure hospitalization 2 years postprocedure.
Across 75 sites, 97.6% of early TAVR patients (444 of 455) underwent the index procedure, and 87.0% of CS patients (388 of 446) underwent delayed AVR through 5 years; 39.2% presented with AVS and 58.5% with progressive valve syndrome (median time to delayed AVR 11.1 months). Early TAVR demonstrated a benefit compared with delayed AVR for the primary composite (adjusted HR [aHR]: 0.61; 95% CI: 0.38-0.99; P = 0.045). When examined by clinical presentation, delayed AVR with AVS was significantly associated with worse outcomes compared with early TAVR (aHR: 2.12; 95% CI: 1.19-3.78; P = 0.01), driven largely by stroke (aHR: 2.92; 95% CI: 1.26-6.76; P = 0.01).
Among patients with asymptomatic, severe AS, delayed AVR with AVS is associated with higher rates of death, stroke, or heart failure hospitalization compared with early TAVR, highlighting a benefit for early TAVR before symptoms develop given the unpredictability of AS progression.

However, the lack of specific reference thresholds for hemoglobin decline limits the ability to discriminate clinically relevant events and the prognostic utility of these criteria.
To evaluate the incidence, predictors, and prognostic implications of hemoglobin declines without overt bleeding in patients undergoing transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR).
In this multicenter study, 9,759 TAVR patients were stratified according to the presence or absence of overt bleeding during hospitalization. Among patients without overt bleeding, hemoglobin decrease was classified according to baseline and nadir in-hospital values as minimal (>1 and <3 g/dL), minor (≥3 and <5 g/dL), or major (≥5 g/dL). The median follow-up duration was 28 months (Q1-Q3: 12-48 months).
Hemoglobin decreases occurred in 5,645 patients (57.8%), classified as minimal in 79.1%, minor in 18.3%, and major in 2.6%. Female sex, dual antiplatelet therapy, chronic kidney disease, and higher baseline hemoglobin determined an increased risk for significant decline (P < 0.01 for all), whereas radial secondary access acted as a protective factor (P = 0.001). A major hemoglobin decline significantly increased 30-day mortality (adjusted HR [aHR]: 3.05; 95% CI: 1.15-8.96). At 1 year, both minor (aHR: 1.42; 95% CI: 1.09-1.86) and major (aHR: 1.85; 95% CI: 1.13-3.03) declines were independently associated with up to a 2-fold increase in mortality risk.
An in-hospital hemoglobin decrease ≥3 g/dL after TAVR, even in the absence of overt bleeding, was very common and independently associated with worse outcomes. Stratifying periprocedural hemoglobin loss may support early risk identification, guide postprocedural management, and refine future endpoint definitions."

Cardiovascular interventions,"Single antiplatelet therapy (SAPT) is the standard treatment after transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR). However, valve-in-valve TAVR to treat surgical bioprosthesis dysfunction carries an increased thrombotic risk and may benefit from more intensive antithrombotic treatment.
The aim of this study was to compare the outcomes of patients treated with dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) or SAPT in the first year after valve-in-valve TAVR.
Patients treated with valve-in-valve TAVR at 10 participating centers were included and grouped according to treatment with DAPT or SAPT, while those treated with oral anticoagulant therapy were excluded. Both clinical and echocardiographic outcomes were analyzed at 1-year follow-up. A propensity score was developed, then inverse probability of treatment weighting was applied in HR estimation to account for confounders.
A total of 278 patients were included. No differences between groups were observed for major adverse cardiac and cerebrovascular events (HR: 0.499, 95% CI: 0.182-1.371; P = 0.178), major bleeding (HR: 0.776; 95% CI: 0.172-3.504; P = 0.741), and death (HR: 0.907; 95% CI: 0.272-3.022; P = 0.874). Fewer strokes were observed in patients treated with DAPT (HR: 0.093; 95% CI: 0.010-0.831; P = 0.033). Additionally, there was no significant difference in moderate or severe structural valve deterioration (1.9% vs 6.0%; P = 0.161).
DAPT after valve-in-valve TAVR may be associated with a lower 1-year incidence of stroke, whereas no significant difference was observed for other major ischemic and bleeding outcomes or for premature valve deterioration."

Uncorrected mitral valve pathology in end-stage renal disease increases perioperative risk and can compromise renal graft outcomes. Traditional staged procedures increase the cumulative surgical burden. This report describes a case of combined cardiac and renal surgery performed during a single operative session. CASE REPORT A 42-year-old man with end-stage renal disease and severe symptomatic mitral regurgitation (grade 4/4) presented for evaluation. He experienced poor tolerance to dialysis and dyspnea attributed to volume overload. Transthoracic echocardiography revealed Carpentier class II posterior leaflet prolapse with central jet regurgitation. The patient underwent simultaneous mitral valve replacement via right mini-thoracotomy with peripheral cardiopulmonary bypass, followed by open extraperitoneal living-donor kidney transplantation in the right iliac fossa. Postoperative recovery was uneventful, with normalization of renal function and satisfactory prosthetic valve performance. Although previous reports have described simultaneous cardiac and renal surgeries, this is the first documented case of simultaneous minimally invasive mitral valve replacement combined with kidney transplantation; prior cases were performed through conventional sternotomy. The use of a minimally invasive cardiac approach resulted in reduced bleeding, absence of sternal wound complications, and no requirement for blood transfusion, providing important advantages in this combined surgical context. CONCLUSIONS This case demonstrates that simultaneous mitral valve replacement and kidney transplantation is feasible in selected high-risk patients. A combined approach may reduce total anesthetic exposure, avoid delay in transplantation, and facilitate early recovery."

This review aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the roles of transthoracic (TTE) and transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) in the evaluation of mitral regurgitation (MR).
MR encompasses a spectrum of pathologies, ranging from degenerative leaflet prolapse to functional regurgitation caused by left ventricular remodeling. Accurate assessment of regurgitation is challenging and requires a multiparametric, comprehensive approach. TTE remains the primary imaging modality used to evaluate mitral valve structure, determine the severity of regurgitation, and related hemodynamic effects. TEE provides higher-resolution imaging for more detailed anatomical assessment, particularly valuable in surgical planning and transcatheter mitral procedures. The introduction of 3D echocardiography has further improved mitral valve imaging, allowing accurate preprocedural assessment and real-time guidance during structural interventions. Both TTE and TEE play essential and complementary roles in the thorough evaluation of MR. A multiparametric approach ensures accurate characterization of the regurgitation severity."

Case reports,"Systolic anterior motion (SAM) of the mitral valve is a well-known complication after mitral valve repair; however, late-onset SAM is extremely rare.
A 72-year-old woman developed progressive dyspnea 8 years after mitral valve repair. Echocardiography revealed severe mitral regurgitation due to SAM, attributed to leaflet elongation, left ventricular reverse remodeling, and a sigmoid septum. The patient underwent totally endoscopic removal of the annuloplasty ring combined with an Alfieri stitch. Postoperative echocardiography confirmed complete resolution of SAM and mitral regurgitation.
In this case, the removal of the annuloplasty ring allowed restoration of leaflet mobility, and the Alfieri stitch provided central coaptation, successfully eliminating SAM and mitral regurgitation.
Late-onset SAM can occur years after mitral valve repair owing to leaflet elongation, left ventricular reverse remodeling, and a sigmoid septum. Totally endoscopic ring removal combined with the Alfieri stitch is a feasible and effective treatment."

Using Danish nationwide registries, we identified patients undergoing first-time mitral valve intervention for MR during the period 1996-2022. Patients were categorized as frail or non-frail based on the Hospital Frailty Risk Score. We assessed 1 year mortality with the reverse Kaplan-Meier estimator, and adjusted comparisons were computed using multivariable-adjusted Cox regression analysis. A composite outcome of death or time in hospital >14 days within 1 year was examined using multivariable-adjusted logistic regression analysis. A total of 7000 patients (90.0%) were considered non-frail (median age 67.0 years, 66.3% male) and 782 (10.0%) were considered frail (median age 71.0 years, 56.3% male). One year mortality was 8.2% among non-frail patients and 13.4% among frail patients (P-value <0.0001), but no statistically significant difference was observed [hazard ratio = 1.16, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.88-1.54, reference: non-frail patients] in the adjusted analysis. Within the first year after mitral valve intervention, 42.8% of non-frail patients were never admitted, 42.1% were admitted for 1-14 days, 6.2% for 14-28 days, and 5.1% for >28 days. Among frail patients, the corresponding proportions were 26.6%, 46.3%, 9.1%, and 9.8%. In the adjusted analysis, frail patients were associated with higher odds of the composite outcome [odds ratio = 1.65 (95% CI: 1.37-2.00)].
Frail patients were associated with more time spent in hospital within the first year following surgery compared with non-frail patients, but no statistically significant difference was found in the 1 year mortality according to frailty status in adjusted analysis."

Case reports,"Mitral regurgitation due to leaflet cleft is a rare pathology typically managed surgically. In high-risk patients, transcatheter edge-to-edge repair may be a feasible alternative.
A 65-year-old man with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, coronary artery disease, and paroxysmal atrial fibrillation presented in acute respiratory failure due to coronavirus disease 2019 pneumonia and pulmonary oedema from severe mitral regurgitation caused by a posterior mitral leaflet cleft. After failed non-invasive ventilation, he required intubation and 4 days of veno-venous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (VV-ECMO). Following clinical stabilization and ECMO decannulation, the Heart Team opted for transcatheter edge-to-edge repair using the PASCAL system. Intraprocedural 3D transoesophageal echocardiography localized a pronounced posterior mitral leaflet cleft. Initial leaflet-grasping attempts between A2/P2 and A2/P3 produced mean transmitral gradients of 7-8 mmHg with inadequate mitral regurgitation reduction. A single PASCAL ACE device was then implanted orthogonally across the cleft with sequential independent grasping of P2 and P3, successfully reducing mitral regurgitation from Grade IV to mild with a resulting mean gradient of 3 mmHg. At the 90-day follow-up, New York Heart Association class had improved from IV to II, with no hospital readmission and no echocardiographic recurrence of significant mitral regurgitation.
This case demonstrates the feasibility of PASCAL implantation in complex leaflet cleft anatomy, offering a bridge-to-surgery or definitive therapeutic option in critically ill patients, highlighting the value of individualized procedural strategies and device-specific advantages."

Diagnosis relies on imaging, with transthoracic echocardiography as the first-line modality, while cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), computed tomography (CT), and positron emission tomography (PET) provide complementary information for staging, surgical planning, and treatment monitoring. Surgical resection remains the cornerstone of therapy. Chemotherapy, radiotherapy, and emerging targeted or immunotherapies have shown limited benefit, highlighting the need for novel treatment strategies. We describe the case of a 71-year-old woman with multiple comorbidities, including heart failure with preserved ejection fraction, who presented with dyspnea, nocturnal breathlessness, edema, and cough. She was initially treated for decompensated heart failure with good short-term improvement. Echocardiography unexpectedly revealed a 50 × 30 mm left atrial mass infiltrating the mitral valve and septa, producing severe mitral stenosis and regurgitation. Cardiac MRI confirmed a sarcomatous lesion, considered unresectable due to extensive involvement. Staging CT identified an osteolytic lesion in the D12 vertebral body. A biopsy confirmed high-grade sarcoma, and PET showed no further spread. Given the rapid progression and recurrent heart failure, systemic therapy was not initiated, and the patient was transitioned to palliative care, passing away five months after diagnosis. This case highlights the diagnostic and therapeutic challenges of primary cardiac sarcomas. Primary cardiac sarcomas should be considered in patients with unexplained heart failure or intracardiac masses. Multidisciplinary management, improved systemic strategies, and timely palliative care are essential to address the aggressive biology and limited treatment options of this disease."

Advances in cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) imaging have refined the ability to characterize these disorders with high spatial resolution and reproducibility. Among them, mitral annular disjunction (MAD) and mitral valve prolapse (MVP) have emerged as interrelated entities implicated in valvular dysfunction, arrhythmogenesis, and myocardial remodeling. This study aimed to determine the prevalence of MAD in a pediatric cohort, explore its association with MVP, and delineate related CMR findings, including myocardial fibrosis. Methods: A retrospective review was conducted in 295 pediatric patients who underwent clinically indicated CMR between September 2022 and June 2025. Echocardiographic and CMR data were systematically compared for the detection of MAD, MVP, and mitral regurgitation (MR). MAD length and mitral annular measurements were obtained from two-chamber and left ventricular outflow tract (LVOT) cine sequences. Late gadolinium enhancement (LGE) was evaluated to identify myocardial fibrosis. Results: MAD was detected more frequently by means of CMR than echocardiography (23.2% vs. 9.3%), as was MVP (34.2% vs. 22.4%), whereas MR was more often observed on echocardiography (31.2% vs. 15.2%). Inter-modality agreement was moderate for MAD, moderate-to-substantial for MVP, and fair for MR. LGE was identified only in patients with concomitant MAD and MVP, suggesting limited myocardial involvement in isolated MAD. Conclusions: CMR demonstrates superior sensitivity in detecting MAD and MVP compared with echocardiography and allows for early recognition of systolic-diastolic annular dissociation before advanced myocardial remodeling occurs. These findings underscore the clinical utility of CMR as a complementary modality for comprehensive assessment, risk stratification, and follow-up of pediatric patients with suspected mitral annular abnormalities."

The primary objective of this study was to directly compare structural valve deterioration between porcine and bovine bioprosthetic valves used in mitral valve replacement.
A systematic review was conducted following PRISMA guidelines. Studies directly comparing porcine and bovine bioprosthetic valves in MVR were identified through comprehensive searches of Embase, MEDLINE, and Web of Science databases from inception through March 5, 2025. Eligible studies were cohort studies that directly compared bovine and porcine bioprosthetic valves implanted in the mitral position and reported SVD outcomes. The primary exposure was valve type, and the primary outcomes were reports of SVD. Data extraction included patient demographics, valve characteristics, SVD definitions, and modes of SVD. The Newcastle-Ottawa Scale was used for risk-of-bias assessment. Principal analyses involved narrative synthesis.
Nine studies comprising 6,945 patients (range per study: 240-1,695) with follow-up periods ranging from 3.5 to 15 years were included. Three studies favored porcine valves, two favored bovine valves, and four showed no significant difference in terms of SVD. Porcine valves frequently demonstrated leaflet tearing resulting in acute regurgitation, while bovine valves predominantly exhibited calcification leading to stenosis. Younger patients (< 65 years) generally showed better results with porcine valves. Despite variability across studies, cumulative evidence suggested a trend toward superior long-term durability of porcine bioprostheses.
Valve selection should be tailored to patient-specific factors, including age, anticipated longevity, clinical risk profile, and religious preference. Future studies should employ standardized definitions and longitudinal follow-up to clarify these findings."

Although intravenous (IV) iron supplementation is well studied in HF with reduced ejection fraction, its impact on coexisting significant valvular disease remains poorly understood.
A 67-year-old female with a known history of coronary artery disease, diabetes, hypertension, hypothyroidism, and chronic kidney disease presented with exertional breathlessness and fatigue. Workup revealed severe anemia (hemoglobin 6.1 gm/dL), reduced left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF 45%), severe mitral regurgitation (MR), and mild tricuspid regurgitation (TR). She was managed conservatively with IV iron and two units of leukocyte-depleted packed red blood cells (LD PRBCs). Over the next few days, the patient experienced marked clinical improvement. Repeat echocardiography demonstrated normalization of LVEF, downgrading of MR severity from severe to mild, regression of TR, and complete resolution of pericardial effusion. Her hemoglobin improved to 8.0 gm/dL.
This case underscores the role of severe anemia as a modifiable factor contributing to cardiac dysfunction, including reversible valvular insufficiency and reduced systolic performance. Restoration of hemoglobin levels led to significant clinical and echocardiographic recovery, pointing to anemia as a potential therapeutic target in such cases. The use of IV iron proved beneficial in facilitating this improvement.
In older patients with multiple comorbidities and new or worsening cardiac dysfunction, severe anemia should be considered a treatable cause. Early diagnosis and targeted therapy using IV iron and transfusion can result in substantial clinical gains and may help avoid unnecessary invasive procedures."

(2) Methods: This study investigated the long-term prognostic of baseline mild aortic valve disease in patients undergoing rheumatic mitral valve surgery, based on evidence from PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library, and Web of Science databases. (3) Results: Meta analysis revealed that patients with mild aortic valve disease had a higher risk of disease progression, with a 3.3-fold risk in the 0-5-year follow-up, which jumped to a hazard ratio of 6.42 in longer-term follow-up (5-25 years). Patients with aortic stenosis had an 8.37-fold risk of progression compared with aortic regurgitation and appeared to be poorly related to the time cut-off. Similarly, higher reoperation rates at long-term follow-up were seen in aortic stenosis patients. (4) Conclusions: This study suggests that patients with mild aortic valve disease at baseline have poorer long-term aortic valve-related progression and reoperation rates, especially aortic stenosis. For those with concomitant aortic stenosis, further investigation of the impact of lesion progression is warranted."

This condition is associated with delayed diagnosis and high comorbidity burden since patients often present at a younger age with advanced disease. Echocardiography plays a central role in identifying structural abnormalities and prognostic markers. This study aimed to evaluate the clinical and echocardiographic profile of patients with HFrEF and assess outcome predictors in a tertiary care center.
A retrospective observational study was conducted at Madras Medical College from May 2024 to May 2025, including 75 patients diagnosed with HFrEF (left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) ≤40%). Clinical data on demographics, comorbidities, and New York Heart Association (NYHA) functional class were collected along with echocardiographic parameters such as left ventricular dimensions, diastolic dysfunction, valvular lesions, right ventricular function, and pulmonary artery systolic pressure (PASP). Outcomes assessed included mortality, hospital stay, and readmission.
The mean age was 58.4 ± 11.2 years, with males comprising 45 patients (60%). Hypertension (42 patients, 56%), diabetes (36 patients, 48%), and ischemic cardiomyopathy (39 patients, 52%) were predominant. Most patients presented in NYHA class III or IV (55 patients, 73%). Echocardiography revealed a mean LVEF of 31.6 ± 5.8, LV dilatation in 48 patients (64%), diastolic dysfunction in 60 patients (80%), and moderate-to-severe mitral regurgitation in 25 patients (33%). Patients with EF <25% had significantly higher mortality (five patients, 15%) and readmission (10 patients, 29%) rates. PASP >40 mmHg independently predicted readmissions, while right ventricular dysfunction and mitral regurgitation were associated with adverse outcomes on univariate analysis.
This study highlights that severe left ventricular dysfunction and elevated PASP are strong prognostic markers in HFrEF. Comprehensive echocardiographic evaluation is essential for risk stratification, and early intervention is crucial to improve outcomes in Indian patients with HFrEF."

We sought to study the effect of P2 prolapse size on neochordal anchoring location on the prolapse. To account for the P2 prolapse size in loop technique, we measured this intraoperatively (edge-to-annulus distance) and anchored the neochords incrementally farther from the leaflet edge in larger prolapses. Neochordal length was measured from the flattened prolapsed leaflet edge to the papillary muscle anchoring point.
Of 180 endoscopic repairs for degenerative mitral disease, 95 involved P2 neochords and 50 were premeasured (loop technique). We studied the relationship between P2 prolapse size and leaflet neochordal anchoring in 50 P2 prolapses through surgical footage review. Echocardiography at discharge and 3 months provided immediate and short-term follow-up.
All 50 repairs were successful without residual billowing or regurgitation above mild when anchoring neochords based on prolapse size. The P2 prolapses were grouped by size into 4 grades: grade 1 (<1.5 cm, n = 15), grade 2 (1.5 to 2 cm, n = 18), grade 3 (2 to 3 cm, n = 10), and grade 4 (>3 cm, n = 7). Each prolapse grade had consistent neochordal leaflet anchoring away from the edge: grade 1 = 3 mm, grade 2 = 5 to 8 mm, grade 3 = 1 to 1.5 cm, and grade 4 = 1.5 to 2 cm.
Our adaptation of the loop technique to include P2 prolapse size prevents residual billowing or prolapse and prevents suboptimal leaflet anchoring."

Still, patient expectations are centered around the absence of any important complications. Recently, textbook outcome (TO) has been introduced to represent such a result. The main objective of this study is to evaluate TO in mitral valve (MV) surgery and identify factors associated with (non-)TO.
All patients undergoing primary elective MV surgery (± tricuspid valve (TV) surgery, Atrial Septum Defect closure, rhythm surgery) in the Netherlands between 2013-2021 were included from the Netherlands Heart Registration. The primary end-point was MV surgery-specific TO, which was defined as absence of respiratory insufficiency, prolonged intubation, readmission to ICU, postoperative stroke, renal failure, major vascular complications, mediastinitis and reintervention for bleeding, while also being alive at one year, without a reintervention at one year.
3026 patients were included. Mean age was 64.7 ± 11.6 years. TO was achieved in 87.1% of patients (n = 2637). Factors independently associated with non-TO were: age (OR = 1.03, 95% CI 1.01-1.03 p = 0.01), reduced left ventricular ejection fraction (<50%) (OR = 1.33, 95% CI 1.02-1.72 p = 0.03), pulmonary hypertension (OR = 1.30, 95% CI 1.00-1.68 p = 0.05), recent myocardial infarction (OR = 4.71, 95% CI 1.79-12.38 p = 0.01), mitral valve replacement (OR = 1.89, 95% CI 1.48-2.41 p < 0.01), sternotomy approach (OR = 1.30, 95% CI 1.02-1.66) and rhythm surgery (OR = 1.33, 95% CI 1.03-1.71, p = 0.03).
TO is a clinically relevant measure which can serve as a benchmark to evaluate surgical performance. Future studies may focus on the validation of these results and its application to other procedures."

VT ablation was considered but not performed since cardiac CT scan revealed M-TEER associated thrombus on the ventricular surface of the posterior mitral leaflet. Despite being on amiodarone, the patient returned few days later with VT storm. After multidisciplinary assessment and patient-centric discussions, the decision was made to proceed with emergent, rescue VT ablation using cerebral embolic protection device (CEP) and mechanical support as needed. VT ablation was safe and successfully performed. Patient had no recurrence of VT during 2.5 month follow up. To our knowledge, this is the first reported case of VT ablation using CEP for LV thrombus in North America. Emergent, successful VT ablation in advanced HF patient with transcatheter mitral prosthesis associated left ventricular thrombus using cerebral protection device."

Zeiher,10.1161/jaha.125.044406,2025-11-26,Journal of the American Heart Association,"Clonal hematopoiesis of indeterminate potential (CHIP), defined as the presence of somatic mutations in subjects without other hematologic abnormalities has been recently associated with several cardiovascular diseases. Degenerative aortic valve stenosis (AVS), a prototypical cardiovascular age‐related disorder resulting from calcification and inflammation processes for which no medical treatment is currently available, has become the subject of scientific research in this field. In this review we describe the clinical relevance of CHIP in patients with AVS, as well as its effects on left ventricular dysfunction and heart failure, particularly about compensatory hypertrophy and diastolic dysfunction assessed by echocardiographic parameters. CHIP‐driver mutations DNMT3A and TET2 have been found in a third of all patients with severe AVS undergoing transcatheter aortic valve replacement in most studies; and several short‐term and long‐term studies have reported an increased mortality rate associated with the presence of CHIP in these patients. Additionally, we discuss potential mechanistic insights involving inflammatory pathways both from a clinical and from an experimental approach. These include primarily fluorescence‐activated cell sorting (FACS) analyses or single‐cell RNA sequencing (sc‐RNA‐seq) analyses from circulating leukocytes of patients with AVS, showing an increase in proinflammatory interleukines, and analyses on valve tissue exhibiting higher transcript levels of immunoglobulins, as well as murine models mimicking the consequences of AVS that could shed some light on potential causal link between CHIP and AVS. Lastly, we summarize prospects for novel therapeutic strategies, with efforts focusing on developing both general and more specific inflammatory therapies targeting inflammatory pathways. Future research will need to assess the incidence and progression of milder stages of aortic stenosis and evaluate potential interactions with different types of acquired mutations."

This study aimed to assess whether plasma from patients with AS induces oxidative stress and contributes to valvular endothelial cells (VECs) dysfunction. Methods Human plasma samples were obtained from patients with severe AS (AS+, n=110), patients with cardiovascular risk factors without AS (n=30), and healthy individuals (n=15). Plasma levels of proinflammatory cytokines (IL [interleukin]‐1β, IL‐6, TNF [tumor necrosis factor]‐α, and factor Xa [FXa]) were measured. Porcine aortic VECs were then incubated with plasma (10%, 24 hours). Oxidative stress levels were assessed using dihydroethidium staining, NO formation with 4‐amino‐5‐methylamino‐2′,7′‐difluororescein diacetate, mRNA expression by quantitative reverse transcription‐polymerase chain reaction, and protein expression levels by Western blot analyses. Platelets and monocytes adhesion as well as thrombin generation were determined. Different pharmacological inhibitors were used to explore the underlying pathways. Results Plasma from patients with AS+ exhibited elevated levels of IL‐1β, IL‐6, TNF‐α, and FXa activity. Incubation of VECs with AS+ plasma induced a pro‐oxidant response mediated by proinflammatory cytokines, the angiotensin system‐SGLT2 (sodium‐glucose transport protein 2) pathway, and FXa. AS+ plasma also triggered VEC dysfunction, inflammation, monocytes and platelets adhesion, and thrombin generation. These detrimental effects were mitigated by empagliflozin, losartan, neutralizing antibodies targeting proinflammatory cytokines, and dabigatran and rivaroxaban. Conclusions Patients with AS displayed subclinical systemic inflammation and increased FXa activity. These processes contributed to aortic VEC dysfunction, inflammation, monocytes and platelets adhesion, and thrombin generation upon exposure to AS+ plasma."

Malaysia; Mogaraj Sellapan",10.17576/jsa.2025.1502.04,2025-11-26,Journal of Surgical Academia,"Prostatic artery embolisation (PAE) is a well-established minimally invasive procedure for the management of lower urinary tract symptoms secondary to benign prostatic hyperplasia. In patients with advanced prostate cancer, its primary role has been palliative, particularly for controlling refractory haematuria. However, emerging evidence suggests that PAE may offer additional cytoreductive benefits. We presented the case of an 85-year-old male with advanced prostate cancer and multiple comorbidities, including severe aortic stenosis and stage 4 chronic kidney disease, who developed refractory gross haematuria unresponsive to conservative management. Due to high surgical risk, bilateral PAE was performed via a single right femoral artery access. The procedure resulted in complete resolution of haematuria, allowing early catheter removal. Remarkably, his prostate-specific antigen (PSA) declined from 5.28 ng/mL to 0.45 ng/mL over seven months, in the absence of systemic therapy. The patient remained haematuria-free with improved voiding symptoms. This case highlights the effectiveness of PAE for haemostatic control in advanced prostate cancer and suggests potential cytoreductive effects, evidenced by sustained PSA normalisation. PAE may serve a dual role in symptom control and disease modulation in patients unsuitable for surgery or systemic therapy. Further studies are warranted to explore its oncologic impact."

Therefore, we aimed to analyze the prognostic impact of Geriatric Nutritional Risk Index (GNRI) and C-reactive protein (CRP) in these patients. We included 122 patients who underwent elective TAVI for aortic valve stenosis (AS) between April 2017 and May 2023. The primary outcome was all-cause mortality, and secondary outcomes were major adverse cerebral/cardiovascular events (MACCEs). Patients with a low GNRI, high CRP levels, and a combination of a low GNRI and high CRP levels exhibited significantly high all-cause mortality. The GNRI and CRP levels alone were significantly associated with late mortality in the univariate analysis; however, this trend was absent in the multivariate analysis. The combination of a low GNRI and high CRP levels was significantly associated with late mortality in the univariate and multivariate analyses. The GNRIs at 6 months showed no significant changes, and the low GNRI in patients before surgery persisted after TAVI. There was no association between low GNRI after TAVI and late mortality or MACCE. The combination of malnutrition (indicated by a low GNRI) and inflammation (indicated by high CRP levels) may be a risk factor for long-term mortality in patients undergoing TAVI for AS."

In China, general anesthesia (GA) remains the standard; however, monitored anesthesia care (MAC) offers a less-invasive alternative. In this study, we compared the outcomes between MAC and GA in transfemoral TAVI. Methods We retrospectively analyzed the data from 106 consecutive patients (54 MAC, 52 GA) who underwent TAVI at a The Second Affiliated Hospital of Harbin Medical University from January 2021 to November 2023. MAC involved administration of a combination of local anesthesia with dexmedetomidine/remifentanil sedation, whereas GA involved endotracheal intubation. We compared procedural metrics, complications, and lengths of hospital stays. Results The baseline characteristics were comparable between the groups (mean age: 70.3 ± 7.3 years, 46% with reduced ejection fraction). The MAC group showed shorter procedure times (102 ± 25 vs. 145 ± 42 min, p &amp;lt; 0.0001) and hospital stays (10.5 ± 3.7 vs. 14.1 ± 5.1 days, p &amp;lt; 0.0001), compared with the GA group. Safety outcomes were similar between the groups: 30-day mortality (5.8% vs. 7.4% in the MAC and GA groups, respectively, p = 0.734), stroke (1.9% in both groups), and major vascular complications (3.8% vs. 5.6%). The GA group had higher valve-in-valve rates (13% vs. 1.9%, p = 0.024) and postoperative hypotension (4 vs. 0 patients), compared with the MAC group. Pacemaker implantation was more frequent in the MAC group vs. the GA group (13% vs. 3.8%, p = 0.229). Conclusions The use of MAC for TAVI is comparably safe to using GA, with potential advantages in recovery speed and resource utilization. A heart team approach, including cardiac anesthesiologists, is critical for optimal patient selection."

Ivanova,10.17116/hirurgia202510294,2025-11-25,Pirogov Russian Journal of Surgery,"Objective. To study hemodynamic parameters according to the data of echocardiography, as well as to evaluate the incidence of complications in the early and late post-operative periods in patients who underwent septal myectomy during aortic valve replacement. Methods. A search for articles in the PubMed database was conducted considering the PRISMA guidelines. The clinical trial had to meet the following criteria: 1) the presence of two comparison groups: aortic valve replacement (AVR) and AVR+septal myectomy (SME); 2) hypertrophy of the left ventricular outflow tract (LVOT) should be associated with severe aortic stenosis. Keywords for searching on the PubMed digital platform (according to MeSH): «aortic stenosis», «aortic valve», «septal myectomy». Statistical analysis was performed using Review Manager (RevMan) software, 5.4.1 (The Cochrane Collaboration, 2020) version. The meta-analysis results are presented as a forest plot. The heterogeneity of the studied sample was assessed using χ2 test and I2 heterogeneity index in each case. The heterogeneity was considered to be statistically significant at p&lt;0.1 and I2&gt;50%. Results. There were no statistically significant differences between the groups in the risk of fatal outcome in both the early (p=0.85) and late (p=0.89) post-operative periods. The thickness of the LV posterior wall (95% confidence interval — CI from –0.93 to –0.03), LV end-diastolic dimension (95% CI from –3.67 to –0.29) were lower in the AVR+SME group than in patients of the comparison group. Discussion. This meta-analysis demonstrates that SME in AVR is safe procedure and promotes reverse myocardium remodeling in a greater extent than performing isolated AVR. However, the number of studies for analysis was small and the investigated publications are retrospective analysis with investigation of different endpoints. Furthermore, not every study reports important factors contributing to LV remodeling."

Emergent balloon aortic valvuloplasty (BAV) is a treatment option for salvage and recent studies have reported that early release of valve obstruction by emergent BAV could improve prognosis. This study aimed to assess the efficacy and safety of emergent BAV for severe AS with cardiogenic shock. Methods Among 8,230 patients hospitalized for heart failure, 7924 patients with heart failure unrelated to severe AS were excluded. Among the remaining 306 patients, 256 patients who developed cardiogenic shock due to other causes except severe AS were further excluded. Finally, a total of 41 patients with severe AS in cardiogenic shock were enrolled and divided into the emergent (underwent BAV within 6 h of admission, n = 9) and non-emergent (underwent BAV more than 6 h after admission, n = 16) groups, after excluding 16 patients who did not undergo BAV. The primary endpoints were the 30-day mortality rate and procedural complications. The secondary endpoints were days to withdrawal from the mechanical support device, days to initial rehabilitation, and clinical frailty scale (CFS) score at discharge. Results In the emergent group, the time from admission to BAV was 3.0 ± 1.4 h, whereas BAV was performed 4.5 days (median) after admission in the non-emergent group. The 30-day mortality rate was not significantly different between the emergent and non-emergent groups (0% vs. 25%, p = 0.260); furthermore, there was no statistically significant difference regarding the incidence of procedural complications (0% in the emergent vs. 12.5% in the non-emergent group, p = 0.520). The days to withdrawal from mechanical support device and to start rehabilitation were earlier in emergent group (2.9 ± 1.2 days vs. 7.8 ± 4.6 days; p = 0.008, 4.2 ± 1.9 days vs. 10.8 ± 6.5 days; p = 0.004). The CFS score at discharge in the emergent group was maintained compared to before admission (from 3.8 ± 1.0 to 3.9 ± 1.1; p = 0.347), whereas worsened in the non-emergent group (from 3.8 ± 0.9 to 4.6 ± 1.2; p = 0.032). Conclusions Emergent BAV for cardiogenic shock is feasible, and earlier BAV may support faster recovery and help prevent deterioration of frailty."

This study developed a standardized ovine aortic stenosis (AS) model through surgical implantation of a circular bioengineered annular stent in the aortic root, creating a reproducible pathomimetic platform for TAVI evaluation. Following hemodynamic stabilization, TAVI procedures were performed to systematically assess mid-to-long-term valve functionality and calcification progression. Methods AS model was established in 11 sheep using extracorporeal circulation assistance technology. Following hemodynamic stabilization (2–4 weeks), TAVI was performed. The modeled sheep were divided into two groups to monitor valve conditions at 3 months ( n = 6) and 6 months ( n = 5), respectively. Additionally, a non-modeled control group was established, with valve conditions assessed at 3 months ( n = 2) and 6 months ( n = 1). Preoperative ultrasound data, collected on the day of TAVI, which served as the baseline. Key hemodynamic parameters including blood flow velocity, transvalvular pressure gradient, and left ventricular ejection fraction were measured at 30, 90, and 180 days postoperatively, in accordance with Valve Academic Research Consortium-3 (VARC-3), to evaluate temporal changes in hemodynamics. The effects of the AS model on valve function were further analyzed by integrating final histopathological findings and calcification degree outcomes. Results Successful AS model establishment was achieved in all 11 sheep, with significant increases in mean transvalvular pressure gradient (Δ+17.98 ± 12.71 mmHg) and peak flow velocity observed post-modeling (Δ+ 2.23 ± 0.38 m/s). Post-TAVI evaluation demonstrated progressive hemodynamic normalization, achieving pre-modeling levels (1.72 vs. 6.91 mmHg, P = 0.058/0.80 vs. 1.51 m/s, P = 0.065) at 180-day follow-up. LVEF remained stable throughout the experimental period. Histopathological analysis indicated comparable calcification burden between 90 and 180 days (Calcium Content: P = 0.7459 and Calcification Score: P = 0.5455). Conclusions The surgically induced ovine AS model effectively replicates clinically relevant hemodynamic perturbations while maintaining excellent procedural feasibility. TAVI in this model achieves complete hemodynamic normalization without accelerating bioprosthetic valve degeneration or calcification. This standardized preclinical platform enables rigorous evaluation of TAVI device performance and durability, providing robust scientific validation for translational applications."

This study aimed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of a novel fully-recyclable self-expanding short-frame ScienCrown TAVR system for severe AS. Materials and Methods: A prospective, multicenter, single-arm study (NCT05202977) was conducted. We enrolled consecutive patients with symptomatic severe AS undergoing TAVR with the ScienCrown valve. The primary endpoint was all-cause mortality at 1 year. Results: Overall, 128 patients were enrolled (mean Society of Thoracic Surgeons score, 5.40%), of whom 63.28% had a bicuspid aortic valve (BAV). The device success rate was 99.20% (124/125), and the procedure success rate was 96.88% (124/128). The 1-year mortality rate (follow-up rate, 100%) was 5.47%, significantly lower than the performance goal of 25% (p&lt;0.0001). At the 1-year point, specific clinical outcomes included stroke, myocardial infarction, paravalvular leak ≥ moderate, and new pacemaker implantation in 3.91%, 4.69%, 2.34%, and 7.03% of patients, respectively. Hemodynamic performance (mean transaortic valve gradient, 10.51 ± 5.63 vs. 56.63 ± 20.00 mmHg; effective orifice area, 1.88 ± 0.52 vs. 0.61 ± 0.25 cm 2 ; and peak velocity, 2.16 ± 0.52 vs. 4.76 ± 0.79 m/s) and quality of life scores (82.93 ± 11.62 vs. 61.09 ± 19.02) had significantly improved. Patients with different types of BAV had outcomes similar to those of patients with tricuspid aortic valves. Conclusion: ScienCrown demonstrated favorable safety and efficacy with sustained clinical and hemodynamic benefits at 1 year for patients with severe AS."
OpenAlex,aortic stenosis,Challenges of Classifying Stage B Heart Failure in a High-Risk Population,Alice C Cowley; Abhishek Dattani; Jian L Yeo; Anna-Marie Marsh; Manjit Sian; Kelly S Parke; Joanne Wormleighton; Anvesha Singh; Christopher P. Nelson; Gaurav S Gulsin; Gerry P. McCann; Emer M Brady,10.20944/preprints202511.1846.v1,2025-11-25,Preprints.org,"Background Stage B heart failure (SBHF) increases the risk of symptomatic HF. Current guideline criteria for SBHF lack sex and ethnic thresholding and cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) imaging cut-offs. We aimed to assess the prevalence of SBHF in a large cohort of people with T2D and healthy controls, and propose a refined CMR definition for SBHF. Methods Sex and ethnic specific thresholds for imaging criteria were derived from 373 healthy controls, who underwent CMR cine imaging. The current definition for SBHF and refined criteria were applied to our prospectively recruited and intensively phenotyped cohort of asymptomatic people with T2D and no evidence of cardiovascular disease. The prevalence of SBHF by different definitions was calculated and patient characteristics, including exercise capacity, were compared between those classified as Stage A vs. B HF. Finally, the refined criteria were also applied to two historical cohorts with symptomatic cardiovascular disease: severe aortic stenosis (AS n=70) and HF with preserved Ejection Fraction (HFpEF n=136). Results A total of 423 people with T2D and a subset of 102 healthy controls who underwent echocardiography were prospectively recruited. Current guideline criteria classified 91% of those with T2D and 69% of the healthy controls as SBHF, suggesting a lack of specificity. Applying derived sex and ethnicity specific thresholds, combining echo and CMR measures, the prevalence of SBHF was reduced to 30% in those with T2D. Those with Stage B HF in the refined definition had lower exercise capacity than those with Stage A HF (percentage predicted maximal oxygen consumption 81 ± 16% vs 91 ± 20%, p&amp;lt; 0.001). Applying the refined definition to symptomatic AS and HFpEF participants classified 89% and 85% with abnormal cardiac remodelling. Conclusion Current guideline criteria for SBHF are non-specific and likely of limited value in clinical practice. Refining these criteria with sex- and ethnic-specific thresholds may improve identification of those at risk of developing symptomatic disease. Further research is required to validate these criteria."
OpenAlex,aortic stenosis,Remimazolam-Based Anesthetic Management in a Patient with Severe Aortic Stenosis and Myelodysplastic Syndrome-Related Thrombocytopenia: A Case Report,Sou Hyun Lee; Seung Bae Cho; Hyo-Jun choo; Jongone Park; Sung Hye Byun; Sou Hyun Lee; Seung Bae Cho; Hyo-Jun choo; Jongone Park; Sung Hye Byun,10.3390/jcm14238371,2025-11-25,Journal of Clinical Medicine,"Background/Objectives: Severe aortic stenosis (AS) poses major anesthetic challenges because cardiac output is highly dependent on preload and heart rate, and abrupt afterload reduction or tachycardia may precipitate ischemia and cardiovascular collapse. Coexisting myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) with severe thrombocytopenia further increases the perioperative bleeding risk, which we considered particularly important in the anesthetic planning for this patient. We report a case of laparoscopic anterior resection in a patient with severe AS and thrombocytopenia, highlighting a transfusion strategy adjusted according to the patient’s response and remimazolam-based anesthesia. To the best of our knowledge, there have been no previous reports describing remimazolam-based total intravenous anesthesia achieving stable hemodynamics without vasopressor support in a patient with severe AS and MDS–related thrombocytopenia. Method: A 78-year-old man with previously diagnosed MDS and chronic pancytopenia, whose baseline platelet counts (PLTs) ranged from 20,000 to 40,000/μL, was found to have severe AS (aortic valve area, 0.73 cm2; mean pressure gradient, 42 mmHg) during preoperative evaluation for laparoscopic anterior resection. After platelet transfusions titrated to his response, the patient’s PLT increased to 93,000/μL before surgery. Anesthesia was induced and maintained with remimazolam and remifentanil, which were chosen to prevent afterload reduction associated with propofol. Results: Hemodynamics, including arterial pressure, cardiac index, systemic vascular resistance index, and cerebral oxygen saturation, remained stable without vasopressor support. Transient systolic hypertension during surgical stimulation was controlled using remifentanil titration and esmolol. Recovery and the postoperative course were uneventful, and the patient was discharged in a stable condition. Conclusions: Remimazolam-based total intravenous anesthesia can provide hemodynamic stability without vasopressors in high-risk patients with severe AS, and a transfusion strategy adjusted step by step according to the patient’s response can be effective for optimizing PLTs while minimizing the transfusion-related risks of MDS-associated thrombocytopenia."
OpenAlex,aortic stenosis,Multimodal deep learning model for enhanced early detection of aortic stenosis integrating ECG and chest x-ray with cooperative learning,Shun Nagai; Makoto Nishimori; Masakazu Shinohara; Hidekazu Tanaka; Hiromasa Otake; Shun Nagai; Makoto Nishimori; Masakazu Shinohara; Hidekazu Tanaka; Hiromasa Otake,10.3389/fradi.2025.1698680,2025-11-25,Frontiers in Radiology,"Background Aortic stenosis (AS) is diagnosed by echocardiography, the current gold standard, but examinations are often performed only after symptoms emerge, highlighting the need for earlier detection. Recently, artificial intelligence (AI)–based screening using non-invasive and widely available modalities such as electrocardiography (ECG) and chest x-ray(CXR) has gained increasing attention for valvular heart disease. However, single-modality approaches have inherent limitations, and in clinical practice, multimodality assessment is common. In this study, we developed a multimodal AI model integrating ECG and CXR within a cooperative learning framework to evaluate its utility for earlier detection of AS. Methods We retrospectively analyzed 23,886 patient records from 7,483 patients who underwent ECG, CXR, and echocardiography. A multimodal model was developed by combining a 1D ResNet50–Transformer architecture for ECG data with an EfficientNet-based architecture for CXR. Cooperative learning was implemented using a loss function that allowed the ECG and CXR models to refine each other's predictions. We split the dataset into training, validation, and test sets, and performed 1,000 bootstrap iterations to assess model stability. AS was defined echocardiographically as peak velocity ≥2.5 m/s, mean pressure gradient ≥20 mmHg, or aortic valve area ≤1.5 cm 2 . Results Among 7,483 patients, 608 (8.1%) were diagnosed with AS. The multimodal model achieved a test AUROC of 0.812 (95% CI: 0.792–0.832), outperforming the ECG model (0.775, 95% CI: 0.753–0.796) and the CXR model (0.755, 95% CI: 0.732–0.777). Visualization techniques (Grad-CAM, Transformer attention) highlighted distinct yet complementary features in AS patients. Conclusions The multimodal AI model via cooperative learning outperformed single-modality methods in AS detection and may aid earlier diagnosis and reduce clinical burden."
OpenAlex,aortic stenosis,Patient-Informed Fluid-Structure Interaction Simulations of Bicuspid Aortic Valve in Young Adults Reveal Regionalized Differences in Mechanical Stress,Hail B. Kazik; Harkamaljot S Kandail; Joy Lincoln; John F. LaDisa,10.1007/s10439-025-03919-4,2025-11-24,Annals of Biomedical Engineering,"Bicuspid aortic valve (BAV) is a common congenital cardiovascular defect characterized by two, rather than three, cusps. Many BAV patients prematurely develop calcification and aortic stenosis by age 35, which is more severe with fusion of the right and noncoronary (RC/NC) cusps. The mechanisms underlying calcification observed within the coaptation, attachment, and fusion regions of BAV patients are unknown. While abnormal mechanical stimuli induced by the bicuspid anatomy likely plays a role, little is known about regionalized mechanical stimuli in these susceptible cusp regions of young patients prior to calcification. Strongly coupled fluid-structure interaction simulations were conducted using physiologic boundary conditions derived from data of a 23-year-old patient with RC/NC BAV and an age-matched tricuspid aortic valve control. Cusp material properties were implemented for the first time from biaxial testing of non-calcific BAV tissue. Additional simulations elucidated the independent and collective contributions of cusp fusion, material properties and boundary conditions. Results show BAV cusps experience higher time-averaged wall shear stress (TAWSS) over the coaptation region (2.92-fold increase), decreased oscillatory shear index (OSI) within the free edge (1.6-fold) and coaptation (1.4-fold) regions, and an increase in von Mises stress in the coaptation (5.72-fold), belly (6.79-fold), and attachment (5.18-fold) regions of the fused and nonfused cusps. These results reveal putative regions susceptible to calcification in BAV patients experience differences in mechanical stimuli that may contribute to the onset of calcification and provide insight for future in vitro and ex vivo studies focusing on mechanosensitive pathways involved in BAV-induced calcification."
